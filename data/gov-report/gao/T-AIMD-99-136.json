If this happens, the issuance of benefits and the  provision of medical care that veterans rely on could be delayed or  interrupted.", "As we reported last August, VBA had made progress in addressing the  recommendations in our May 1997 report and making its information  systems Y2K compliant.  It reported it had renovated 75 percent of its  mission-critical applications as of June 1998.  At the same time, VHA  reported it had assessed all and renovated the vast majority of its mission- critical information systems.", "Despite this progress, VBA was making limited progress in renovating two  key mission-critical applications--the compensation and pension online  application and the Beneficiary Identification and Record Locator Sub- System.  And, except for its Insurance Service, VBA had not developed  business continuity and contingency plans for its program services-- Compensation and Pension (the largest), Education, Loan Guaranty, and  Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling--to ensure that they would  continue to operate if Y2K failures occurred.", "VHA\u2019s Y2K program likewise had areas of concern.  For example, although  VHA\u2019s medical facilities had hospital contingency plans, as required by the  Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, they had  not yet completed Y2K business continuity and contingency plans.  To  address these areas and to reduce the likelihood of delayed or interrupted  benefits and health care services, we recommended that VA reassess its Y2K mission-critical efforts for the compensation and  pension online application and the Beneficiary Identification and  Record Locator Sub-System, as well as other information technology  initiatives, such as special projects, to ensure that the Y2K efforts have  adequate resources, including contract support, to achieve compliance  in time; establish critical deadlines for the preparation of business continuity  and contingency plans for each core business process or program  service so that mission-critical functions affecting benefits delivery can  be carried out even if software applications and commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS) products fail, including a description of resources, staff  roles, procedures, and timetables needed for implementation; and ensure rapid development of business continuity and contingency plans  for each medical facility so that mission-critical functions affecting  patient care can be carried out if software applications, COTS products,  and/or facility-related systems and equipment do not function properly,  including a description of resources, staff roles, procedures, and  timetables needed for implementation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Continues to Make Progress", "paragraphs": ["VA has been responsive to our recommendations.

The plan provides a high-level  overview of the resources, staff roles, procedures, and timetables for its  implementation.  It addresses risks, including mitigation actions to reduce  the impact of Y2K-induced business failures, and analyzes the effect on  each business line of a number of potential Y2K disasters--such as loss of  electrical power, loss of communications, loss of data processing  capabilities, and failure of internal infrastructure.

A VBA official told us that the payment  contingency plan should have been referenced in VBA\u2019s business continuity  and contingency plan and will be in future versions.  The current plan also  does not contain the designation of an information technology security  coordinator and a physical security coordinator--individuals that VBA  acknowledges are essential to the agency\u2019s Y2K efforts--with responsibility  for ensuring overall security for VBA's network and web site and backing  up data storage before, during, and following January 1, 2000.  This type of  information will be necessary if security-related failures occur.  According  to VBA, it expects to designate these individuals by August 1999.", "VHA has also made progress in developing business continuity and  contingency plans for its medical facilities.  Last month, VHA issued its  Patient-Focused Year 2000 Contingency Planning Guidebook to its medical  facilities describing actions they can take to minimize Y2K-related  disruptions to patient care.  The guidebook discusses how the facilities  should develop contingency plans for each major hospital function--such as  radiology, pharmacy, and laboratory--as well as each major support  function--such as telecommunications, facility systems, medical devices,  and automated information systems.  The guidebook also contains  examples of plans, policies, and solutions for problems that a medical  facility may face and provides Y2K templates describing the areas a facility  should address by specific hospital function.  VA provided this guidebook  to the medical facilities early last month and expects the facilities to use it  to prepare their individual business continuity and contingency plans, set  to be completed by April 30.  The guidebook stresses that these plans  should be tested and suggests that the medical facilities begin testing in  June.", "The guidebook addresses external emergency preparedness as well as  internal operations.  Specifically, it discusses three functions that medical  facilities should perform in order to ensure that potential external hazards  are considered and planned for.  These are (1) performing an assessment of  hazard vulnerabilities--that is, the types and kinds of Y2K problems that are  anticipated within the community, (2) conducting an inventory of  community resources--people, money, clinical space, supplies, and  equipment--available to address these hazards, and (3) closing the gap  between vulnerabilities and capabilities by putting into place measures that  will mitigate potential disruptions in critical services by developing new  working relationships with various government agencies, non-VA health  care organizations, and vendors of critical supplies.", "In addition to implementing our recommendations, VA continues to make  progress renovating, validating, and implementing its systems.

Experience is showing that Y2K testing is consuming between 50 and 70  percent of a Y2K project\u2019s time and resources.", "According to our Y2K guide, to be done effectively, testing should be  planned and conducted in a structured and disciplined fashion.  Our guide  describes a step-by-step framework for managing Y2K testing, which  includes the following key processes:", "Software unit testing to verify that the smallest defined module of  software (individual subprograms or procedures) continues to work as  intended.", "Software integration testing to verify that units of software, when  combined, continue to work together as intended.  Typically, integration  testing focuses on ensuring that the interfaces work correctly and that  the integrated software meets requirements.", "System acceptance testing to verify that the complete system--that is,  the full complement of application software running on the target  hardware and systems software infrastructure--satisfies specific  requirements and is acceptable to users.  This testing can be run  separately or in some combination in an operational environment  (actual or simulated) and collectively verifies that the entire system  performs as expected.", "According to VBA and VHA officials, their testing criteria were based on  their software development life cycle guidance documents.

They said this type of testing had been  completed for all of their mission-critical systems.", "As of March 31, 1999, neither VBA nor VHA had completed systems  acceptance testing--which requires that each system be tested, including  full forward-date testing, on a compliant platform--for all their mission- critical systems.  Specifically, according to VBA officials, the agency had  completed systems acceptance testing for half of its mission-critical  systems--Insurance, Loan Guaranty, and Vocational Rehabilitation and  Counseling.  According to VBA\u2019s March 1999 draft test plan, systems  acceptance testing of the Compensation and Pension and most of the  Education systems was to start in mid-April 1999.  According to a VBA  official, one of the reasons for the late systems testing was that the IBM  platform at its Hines, Illinois, data center was not made Year 2000 compliant until the compiler was upgraded in February 1999.  According  to VBA, the Compensation and Pension and most of the Education systems  will be future-date tested throughout April.", "VHA also plans to begin system acceptance testing of its mission-critical  systems this month and complete it this June.  According to VHA officials,  they could not perform this type of testing before March of this year  because VHA did not have a separate Y2K-compliant test environment to  isolate the testing from the hospital systems in use.", "In addition to testing of individual systems, end-to-end testing of multiple  systems is also critical.  End-to-end testing, as defined in our test guide,  verifies that a defined set of interrelated systems, which collectively  support an organizational core business area or function, continues to  work as intended in an operational environment, either actual or simulated.   For example, in order to successfully process a compensation benefit  payment to a veteran, VBA\u2019s Compensation and Pension System must work  correctly with its Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Sub- System, Treasury\u2019s Financial Management System, the Federal Reserve  System, and financial institution systems.", "VBA and VHA plan to conduct end-to-end testing between now and this  July.

VBA also plans to test transactions that interface with VHA systems,  such as information related to veteran eligibility.  VHA is defining end-to- end testing as verification that core mission-critical business functions,  including patient-care transactions and vendor and payroll payments,  process correctly.  Once these tests are completed, VBA and VHA plan to  conduct a \u201cbusiness process simulation\u201d during the July 4, 1999, weekend.   This simulation of day-to-day work at VA is to include users at the VBA  regional offices and VHA test laboratories, who will simulate various  transactions and process them through a set of interrelated systems  necessary to complete a core business function.

This letter  requested that they (1) review VHA\u2019s list of manufacturers that have yet to  respond and compare it with a list of manufacturers from whom their  medical facilities still require compliance information and (2) indicate the  equipment item that the facility owns for each manufacturer.  According to  VHA\u2019s Y2K project director, as of mid-March--with 135 of 147 medical  reporting sites--47 biomedical equipment items involving 35 manufacturers  were identified as still requiring compliance status information.  The  project director told us that VHA medical facilities have been instructed to  replace or eliminate equipment in their inventories for which they do not  know the compliance status by June 30.

According to VA, these cases do not present a risk to patient safety because  health care providers, such as physicians and nurses, can work around the  problem.  Of more serious concern are situations in which devices depend  on date calculations--the results of which can be incorrect.  One  manufacturer cited the example of a product used for planning delivery of  radiation treatment using a radioactive isotope as the source.  An error in  calculating the strength of the radiation source on the day of treatment  could result in a dose that is too high or too low, which could have an  adverse effect on the patient.  Other examples of equipment presenting a  risk to patient safety identified by manufacturers to FDA include  hemodialysis delivery systems; therapeutic apheresis systems; alpha- fetoprotein kits for neural tube defects; various types of medical imaging  equipment; and systems that store, track, and recall images in  chronological order.", "To track the compliance status of its biomedical equipment, VHA uses a  monthly status report on medical devices based on information provided  by the VISNs.

Of the remaining devices, 86,452 were identified as conditional-compliant  or were not assessed for Y2K compliance because the manufacturers  certified that the equipment contained no software or embedded chips, and  19,073 were reported as being noncompliant.  Of the noncompliant devices  identified, 15,621 are to be repaired, 1,582 are to be replaced, 757 are to be  used as is, 255 are to be retired, and 858 are still awaiting a decision on the  remedy.  According to VHA\u2019s Chief Biomedical Engineer, most of the  noncompliant devices identified incorrectly displayed date/time.", "As we reported last September, FDA was also trying to determine the Y2K  compliance status of biomedical equipment.  Its goal is to provide a  comprehensive, centralized source of information on the Y2K compliance  status of biomedical equipment used in the United States and make this  information publicly available on a web site.  At the time, however, FDA  had a disappointing response rate from manufacturers to its letter  requesting compliance information.   And, while FDA made this  information available to the public, it was not detailed enough to be useful.   Specifically, FDA\u2019s list of compliant equipment lacked information on  particular make and model.", "To provide more detailed information on the compliance status of  biomedical equipment, as well as to integrate more detailed compliance  information gathered by VHA, we recommended that VA and the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) jointly develop a single  data clearinghouse that provides such information to all users.  We said  development of the clearinghouse should involve representatives from the  health care industry, such as the Department of Defense and the Health  Industry Manufacturers Association.  We recommended that the  clearinghouse contain such information as (1) the compliance status of all  biomedical equipment by make and model and (2) the identity of  manufacturers that are no longer in business.  We also recommended that  VHA and FDA determine what actions should be taken regarding  biomedical equipment manufacturers that have not provided compliance  information.", "In response to our recommendation, FDA--in conjunction with VHA--has  established the Federal Year 2000 Biomedical Equipment Clearinghouse.   With the assistance of VHA, the Department of Defense, and the Health  Industry Manufacturers Association, FDA has made progress in obtaining  compliance-status information from manufacturers.  For example,  according to FDA, as of April 5, 1999, 4,251 biomedical equipment  manufacturers had submitted data to the clearinghouse.  As shown in  figure 1, about 54 percent of the manufacturers reported having products  that do not employ a date, while about 16 percent reported having date- related problems such as incorrect display of date/time.  FDA is still  awaiting responses from 399 manufacturers.", "FDA has also expanded the information in the clearinghouse.  For example,  users can now find information on manufacturers that have merged with or  have been bought out by other firms.

Accordingly, we recommended that VA and HHS  take prudent steps to jointly review manufacturers\u2019 compliance test results  for critical care/life support biomedical equipment.  We were especially  concerned that VA and FDA review test results for equipment previously  determined to be noncompliant but now deemed by manufacturers to be  compliant, or equipment for which concerns about compliance remain.

Officials at three hospitals told us that their biomedical engineers  established their own test programs for biomedical equipment, and in many  cases contacted the manufacturers for their test protocols.  Several of  these engineers informed us that their testing identified some  noncompliant equipment that the manufacturers had certified as  compliant.  According to these engineers, to date, the equipment found to  be noncompliant all had display problems and was not critical care/life  support equipment.

They further believe that  manufacturers are the ones with full access to all design and operating  parameters contained in the internal software or embedded chips in the  equipment.  VHA believes that such testing can potentially cause  irreparable damage to expensive health care equipment, causing it to lock  up or otherwise cease functioning.  Further, a number of manufacturers  also have recommended that users not conduct verification and validation  testing.", "We continue to believe that rather than relying solely on manufacturers'  certifications, organizations such as VHA or FDA can provide users of  medical devices with a greater level of confidence that the devices are Y2K  compliant through independent reviews of manufacturers\u2019 compliance test  results.

VHA reported that in 1998, it filled  about 72 million prescriptions for 3.4 million veterans, at an estimated cost  of about $2 billion.  About half of the prescriptions were filled by the over  200 pharmacies located in VA\u2019s medical centers, clinics, and nursing homes.   These pharmacies rely on the pharmaceutical applications in the Veterans  Health Information Systems Architecture (VISTA) for (1) drug distribution  and inventory management, (2) dispensing of drugs to inpatients and  outpatients, (3) patient medication information, and (4) an electronic  connection between the pharmacies and the CMOPs.

These facilities are  supported by automated systems provided by one of two contractors-- SI/Baker, Inc. and Siemens ElectroCom.  For example, the CMOP  electronically receives a prescription for a veteran through the medical  center.  The prescription is downloaded to highly automated dispensing  equipment to be filled.  The filled prescription is then validated by a  pharmacist who compares the medication against a computerized image of  the prescribed medication.  Afterward, the prescription is packaged and an  automatically generated mailing label is applied for delivery to the veteran.   Finally, the medical center is electronically notified that the prescription  has been filled.  Because of the reliance on automation, the CMOPs\u2019 ability  to fill prescriptions could be delayed or interrupted if a Y2K failure  occurred.", "VHA has determined that the automated systems supporting its CMOPs are  not Y2K compliant. Specifically, neither of the systems provided by their  contractors are Y2K compliant.  According to the Y2K coordinator for the  SI/Baker facilities, failure to make the SI/Baker systems Y2K compliant  may delay the filling of outpatient prescriptions.  The SI/Baker systems are  used by three of VHA\u2019s CMOPs--Hines, Illinois; Charleston, South Carolina;  and Murfreesboro, Tennessee; they handle about 58 percent of all  prescriptions filled by CMOPs.  In contrast to the SI/Baker systems,  according to a contractor hired by the CMOPs that use these systems,  failure to make the Siemens ElectroCom systems Y2K compliant may result  in delays in processing management reports for prescriptions filled, but not  the actual filling of prescriptions.", "Although the CMOPs plan to replace their noncompliant systems with  compliant ones, these systems are not scheduled to be implemented until  mid- to late-1999.  As shown in table 3, the earliest estimated completion  date for implementing a compliant system is June 30, 1999, while the latest  is December 1, 1999.  This leaves little time to address any unexpected  implementation problems.", "Given the late schedule for implementing compliant systems, it is crucial  that the CMOPs develop business continuity and contingency plans to  ensure that veterans will continue to receive their medications if these  systems are not implemented in time or fail to operate properly.  As of  March 31, VA had not completed a business continuity and contingency  plan for the CMOPs.

This information is essential to VHA\u2019s  medical facilities and CMOPs because of their \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory  policy.  Accordingly, they must know whether their manufacturers\u2019  processes, which are highly automated, are at risk, as well as whether the  rest of the supply chain will function properly.", "To determine the Y2K readiness of their suppliers, on January 8, 1999, VA\u2019s  National Acquisition Center (NAC) sent a survey to 384 pharmaceutical  firms and 459 medical-surgical firms with which it does business.  The  survey contained questions on the firms\u2019 overall Y2K status and inquired  about actions taken to assess, inventory, and plan for any perceived impact  that the century turnover would have on their ability to operate at normal  levels.  In addition, the firms were asked to provide status information on  progress made to become Y2K compliant and a reliable estimated date  when compliance will be achieved for business processes such as (1) ordering and receipt of raw materials, (2) mixing and processing  product, (3) completing final product processing, (4) packaging and  labeling product, and (5) distributing finished product to distributors/ wholesalers and end customers.", "According to NAC officials, of the 455 firms that responded to the survey as  of March 31, 1999, about 55 percent completed all or part of the survey.   The remainder provided general information on their Y2K readiness status  or literature on their efforts.  As shown in table 4, more than half of the  pharmaceutical firms surveyed responded (52 percent), with just less than  one-third (32 percent) of those respondents reporting that they are  compliant.  Among the pharmaceutical firms that had not responded as of  March 31, however, were two of VA\u2019s five largest suppliers.  The three  large pharmaceutical suppliers that did respond provided general  information on their Y2K readiness status, rather than answering the  survey, and estimated that they will be compliant by June 30, 1999.", "Table 4 also shows that 54 percent of the medical-surgical firms surveyed  responded, with about two-thirds of them (166) reporting that they are Y2K  compliant.  All five of VA\u2019s largest medical-surgical suppliers have  responded.  Specifically, two reported being compliant, two reported they  would be compliant by June 30, 1999, and the remaining supplier did not  report an expected compliance date.", "On March 17, 1999, NAC sent a second letter to its pharmaceutical and  medical-surgical firms, informing them of VA\u2019s plans to make Y2K readiness  information previously provided to VA available to the public through a  web site (www.va.gov/oa&mm/nac/y2k).  VA made the survey results  available on its web site on April 13, 1999.  The letter also requested that  manufacturers that had not previously responded provide information on  their readiness.  NAC\u2019s Executive Director said that he would personally  contact any major VA supplier that does not respond.  On a broader level,  VHA has taken a leadership role in obtaining and sharing information on  the Y2K readiness of the pharmaceutical industry.  Specifically, VHA chairs  the Year 2000 Pharmaceuticals Acquisitions and Distributions  Subcommittee, which reports to the Chair of the President\u2019s Council on  Year 2000 Conversion.  The purpose of this subcommittee is to bring  together federal and pharmaceutical representatives to address issues  concerning supply and distribution as they relate to the year 2000.  The  subcommittee consists of FDA, federal health care providers, and industry  trade associations such as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers  of America (PhRMA), the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and  the National Wholesale Druggists\u2019 Association.  Several of these trade  associations have surveyed their members on their Y2K readiness and  made the results available to the public.  However, the information is not  manufacturer-specific or as detailed as VHA's survey results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Y2K Efforts for Pharmaceutical and Biological Products Industries Were Initially Focused on Awareness", "paragraphs": ["FDA\u2019s oversight and regulatory responsibility for pharmaceutical and  biological products is to ensure that they are safe and effective for public  use.  Because of its concern about the Y2K impact on manufacturers of  these products, FDA has taken several actions to raise the Y2K awareness  of the pharmaceutical and biological products industries.  In addition, it is  thinking about conducting a survey to determine the industry\u2019s Y2K  readiness.", "One of FDA\u2019s actions to raise industry awareness was the January 1998  issuance of industry guidance by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and  Research (CBER) on the Y2K impact of computer systems and software  applications used in the manufacture of blood products.  In addition, as  shown in table 5, FDA has issued several letters to pharmaceutical and  biological trade associations and sole-source drug manufacturers.", "Further, on February 11, 1999, FDA\u2019s director of emergency and  investigation operations sent a memorandum on FDA\u2019s interim inspection  policy for the Y2K problem to the directors of FDA\u2019s investigations branch.  The policy emphasizes FDA\u2019s Y2K awareness efforts for manufacturers.  It  states that FDA inspectors are to (1) inform the firm of FDA\u2019s Y2K web page  (URL http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/yr2000/year2000.html), (2) provide the firm  with copies of the appropriate FDA Y2K awareness letter, (3) explain that  Y2K problems could potentially affect aspects of the firm\u2019s operations,  including some areas not regulated by FDA, and that FDA anticipates that  firms will take prudent steps to ensure that they are not adversely affected  by Y2K, and (4) provide firms with a copy of FDA\u2019s compliance policy guide  \u201cYear 2000 (Y2K) Computer Problems.\u201d", "In addition, FDA and PhRMA jointly held a government/industry forum on  the Y2K preparedness of the pharmaceutical and biotech industries on  February 22, 1999.  The objectives of this forum were to (1) share  information on Y2K programs conducted by health care providers,  pharmaceutical companies, FDA, and other federal agencies, (2) provide a  vehicle for networking, and (3) raise awareness.", "On March 29, 1999, FDA revised its February 11, 1999, interim inspection  policy.  The revision states that field inspectors are now to inquire about  manufacturers\u2019 efforts to ensure that their computer-controlled or date- sensitive manufacturing processes and distribution systems are Y2K  compliant.  Inspectors are to include this information in their reports, along  with a determination of activities that firms have completed or started to  ensure that they will be Y2K compliant.", "Further, FDA inspectors may review documentation in cases in which firms  have made changes to their computerized production or manufacturing  control systems to address Y2K problems.  The purpose of this review is to  ensure that the changes were made in accordance with the firms\u2019  procedures and applicable regulations.  If inspectors determine that a firm  has not taken steps to ensure Y2K compliance, they are to notify their  district managers and the responsible FDA center.", "FDA\u2019s interim policy describes steps inspectors are to take in reviewing  manufacturers\u2019Y2K compliance.  However, FDA stated that the primary  focus of its inspections for the remainder of 1999 will be to ensure that  products sold in the United States are safe and effective for public use and  comply with federal statutes and regulations, including \u201cgood  manufacturing practice\u201d (GMP).  FDA officials explained that the agency  does not have sufficient resources to perform both regulatory oversight of  the manufacturers and in-depth evaluations of firms\u2019 Y2K compliance  activities.", "Nevertheless, according to the March 29, 1999, memorandum, field  inspectors are to note any concerns they may have with a firm\u2019s Y2K  readiness in the administrative remarks section of their inspection reports.   These reports are to be reviewed by FDA district managers.  If the Y2K  concern appears to present a serious problem to a firm\u2019s ability to produce  safe, effective medication, the district manager can discuss this issue with  FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs and determine a course of action.   However, FDA officials have stressed that the agency cannot take any  regulatory action toward the firm until a Y2K-related problem affects a  pharmaceutical or biological product.", "Like VHA, FDA is interested in the impact of Y2K readiness of  pharmaceutical and biological products on the availability of products for  health care facilities and individual patients.  FDA\u2019s Acting Deputy  Commissioner for Policy informed us on March 24, 1999, that the agency is  thinking about surveying pharmaceutical and biological products  manufacturers, distributors, product repackagers, and others in the drug  dispensing chain, on their Y2K readiness and contingency planning.  In  anticipation of a possible survey, the agency has published a notice in the  March 22, 1999, Federal Register regarding this matter.  The Acting Deputy  Commissioner said that potential survey questions on contingency  planning would include steps the manufacturers are taking to ensure an  adequate supply of bulk manufacturing materials from overseas suppliers.  This is a key issue because, as we reported in March 1998, according to  FDA, as much as 80 percent of the bulk pharmaceutical chemicals used by  U.S. manufacturers to produce prescription drugs is imported.", "In summary, VBA and VHA continue to make progress in preparing their  mission-critical systems for the year 2000.  However, key actions remain to  be taken in the areas of mission-critical systems testing, VHA facility  systems compliance, and CMOP systems compliance.  We also reiterate the  need for VHA and FDA to take prudent steps to ensure that the test results  of critical care/life support biomedical equipment are obtained and  reviewed.  Finally, VHA needs information on the Y2K readiness of specific  pharmaceutical and medical-surgical manufacturers.  Until this information  is obtained and publicized, VHA medical facilities and veterans will remain  in doubt as to whether an adequate supply of pharmaceutical and biological  products will be available.  FDA and the pharmaceutical and biological  trade associations can play key roles in helping VHA obtain this  information and publicize the results in a single data clearinghouse.", "In carrying out this assignment, we reviewed and analyzed VA's Y2K  documents and plans, comparing them against our guidance on Y2K  activities.  We also reviewed and analyzed FDA documentation relating to  its Y2K efforts on biomedical devices and pharmaceutical manufacturers.   In addition, we visited selected VHA medical centers, VA data centers, and  VHA consolidated mail outpatient pharmacies to discuss their Y2K  activities, and interviewed VA and FDA officials on those activities.  We  also interviewed officials of the Emergency Care Research Institute  regarding their statements on biomedical equipment testing.  Finally, we  interviewed selected private hospital officials about their Y2K actions and  pharmaceutical trade associations on their Y2K readiness surveys of  pharmaceutical manufacturers.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
