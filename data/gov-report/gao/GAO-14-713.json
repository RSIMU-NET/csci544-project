Between fiscal years 2011 and 2017, agencies reported planning a total of about $5.3 billion in cost savings and avoidances.", "However, planned savings may be higher because six agencies that reported having closed as many as 67 data centers reported limited or no savings, in part because they encountered difficulties, such as calculating baseline data center costs. In addition, 11 of the 21 agencies with planned cost savings are underreporting their fiscal years 2012 through 2015 figures to OMB by approximately $2.2 billion. While several agencies noted communication issues as the reason for this, others did not provide a reason. Until OMB assists agencies in reporting savings and agencies fully report their savings, the $5.3 billion in total savings will be understated.", "Most agencies reported successes in achieving cost savings\u2014notably, the benefits of key technologies, reduced power consumption and facility costs, and improvements in asset inventories. However, agencies also reported challenges, many of which were the same as GAO found in 2012. One of the most-reported challenges was related to obtaining power usage information as a means to determine cost savings. In light of how closely these successes and challenges relate to achieving cost savings, it is important for OMB to continue to provide leadership and guidance, including\u2014as GAO previously recommended\u2014using the Data Center Consolidation Task Force to monitor agencies' efforts.", "Pursuant to OMB guidance, in May 2014 the Data Center Consolidation Task Force completed a set of 11 metrics to measure agency progress toward optimizing their data centers, such as power usage and facility utilization. In addition, related targets to be achieved by fiscal year 2015 have been developed for nearly all the metrics. However, the metrics do not address server utilization, even though OMB reported this to be as low as 5 percent in 2009, which is significantly below OMB's target of 60 to 70 percent.

Finally, standards for internal control emphasize  the need for federal agencies to establish plans to help ensure goals and   reiterated the  objectives can be met, including compliance with applicable laws and  regulations.", "Although agencies are already collectively reporting approximately $5.3  billion in planned cost savings and avoidances from their consolidation  efforts, these savings may be higher because 6 of the 24 agencies,  claiming between 11 and 67 data center closures each, have been limited  in their abilities to report savings. For example, although Interior reported  closing 65 data centers as of May 2014, the agency cited significant  challenges in obtaining costs and related savings information from its  component agencies. In addition, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) reported that, as of May 2014, it had closed 25  data centers; however, while the agency has been able to report $1.3  million in savings through fiscal year 2013, agency officials stated that  NASA has been otherwise limited in its ability to identify cost savings and  avoidances because of the agency\u2019s complex organizational structure,  which includes multiple centers with multiple missions and multiple IT  contractors utilizing data centers within multipurpose facilities. Similar  challenges were also identified by other agencies, as discussed later in  this report. Table 5 shows the agencies with limited or no savings relative  to their consolidation efforts and their reasons for not being able to fully  report savings.", "Considering that cost savings is one of OMB\u2019s original high-level goals of  FDCCI and reporting such savings is currently required on a quarterly  basis, OMB has a responsibility for ensuring that agencies are identifying  the full extent of cost savings from their consolidation efforts. Further, as  previously mentioned, OMB\u2019s PortfolioStat guidance requires yearly  review sessions of agency portfolio management (including data center  consolidation) with the Federal CIO and senior agency officials and notes  that these reviews are critical to driving cost savings. We previously  found that all agencies held PortfolioStat sessions with OMB in fiscal  year 2012. In addition, agencies were required to hold sessions again in  2013. However, after 2 years of PortfolioStat sessions, the six agencies  identified in the table have been limited in their ability to report savings  from their data center consolidation efforts.", "In addition, slightly more than half of the agencies with cost savings and  avoidances did not fully report them to OMB\u2014a requirement of OMB\u2019s  quarterly integrated data collection process. Specifically, of the 21  agencies with actual and estimated fiscal years 2012 through 2015 cost  savings and avoidances, 10 agencies fully reported their savings and  avoidances to OMB through the integrated data collection process, 8  agencies partially reported this information, and 3 agencies did not report  it. As a result, agencies collectively reported savings for fiscal years 2012 through 2015 of approximately $3.1 billion to us, as compared to  only about $876 million that agencies reported to OMB, meaning that the  savings have been underreported to OMB by approximately $2.2 billion.  See table 6 for a listing of agencies and a comparison of their data center  consolidation savings as reported to GAO and through OMB\u2019s integrated  data collection process.", "While several agencies noted internal agency communication issues as a  reason that their savings and avoidances were not fully reported, other  agencies were not able to provide a reason. These shortcomings in  agency reporting have resulted in OMB not being able to fully report  agencies\u2019 data center consolidation cost savings and avoidances in its  quarterly reports to Congress on the status of federal IT reform efforts, in  accordance with its responsibilities as set forth in law. For example,  OMB\u2019s May 2014 report to Congress noted total fiscal years 2012 and  2013 data center consolidation cost savings and avoidances of slightly  less than $329 million, as compared to the approximately $951 million  that agencies reported to us that they achieved over that same time  period\u2014a difference of approximately $622 million.", "Until OMB assists those agencies with limited or no cost savings  reported, agencies may not be able to identify the full extent of savings  from their consolidation efforts and the total planned cost savings and  avoidances of approximately $5.3 billion will be understated. Further, until  agencies fully report their cost savings and avoidances to OMB,  Congress may be limited in its ability to oversee agencies\u2019 progress  against key initiative goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Reported Successes and Challenges in Achieving Cost Savings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Reported That Efforts to Achieve Consolidation Cost Savings Face Challenges Similar to Those Previously Reported", "paragraphs": ["In 2011 and 2012, we reported on the broad challenges that agencies  were facing during data center consolidations.

In  2014, agencies reported that many of the same challenges still exist and  impacted their ability to achieve cost savings through consolidation  efforts. In addition, agencies identified many new challenges that were  specific to achieving cost savings. As we found previously, some  challenges are more common than others, with the most-reported  challenge being faced by a total of eight agencies. One agency\u2014HUD\u2014 did not report any challenges. Table 8 details the reported challenges and  the numbers of agencies experiencing that challenge. The table is  followed by a discussion of the most prevalent challenges.", "Agencies reported that the most significant operational challenges  included difficulty in obtaining information (such as data center inventory  and cost savings data) from component organizations and determining  costs and realizing savings when data centers were located in shared,  multipurpose facilities. Specifically, 6 agencies reported that obtaining  consolidation-related data from component organizations as a challenge  to achieving cost savings which is similar to, but not as prevalent as, the  10 agencies we found having difficulty providing good quality asset  inventories in 2012. For example, Defense\u2019s Data Center Consolidation  Lead noted that getting component organizations to report all of their data  centers remains a challenge in achieving cost savings, particularly in the  case of smaller, single-server data centers (e.g., research stations or  computers that are only used by a few individuals and are often not  reported until replacement or enhancement is needed). Additionally,  Agriculture\u2019s Associate CIO for Data Center Operations stated that it was  often difficult to determine actual cost savings because the department\u2019s  32 component agencies did not track their total cost of IT, as portions are  funded from many different sources versus being under the control of the  component agency or office CIO (e.g., building rent and utilities, salaries,  construction, etc.).", "In addition, whereas we found in 2012 that one agency had difficulty with  identifying and quantifying actual costs associated with data center  facilities, we found that five agencies reported that it was difficult to  determine costs and realized savings when data centers were located in  shared, multipurpose facilities. For example, Energy reported that  because several of its data centers were located in shared-use facilities, it  was difficult for the department to determine the centers\u2019 total operating  costs without an additional investment in advanced electricity metering.  Energy also noted that it is difficult to determine the total cost savings and  avoidances associated with the closure of these data centers until they  are decommissioned and the vacated floor space is repurposed. EPA  also reported that its data centers and server rooms were housed within  mixed-use facilities, which generally cannot be discarded. Further, EPA  expects that most former data center spaces will continue to provide local  telecommunications and building access support services, which reduces  potential substantive building operational cost reductions due to room  decommissioning."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technical Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Agencies reported that the most significant technical challenges included  a lack of electricity metering to determine power usage information and  increased telecommunication costs after relocating small data centers or  applications. The lack of electricity metering is similar to the difficulty we  previously found for 15 agencies in 2012 with obtaining power usage  information. Our current work found that 8 agencies reported that a lack  of electricity metering to determine power usage was a challenge. For  example, the Department of Labor (Labor) reported that a lack of  electricity metering at many data centers prevented the department from  accurately reporting energy savings attributed to the consolidation effort.  Labor officials added that it was difficult to perform power usage efficiency  calculations because the data to feed the calculations were not available.", "As other examples, Transportation reported that its smaller data centers  were operated in GSA-owned buildings which did not have electricity  metering for the data center spaces. Transportation also noted that many  of these spaces also contain telecommunications equipment which would  remain after the data center equipment is relocated or decommissioned,  which would mean the closures are not expected to produce significant  savings. Further, NASA reported that it had encountered difficulties in  metering its older, less-efficient facilities and that the modifications  needed to make the facilities more efficient would require a significant  amount of resources and yield a low return on investment. In addition,  those modifications would adversely impact current operations due to the  requisite power outages to install metering equipment. Commerce,  Defense, Interior, NSF, and the Social Security Administration (SSA) also  reported a lack of electricity metering as a challenge.", "Regarding increased telecommunication costs, Interior and  Transportation both reported this area as a challenge. Interior noted that  the higher telecommunication premiums realized from its effort often  offset the savings from consolidating a large number of small and closet- sized data centers. Transportation officials also stated that that the  relocation of locally run applications to a consolidated data center may  lead to increased telecommunications costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Agencies reported two financial challenges related to obtaining the  funding required within their agency for consolidation efforts, as well as  budget and accounting system issues that impacted their ability to  achieve cost savings. In 2012, we found that nine agencies considered  obtaining the funding required for consolidation and migration efforts to be  a challenge. In 2014, eight agencies identified this challenge. For  example, VA reported that the investment funding for all phases of its  consolidation plan has not been available from the department as initially  scheduled and, as a result has had to evolve its plan to address the risk  of continued investment funding shortfalls so that it can continue to make  progress towards its consolidation goals. In addition, SBA officials stated  that a lack of funding allocated to implementing its data center  consolidation strategy has been the primary challenge in achieving data  center consolidation cost savings. Officials added that, in light of this  challenge, the agency continues to examine federal cloud and GSA e- mail-as-a-service offerings, and initiated a request to the SBA investment  governance process and a fiscal year 2015 request to pilot and migrate  agency e-mail to a GSA vendor-managed cloud provider.", "In addition, six agencies reported having budget and accounting systems  that were not structured to account for individual data centers. For  example, Energy officials stated that data centers have generally  operated from separate facility and IT operations budgets and specific  facility cost elements have not been tracked. In addition, officials added  that different budgets are used to support different data centers, resulting  in a lack of a consolidated budget for data centers, and has made  documenting costs and related savings difficult. In addition, VA officials  stated that IT costs often encompass multiple data centers and user  facilities, making it challenging to parse the costs to the individual data  centers and determine related savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cultural Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Agencies reported that the most significant cultural challenges included  having a decentralized organizational structure that was not geared  toward consolidation and accepting the cultural changes that were part of  consolidation. In 2012, we found that two agencies encountered cultural  challenges related to having a decentralized organization structure and  five agencies had difficulty accepting cultural change as part of the  consolidation effort. Our current work showed six agencies encountered  cultural challenges related to having a decentralized organization  structure. For example, GSA reported that its foremost challenge was that  its data center costs and expenses were distributed across a federated  organization. The agency indicated that the costs for rents; leases;  personnel; and equipment repair, replacement, and service contracts  were distributed across 11 regions, six components, and their subordinate  organizations. Further, the Department of Justice (Justice) reported that  its federated organizational structure had made it especially challenging  to implement enterprise-wide initiatives such as data center consolidation.  Officials noted that this was due, in part, to the need to build consensus  for, plan, and then implement the consolidation changes, which does not  happen quickly in a decentralized environment.", "In addition, three agencies stated that accepting the cultural changes  required to implement their consolidation efforts impacted their ability to  achieve cost savings. For example, Justice also noted that its federated  environment made it difficult for people to accept the cultural changes that  are part of consolidation. Further, officials from Agriculture reported the  challenge of accepting culture change as it encountered resistance to  consolidation-related changes, including the use of cloud computing, from  component agency personnel.", "In any significant IT initiative, it is important that both successes and  challenges be highlighted. In the case of FDCCI, a success highlights  approaches and strategies that have helped agencies to achieve cost  savings and fulfill the intent of the initiative.

Development of the cost-per-operating-system target is  expected to continue and OMB staff stated that the Task Force expects to  finalize the target in the fall of 2014.", "In addition, although low server utilization rates were a driving force cited  by OMB in launching FDCCI, the new data center optimization metrics do  not address this key issue. As previously mentioned, in 2009, OMB  reported that server utilization rates were as low as 5 percent across the  federal government\u2019s servers. OMB subsequently required agencies to  report on server utilization percentage as part of their 2011 and 2012  consolidation plans and included a suggested target of 60 to 70 percent  server utilization in its 2011 and 2012 FDCCI consolidation plan  guidance.

According to an official from the  GSA FDCCI Program Management Office that led initial efforts to  establish the metrics, server utilization was not included as a metric for a  variety of reasons, including that agencies have not traditionally collected  the necessary data to be able to calculate server utilization, agencies do  not have the server monitoring capabilities required to collect such data,  and improvements in other areas of the metrics (such as virtualization)  would likely result in higher server utilization. However, as previously  mentioned, with server utilization a driving factor for FDCCI and  measuring as low as 5 percent as recently as 2009, determining progress  against this metric is critical to improving the efficiency, performance, and  environmental footprint of federal data center activities.", "Without an established target for one of its key cost metrics, the cost per  operating system, OMB may not be getting complete information about  agencies\u2019 progress in their data center optimization efforts and, therefore,  may be lacking important insight that limits its ability to take corrective  actions as needed.

However, limited or no savings achieved  at agencies with major consolidation efforts underway suggests that  additional actions are necessary. OMB\u2019s and these agencies\u2019 continued  efforts to address challenges and identify cost savings opportunities,  through the use of such existing mechanisms as PortfolioStat sessions,  will result in even more savings. Additionally, agencies\u2019 continued  underreporting of consolidation savings will limit OMB\u2019s ability to  accurately track agencies\u2019 progress and report to Congress, a point  highlighted by the significant understatement of agency-reported  savings\u2014by approximately $622 million through fiscal year 2013\u2014in  OMB\u2019s recent congressional submission, and\u2014by over $2.2 billion  through fiscal year 2015\u2014in agency data submissions to OMB.", "As the federal consolidation effort has matured over the past few years,  agencies have reported noteworthy successes in achieving cost  savings\u2014particularly in leveraging virtualization and cloud computing as a  means to achieve such savings.

However, as agencies work toward  achieving their cost savings goals, many continue to report challenges  related to gathering the necessary technical information from which to  calculate savings and funding the consolidation itself. While these  challenges are consistent with those reported in the past, others, such as  determining savings when data centers are located in multipurpose  facilities, have become more prominent. Such a dynamic environment  reinforces the need for agencies to remain in communication with OMB in  order to facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer and for OMB to  continue to provide leadership and guidance, as we have previously  recommended.", "OMB\u2019s May 2014 publication of the data center optimization metrics is a  considerable step forward in helping OMB provide better oversight of  agencies\u2019 efforts to optimize their core data centers.

This documentation included, but was not  limited to, agencies\u2019 quarterly reports of cost savings and avoidances  submitted to OMB, total cost of ownership models, contract and budget  documentation, and internal agency status reports. To determine cost  savings achieved to date, we totaled agency reported savings and  avoidances from fiscal years 2011 through 2013, and to identify future  planned savings we totaled agency projected savings and avoidances  from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. We also compared agencies\u2019 cost  savings and avoidance information to key requirements for identifying and  reporting data center consolidation cost savings and avoidances, as  outlined in OMB\u2019s March 2013 memorandum.", "To assess the reliability of agencies\u2019 cost savings and avoidance data, we  reviewed related documentation provided by agency data center program  managers and other cognizant officials, such as agency total cost of  ownership models, agency-developed spreadsheets, agencies\u2019 quarterly  data submissions to OMB, among other sources. We also compared the  cost savings and avoidances reported to us by agencies with cost savings  identified in OMB\u2019s quarterly reports to Congress on the status of  information technology reform efforts. In addition, we reviewed agency  documentation for missing data or other errors (e.g., incorrect  calculations). Finally, we interviewed agency officials to obtain additional  supporting information regarding how their cost savings and avoidance  figures were determined, the processes and methods to recalculate the  figures, and the steps that the agency took to ensure the reliability of their  figures and validate their figures. We also discussed with agency officials  any discrepancies or potential errors identified during our review of their  supporting documentation to determine the cause or request additional  information. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to  report on agencies\u2019 cost savings achieved to date and identified future  savings. However, as part of our reliability assessment, we identified  issues with the reliability of OMB\u2019s quarterly reports to Congress,  including that agencies\u2019 data center consolidation cost savings were not  being fully reflected in OMB\u2019s report. We have highlighted this issue in our  report.", "Lastly, we reviewed agencies\u2019 data center facility reductions as reported  on  http://data.gov and compared the information to agencies\u2019 cost savings  and avoidances achieved to date, taking into consideration the challenges  in achieving savings identified by agencies. To assess the reliability of  agencies\u2019 data center reductions, we reviewed prior reporting of data  center closures to check for anomalies in the data, such as fewer  closures for agencies in more recent data sets than previously reported.  We also checked for missing data, outliers, and other obvious errors,  such as missing closure status information. Finally, we interviewed OMB  staff from the Office of E-Government and Information Technology  regarding actions taken to verify the data. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable to report on agencies\u2019 consolidation progress.", "To identify notable consolidation successes and challenges in achieving  cost savings, we reviewed agencies\u2019 cost savings documentation,  including quarterly reports on cost savings and avoidances submitted to  OMB, total cost of ownership models, contract and budget  documentation, internal agency status reports, and other documentation,  and interviewed agency officials. To determine the types of successes  experienced, we identified areas reported in agencies\u2019 documentation  with directly attributable cost savings or avoidances. We also interviewed  agency officials to identify additional successes in achieving cost savings,  including areas where the agency may not have been able to quantify the  savings. To determine challenges in achieving cost savings, we  interviewed agency officials to obtain information regarding challenges  faced, as well as to discuss any steps taken, or planned, to address the  challenges identified. We then determined which successes and  challenges were encountered most often. In some cases, agencies\u2019 cost  savings and avoidance data were used to highlight the impact of a  particular success. As a result of the reliability assessment performed for  our first objective, we determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for  reporting on agencies\u2019 cost savings and avoidances achieved to date and  planned.", "To evaluate the extent to which data center optimization metrics have  been established, we analyzed OMB\u2019s March 2013 memorandum to  determine OMB\u2019s requirements for such metrics, including the  responsibilities for completing the metrics and the key areas or categories  that were to be addressed by the metrics. We then compared OMB\u2019s  requirements for the metrics to the final metrics, as documented in a May  2014 OMB memorandum. We also reviewed previous data center  consolidation-related OMB memorandums and consolidation plan  guidance to identify metrics that had previously been identified by OMB  as indicators of data center optimization success and determined the  extent to which the metrics addressed these areas. Finally, we  interviewed relevant OMB, General Services Administration, and Data  Center Consolidation Task Force officials to discuss the process by which  the metrics were established and to determine the extent that related  targets, or goals, for the metrics had been established.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2013 to September  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
