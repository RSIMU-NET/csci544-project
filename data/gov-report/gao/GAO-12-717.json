States also decide which other states\u0092 permits to honor. Typically, states enter into reciprocity agreements that establish which out of- state permit holders can carry concealed firearms within each state. In recent years, Members of Congress have introduced legislation that would require each issuing state to recognize any permit.

Typically, states enter into  reciprocity agreements that establish which out-of-state permit holders  can carry concealed firearms within each state. Congress has considered  the issue of concealed carry permitting and the concept of national  reciprocity. Most recently, Members of the 112th Congress have  proposed legislation that would address certain aspects of concealed  carry permitting as well as national reciprocity. Proposed legislation  currently pending in Congress would provide national reciprocity or allow  individuals that have a concealed carry permit issued from one state to be  eligible to carry a concealed weapon in any other state that issues  concealed carry permits. Other proposed legislation would require states  to have minimum standards for the process of issuing concealed carry  permits as well as minimum eligibility requirements to attain a permit.  Both gun rights and gun control advocates have raised concerns with a  variety of proposed legislation related to concealed carry permitting and  national reciprocity. In this context, you requested that we provide  information on the status of concealed carry permitting.

To assess the reliability of the data and  information, we asked the states about the systems they use to track the  data, any steps taken to verify accuracy, and any limitations to the data.  Our analysis was largely dependent on the availability of state data on the  number of concealed carry permits.

Additionally, probate  court officials could become aware of disqualifying acts committed by  permit holders through other means, such as reading or scanning the  local newspaper and watching local news television broadcasts, which  may result in a revocation.", "With respect to legislation, states that wish to use the FBI\u2019s NGI Rap Back services  need legislation requiring concealed carry permit applicants to be fingerprinted and a  background check conducted at the federal level.

In Virginia, an issuing authority reported that a common reason  for a revocation is if a permit holder is found to be driving under the  influence. In Louisiana, the issuing authority reported that a common  reason for a revocation is if a permit holder failed to notify the department  of public safety of an arrest within 15 days. In Virginia, for example, a  revocation could also be warranted if the permit holder has a noncriminal  prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm, such as being diagnosed  with a mental illness or subject to a domestic violence restraining order.  For example, in Arizona, if a judge orders a permit holder to receive  mental health treatment or a permit holder is involuntarily committed to a  mental health facility, the holder\u2019s permit is revoked.", "After detecting a disqualifying criminal offense or other disqualifying  factors, officials from each of the 9 states in our case study that issues  permits reported that they begin the revocation process by notifying the  permit holder through a letter or court order, or in some cases, issuing  authorities send law enforcement to deliver the letter and retrieve the  permit. The letter is to outline the procedures for either appealing the  revocation (if applicable) or physically surrendering the permit. Further, all  9 states in our case study have an appeals process. Some states, such  as Louisiana and Texas, have a suspension process until the appeal  process is completed, final disposition is determined by a court, or the  individual surrenders the permit. For example, when a permit holder is  arrested, the issuing authority is to suspend the permit until the final  disposition has been determined by the court. If the court convicts the  permit holder, the issuing authority is to revoke the permit. For example,  Louisiana offers permit holders the option of providing additional evidence  for the issuing authority to consider as part of its appeals process before  final revocation. Texas offers its permit holders the option of requesting a  hearing to review the denial, suspension, or revocation of their permit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Select States Use Different Mechanisms to Retrieve Revoked Permits", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned above, the 9 states in our case study that issue permits  have mechanisms for indicating in their respective systems that a permit  has been revoked. In addition, these states have varying retrieval  processes. For example:  In Arizona, the permit holder is required to surrender a revoked  permit. If the holder does not surrender the permit and is caught by  law enforcement with the revoked permit, the law enforcement officer  is directed to seize the permit and return it to the issuing authority.  In California, although doing so is not a requirement in state law, local  law enforcement officials said that permit holders are asked to  physically return their revoked permit to the issuing authority (a city  police department or sheriff\u2019s department).", "Some Georgia issuing authorities send a letter communicating the  court order via certified mail notifying permit holders that their permits  have been revoked and to surrender the permits. If the issuing  authorities do not receive a response, they can send local law  enforcement to retrieve the revoked permit.", "Virginia\u2019s issuing authorities use different processes to retrieve  revoked permits. For example, one issuing authority in Virginia sends  local law enforcement to the permit holder\u2019s residence to retrieve the  revoked permit. Another jurisdiction requires the permit holder to  come to the circuit court for a hearing. The judge may charge the  permit holder with contempt if the person does not show up for the  hearing.", "Of the 9 states in our case study that issue permits, 3 (Georgia, Maryland,  and Tennessee) reported that they can impose a penalty for failure to  surrender a revoked permit or continuing to possess one. Permit issuing  authority officials in 5 out of the remaining 6 states (Arizona, California,  Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Virginia) said that they were not aware of  any instances where individuals have presented revoked permits to law  enforcement and noted that because revocations are annotated in their  state-wide systems available to law enforcement, law enforcement could  know if someone presented a revoked permit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Law Enforcement in Select States Visually Check Permits to Verify Validity, among Other Actions", "paragraphs": ["When encountering an individual with a concealed carry permit, such as  during a routine traffic stop, law enforcement officials in our 9 case study  states that issue permits told us that they visually inspect a permit to  verify its status to ensure it is valid and active. They also have  mechanisms available to further validate the permit, as needed, such as  checking a permit against state databases or contacting state  dispatchers. Law enforcement in these states may take steps to confirm a  permit is valid and active if law enforcement knows a person has a permit  and determines a need to take this action. In Texas, permit holders are  required by law to present their permit when encountering law  enforcement and identification is requested. In addition, in 5 of our case  study states (Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Virginia),  permit holders are required to produce a permit if law enforcement  demands it. For example, in 4 of these states (Louisiana, Tennessee,  Texas, and Virginia), law enforcement could become aware if an  individual had an active permit when running his or her driver\u2019s license, as  permits in these states are linked to the driver\u2019s license system. During  these checks, law enforcement in these states would also receive  information on whether the individual had a permit revoked. Permit  holders may also voluntarily present permits to law enforcement officials  immediately when being pulled over for a traffic stop regardless of state  requirements. While Tennessee law does not require permit holders to  present permits unless requested by law enforcement officers, according  to Tennessee issuing authority officials, firearms safety training required  for all Tennessee permit holders teaches them to do so when  encountering law enforcement.", "Generally, law enforcement officials in all 9 case study states said that  when presented with a permit, they would visually inspect the permit to  verify that the permit was current and belonged to the individual. All of  these states have a standardized permit prescribed by state law, which  can make it easier for law enforcement to verify. Further, all of these  states\u2019 permits contain the permit holders\u2019 name, permit expiration date,  and unique permit number\u2014this information assists law enforcement in  verifying whether a permit is current. As shown in table 5, the permits  have other physical features such as a photograph, the date of birth, or a  state seal or hologram, among others.", "Law enforcement officials in all 9 case study states said they would not  routinely take additional steps to verify a permit beyond visual inspection  and verifying permit information in the driver\u2019s license system in states  where permits are linked to such systems. These officials explained that  their top priorities during a traffic stop would be officer safety and the  reason for the stop (e.g., traffic violation). However, law enforcement in all  of these states has other means to further validate a permit as needed,  although some methods are easier to use than others. According to  issuing authority officials in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana,  Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, law enforcement within their  state can instantly access state databases, which have permit holders\u2019  information, to validate the status of a permit as needed. In Florida, for  example, issuing authority officials said that they update all information  related to permit holders in the state\u2019s criminal database nightly. The  Florida Department of Law Enforcement \u2014which manages the  database\u2014makes the information available to all law enforcement  agencies. Thus, a law enforcement officer in the field can obtain current  information on the status of a permit usually by contacting the officer\u2019s  dispatcher, or in some Florida jurisdictions, law enforcement can obtain  current permit information from their vehicles\u2019 on-board computer  systems. In Georgia and Maryland, law enforcement officers can call the  issuing authority to verify the status of resident permits. However, law  enforcement may not be able to instantly validate a permit because  permit issuing authorities generally operate during normal business hours  (Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.).", "In addition, law enforcement may have mechanisms to validate permits  issued by other states. As noted above, Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas, and  Virginia provide access to permit information when officers check these  driver\u2019s licenses; consequently, this check can be used to validate permits  within their state or outside of their state. Further, an out-of-state law  enforcement agency can obtain current information on Florida-issued  permits by submitting an information request to the Florida Department of  Law Enforcement Customer Support Center. Additionally, Arizona, Florida,  Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia input permit information into the  International Justice and Public Safety Network (Nlets), an information- sharing system available to all states\u2019 law enforcement agencies. Nlets  provides users instant access to permit holder information, such as permit  status (i.e., whether the permit is valid, active, or revoked, etc.), and a  description of the permit holder. Submission of permit holder information  into Nlets is strictly voluntary for states that have a centralized state  database. Currently, approximately 20 states input permit information into  Nlets. States that do not have a centralized state database of permit  holders (e.g., Georgia) cannot make information available in Nlets. Law  enforcement in other states can also call select states\u2019 dispatchers in  Florida and Maryland to validate permits issued by these states. To validate  a permit issued in California, officers from other states could call the  California Department of Justice, which collects permit information from the  issuing authorities throughout the state.", "We provided portions of a draft of this report to state and local officials in  Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Tennessee,  Texas, and Virginia.

We also contacted the 48 states to obtain information on their  permit tracking systems, reasons for denials, and revocations. Of the 48  states, we received data from 45 states. We requested data for the  period 2007 through 2011 to illustrate any trends; however some states  could not provide complete data for this period. Most states were able to  provide 2011 data. To assess the reliability of these data, we asked the  states questions about the systems they use to track the data, any steps  taken to verity accuracy, and any limitations to the data. Our analysis was  largely dependent on the availability of state data on the number of  concealed carry permits. In some cases, statewide data were not  available, and in other cases only data from certain time periods were  available. As a result of these limitations, we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable solely to illustrate a minimum number of total  active permits and approximate number of state specific permits.", "In addition, we obtained information from and interviewed federal  agencies with firearms-related experience and law enforcement  responsibilities\u2014the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). We  obtained information from and interviewed FBI headquarters officials on  their audits of select states that utilize federal databases that states query  when screening concealed carry permit applicants. We obtained  information and interviewed ATF headquarters officials and field special  agents on their experience and perspective on state permits. In addition,  we interviewed non-governmental groups representing a cross section of  different views on concealed carry permit issues to obtain information  regarding a historical perspective of carry conceal issues.", "To obtain more detailed information about specific state laws and  procedures for carry concealed permits, we met with officials at various  state and local agencies in the 9 states in our case study. We obtained  and analyzed information about state laws, eligibility requirements, and  procedures including, (1) how states screen, approve, and deny permit  applicants and (2) factors considered by states when entering into  reciprocity agreements with other states and the number of current  reciprocity agreements in place. We also obtained and analyzed state  data on state-maintained statistics on the number of active and denied  permits, and other firearms-related information such as specific  requirements and training guidance.", "To determine how the 9 states we selected for our case study monitor  active holders to ensure they remain eligible to possess firearms and  what actions the states take to revoke permits when permit holders  become ineligible, we obtained information from the 9 states that issue  permits: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland,  Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Of these 9, 3 states (California, Georgia,  and Virginia) have a decentralized process for issuing permits. We  obtained information and interviewed the issuing officials (county sheriffs,  probate court staff, and circuit court staff) from three to five jurisdictions  per state. From the 9 states, we selected for our case study that issue  permits, we obtained and analyzed available data on the number of  permits revoked, and the extent to which states recovered revoked  permits from permit holders. We also interviewed state and local officials  responsible for issuing permits to obtain information on applicable laws  and procedures for monitoring, and revoking permits.", "To identify how law enforcement officials in the 9 select states that issue  permits determine whether permits they encounter are current and valid,  we obtained information on the physical features embedded in each state\u2019s  permit, and the state and federal systems utilized to check the status of  permits, and we interviewed state and local law enforcement officials  across the 9 states to obtain information on processes they use to validate  permits. These law enforcement officials included those representing state  department of law enforcement, state departments of public safety, state  police or state highway patrol, county sheriffs, and city police.", "We conducted our work from August 2011 through July 2012 in  accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that  are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and  perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to  meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We  believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis  conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings in this product."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: State Issuing Authority, as of March 2012", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Type of authority Decentralized", "paragraphs": ["Local police or Colonel of the State Police  Counties Concealed Weapon Licensing Boards  17  Approximate number  of authorities  (if decentralized)", "Clerk of Circuit Courts for residents, Department  of State Police for nonresidents  Chiefs of police of municipalities, county sheriffs  Not applicable (N/A)", "Attorney General\u2019s Office through the Division of  Criminal Investigation  For states that have a + symbol beside the number of authorities, the approximate number of  authorities may be significantly higher."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: State Concealed Carry Permit Designation, as of March 28, 2012", "paragraphs": ["While there is no federal law specifically addressing the issuance of  concealed carry permits, 48 states have passed laws allowing the state to  issue citizens concealed carry permits.
