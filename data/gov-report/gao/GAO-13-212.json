At the height of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the number of contractors exceeded the number of military personnel, and a similar situation is occurring in Afghanistan. In January 2011, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum noting the risk of DOD's level of dependency on contractors and outlined actions to institutionalize changes necessary to influence how the department plans for contracted support in contingency operations. The memorandum also called for leveraging the civilian expeditionary workforce to reduce DOD's reliance on contractors, but this workforce is not yet fully developed. GAO was asked to examine DOD's progress in planning for operational contract support. Our review determined how DOD is integrating operational contract support into its planning through efforts of the (1) OSD, Joint Staff, and military services, and (2) combatant commands and their components. To conduct its work, GAO evaluated DOD operational contract support guidance and documents and met with officials at various DOD offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, and the services have taken steps to integrate operational contract support into planning for contingency operations. For example, in April 2011, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, working with the Joint Staff, revised the Guidance for the Employment of the Force to require planning for operational contract support in all phases of military operations. Further, in December 2011, the Department of Defense (DOD) revised an instruction and issued corresponding regulations establishing policies and procedures for operational contract support. The Army issued service-specific guidance that describes roles, responsibilities, and requirements to help integrate operational contract support into its planning efforts for contingency operations. However, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have not issued similar comprehensive guidance for integrating operational contract support throughout each service. Instead, these services have taken actions such as developing training and other individual efforts to familiarize servicemembers with operational contract support. According to service officials, one reason that they have not issued comprehensive guidance similar to the Army's guidance is because the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have not been the lead service for contracting in recent operations. However, these services combined spent over a billion dollars for contracted services in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2011. Without specific, service-wide guidance, the other services' future planning efforts may not reflect the full extent of the use of contract support and the attendant cost and need for oversight.", "The combatant commands and their components have begun to incorporate operational contract support into their planning for contingencies, but they have not fully integrated operational contract support in all functional areas. We found that the combatant commands and components are not planning for the potential use of contractors in areas where they may be needed beyond logistics such as communications. Recognizing the problem, DOD, in October 2012, issued guidance that calls on functional planners beyond the logistics area to identify major support functions planned for commercial support sourcing. GAO also found that officials involved with logistics planning at the commands receive training from the Joint Staff and assistance from embedded operational contract support planners to help integrate operational contract support into logistics planning. However, officials involved in planning for other areas--such as intelligence--that have used contractors in past operations, do not receive such training. Further, the embedded operational contract support planners do not focus on areas beyond logistics. Moreover, while the combatant commands have embedded experts to assist with operational contract support planning, the military service components do not have such expertise. Without training for all planners, a broader focus beyond logistics for embedded planners, and expertise offered at the military service components, DOD risks being unprepared to plan and manage deployed contractor personnel and may not be able to provide the necessary oversight during future contingencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Navy , Marine Corps and Air Force provide guidance on planning for operational contract support; that the Joint Staff provide training for all planners; that the planners broaden their focus to include areas beyond logistics; and that expertise is offered to service components to further integrate operational contract support into plans. DOD generally agreed with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has relied extensively on contractors  for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade. At the height  of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the number of contractors exceeded the  number of military personnel, and a similar situation is occurring in  support of Operation Enduring Freedom. According to DOD, in 2012, the  number of contractors in Afghanistan exceeded 109,000 compared to the  approximately 84,200 military personnel present at that same time.  According to DOD regulations, operational contract support is the ability  to orchestrate and synchronize the provision of integrated contract  support and management of contractor personnel providing support to the  joint force within a designated operational area. In Afghanistan,  contractors provide traditional logistical support, such as base operating  support (food and housing) and maintaining weapon systems.  Additionally, contractors provide nonlogistical support, such as  intelligence analysts and interpreters who accompany military patrols.  DOD anticipates continued reliance on contractors for future operations.", "Our previous work has highlighted long-standing problems regarding the  oversight and management of contractors supporting deployed forces and  the department\u2019s failure to fully integrate operational contract support  within DOD. For example, we and others have identified instances in Iraq  and Afghanistan where DOD\u2019s acquisition and non-acquisition personnel  were in short supply, were not properly trained, or were not fully aware of  their responsibilities. Since 1992, we have designated DOD contract  management as a high-risk area. In our February 2011 report on high- risk areas, we reported that DOD needed to, among other things, fully  integrate operational contract support throughout the department through  education and predeployment training. In June 2010, because of the  department not fully integrating operational contract support, we called for  a cultural change in DOD\u2014one that emphasized an awareness of  operational contract support throughout all entities of the department to  help address the challenges faced in ongoing and future contingency  operations\u2014and last September, we testified that DOD still faced  challenges achieving such a change. We recognize that effecting a  cultural change is a major undertaking for organizations, especially for an  organization as large and multifaceted as DOD. Effecting a cultural  change involves, for example, developing and communicating a vision for  the future, neutralizing impediments to change, identifying stakeholders in  the change process, and promoting continued support from senior  leaders. Additionally, Congress has enacted legislation requiring DOD to  take specific actions to improve its management and oversight of  contractors in contingency operations. For example, in the John Warner  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, Congress  required DOD to develop joint policies for requirements definition,  contingency program management, and contingency contracting during  combat and postconflict operations. A provision in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 added to this requirement, which  is codified as amended at section 2333 of Title 10, United States Code.", "DOD has taken steps toward making fundamental changes in how it  approaches the issue of operational contract support. In January 2011,  the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum in which he expressed  concern about the risks introduced by DOD\u2019s current level of dependency  on contractors, its future total force mix, and the need to better plan for  operational contract support in the future. The Secretary outlined a  number of actions needed to institutionalize the changes necessary to  influence a cultural shift in how the department views, and accounts and  plans for, contracted support in a contingency environment. In addition, in  June 2011, the Director of the Joint Staff issued a memorandum to  implement the direction in the Secretary\u2019s memorandum and assigned  Joint Staff directors to specific tasks regarding the integration of  operational contract support and the civilian expeditionary workforce  throughout DOD. Further, in December 2011, DOD issued DOD  Instruction 3020.41 and corresponding regulations in the Code of Federal  Regulations. The instruction and regulations established policy, assigned  responsibilities, and provided procedures for operational contract support,  including operational contract support program management, contract  support integration, and integration of defense contractor personnel into  contingency operations outside the United States.", "In addition to operational contract support, the Secretary of Defense\u2019s  January 2011 memorandum also addresses the need to better leverage  the capabilities of the civilian expeditionary workforce in order to reduce  the risk introduced by DOD\u2019s level of reliance on contractors. Created in  2009, the civilian expeditionary workforce is a DOD program that deploys  civilian employees to support military operations. As of late 2012, it  comprised approximately 395 personnel, which is about 10 percent of the  total number of civilians deployed in support of contingency operations.  DOD established this workforce to create a cadre of civilians who are  trained, cleared, and equipped to respond urgently to expeditionary  requirements. However, according to officials from the civilian  expeditionary workforce program office, the use of these individuals, to  date, has been on an augmentee basis to fulfill individual requirements. In  an effort to utilize the program as originally intended with a ready pool of  qualified and trained civilians to support contingency operations, civilian  expeditionary workforce officials stated that they are currently developing  a DOD instruction that includes defining the critical skill sets for the  civilian expeditionary workforce program. DOD expects to issue the  instruction in late 2013. In the interim, DOD officials stated that they  expect to release a policy memorandum ahead of the instruction that will  address the civilian expeditionary workforce support and deployment  procedures. According to officials from the services and combatant  commands and their components, they are not planning for this workforce  until the capabilities are further defined.", "In light of continuing interest in DOD\u2019s integration and management of  contracted support in support of contingency operations, you asked us to  examine DOD\u2019s progress on institutionalizing the planning for operational  contract support throughout the department. Specifically, our objectives  were to determine how DOD is integrating planning for operational  contract support through efforts of: (1) the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, and the military services, and (2) the  combatant commands and their components.", "To conduct this review, we collected and analyzed documentation such  as planning guidance and policies related to the integration of operational  contract support into DOD\u2019s planning for contingency operations. We  reviewed plans and other efforts to understand DOD\u2019s implementation of  requirements to integrate operational contract support. We also  interviewed officials from OSD, the Joint Staff, military services, and  combatant commands to obtain a comprehensive understanding of  DOD\u2019s efforts to integrate operational contract support. Specifically, to  determine how OSD and the Joint Staff have taken steps to integrate  operational contract support department-wide, we examined excerpts  from strategic planning guidance and policies regarding operational  contract support and met with officials from OSD and the Joint Staff. We  reviewed DOD guidance on the civilian expeditionary workforce and  interviewed officials from OSD, the Joint Staff, the civilian expeditionary  workforce program office, military services, and combatant commands to  understand the intent and the status of the development of the civilian  expeditionary workforce program. To determine how the military services  have integrated operational contract support into their operations, we  collected and analyzed documentation related to operational contract  support initiatives from each of the services. We also met with officials  from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force to gain an  understanding of how each organization has implemented operational  contract support to support strategic-level guidance and policy. To  determine how combatant commands and their components have  integrated operational contract support into planning, we reviewed  selected operation and contingency plans to validate the integration of  operational contract support considerations in those instances. We also  met with officials from all of the geographic combatant commands (except  U.S. Northern Command) and their components to gain knowledge about  their current processes for planning for contingency operations.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2012 to February  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

This strategic guidance  includes DOD documents, such as the Guidance for the Employment of  the Force and the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, which tell combatant  commanders what to plan for within their areas of responsibility. On the  basis of the strategic guidance, combatant command planners write an  operation plan to address particular contingencies. During this stage, a  combatant commander can also task and provide guidance to the  component commands to develop supporting plans for an operation plan.  DOD doctrine suggests that, as a plan is developed, frequent dialogue  between planners and senior DOD leadership is necessary to ensure that  results are sufficient and feasible to meet mission objectives.", "An operation plan describes how DOD will respond to a potential  contingency that might require the use of military force. Such plans are  used to deal with a wide range of events, such as terrorism, hostile  foreign nations, and natural disasters. An operation plan consists of a  base plan and annexes. A base plan describes the concept of operations,  major forces, sustainment concept, and anticipated timelines for  completing the mission. Base plans are written following a five-paragraph  structure\u2014Situation, Mission, Execution, Administration and Logistics,  and Command and Control. Plans will generally include assumptions that  are relevant to the development or successful execution of the plan and  the concept of operation that the commander plans to use to accomplish  the mission, including the forces involved, the phasing of operations, and  the general nature and purpose of operations to be conducted. In addition  to the base plan, operation plans sometimes include annexes that provide  further details on areas such as intelligence (Annex B), operations (Annex  C), logistics (Annex D), personnel (Annex E), communications (Annex K),  and operational contract support (Annex W)\u2014the latter generally includes  information such as contract support, contracting capabilities, and  capacities support estimates. While Annex D includes operational  contract support considerations, we have previously reported that  because DOD has typically relied on contractors in areas beyond  logistics, it is important for DOD to conduct up-front planning for the use  of contractors in all functional areas, not just logistics.

The  memorandum required, among other things, that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy integrate operational contract support considerations  into strategic planning documents and provide policy guidance on  planning for contracted support in force planning scenario development.  Also, the memorandum required that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff collaboratively develop procedures to support operational contract  support planning in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System,  including contractor support estimates and visibility of contractors  accompanying the force.

Additionally, the Joint Staff completed  revisions in April 2011 to the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. The  revisions included the requirement that operational contract support  planning must occur at all plan levels and that, at a minimum, plans will  identify anticipated contract support requirements by joint capability area,  phase of operation, and area of need.", "In addition to policy revisions, OSD and the Joint Staff have undertaken  additional actions to ensure that planners better integrate operational  contract support into the planning process. For example, at the request of  the combatant commands, the Joint Staff has conducted operational  contract support training that explains changes to the planning  requirements for the integration of operational contract support.  Specifically, the Joint Staff held training seminars for operational contract  support planners at Central Command and Southern Command in  November 2011, at Pacific Command in January 2012, and at Africa and  European Commands in May 2012 to highlight recent changes in  guidance and processes.", "In addition, the Functional Capabilities Integration Board, which was  created in 2010, is actively monitoring ongoing operational contract  support\u2013related efforts across DOD and the progress toward timely  completion of the direction in the Secretary\u2019s January 2011  memorandum.

This  manual will be used by joint commanders and war planners to monitor,  plan, and execute mobilization, deployment, employment, and  sustainment activities associated with joint operations and provide users  with access to joint operations planning policies and procedures.  Specifically, the Adaptive Planning and Execution manual requires that  functional planners identify major support functions planned for  commercial support sourcing. The manual also references Annex W in  the instructions for many of the individual annexes. Also, the Adaptive  Planning and Execution manual, in keeping with the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s memorandum requirements, requires the expansion of the  Annex W, the operational contract support annex, in operation plans to  include appendixes on (1) estimates of contracting capabilities and  capacities support, (2) a contractor management plan, and (3) estimates  of contractor support.

Further, the Secretary of Defense\u2019s January 2011  memorandum also directs the military services to take certain actions,  which could improve how they plan for and use operational contract  support.", "In large part because of the Army\u2019s leading role in the major  contingencies over the past decade that required it to employ operational  contract support, the Army has issued guidance and created various  organizations for integrating contract support into its planning and for  developing related training. The Secretary of the Army established an  independent panel, known as the Gansler Commission, which issued a  final report in October 2007 that highlighted issues and needs for better  military operations and cited critical deficiencies in the Army\u2019s contracting  and contract management. Since that report\u2019s issuance, the Army has  made it a priority to address highlighted deficiencies in areas such as  guidance and training. In particular, the Army has issued service-specific  guidance for integrating contract support into the service. For example,  the Army issued Army Regulation 715-9 in 2011 that provides guidance  regarding planning and managing operational contract support for the  nonacquisition force, such as operational commanders or contracting  officer\u2019s representatives. It describes responsibilities, policy, and  implementing procedures for operational contract support. Specifically,  the regulation describes, among other things, planning, requirements  definition, and oversight in the context of contracted support. For  example, the regulation notes that, in general, contracted support will be  utilized after full consideration of all sources of support, including  deployable civilians. The Army also developed a manual containing  tactics, techniques, and procedures for operational contract support.  The manual provides \u201chow to\u201d guidance about operational contract  support for Army operational commanders and their nonacquisition officer  staff. In addition, the manual describes the roles of Army officials and  organizations regarding operational contract support and serves as the  primary reference document for execution of operational contract support  planning, integration, and oversight tasks provided in other guidance,  including Army Regulation 715-9. Moreover, the manual contains  checklists that include considerations related to operational contract  support. Furthermore, in direct response to the Gansler Commission  report, the Army created the Army Contracting Command in 2008, which  performs the majority of the contracting work for the Army, including  assisting in operational contract support planning needs, training  development, and execution. Other Army entities, along with DOD\u2019s  Defense Acquisition University, have developed and are implementing  additional operational contract support training initiatives. Key Army  training initiatives include the following:", "The Expeditionary Contracting Command, a subordinate to the Army  Contracting Command, provides contracting support to the Army and  other federal organizations at installations outside of the United  States. Additionally, the Expeditionary Contracting Command has  seven contracting support brigades that provide direct support to  Army service component commanders, including providing  predeployment contingency contracting unit training, which includes  training contracting officers\u2019 representatives.", "The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and  Technology) Integration Office works with other entities including the  Expeditionary Contracting Command to develop collective and  individual training standards and material for acquisition and  nonacquisition personnel involved with the planning, requirements  definition, contracting, and management of operational contract  support. Also, the integration office oversees the incorporation of  planning of operational contract support for brigade-level training.", "The Army Contracting Command, along with other entities, developed  and launched enhanced training of contracting officer\u2019s  representatives through the Defense Acquisition University. This  course assists with deploying more prepared and trained contracting  officer\u2019s representatives into contingencies.", "Finally, according to statements of senior Army officials before the  Commission on Wartime Contracting, the Assistant Secretary of the Army  (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) chartered the Operational  Contracting Support and Policy Directorate in December 2009. As  described in an Army briefing, this directorate develops, issues, manages,  and measures the effectiveness of policies regarding operational contract  support. According to the briefing, it provides strategic contract  management and oversight of the U.S. Central Command Joint Theater  Support Contracting Command, an organization that provides theater  contracting support to the combined joint operations area of Afghanistan.  The directorate provides oversight of contingency contracting operations  in Iraq and Afghanistan as the focal point for the Army for contracting in- theater. According to the briefing, among other activities, such as  validation of operational contract support in doctrine, organization,  training, materiel, leadership, and personnel considerations, members of  the directorate also serve on DOD\u2019s Operational Contract Support  Functional Capabilities and Integration Board. In addition, this directorate,  along with the Army\u2019s other efforts, assists the Army in meeting the  operational contract support requirements in both Joint Publication 4-10  and the Secretary of Defense\u2019s January 2011 memorandum.", "While the Army has established guidance and taken several steps to  integrate operational contract support within its service, the other services  have not taken similar actions to incorporate operational contract support  into their planning. Joint Publication 4-10 and the Secretary of Defense\u2019s  January 2011 memorandum require the military departments to take  certain steps that could improve how they plan for and use operational  contract support. While the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have  developed some training and other efforts to improve the planning and  use of operational contract support, they have not developed service- specific guidance detailing how operational contract support will be  integrated into each of their services\u2019 planning and execution efforts for  contingency operations. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force officials told  us that they generally do not have a major role in operational contract  support because the Army has been the lead service for contracting in  present conflicts.", "Navy officials acknowledged that some sailors need to understand the  role that operational contract support plays in their deployed locations. As  a result, Navy officials have included information about operational  contract support in logistics training, which provides a basic overview of  contract execution. However, as acknowledged by Navy officials, the  Navy has not issued guidance that includes information regarding roles  and responsibilities for ensuring better execution of planning, integration,  and oversight of operational contract support within the service. Marine  Corps officials acknowledged that the Marine Corps has also not issued  service-wide, specific operational contract support guidance, although  they explained that the service\u2019s role in the Afghanistan and Iraq  contingencies showed that operational contract support was important  and that the Marine Corps needed specific, related training. In  Afghanistan, the Marine Corps established two operational contract  support cells, which have managed contract support and management- related activities for the service and provided oversight of operational  contract support training to relevant personnel. In addition, a 2009 Marine  Corps reference publication on contingency contracting contains doctrinal  information for commanders and their staff members to plan for and  obtain contracting support when deployed. While this information is  helpful to commanders and their staff to understand the process for  contingency contracting, the document does not comprehensively  describe how the Marine Corps plans to integrate operational contract  support throughout the service. Further, as part of planning before  deployment, the Marine Corps identified and trained contracting officer\u2019s  representatives prior to their deployment. Additionally, officials told us that  the Marine Corps has begun to include some operational contract support  in training in areas such as on regulations related to contracting. While  the Marine Corps has incorporated some operational contract support in  predeployment planning, the training is limited and, according to Marine  Corps officials, it is at the commanders\u2019 discretion to include it into their  units\u2019 training. According to Marine Corps officials, the Marine Corps has  not provided guidance detailing the roles and responsibilities for  nonacquisition personnel on how operational contract support will be  integrated into the Marine Corps\u2019 planning and execution efforts for  contingency operations. Since training often changes, there is no  permanent enforcement to maintain competencies of operational contract  support, such as contractor oversight, into planning or training within the  Marine Corps, thus limiting full institutionalization of operational contract  support.", "Air Force officials acknowledged that the Air Force has not developed  service-wide guidance regarding the integration of operational contract  support within the service. The guidance that officials did identify is  focused on the role of contracting officer\u2019s representatives and actions for  deployed commanders and contingency contracting officers to take during  initial deployment (such as establishing shelter requirements and other  needs of the unit). GAO identified similar acquisition-related implementing  guidance related to basic contingency contracting actions during phases  of an operation as well as implementing guidance regarding review of  operation plans for contractor support integration plans, contractor  management plans, and other contracting considerations. However, these  documents do not comprehensively describe how the Air Force plans to  integrate operational contract support throughout the service. Further, it is  not clear how familiar officials are with these documents, as they were not  mentioned during the course of discussions. The Air Force\u2019s current  training related to operational contract support is limited to the contract  familiarization training provided to the contracting officer\u2019s  representatives, which is typical of training provided to contracting  officer\u2019s representatives in all services. As a result, the integration of  operational contract support throughout the Air Force\u2019s planning is limited  because, as acknowledged by Air Force officials, the Air Force has not  issued comprehensive guidance explaining the roles and responsibilities  for the execution of planning, integration, and oversight of operational  contract support within the service.", "Thus, while the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have developed some  training and other individual efforts to familiarize servicemembers with  operational contract support, these services have not issued  comprehensive guidance to assist in fully institutionalizing operational  contract support. DOD and service officials told us that they do not need  to plan for operational contract support in advance because the Army has  been the lead service in recent conflicts. However, according to DOD, the  Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force spent over a billion dollars combined  for contracted services in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2011, and therefore  contracted support has been utilized for which planning should have  occurred. Without specific service-wide guidance to help institutionalize  operational contract support, the other services may not fully understand  their role in operational contract support and may not be prepared to  execute operational contract support in the future\u2014when it is possible  that one of these services, instead of the Army, will play a leading role.  Further, unless the services\u2019 guidance describes how each service plans  to integrate operational contract support into each organization\u2014including  planning for contingency operations and training\u2014the other services\u2019  planning efforts may not reflect the full extent of the use of contract  support and the attendant cost and requirements for oversight."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Combatant Commands and Components Have Taken Positive Steps, but Face Challenges in Fully Integrating Operational Contract Support into Their Contingency Planning Processes", "paragraphs": ["The combatant commands and their components have begun to  incorporate operational contract support into their planning, but they  have not fully integrated operational contract support into their planning  for contingencies.

We found that DOD\u2019s efforts to fully integrate operational  contract support at the command and component levels are hindered by  not training all planners about new operational contract support  requirements, a lack of focus of operational contract support planners on  areas beyond logistics, and not providing operational contract support  planning expertise at the commands\u2019 components."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Combatant Commands and Their Components Have Taken Some Positive Steps to Integrate Operational Contract Support in Their Planning Processes", "paragraphs": ["The combatant commands and their components have taken some  positive steps to integrate operational contract support in their planning  processes.

For example, in  a draft humanitarian assistance and foreign disaster response plan that  we reviewed, officials at Southern Command had included an Annex W  that integrated assumptions for operational contract support. Similarly,  officials incorporated assumptions for operational contract support in  operation base plans and Annex Ws that we examined at Central  Command, Pacific Command, Africa Command, and European  Command. This integration of operational contract support is an  improvement from February 2010 when we found that only 4 of 89  operation plans had approved Annex Ws.", "Also, the Joint Staff has developed training for logistics officials at the  combatant commands and components to better understand how to  integrate operational contract support into their planning processes. The  Joint Staff\u2019s training informs planners of requirements in the Guidance for  the Employment of the Force that the combatant commands, together  with their service components and relevant combat support agencies,  plan for the integration of contracted support into all phases of military  operations. The training also makes officials aware of the new  requirement in the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan that states that  geographic combatant commands, together with their service  components and logistics planners, will synchronize and integrate  contracted support into military operations. According to U.S. Central  Command officials, they have already begun to employ the new guidance  shared with them during the training for developing the Annex W.", "We also noted several other positive efforts to integrate operational  contract support into planning. For example, the Defense Logistics  Agency, at the request of the combatant commands, has assigned two  expert planners from its Joint Contingency Acquisition Support Office to  the logistics offices at each combatant command to improve the  incorporation of operational contract support into combatant command  plans.

Under regulations and DOD  Instruction 3020.41, when officials anticipate the need for contractor  personnel and equipment to support military operations, military planners  are directed to develop orchestrated, synchronized, detailed, and fully  developed contract support integration plans and contractor management  plans as components of concept plans and operational plans in  accordance with appropriate strategic planning guidance. The  regulations and instruction also state that plans should contain additional  contract support guidance, as appropriate, in applicable annexes and  appendixes within the respective plans. Our previous work has shown  that DOD has typically relied on contractors in areas beyond logistics, and  thus we have emphasized the importance of the up-front planning for their  use across all functional areas.", "A Joint Staff official indicated that, in 2011, the Joint Staff added a  requirement to incorporate planning for operational contract support in the  base plan and Annex W of all operation plans; but the official noted that  requirement did not include incorporating operational contract support in  the nonlogistics annexes of plans. In a briefing document on changes and  anticipated changes to strategic and planning guidance, the Joint Staff  suggested that, among other things, planners would be required to  include assumptions for the use of contractor support in paragraph one of  the base plan and provide estimates of contractors in the Annex W.  Although the combatant commands and their components have  integrated operational contract support in the base plans and Annex Ws  we reviewed, they did not, at the time we reviewed their plans, have  more-specific and comprehensive guidance within the key operations  planning system manual for integrating planning for operational contract  support across all functional areas where contractors might be used. As a  result, officials working in areas outside of logistics were not integrating  operational contract support into their respective sections of plans. For  example, nonlogistics officials at Central Command\u2014such as those in the  communications (Annex K) and intelligence (Annex B) divisions\u2014stated  that they do not plan for operational contract support in their respective  annexes although contract support had been utilized in the past in these  areas. Similarly, at Southern Command, we found that operational  contract support was incorporated in Annex D (logistics) and Annex W  (operational contract support), but its Annex Ks (communications) and  Annex Bs (intelligence) did not directly contain considerations for  operational contract support. Moreover, nonlogistics officials at Africa  Command stated that they did not incorporate considerations of  operational contract support in annexes other than Annex W. Some  nonlogistics officials at Central Command further stated that they tend to  assume the logistics planners will address the need to incorporate  operational contract support throughout operation plans, but we found  that this was not occurring.

However, the Joint Staff only recently issued in October 2012  the Adaptive Planning and Execution manual that calls on functional  planners beyond the logistics area alone to identify major support  functions planned for commercial support sourcing. As a result, the effect  of this new manual remains to be determined. Until all functional area  planners begin to integrate operational contract support into their  respective sections of plans, the combatant commands and their  components risk being unprepared to fully plan for the use of contractors  in contingencies.

As explained in the guidance,  DOD viewed the act as requiring the department to adopt a preplanned  organizational approach to program management and to provide a  deployable team during contingency operations when requested, to  ensure jointness and cross-service coordination. According to the  guidance, the purpose of the Joint Contingency Acquisition Support Office  is to help synchronize, integrate, and manage the implementation and  execution of operational contract support among diverse communities in  support of U.S. government objectives during peacetime and contingency  operations.

However, because these planners are placed within the logistics  directorates, the planners are not integrated across all functional areas  and are not always focused on working with all planners at the combatant  commands to enable planning for the use of contracted support. Some  planners, such as those at U.S. Southern Command, coordinate with  combatant command planners from the nonlogistics areas and have  helped these planners to become aware of operational contract support  considerations.

While progress has been made at high levels within the department to  emphasize an awareness of operational contract support, DOD has not  yet fully institutionalized planning for operational contract support  throughout the military services, or at the combatant commands or  components where much of the operational planning occurs for  contingencies. Although the Army has made strides in creating guidance  and training on the importance of planning for operational contract  support because of the challenges it encountered in Iraq and Afghanistan,  the other military services have not taken additional steps to develop and  implement comprehensive guidance within each service to ensure the full  institutionalization of operational contract support. Moreover, at the  combatant commands and components, there is a lack of emphasis on  training for all planners, operational contract support planners are not  working with all planners, and expertise on operational contract support is  not provided for component planners.
