OMB has developed several processes to help carry out its role. For example, OMB began using a Management Watch List several years ago as a means of identifying poorly planned projects based on its evaluation of agencies' funding justifications for major projects, known as exhibit 300s. In addition, in August 2005, OMB established a process for agencies to identify high risk projects, i.e., projects requiring special attention because of one or more reasons specified by OMB, and to report on those that are poorly performing or not meeting performance criteria. GAO recently issued reports on the Management Watch List, high risk projects, and agencies' exhibit 300s.

Specifically, of the 857 major IT projects in the President's budget for fiscal year 2007, OMB placed 263 projects, representing about $10 billion on its Management Watch List. In addition, in response to OMB's memorandum, agencies reported that 79 of 226 high risk projects, collectively totaling about $2.2 billion, had a performance shortfall. While this information helps to focus both agency and OMB management attention on these poorly planned and poorly performing projects, GAO identified opportunities to strengthen how these projects are identified and provided oversight. The Management Watch List may be undermined by inaccurate and unreliable data. OMB uses scoring criteria to evaluate agencies' exhibit 300s to derive the projects on its Management Watch List. GAO's detailed evaluation of exhibit 300s showed that the information reported in them is not always accurate or supported by documentation. The criteria for identifying high risk projects were not always consistently applied and projects that appeared to meet the criteria were not identified as high risk. Without consistent application of the high risk criteria, OMB and agency executives cannot have the assurance that all projects that require special attention have been identified. For both sets of projects, OMB did not develop a central list of projects and deficiencies that could facilitate tracking progress and reporting to Congress. Without such lists, OMB is not fully exploiting the opportunity to analyze and track these projects on a governmentwide basis and not involving Congress in the oversight of these projects with risks. To improve the way the Management Watch List and high risk projects are identified and provided oversight, GAO has made a number of recommendations to the Director of OMB. These recommendations include directing agencies to improve the accuracy and reliability of exhibit 300 information and to consistently apply the high risk criteria defined by OMB. In addition, GAO recommended that the Director develop a single, aggregate list for both the Management Watch List and high risk projects to facilitate tracking progress, performing governmentwide analysis, and reporting the results to Congress. OMB generally disagreed with these recommendations. However, GAO believes that they are needed to provide greater assurance that poorly planned and poorly performing projects are more accurately identified and provided oversight, and ultimately ensure that potentially billions of taxpayer dollars are not wasted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the federal government\u2019s  processes for improving the management of IT investments that  total $64 billion for fiscal year 2007.

The performance criteria  are (1) establishing baselines with clear cost, schedule, and  performance goals;(2) maintaining the project\u2019s cost and schedule  variances within 10 percent; (3) assigning a qualified project  manager; or (4) avoiding duplication by leveraging interagency and  governmentwide investments.", "These processes, among other things, are instrumental in helping to  identify and improve oversight of poorly planned and poorly  performing projects.

To drive improvement in the implementation and  management of IT projects, Congress enacted the Clinger-Cohen Act  in 1996 to further expand the responsibilities of OMB and the  agencies under the Paperwork Reduction Act. In particular, the act  requires agency heads, acting through agency chief information  officers (CIOs), to, among other things, better link their IT planning  and investment decisions to program missions and goals and to  implement and enforce IT management policies, procedures,  standards, and guidelines. The Clinger-Cohen Act requires that  agencies engage in capital planning and performance and results- based management. The act also requires OMB to establish  processes to analyze, track, and evaluate the risks and results of  major capital investments in information systems made by executive  agencies. OMB is also required to report to Congress on the net  program performance benefits achieved as a result of major capital  investments in information systems that are made by executive  agencies.", "In response to the Clinger-Cohen Act and other statutes, OMB  developed policy for planning, budgeting, acquisition, and  management of federal capital assets.

Among other things,  OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide directs agencies to  \u25cf  evaluate and select capital asset investments that will support core  mission functions that must be performed by the federal  government and demonstrate projected returns on investment that  are clearly equal to or better than alternative uses of available public  resources;  institute performance measures and management processes that  monitor actual performance and compare to planned results; and   \u25cf  establish oversight mechanisms that require periodic review of  operational capital assets to determine how mission requirements  might have changed and whether the asset continues to fulfill  mission requirements and deliver intended benefits to the agency  and customers.", "To further support the implementation of IT capital planning  practices, we have developed an IT investment management  framework that agencies can use in developing a stable and  effective capital planning process, as required by statute and  directed in OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide. Consistent with the  statutory focus on selecting, controlling, and evaluating  investments, this framework focuses on these processes in relation  to IT investments specifically. It is a tool that can be used to  determine both the status of an agency\u2019s current IT investment  management capabilities and the additional steps that are needed to  establish more effective processes.

While OMB uses the exhibit 300s as the basis  for designating projects as poorly planned, we have recently  reported that the underlying support was often inadequate for  information provided in the exhibit 300s GAO reviewed. Three  general types of weaknesses were evident:   \u25cf  All exhibit 300s had documentation weaknesses. Documentation  either did not exist or did not fully agree with specific areas of the  exhibit 300.   \u25cf  Agencies did not always demonstrate that they complied with  federal or departmental requirements or policies with regard to  management and reporting processes. Also, none had cost analyses  that fully complied with OMB requirements for cost-benefit and  cost-effectiveness analyses. In contrast, most investments did  demonstrate compliance with information security planning and  training requirements.  \u25cf  In sections that required actual cost data, these data were unreliable  because they were not derived from cost-accounting systems with  adequate controls. In the absence of such systems, agencies  generally derived cost information from ad hoc processes.", "Moreover, although agencies, with OMB\u2019s assistance, generally  identified their high risk projects using criteria specified by OMB,  these criteria were not always consistently applied.   \u25cf  In several cases, agencies did not use OMB\u2019s criteria to identify high  risk projects. Some agencies reported using other reasons to  identify a total of 31 high risk projects. For example, the Department  of Homeland Security reported investments that were high risk  because they had weaknesses associated with their business cases  based on the evaluation by OMB. The Department of Transportation  reported projects as high risk because two did not have approved  baselines, and four had incomplete or poor earned value  management assessments.  \u25cf  Regarding the criterion for high risk designation that the agency has  not consistently demonstrated the ability to manage complex  projects, only three agencies reported having projects meeting this  criterion. This appears to be somewhat low, considering that we and  others have previously reported on weaknesses in numerous  agencies\u2019 ability to manage complex projects. For example, we have  reported in our high risk series on major programs and operations  that need urgent attention and transformation in order to ensure  that our national government functions in the most economical,  efficient, and effective manner possible.  Specifically, the  Department of Defense\u2019s efforts to modernize its business systems  have been hampered because of weaknesses in practices for (1)  developing and using an enterprise architecture, (2) instituting  effective investment management processes, and (3) establishing  and implementing effective systems acquisition processes. We  concluded that the Department of Defense, as a whole, remains far  from where it needs to be to effectively and efficiently manage an  undertaking with the size, complexity, and significance of its  departmentwide business systems modernization. We also reported  that, after almost 25 years and $41 billion, efforts to modernize the  air traffic control program of the Federal Aviation Administration,  the Department of Transportation\u2019s largest component, are far from  complete and that projects continue to face challenges in meeting  cost, schedule, and performance expectations.  However, neither  the Department of Defense nor the Department of Transportation  cited the \u201cinability to consistently manage complex projects\u201d criteria  for any projects as being high risk.  \u25cf  Finally, while agencies have reported a significant number of IT  projects as high risk, we identified other projects on which we have  reported and testified that appear to meet one or more of OMB\u2019s  criteria for high risk designation including high development or  operating costs and recognized deficiencies in the adequate  performance but were not identified as high risk. Examples we have  recently reported include the following projects:  \u25cf  The Decennial Response Integration System of the Census  Bureau, is intended to integrate paper, Internet, and telephone  responses. Its high development and operating costs are  expected to make up a large portion of the $1.8 billion program  to develop, test, and implement decennial census systems. In  March 2006,  we testified that the component agency has  established baseline requirements for the acquisition, but the  bureau has not yet validated them or implemented a process for  managing the requirements. We concluded that, until these and  other basic contract management activities are fully  implemented, this project faced increased risks that the system  would experience cost overruns, schedule delays, and  performance shortfalls.", "System\u2014an initiative managed by the Department of Commerce,  the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration\u2014is to converge two satellite programs into  a single satellite program capable of satisfying both civilian and  military requirements. In November 2005,  we reported that the  system was a troubled program because of technical problems on  critical sensors, escalating costs, poor management at multiple  levels, and the lack of a decision on how to proceed with the  program. Over the last several years, this system has experienced  continual cost increases to about $10 billion and schedule delays,  requiring difficult decisions about the program\u2019s direction and  capabilities. More recently, we testified  that the program is still  in trouble and that its future direction is not yet known. While the  program office has corrective actions under way, we concluded  that, as the project continues, it will be critical to ensure that the  management issues of the past are not repeated.   \u25cf  Rescue 21, is a planned coastal communications system of the  Department of Homeland Security. We recently reported  that  inadequacies in several areas contributed to Rescue 21 cost  overruns and schedule delays. These inadequacies occurred in  requirements management, project monitoring, risk management,  contractor cost and schedule estimation and delivery, and  executive level oversight.

In particular,  one agency stated that their list does not include all high risk  projects, only those that are the highest priority of the high risk  investments.

In addition,  to fully realize the potential benefits of using the Management  Watch List, we  recommended that OMB use the list as the basis for  selecting projects for follow-up, tracking follow-up activities and  analyze the prioritized list to develop governmentwide and agency  assessments of the progress and risks of IT investments, identifying  opportunities for continued improvement.  We also made similar  recommendations to the Director of OMB regarding high risk  projects.  Specifically, we recommended that OMB develop a single  aggregate list of high risk projects and their deficiencies and use  that list to report to Congress progress made in correcting high risk  problems, actions under way, and further actions that may be  needed.", "OMB generally disagreed with our recommendations for  strengthening the Management Watch List and high risk projects  processes. Specifically, OMB\u2019s Administrator of the Office of E- Government and Information Technology stated that the ultimate  responsibility to improve the accuracy and reliability of the exhibit  300s lies with the agencies. While this is true, OMB also has  statutory responsibility for providing IT guidance governmentwide,  especially when it involves an OMB-required budget document.  Regarding the consistent application of the high risk criteria, the  Administrator stated that some flexibility in the application of the  criteria is essential. While some flexibility may be appropriate, we  believe that these criteria should be more consistently applied so  that projects that clearly meet them are identified and provided  oversight.  The Administrator also disagreed with our  recommendations that an aggregated governmentwide Management  Watch List and high risk project list is necessary to perform  adequate oversight.  However, we continue to believe that these lists  are needed to facilitate OMB\u2019s ability to track progress.  Addressing  these recommendations would provide increased assurance that  poorly planned and performing projects are accurately identified  and more effectively provided oversight.  -------------------------------  In summary, the Management Watch List and High Risk processes  play important roles in improving the management of federal IT  investments by helping to identify poorly planned and performing  projects totaling at least $12 billion that require management  attention. However, the number of projects identified on both lists is  likely understated because the Management Watch List is derived  from budgetary documents that are not always accurate and reliable  and the high risk projects are not always identified consistently  using OMB criteria. In addition, we noted areas where oversight of  both sets of projects could be strengthened primarily by reporting  the results in the aggregate so that governmentwide analyses can be  performed, progress can be tracked, and Congress can be informed.
