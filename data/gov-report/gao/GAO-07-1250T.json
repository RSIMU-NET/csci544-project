In 1993, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's World Heritage Committee (WHC) added Everglades National Park (Park) to its List of World Heritage in Danger sites. In 2000, a strategy to restore the ecosystem was set; the effort was expected to take at least 40 years and cost $15.4 billion.

The completed and ongoing projects will provide improved water quality and water flow within the ecosystem and additional habitat for wildlife. According to restoration officials, significant progress has been made in acquiring land, constructing water quality projects, and restoring a natural water flow to the Kissimmee River--the headwater of the ecosystem. Many of the policies, strategies, and agreements required to guide the restoration in the future are also now in place. However, the 60 CERP projects, which are the most critical to the restoration's overall success, are among those that are currently being designed, planned, or have not yet started. Some of these projects are behind schedule by up to 6 years. Florida recently began expediting the design and construction of eight key projects, with the hope that they would immediately benefit the environment, enhance flood control, and increase water supply, thus providing further momentum to the restoration. In 2006, the WHC adopted several key benchmarks that if met would facilitate removal of the Everglades National Park from its List of World Heritage in Danger sites. As noted by WHC, achievement of these benchmarks was linked to the implementation of nine key restoration projects. However, only one of these projects has been completed, four are currently being implemented and four are currently being designed. Moreover, the benefits of these projects will not be available for many years because most of the projects are scheduled for completion between 2011 and 2035. There are no overarching sequencing criteria that restoration officials use when making implementation decisions for all 222 projects that make up the restoration effort. Instead, decisions for 162 projects are driven largely by the availability of funds. There are regulatory criteria to ensure that the goals and purposes of the 60 CERP projects are achieved in a cost effective manner. However, the 2005 sequencing plan developed for these projects is not consistent with the criteria because some of the data needed to fully apply these criteria were not available. Therefore, there is little assurance that the plan will be effective. GAO recommended that the agencies obtain the needed data and then comprehensively reassess the sequencing ofthe CERP projects. From fiscal years 1999 through 2006, the federal government contributed $2.3 billion and Florida contributed $4.8 billion, for a total of about $7.1 billion for the restoration. However, federal funding was about $1.4 billion short of the funds originally projected for this period. In addition, the total estimated costs for the restoration have increased by 28 percent--from $15.4 billion in 2000 to $19.7 billion in 2006 because of project scope changes, increased construction costs, and higher land costs. More importantly, these cost estimates do not represent the true costs for the overall restoration effort because they do not include all cost components for a number of projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to participate in your hearing on  protecting the Everglades. As you know, restoring the South Florida  ecosystem is a complex, long-term effort. This vast region, which is home  to a rapidly growing population of more than 6 million people and  supports a large agriculture-, tourism-, and recreation-based economy, also  encompasses one of the world\u2019s unique environmental resources\u2014the  Everglades. Recognizing the importance of the Everglades, in 1979, the  World Heritage Committee (WHC) of the United Nations Educational,  Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) included Everglades  National Park (Park) on its list of world cultural and natural heritage sites  of importance. However, over the past 100 years, engineering projects  designed to control floods and supply water to the residents of South  Florida have diverted water from the Everglades. This alteration of water  flow, coupled with agricultural and industrial activities and urbanization,  has jeopardized the ecosystem\u2019s health and reduced the Everglades to  about half of its original size. In light of the Everglades deteriorating  condition, in 1993 the WHC added the Park to its List of World Heritage in  Danger sites. These sites are determined to be facing serious and specific  threats and require major conservation efforts.", "In 1996, through the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, the  Congress formalized the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force,  an effort established by federal agencies in 1993 to stem the deterioration  of the ecosystem and restore the Everglades to a more natural state. The  Task Force was expanded to include state, local, and tribal representatives  and was charged with coordinating and facilitating efforts to restore the  ecosystem.  The restoration effort currently consists of 222 projects, which  include 60 key projects that comprise the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan (CERP), 28 projects that lay the foundation for the CERP  projects (that we refer to as CERP-related projects); and 134 projects that  are not directly related to CERP (that we refer to as non-CERP projects).  According to WHC and Park documents, nine of the 222 projects are key  to achieving a set of benchmarks adopted by the WHC in 2006 that, when  met, would lead to the removal of the Park from its list of sites in danger.", "Our testimony today focuses on the (1) status of restoration projects and  their expected benefits, (2) status of projects that are key to restoring the  health of Everglades National Park, (3) factors that influence the  sequencing of project implementation, and (4) amount of funding provided  to the restoration effort since 1999 and the extent to which costs have  increased. Our testimony is based primarily on our May 2007 report on the  status of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Initiative.  In addition,  at the request of the subcommittee, we reviewed publicly available WHC  decision documents regarding Everglades National Park\u2019s inclusion on the  List of World Heritage in Danger.  We conducted our work in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, we found the following:    Forty-three of the 222 projects that constitute the South Florida  ecosystem restoration effort have been completed, while the remaining  projects are currently being implemented or are in design, being  planned, or have not yet started. Many of the completed projects are  intended primarily to improve water quality in natural areas or to  acquire or improve tracts of land in order to preserve wildlife habitat.  The projects now being implemented also emphasize the restoration of  wildlife habitat by acquiring or improving land, as well as the  construction of key CERP-related projects that will improve water flow  to natural areas. The projects not yet implemented are largely CERP  projects that are crucial to realizing the restoration\u2019s overall goals, but  these projects are progressing slowly. Despite the slow progress,  agency officials report a number of achievements, such as finalizing  key CERP agreements and restoring a more natural water flow to the  Kissimmee River which is the headwater of the ecosystem. In addition,  because of the continuing delays in implementing critical CERP  projects, the state has begun expediting the design and construction of  some of these projects with its own resources. The state hopes that its  efforts will provide some immediate environmental, flood control and  water supply benefits and will help provide some impetus to the larger  CERP effort.", "Most of the nine projects that were identified by the WHC as being  critical to removing Everglades National Park from the list of world  heritage sites in danger have not yet been completed. Specifically, only  one project has been completed, four are currently being implemented,  and four are currently in the planning and design phase. Moreover, the  benefits from these projects may not be apparent for many more years.  For example, five of the projects have scheduled completion dates  from 2012 to 2035.", "There are no overarching criteria to ensure that the 222 projects that  make up the restoration effort are implemented in a sequence that  would ensure the achievement of environmental benefits as early as  possible and in the most cost effective manner. Instead,  implementation decisions for the 162 CERP-related and non-CERP  projects are largely driven by available funding. The 60 CERP  projects\u2014which are critical to successfully achieving the restoration\u2014 have sequencing criteria; however, when the agencies developed their  sequencing plan for CERP projects in 2005, they did not have key data  and other information to fully apply these criteria. Recently, the  agencies began revising the CERP project schedules and sequencing  plan, but they still do not have the key information needed to fully  apply the established criteria. As a result, there is little assurance that  the revised sequencing plan, when it is final, will lead to a CERP  project implementation plan that will provide restoration benefits as  early as possible and in the most cost-effective manner. We  recommended that the agencies obtain the information needed to fully  apply the required criteria and then comprehensively reassess its  sequencing decisions to ensure that the CERP projects have been  appropriately sequenced.", "Participating federal and state agencies provided a total of $7.1 billion  for the restoration effort from fiscal years 1999 through 2006. During  this period, the federal government contributed about $2.3 billion to the  restoration effort and Florida contributed about $4.8 billion. However,  the federal contribution to the effort has been about $1.4 billion less  than agencies expected during this period. Because the state has  contributed more than its share the overall shortfall for the restoration  effort has been about $1.2 billion. At the same time, the total projected  cost of the restoration effort has increased by 28 percent\u2014from $15.4  billion in 2000 to $19.7 billion in 2006. According to agency officials, the  overall cost increases are due to project scope changes, increased  construction costs, and higher land costs.

It extends from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes south of Orlando  to Lake Okeechobee, and continues south past the Florida Bay to the reefs  southwest of the Florida Keys. The ecosystem is in jeopardy today because  of past efforts that diverted water from the Everglades to control flooding  and to supply water for urban and agricultural development. The Central  and Southern Florida project, a large-scale water control project begun in  the late 1940s, constructed more than 1,700 miles of canals and levees and  over 200 water control structures that drain an average of 1.7 billion  gallons of water per day into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.  This construction resulted in insufficient water for the natural system and  for the growing population, along with degraded water quality. Today, the  Everglades has been reduced to half its original size and the ecosystem  continues to deteriorate because of the alteration of the water flow,  impacts of agricultural and industrial activities, and increasing  urbanization.", "In response to growing signs of ecosystem deterioration, federal agencies  established the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in 1993  to coordinate ongoing federal restoration activities. The Water Resources  Development Act of 1996 formalized the Task Force and expanded its  membership to include state, local, and tribal representatives, and charged  it with coordinating and facilitating efforts to restore the ecosystem.  The  Task Force, which is chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the  Interior, consists of 14 members representing 7 federal agencies, 2  American Indian tribes, and 5 state or local governments.", "To accomplish the restoration, the Task Force established the following  three goals:    Get the water right. The purpose of this goal is to deliver the right  amount of water, of the right quality, to the right places, at the right  times. However, restoring a more natural water flow to the ecosystem  while providing adequate water supplies and controlling floods will  require efforts to expand the ecosystem\u2019s freshwater supply and  improve the delivery of water to natural areas. Natural areas of the  ecosystem are made up of federal and state lands, and coastal waters,  estuaries, bays, and islands.", "Restore, preserve, and protect natural habitats and species. To restore  lost and altered habitats and recover the endangered or threatened  species native to these habitats, the federal and state governments will  have to acquire lands and reconnect natural habitats that have become  disconnected through growth and development, and halt the spread of  invasive species.", "Foster compatibility of the built and natural systems. To achieve the  long-term sustainability of the ecosystem, the restoration effort has the  goal of maintaining the quality of life in urban areas while ensuring that  (1) development practices limit habitat fragmentation and support  conservation and (2) traditional industries, such as agriculture, fishing,  and manufacturing, continue to be supported and do not damage the  ecosystem.", "The centerpiece for achieving the goal to get the water right is the  Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), approved by the  Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000).  CERP is one of the most ambitious restoration efforts the federal  government has ever undertaken. It currently encompasses 60 individual  projects that will be designed and implemented over approximately 40  years. These projects are intended to increase the water available for the  natural areas by capturing much of the water that is currently being  diverted, storing the water in many different reservoirs and storage wells,  and releasing it when it is needed. The cost of implementing CERP will be  shared equally between the federal government and the state of Florida  and will be carried out primarily by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the  Corps) and the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD),  which is the state authority that manages water resources for South  Florida. After the Corps and SFWMD complete the initial planning and  design for individual CERP projects, they must submit the proposed  projects to the Congress to obtain authorization and funding for  construction.", "In addition to the CERP projects, another 162 projects are also part of the  overall restoration effort. Twenty-eight of these projects, when completed,  will serve as the foundation for many of the CERP projects and are  intended to restore a more natural water flow to Everglades National Park  and improve water quality in the ecosystem. Nearly all of these \u201cCERP- related\u201d projects were already being designed or implemented by federal  and state agencies, such as the Department of the Interior and SFWMD, in  2000 when the Congress approved CERP. The remaining 134 projects  include a variety of efforts that will, among other things, expand wildlife  refuges, eradicate invasive species, and restore wildlife habitat, and are  being implemented by a number of federal, state, and tribal agencies, such  as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection (FDEP), and the Seminole Tribe of Florida.  Because these projects were not authorized as part of CERP and do not  serve as CERP\u2019s foundation, we refer to them as \u201cnon-CERP\u201d projects.", "Success in completing the restoration effort and achieving the expected  benefits for the ecosystem as quickly as possible and in the most cost- effective manner depends on the order, or sequencing, in which many of  the 222 projects will be designed and completed. Appropriate sequencing  is also important to ensure that interdependencies among restoration  projects are not ignored. For example, projects that will construct water  storage facilities and stormwater treatment areas need to be completed  before undertaking projects that remove levees and restore a more natural  water flow to the ecosystem.", "Recognizing the threats that Everglades National Park was facing, in 1993,  UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Committee (WHC) included the Park on its List  of World Heritage in Danger. This list includes cultural or natural  properties that are facing serious and specific threats such as those caused  by large-scale public or private projects or rapid urbanization; the  outbreak or the threat of an armed conflict; calamities and cataclysms; and  changes in water levels, floods, and tidal waves. The Park\u2019s inclusion on  the list resulted from five specific threats: (1) urban encroachment; (2)  agricultural fertilizer pollution; (3) mercury contamination of fish and  wildlife; (4) lowered water levels due to flood control measures; and (5)  damage from Hurricane Andrew, which struck the south Florida peninsula  in 1992 with winds exceeding 164 miles per hour. In 2006, WHC adopted a  set of benchmarks that, when met, would lead to the Park\u2019s removal from  the list.

Nine projects were completed before 2000 when the strategy to  restore the ecosystem was set.  These projects are expected to provide  benefits primarily in the area of habitat acquisition and improvement.  Thirty-four projects were completed between 2000 and 2006.

For  example, four of the seven CERP projects in implementation were  originally scheduled for completion between November 2002 and  September 2006, but instead will be completed up to 6 years behind their  original schedule because it has taken the Corps longer than originally  anticipated to design and obtain approval for these projects. Overall, 19 of  the 107 projects currently being implemented have expected completion  dates by 2010.

In contrast, the other  19 projects include 3 CERP-related and 16 non-CERP projects, which are  expected to be completed by or before 2013. Consequently, the full  environmental benefits for the South Florida ecosystem restoration that  the CERP projects were intended to provide will not be realized for  several decades. Several of the CERP projects in design, in planning, or  not yet begun, were originally planned for completion between December  2001 and December 2005, but instead will be completed from 2 to 6 years  behind their original schedule. According to agency officials CERP project  delays have occurred for the following reasons:  It took longer than expected to develop the appropriate policy,  guidance, and regulations that WRDA 2000 requires for the CERP  effort.", "Some delays were caused by the need to modify the conceptual design  of some projects to comply with the requirements of WRDA 2000\u2019s  savings clause. According to this clause, CERP projects cannot transfer  or eliminate existing sources of water unless an alternate source of  comparable quantity and quality is provided, and they cannot reduce  existing levels of flood protection.", "Progress was limited by the availability of less federal funding than   expected and a lack of congressional authorization for some of the  projects.", "The extensive modeling that accompanies the design and  implementation of each project in addition to the \u201ccumbersome\u201d  project review process may have also contributed to delays, as well as  stakeholder comment, dispute resolution, and consensus-building that  occurs at each stage of a project.", "Delays have occurred in completing the CERP-related Modified Water  Deliveries to Everglades National Park (Mod Waters) project, which is  a major building block for CERP.

This project is expected to  restore natural hydrologic conditions across 190,000 acres of habitat in  Everglades National Park and assist in the recovery of threatened and  endangered plants and wildlife.

This shortfall occurred primarily because CERP projects  did not receive the congressional authorization and appropriations that the  agencies had expected.

This increase represents nearly 31 percent of the  increase in the total estimated cost for the restoration. Agency officials  reported that costs have increased for the restoration effort primarily  because of inflation, increased land and construction costs, and changes in  the scope of work. Furthermore, the costs of restoring the South Florida  ecosystem are likely to continue to increase for the following reasons:     Estimated costs for some of the projects are not known or fully known  because they are still in the design and planning stage. For example,  the total costs for one project that we examined\u2014the Site 1  Impoundment project\u2014grew by almost $36 million; from about $46  million to about $81 million after the design phase was completed.
