Most of these beneficiaries were enrolled in TRICARE's managed care plan\u2014TRICARE Prime. However, about 2 million beneficiaries received care primarily from civilian providers through TRICARE's non-Prime options: TRICARE Standard and Extra. Effective January 1, 2018, these two options were eliminated and TRICARE Select was implemented. TRICARE Select has similar benefits for provider choice and obtaining care from civilian providers as TRICARE Standard and Extra, but includes access standards to ensure at least 85 percent of enrollees are covered by TRICARE's network of civilian providers, among other things.", "The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2008 included a provision for GAO to review results of DOD surveys of non-Prime beneficiaries and civilian providers.

DOD surveys indicate few changes in these non-Prime beneficiaries' satisfaction and access to care during the first year following the implementation of TRICARE Select, though GAO cannot directly attribute these differences to implementation due, in part, to other changes in the TRICARE program during the same time frame. Specifically, GAO found the following:", "There was no change in the percent of beneficiaries reporting positive ratings of their TRICARE health care and health plans\u201480 percent and 68 percent, respectively\u2014in the first year of TRICARE Select.", "There was an increase in the percent of beneficiaries reporting problems accessing specialty providers from 18 to 24 percent in the first year of TRICARE Select.

Prior to 2018, beneficiaries primarily had  a choice between three health plan options\u2014TRICARE Prime, TRICARE  Standard, and TRICARE Extra\u2014to obtain care either from military  hospitals and clinics, referred to as military treatment facilities, or from  civilian providers. Most beneficiaries were enrolled in TRICARE Prime,  TRICARE\u2019s managed care plan. However, about 2 million beneficiaries  received care primarily from civilian providers through TRICARE\u2019s non- Prime options\u2014TRICARE Standard and TRICARE Extra. The National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 terminated  TRICARE Standard and Extra beginning on January 1, 2018, and introduced TRICARE Select\u2014a new plan option for beneficiaries to obtain  care primarily from civilian providers.", "Since TRICARE\u2019s inception in 1995, beneficiaries have raised concerns  about difficulties finding civilian providers who will accept them as  patients. In response to these concerns about access to care, the NDAA  for Fiscal Year 2008 directed DOD to conduct a multi-year survey (2008- 2011) of non-Prime beneficiaries and a multi-year survey (2008-2011) of  civilian providers to determine the adequacy of beneficiaries\u2019 access to  health care providers. The multi-year surveys were continued for 2012- 2015, and most recently from 2017-2020. The NDAA for Fiscal Year  2008 also included a provision for us to conduct recurring reviews of a  series of issues related to the adequacy of non-Prime TRICARE  beneficiaries\u2019 access to care, including a review of information gleaned  from the beneficiary and civilian provider surveys, and to report on these  issues on a biannual basis.", "Since TRICARE Select\u2019s implementation, there also have been  complaints from some non-Prime beneficiaries that they did not know  about this new plan and that their ability to find certain types of  providers\u2014particularly mental health providers\u2014that accept TRICARE  has decreased. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 directed us to review  TRICARE Select beneficiary access and satisfaction, civilian provider  acceptance of new TRICARE patients, and how these have changed  since the implementation of TRICARE Select in 2018.", "This report addresses provisions in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008, as  amended, and the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 for us to report on the  adequacy of non-Prime TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to care.  Specifically, this report describes the extent to which  1.  non-Prime TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 ratings of TRICARE have changed  since the implementation of TRICARE Select;  2.  non-Prime TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 reported ability to find providers  and obtain appointments has changed since the implementation of  TRICARE Select; and  3.  civilian providers\u2019 reported acceptance of TRICARE patients has  changed since the implementation of TRICARE Select.", "To determine the extent to which non-Prime TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019  ratings of TRICARE changed since the implementation of TRICARE  Select, we obtained and analyzed 3 years of survey results from DOD\u2019s  TRICARE Survey of Beneficiaries for 2017-2020. Specifically, we  analyzed data related to beneficiaries\u2019 ratings of certain aspects of their  TRICARE experiences, such as their ratings of health care, health plan,  and primary, specialty, and mental health care providers. To compare  how these ratings had changed after the TRICARE Select  implementation, we compared combined data from the first 2 completed  years of the survey (2017 and 2018)\u2014which reflects beneficiary  experiences under TRICARE Standard and Extra\u2014to the most recent  completed year of the survey (2019)\u2014which reflects beneficiary  experiences in the first year under TRICARE Select.", "To determine the extent to which non-Prime TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019  reported access to care has changed since the implementation of  TRICARE Select, we analyzed data from DOD\u2019s beneficiary survey. We  analyzed these data to determine if non-Prime beneficiaries indicated that  they had problems finding providers that would accept TRICARE, that  they were able to obtain appointments as soon as they wanted, and how  quickly they were able to see providers. We compared the combined  data from the 2017 and 2018 beneficiary surveys to data from the 2019  survey to identify changes since the implementation of TRICARE  Select. We then compared these data between different geographic  location types and provider types, where applicable. In addition, we met  with DOD\u2019s two managed care support contractors to determine how they  were ensuring access to care for these beneficiaries.", "To determine the extent to which civilian providers\u2019 reported acceptance  of TRICARE patients has changed since the implementation of TRICARE  Select, we obtained and analyzed survey data from DOD\u2019s TRICARE  Survey of Providers for 2017-2020. Specifically, we analyzed the data to  determine whether civilian providers were accepting any new TRICARE  patients, and accounted for whether they were accepting any other new  patients. We compared the combined data from the 2017 and 2018  provider surveys to data from the 2019 survey to identify changes since  the implementation of TRICARE Select. We also compared these data  between different geographic location types, provider types, and whether  a provider was participating in the TRICARE network of providers.", "For each objective, we assessed the reliability of the data from DOD\u2019s  surveys by speaking with knowledgeable officials, conducting statistical  testing, and reviewing relevant documentation. We previously reported  that DOD\u2019s implementation of its 2008-2011 and 2012-2015 beneficiary  and civilian provider surveys generally addressed the requirements  outlined in the NDAA 2008. DOD made several minor revisions to the  methodologies of the 2017-2020 surveys, but we determined that the  surveys continue to address the requirements outlined in the NDAA 2008,  as amended. DOD calculated the response rates for its 2017-2019  beneficiary surveys and civilian provider surveys to be about 19 percent  and 29 percent, respectively. We verified that the surveys\u2019 results were  representative of the areas surveyed by reviewing DOD\u2019s nonresponse  analyses for these surveys and by interviewing DOD officials.", "Two factors affect our ability to directly attribute differences in survey  results to the implementation of TRICARE Select: 1) There were other  significant changes to the TRICARE health plans between 2017/2018 and  2019 survey years\u2014on January 1, 2018, the TRICARE regions were  restructured and a new contractor began managing the program in the  West region. 2) Each individual year of the DOD multi-year survey is not  nationally generalizable; the survey is designed so that 4 years of results  create a nationally representative sample and are analyzed collectively.  However, at the time of our analysis, only 1 year of data reflecting  beneficiary and provider experiences after the implementation of  TRICARE Select was available. As a result of these limitations, reported  differences from the 2017/2018 surveys to the 2019 survey may be due to  changes in the TRICARE program, differences in the geographic areas  sampled, or other factors rather than the implementation of TRICARE  Select. After consideration of these limitations, we determined that all  data used in this report were sufficiently reliable for our audit objectives\u2014 to describe changes in beneficiary experience and provider acceptance of  TRICARE patients before and after TRICARE Select was implemented on  January 1, 2018.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2019 to February 2020  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
