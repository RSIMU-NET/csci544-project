GAO was asked to review issues regarding the Federal Reserve's role in providing payment services.

GAO found the Federal Reserve had a detailed cost accounting system for capturing these costs that generally aligned with federal cost accounting standards. Although this system was evaluated and found effective by a public accounting firm in the 1980s, it has not undergone a detailed independent evaluation since then. In addition to the actual costs it incurs in providing services, the Federal Reserve also must include an allocation of imputed costs which takes into account the taxes that would have been paid and the return on capital that would have been provided if the services had been furnished by a private firm. Although its processes for simulating the imputed costs generally were reasonable, the Federal Reserve did not impute certain compliance costs private-sector firms can face\u2014such as for planning for recovery and orderly wind down after financial or other difficulties. Including additional simulated costs competitors can incur and obtaining periodic external evaluations of its cost accounting practices would provide greater assurance that the Federal Reserve fully includes appropriate costs when pricing its services.", "Since the mid-2000s, the effects of Federal Reserve participation in the payment services market have included lower prices for many customers; overall market share for competitors also increased. Although some competitors raised concerns about some Federal Reserve pricing practices, customers GAO interviewed generally were satisfied with its services and prices. The Federal Reserve also has a process for assessing its pricing and products to help ensure it is not unfairly leveraging any legal advantages. Since 2005, the Federal Reserve lowered prices for checks and smaller electronic payments while increasing prices for wire transfers. During this time, private-sector competitors' market share expanded overall. But the Federal Reserve's only competitor in small electronic payments and wire transfers told GAO that increased regulatory costs and competitive pressure from the Federal Reserve creates difficulties for the long-term viability of private-sector operators.", "Most market participants GAO interviewed were satisfied with how the Federal Reserve performed various regulatory and service provider roles in the payments system. Most of the 24 participants GAO interviewed had no concerns over how the Federal Reserve separated its supervisory activities from its payment services activities. The Federal Reserve also has begun collaborating with market participants to pursue improvements to the safety, speed, and efficiency of the payment system. Although some competitors said the Federal Reserve should reduce its payment services role, many participants supported having the Federal Reserve remain an active provider. Federal Reserve staff indicated that these activities provide the Federal Reserve with sufficient revenue to enable it to provide ubiquitous access at affordable prices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Federal Reserve consider ways to incorporate, where appropriate, additional costs faced by private-sector competitors in its simulated cost recoveries and periodically obtain an external audit that tests the accuracy of the methods it uses to capture and simulate its costs.

The Board of  Governors (Board) and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve) play multiple roles in the payments  system, including functioning as the nation\u2019s central bank, supervising  financial institutions, and providing payment services to market  participants. The Reserve Banks offer a range of payment services to  depository institutions and the federal government, including collecting  checks; electronically transferring funds; issuing, transferring, and  redeeming U.S. government securities; distributing and receiving  currency and coin; and maintaining accounts for reserve and clearing  balances. The Board oversees the operations of the Reserve Banks and  serves as a regulator of certain aspects of payment services in the United  States. As part of its oversight, the Board issues regulations that apply to  the payment services activities of the Reserve Banks and the private- sector entities that compete with them. Where these roles potentially  overlap or conflict, the Federal Reserve faces the challenge of managing  or separating the roles in ways that help ensure it fulfills each role without  exerting undue influence or giving itself an advantage at the expense of  the banking industry or its private-sector competitors in providing payment  services.", "In 2000, we reviewed the potential conflicts of interest posed by the  Federal Reserve\u2019s operation of a payment system that competes with  private-sector systems operated and owned by institutions that the  Federal Reserve also supervises. We found no evidence to suggest that  the Federal Reserve had not adequately separated its multiple roles in  the payments system. However, the overall U.S. payments system has  evolved since our 2000 report. Technology has dramatically changed  many aspects of the payments process, notably in the transition from the  use and settlement of paper checks to electronic payments. In addition,  the Federal Reserve has begun publicly exploring how the United States  can develop a near real-time payment system to facilitate payments  between individuals and businesses as several other countries are  moving to. When Congress mandated that the Reserve Banks offer  payment services to nonmember depository institutions on terms  comparable to those for member banks, it also required that the Banks  publish prices for these services that were established over the long run  on the basis of all the direct and indirect costs actually incurred in  providing the services, including certain imputed costs that would have  been incurred if the services had been furnished by a private firm.", "You asked us to update our 2000 report and in particular, review the  Federal Reserve\u2019s management of its potential conflicts of interest in the  U.S. payments system, including issues relating to the costs and pricing  of its services. This report examines (1) how effectively the Federal  Reserve captures and recovers its payment services costs; (2) the effect  of the Federal Reserve\u2019s practices on competition in the payment  services market; (3) how the Federal Reserve mitigates the inherent  conflicts posed by its various roles in the payments system; and (4)  market participant viewpoints on the future role of the Federal Reserve in  the payments system. This report focuses on three payment system  products offered by the Federal Reserve\u2014check clearing, electronic  payments known as Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments, and  wire transfer payments\u2014because these are the services in which the  Federal Reserve primarily competes with private-sector entities.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed data on the reported costs and  revenues of Federal Reserve payment services from 1996 to 2015 and  how pricing and fee structures for the services had changed over this  period. We took steps to assess the reliability of these data and  determined they were sufficiently reliable for our analysis. Although we  analyzed the processes by which the Federal Reserve accounts for its  reported costs and revenues, we did not include detailed testing of the  Federal Reserve\u2019s cost accounting controls related to its priced services  activities. We reviewed relevant legislation and Federal Reserve policies,  regulations, and guidance relevant to payment services activities. We  reviewed audits that external and internal audit organizations performed  of Federal Reserve payment system costs and activities. We also  reviewed the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies that outline the criteria it would  consider before offering a new payment service. We interviewed Board  and Reserve Bank staff and 34 market participants, including financial  trade associations whose members participate in payment systems and  issue rules governing payment system activities; payment services  providers, including those that compete with the Federal Reserve; and  banks and credit unions that were end users of payments systems  services from other private-sector providers and the Federal Reserve.  The sample of banks and the sample of credit unions we interviewed  were both composed of a nonprobability stratified sample based on tiers  by asset size, including interviewing the five largest banks and randomly  selecting a number of banks from the large, mid-sized, and smaller tiered  banks. For credit unions we randomly selected institutions from larger and  from smaller credit unions. We also interviewed both financial institution  and nonbank entities that provided competing payments services  randomly selected within type of institution.

One of the major impetuses for the creation of the Federal Reserve was  to reduce the potential for disruptions in payments that periodically  occurred in the United States. During a financial crisis in 1907 stemming  from losses arising from the San Francisco fire and the failure of the  Knickerbocker Trust in New York City, payments were largely suspended  throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses, which  served as centralized locations for banks to exchange checks for clearing,  refused to clear checks drawn on certain banks. These refusals led to  liquidity problems in the banking sector and the failure of otherwise  solvent banks, which exacerbated the impact of the crisis on businesses  and individuals.", "With the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, Congress established the  Federal Reserve in 1913 in part as a response to these events. The  Federal Reserve Act also directed the Federal Reserve to supply  currency in the quantities demanded by the public and gave it the  authority to establish a national check-clearing system. Previously, some  paying banks (on which checks had been drawn) had refused to pay the  full amount of checks (nonpar collection) and some had been charging  other fees to the banks presenting checks to be paid. To avoid paying  these presentment fees, many presenting banks routed checks to banks  that were not charged presentment fees by paying banks. This circuitous  routing resulted in extensive delays and inefficiencies in the check- collection system. In 1917, Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act  to prohibit banks from charging the Reserve Banks presentment fees and  to authorize nonmember banks as well as member banks to collect  checks through the Federal Reserve System.", "As the nation\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve manages U.S.  monetary policy, supervises certain participants in the banking system,  and serves as the lender of last resort. The Federal Reserve System  consists of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., and 12 Reserve  Banks with 24 branches located in 12 districts across the nation. The  Board is a federal agency, and the Reserve Banks are federally chartered  and organized like private corporations each with a board of directors and  with their shares owned by their member banks. The Board is responsible  for maintaining the stability of financial markets, supervising banks that  are members of the Federal Reserve and bank and savings and loan  holding companies, and overseeing the operations of the Reserve Banks.", "The Board has delegated some of these responsibilities to the Reserve  Banks, which also provide payment services to depository institutions and  government agencies. As a result, the Federal Reserve has dual roles as  both payment systems operator and as a regulator of payment system  participants.", "The role of the Federal Reserve Banks as a provider of several payment  services in the United States contrasts with that of the central banks of  other countries. According to a study by the Bank for International  Settlements, which provides services to other central banks, of the 13  foreign jurisdictions examined, central banks in 11 operated large value  payment transfer systems\u2014as the Reserve Banks do\u2014but only 2 central  banks (those in Belgium and Germany)\u2014also operated check-clearing  and electronic retail payment networks.", "To improve the functioning of check services, Congress instituted a par- value (face value) check collection service to simplify the check-clearing  process in the Federal Reserve Act, and gave the Federal Reserve  operational (through the Reserve Banks) and regulatory (through the  Board) roles in check collection. Interbank checks are cleared and settled  through a check-collection process that includes presentment and final  settlement. Presentment occurs when checks are delivered by the bank  that received them\u2014which currently almost exclusively involves  transmission of electronic images\u2014to paying banks for payment. The  checks may be sent either directly to the paying bank or through another  entity\u2014either another bank, a check clearinghouse, or a correspondent  bank\u2014that would ultimately deliver them to the paying banks (see fig. 1).  The paying banks then decide to honor or return the checks. Settlement  ultimately occurs when collecting banks are credited and paying banks  debited, usually through accounts held at a Reserve Bank or at  correspondent banks that provide check clearing and other services for  other institutions. As part of its role in regulating check collection, the  Federal Reserve Board promulgated regulations that govern various  aspects of these processes, including Regulation CC (which covers how  quickly banks must make funds from checks and other deposits available  for withdrawal and governs aspects of interbank check collection and  return), and Regulation J (which covers how institutions can collect and  return checks and other items through the Reserve Banks).", "To facilitate electronic check processing, some banks can create an  electronic image of a paper check at their branches, while others  transport the paper to centralized locations where the paper is imaged.  After imaging, an image cash letter is assembled and sent directly to a  paying bank, an intermediary bank, or to a collecting bank (such as a  Reserve Bank or a correspondent bank) or to an image exchange  processor for eventual presentment to the paying bank. The Reserve  Banks offer imaged check products\u2014FedForward, FedReceipt, and  FedReturn\u2014for a fee to banks that use its check collection services to  present checks for payment at other institutions. Similarly, other entities  that offer check-clearing services charge fees or use other mechanisms  to obtain compensation for such services, or institutions may not charge  each other when directly exchanging images.", "The Fedwire Funds Service (Fedwire), the Federal Reserve\u2019s wire  payments service, began in 1918 as a funds transfer service and initially  used Western Union\u2019s telegraph lines to transmit payments. The current  Fedwire network provides a real-time gross settlement system in which  about 6,000 participants can initiate electronic funds transfers that are  immediate, final, and irrevocable. Depository institutions and others that  maintain an account with a Reserve Bank can use the service to send  payments directly to, or receive payments from, other participants.  Depository institutions also can use a correspondent relationship with a  Fedwire participant to make or receive transfers indirectly through the  system. Participants use Fedwire to handle time-critical payments (such  as settlement of interbank purchases, sales of federal funds, securities  transactions, real estate transactions, or disbursement or repayment of  large loans). The U.S. Department of the Treasury, other federal  agencies, and government-sponsored enterprises also use Fedwire to  disburse and collect funds. A private-sector entity, The Clearing House  Payments Company L.L.C. (TCH), operates a competing wire transfer  service\u2014the Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS)\u2014that is  used for similar purposes as Fedwire. Figure 2 shows how a typical wire  transfer payment occurs.", "In response to concerns over high volumes of paper checks in the  payments system, the Federal Reserve worked with the private sector in  the 1970s to develop an electronic system to exchange payments known  as Automated Clearing House (ACH). These payments are often used for  small or recurring transactions, such as direct deposit of payrolls or  payment of utility, mortgage, or other bills. The Reserve Banks\u2019 Retail  Payments Office operates an ACH payment network (called FedACH). By  agreement (in the form of an operating circular), ACH transactions are  conducted under rules and operating guidelines developed by a nonprofit  banking trade association, NACHA (formerly the National Automated  Clearing House Association). With limited exceptions, Federal Reserve  staff indicated that the Reserve Banks incorporate the association\u2019s rules  by reference in their ACH operating circulars, which represents the  agreement between a Reserve Bank and its customers on the terms and  conditions of the FedACH services. TCH also operates its own ACH  network\u2014the Electronic Payments Network\u2014through which its members  can transmit and receive ACH payments to or from the customers of their  institutions. The Federal Reserve and TCH exchange ACH payments  originated by their customer institutions that are bound for institutions  using the other\u2019s ACH network. Both the sending and the receiving  institutions typically are charged fees for ACH transactions. Figure 3  illustrates a typical ACH payment.", "In 1980, Congress enacted changes that expanded the role of the  Federal Reserve in the payments system. The Monetary Control Act of  1980 (Monetary Control Act) extended the Federal Reserve\u2019s reserve  requirements to all depository institutions, not just member banks of the  Federal Reserve. The act also allowed the Reserve Banks to offer  payment services to all depository institutions that had previously been  available at no cost to their members. Part of the legislative history of the  Monetary Control Act indicates that since the act required nonmember  institutions to meet reserve requirements, it was reasonable to also  provide such institutions with access to Reserve Bank payment  services. At this time, the act required the Federal Reserve to begin  charging all institutions for such services.", "Because this change placed the Reserve Banks and private-sector  providers of payment services in competition with each other, the act  included certain requirements to encourage competition between the  Reserve Banks and private-sector providers to ensure provision of  payment services at an adequate level nationwide. The Monetary Control  Act required the Board to establish a fee schedule for Reserve Bank  payment services, under which all services are required to be priced  explicitly. The act also required that over the long run, fees be established  on the basis of all direct and indirect costs actually incurred in providing  the priced services, including imputed costs that would have been  incurred by a private-sector provider, giving due regard to competitive  factors and the provision of an adequate level of such services  nationwide. In describing the policies adopted to implement the  requirements of the Monetary Control Act, the Board stated that the act\u2019s  legislative history indicated Congress sought to encourage competition to  ensure that these services would be adequately available nationwide and  at the lowest cost to society. According to these Board policies, the  Reserve Banks provide payment services to promote the integrity and  efficiency of the payments mechanism and ensure that payment services  are provided to all depository institutions on an equitable basis and in an  environment of competitive fairness.", "In participating in the payments system, the Federal Reserve has taken  various actions to make the system more efficient. For example, in the  1950s the Federal Reserve contributed to the adoption of magnetic ink  character recognition, which allowed routing and other processing  information to be printed in machine-readable ink on the bottom of the  check\u2019s face, which helped automate check processing. As discussed  earlier, the Federal Reserve worked with the private sector to develop the  ACH system in the 1970s. Initially, ACH volumes were low with most  volume growth attributed to government-initiated transactions, because  high startup costs made private-sector banks reluctant to invest in and  use the network. For a few years following the implementation of the  Monetary Control Act, the Federal Reserve subsidized the ACH network,  which helped the network obtain sufficient volume to become successful.  To improve the clearing of checks, Congress passed the Check Clearing  for the 21st Century Act (Check 21), which became effective October 28,  2004, which was legislation supported by the Federal Reserve. Check  21 facilitates check truncation, which is the substitution of the original  physical check with a legal equivalent (called a substitute check).  According to the trade association that establishes rules for exchanging  check images, checks are generally processed as images.", "In 1998, a committee of senior Federal Reserve executives examined  whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s participation in the payments system  remained justified in light of changes occurring in the financial services  and technology sectors at the time. This committee\u2019s report addressed  the results of its review of the role the Federal Reserve played in the use  of checks and ACH payments in the retail payments system, including  considering whether any changes in its role could affect the integrity,  efficiency, and accessibility of this system. After examining check- clearing activities, the committee concluded that Reserve Banks\u2019  withdrawal from the check collection market would disrupt the system in  the short-run, with little promise of substantial benefit over the longer run.  The committee noted that withdrawing from check clearing could increase  check collection prices to small and remote depository institutions and  could disrupt the migration from paper to electronic payments. Similarly,  the report concluded that having the Reserve Banks remain in the ACH  market would be more conducive to the future efficiency and migration to  electronic payments, including joint efforts with industry participants to  spur innovation in products and increase ACH usage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Entities Involved in the Payments System", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the Reserve Banks, other entities offer payment system  services to financial institutions. To process check payments, financial  institutions can set up direct, individual connections with other financial  institutions with which they can exchange check images for clearing of  checks drawn on the accounts of their respective customers. Institutions  also can submit their checks to clearinghouses that process and transmit  check image files for clearing to the respective clearinghouse members  on which the checks are drawn. For example, in addition to operating the  only other ACH and wire transfer networks that compete with the offerings  of the Federal Reserve, TCH also acts as a clearinghouse for check  images. Other competitors that provide checking services include  correspondent banks, bankers\u2019 banks, and corporate credit unions. The  financial institution customers of these entities will send or receive their  checks, ACH payments, or wire transfers using these entities\u2019 systems,  which may pass them to other entities, including individual institutions,  TCH, or the Reserve Banks, for processing.

Federal Reserve  staff noted that although check volumes have declined, the dollar value of  payments made by checks\u2014estimated by the checking industry  association to exceed $20 trillion in 2013\u2014indicates that checks are still  an important payment method in the United States because businesses  continue to use them to make payments to other businesses.", "The growth in ACH payments encompassed its increased use for making  various types of payments, including for payroll deposits and automatic  bill payments, as well as increased use by consumers to make one-time  payments over the Internet.

However, as a percentage of total payment  services assets, the PSAF increased slightly from 1.3 percent to 1.5  percent during this period. Federal Reserve staff said that they use  publicly available information to calculate the imputed elements of their  PSAF methodology and publish the methodology and its results annually  in the Federal Register. Additionally, all proposed and finalized changes  to the PSAF methodology, as well as a summary of the public comments  on these changes, are published in the Federal Register and posted to  the Federal Reserve\u2019s website. Federal Reserve staff indicated that they  follow this approach to help ensure that the PSAF methodology is  transparent and that its results can be more easily verified by the private  sector.", "As part of its attempts to improve its accuracy and conform the PSAF to  changes in the payment system market, Federal Reserve staff noted that  the Board has made numerous changes to the methodology over the  years. The Federal Reserve staff said that they consider changes to the  PSAF methodology when conditions in the marketplace or industry  suggest that practices in the markets or other changes have occurred that  should be considered in the methodology for imputing costs. They said  that in those situations they evaluate different options to improve the  methodology and request public comments on the strongest options  before adopting a new approach. We reviewed the changes made  between 1980 and 2014 and found that the Federal Reserve had publicly  sought comment on significant changes to its PSAF methodology 10  times during this period. These include changes to how the return on  equity is calculated and to the peer group used to approximate the levels  of debt and equity in the model. See appendix III for further details on  changes to the PSAF methodology over time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Concerns over Whether All Relevant Costs Are Included in the PSAF", "paragraphs": ["Private-sector market participants have criticized the Federal Reserve for  not accounting for or imputing into the PSAF certain regulatory  compliance costs that private-sector providers incur. These costs include  those associated with federal antimoney-laundering requirements,  increased audit and risk management, overseeing the risks posed by  service vendors, and integrated planning for recovery and wind down of  operations. The Federal Reserve has said that it accounts for some of  these costs as actual expenses incurred by the Reserve Banks, and that  it has been considering how the other costs might be incorporated into  the PSAF.", "In May 2015, the Electronic Check Clearing House Organization  (ECCHO) submitted a letter to the Board expressing concerns over the  Federal Reserve\u2019s failure to account for certain costs being borne by  private-sector check services providers and urged it to conduct a  complete (de novo) competitive impact analysis of the Reserve Banks\u2019  check image services. ECCHO specifically noted that many of its  members that provide check processing services to other institutions  incur costs associated with compliance with federal antimoney-laundering  requirements. In a written response sent in December 2015, the Chair of  the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Affairs  said that if private-sector banks incur material antimoney-laundering  compliance costs related to their check collection services that the  Reserve Banks do not, it might be appropriate for Reserve Banks to  impute such costs as part of the PSAF. However, Federal Reserve staff  said that correspondent banks have informed them that determining the  proportion of antimoney-laundering costs that relate to check services  specifically would be difficult, because they do not allocate compliance  costs directly to this service. Federal Reserve officials said in their  response to ECCHO that, while they did not see the need for the  complete competitive impact analysis that ECCHO requested, they  continue to consider how they could identify ways to incorporate these  costs into the PSAF methodology if they are material. However, until the  Federal Reserve determines and implements such costs into the PSAF,  the imputed costs will not reflect these actual expenses incurred by many  of the Federal Reserve\u2019s competitors.", "Additionally, enhanced regulatory standards, including those that apply to  entities designated as systemically important financial market utilities,  have raised regulatory compliance costs for the Federal Reserve\u2019s key  competitor. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act, entities engaged in payment, clearing, or settlement  activity must be designated as systemically important by the Financial  Stability Oversight Council if the Council determines that the failure of or a  disruption to the functioning of the entity could create, or increase, the risk  of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial  institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the U.S.  financial system. Such entities then become subject to heightened  prudential and supervisory provisions intended to promote robust risk  management and safety and soundness. The act required the Federal  Reserve to issue rules to prescribe risk-management standards for those  financial market utilities designated as systemically significant for which  the Board is the supervisory agency. In November 2014, the Board  issued amendments to Regulation HH, based on the international risk- management standards for payment services that are systemically  important developed by the Committee on Payment and Settlement  Systems (CPSS) and the Technical Committee of the International  Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). Regulation HH  requires designated financial market utilities to implement rules,  procedures, or operations designed to ensure that the financial market  utility meets or exceeds various standards, including, among others,  those relating to its governance, risk management and credit risk. For  example, the entity must have an integrated plan for its recovery and  orderly wind down, maintain unencumbered liquid financial assets  sufficient to cover the greater of the cost to implement its recovery and  orderly wind-down plans and 6 months of current operating expenses,  and hold equity greater than or equal to the amount of unencumbered  liquid financial assets required.", "Representatives from TCH told us that complying with these standards  has increased their regulatory compliance costs and that they question  the extent to which the Federal Reserve has appropriately incorporated  these costs into the PSAF. TCH estimated that their efforts to comply  with these requirements have increased their operating costs by 10  percent, including additional costs associated with their Risk Office that  conducts activities related to information technology security, risk  management, liquidity risk and orderly recovery and wind-down planning,  among other things. They also said that they incur greater costs  associated with responding to their customers\u2019 due diligence reviews  regarding vendor management, an element of the federal bank  examination process in which federal bank examiners evaluate a financial  institution\u2019s third-party relationships as a component of their overall risk- management processes.", "The Federal Reserve has incorporated some, but not all, of these  expenses into the imputed costs it calculates as part of the PSAF.  Federal Reserve staff have said that although the Reserve Banks\u2019  payment services are not always subject to the same regulatory regime  as similar services provided by the private sector, the Reserve Banks are  subject to Board supervision and that these oversight costs are already  included in the PSAF as Board expenses and are being recovered  through revenue from the services. Additionally, Federal Reserve staff  told us that the Reserve Banks have devoted increased resources to  audit and risk management functions and that costs associated with these  functions\u2014including additional personnel\u2014are captured in PACS as  internal audit costs at the product line level. Federal Reserve staff said  that the amount of these costs had increased in recent years as they  hired additional staff to perform expanded oversight activities.  Additionally, in order to foster competition with private-sector financial  market utilities that are required to hold liquid net assets funded by equity  to manage general business risk, the Federal Reserve Board requires the  Fedwire Funds service to impute equity held as liquid financial assets  equal to 6 months of estimated current operating expenses. To meet this  requirement the Fedwire Funds service imputed an additional $2.7 million  in equity above the $51.1 million it imputed to meet other capital  requirements. This additional imputed equity, at the equity financing rate  in the 2016 PSAF, resulted in the Federal Reserve having to recover  additional imputed financing costs of $265,000. Federal Reserve staff  also clarified that, as a service provider of last resort, the Fedwire Funds  Service is subject to unique requirements that do not apply to CHIPS. For  example, the staff noted, Reserve Banks have incurred (and continue to  incur) substantial expenses in recent years to develop, implement, and  test manual procedures for settling systemically important transactions in  the unlikely event that the Fedwire Funds Service automated systems are  not available. Additionally, Federal Reserve staff told us that they also  receive inquiries from customers conducting vendor management due  diligence. Federal bank examiners told us that they have not noticed any  differences in how either the Reserve Banks or TCH respond to questions  from financial institutions on their vendor relationship and that in the  course of an examination they would look at an institution\u2019s relationship  with the Federal Reserve the same way as they would view an  institution\u2019s relationship with TCH.", "However, the Federal Reserve has not incurred or imputed costs related  to a plan for recovery and orderly wind down that is required of CHIPS. In  a 2014 request for comment on revisions to its Policy on Payment System  Risk, the Board noted that Fedwire services do not face business risk that  would cause the service to wind down in a disorderly manner and disrupt  the stability of the financial system because the Federal Reserve, as the  central bank, would support a recovery or orderly wind down of the  service, as appropriate, to meet public policy objectives. As a result,  Federal Reserve staff said, the Board currently does not require the  Fedwire service to develop recovery or orderly wind-down plans or to  estimate or impute the costs of developing those plans. However,  estimating what these costs would be for its own operations if it were a  private firm and including them in its PSAF methodology would enable the  Federal Reserve to more completely impute costs that it would have  incurred as a private firm in order to meet its cost recovery goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasonableness of Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, the Monetary Control Act states that the Federal  Reserve must impute certain costs for its payment services that would  have been incurred if a private firm had provided them. Additionally, the  act states that the Federal Reserve\u2019s pricing principles shall give due  regard to competitive factors and the provision of an adequate level of  services nationwide. However, the act does not specify exactly how the  Federal Reserve should impute these costs and various ways could  reasonably exist to do so. The Federal Reserve has stated that there is  no perfect private-sector proxy for imputing these costs and that the  PSAF methodology represents a reasonable approximation of the costs,  though some market participants have criticized the methodology.", "Nevertheless, some market participants have questioned the  appropriateness of the Federal Reserve\u2019s current PSAF methodology.  Representatives from TCH said that the PSAF should be calculated using  a peer group comprising payments-processing companies. They noted  that in 2015 their company\u2019s equity capital was materially larger than the  imputed equity levels calculated by the Federal Reserve. However,  neither the Board\u2019s rule on risk management standards for systemically  important financial market utilities that it regulates nor the international  framework for addressing risks of financial market utilities on which it was  based dictates any specific equity requirements other than to hold at least  6 months of current operating expenses funded by equity for liquidity  reasons and equity greater than or equal to the amount of liquid net  assets required.", "Some have argued that the Federal Reserve\u2019s current approach for  imputing debt and equity into the PSAF\u2014in which it uses financial data  from all U.S. publicly traded firms in Standard and Poor\u2019s Compustat  database\u2014does not sufficiently reflect the financial activities that its  payment services represent. Furthermore, the U.S. publicly traded firm  market includes many firms that are engaged in industries outside of  payment services that may be even less similar to the Federal Reserve  than is TCH. However, Federal Reserve staff said that basing the imputed  debt and equity levels on a peer group consisting of firms providing  payment services, such as large bank holding companies, is not optimal  because such firms engage in many different lines of business and have  risk profiles dissimilar to the payment services provided by the Reserve  Banks. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has noted that a methodology  based on all publicly traded firms decreases the risk of price volatility that  could result from changes in the characteristics or financial results of a  limited peer group. If the Federal Reserve\u2019s product pricing had to vary  widely each year because of large variability in the PSAF, such volatility  could be disruptive to its customers and the payment systems market.", "Furthermore, the PSAF methodology uses data in the public domain to  help ensure that the PSAF calculation is replicable and transparent.  Federal Reserve staff noted that the Monetary Control Act states that all  Reserve Bank services shall be priced explicitly, which the Board  interprets as being fully transparent in their pricing. Many private-sector  payment services providers, including TCH, are not publicly traded and  do not provide publicly available financial information, which, if used to  calculate the PSAF, could hamper the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of  maintaining the transparency and replicability of its methodology.  Transparency can be an important goal, and our 2000 report included  recommendations that the Federal Reserve implemented to increase the  transparency and involvement of market participants in its pricing  activities.", "As noted, the Federal Reserve has attempted to use different  methodologies for calculating the PSAF, including previously using the  financial data from a peer group of bank holding companies to calculate  the PSAF\u2019s target return on equity. Although the Federal Reserve no  longer bases the PSAF methodology\u2019s peer group on the top 50 bank  holding companies, the resulting equity financing rates have remained  similar. We reviewed the return on equities for the top 50 bank holding  companies from 2006 through 2015, and found that the average pre-tax  return on equity was 10.5 percent for these bank holding companies,  which is similar to the 10.1 percent pre-tax return on equity used in the  Federal Reserve\u2019s 2015 PSAF calculation.", "Because the PSAF is a proxy for private-sector costs and profit  dependent on a range of variables, and because of the Reserve Banks\u2019  unique structure and operation and the lack of perfectly comparable  private-sector competitors, the calculation of the PSAF amount involves  trade-offs and assumptions that could be reasonably debated. For  example, assumptions on how to impute the return on equity in the  methodology can dramatically affect the overall figure. However, as  previously noted, changing the way the equity is imputed to include  nonpublic financial information might come at the cost of transparency  and replicability of the methodology.", "While the Federal Reserve\u2019s approach seems reasonable, any single  PSAF figure calculation could be reasonably criticized based on the  assumptions made and trade-offs chosen. Likewise, different trade-offs  and assumptions could result in higher or lower PSAF figures. We asked  three finance experts to review the Federal Reserve\u2019s PSAF  methodology. All three experts said that the methodology and the  assumptions used to make the calculations seemed reasonable. One  finance professor said that specific assumptions on rates that the Federal  Reserve uses were standard assumptions to use, though there may be  some disagreement within each one, which could be expected. Another  finance professor said that the Federal Reserve\u2019s approach appears to be  reasonable without being unnecessarily complex, and added that any  alternative models might add more complexity for little benefit.", "We also reviewed the methodology and the changes made from 2005  through 2014 and determined that many of the assumptions used rely on  professional judgments and involve trade-offs between precision and  ease of calculation. For example, the Federal Reserve simplified its  calculation for computing the methodology\u2019s equity financing rate in 2005.  Previously, the methodology averaged the results of three separate  financing models based on (1) the return on equity investors would  demand based on the risk in the market, (2) the average 5-year ratio of  net income-to-book value of equity among a peer group of bank holding  companies, and (3) a forward-looking approach estimating the discounted  present value of all future cash flows. Ultimately, the Board changed the  methodology to use only the model based on the expected rate of return  on equity that investors would demand based on the risk in the market,  because they considered this approach to be a well-known, generally  accepted, and theoretically sound model that is simpler and more  transparent than other approaches. In 2005, this change reduced the  PSAF from the $161 million it would have been under the three-model  approach, to $90.8 million under the simplified one-model approach.  However, annual fluctuations in peer group earnings or in projected cash  flows could have made the PSAF lower under the three-model approach  than under the one-model approach in a given year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Reserve Generally Has Achieved Its Cost Recovery Goals", "paragraphs": ["According to Federal Reserve reporting on cost recovery rates from 1996  through 2015, the Reserve Banks have recovered or come close to  recovering all actual and imputed costs for all of their payment services.  As noted previously, the Monetary Control Act requires fees to be  established, over the long run, on the basis of the costs actually incurred,  and an allocation of the imputed costs that would have been incurred by a  private-sector provider. To meet this mandate, the Board has developed  an internal goal of recovering 100 percent of its costs for all its explicitly  priced payment services over a 10-year period. Federal Reserve staff told  us that the Monetary Control Act did not provide a specific definition of  \u201cover the long run,\u201d but they used 10 years for their targeted recovery  time frame.", "The Federal Reserve annually reports how well it has met its 100 percent  recovery goal over 10-year periods. As shown in figure 5, in the rolling 10- year periods that cover 1996-2015, the Federal Reserve achieved at least  a 97.9 percent recovery for every 10-year period during this span.  However, a relatively low-cost recovery rate of 85.1 percent in 2003  lowered the 10-year rates for eight of the periods. In 2003, the Federal  Reserve\u2019s check services had a net loss of more than $65 million that the  Federal Reserve attributed to significant one-time costs related to  consolidation activities, a decline in volumes, and greater use of products  with lower margins. The significant loss in that one year resulted in the  Federal Reserve falling short in achieving its 100-percent cost recovery  goal in each of the ten periods that included 2003 in the calculations. The  Federal Reserve\u2019s cost recovery rates in the three most recent periods\u2014 none of which include the 2003 cost recovery figures\u2014exceeded 100  percent.", "Although the Federal Reserve Banks generally have come close to  recovering all of their actual and imputed costs for their payment services  in aggregate, the extent to which individual payment services recovered  their costs varied more widely from year to year (see table 1). Cost  recovery variations between products in a given year may be due to  circumstances specific to those products. For example, in 2014, the  Federal Reserve Banks\u2019 ACH service recovered 86.7 percent of its costs.  The lower rate was due to a nearly $32 million charge incurred that year  associated with a multiyear technology initiative that was to have  modernized a processing platform but had been suspended that year. In  contrast, in the same year, greater-than-expected check volume resulted  in cost recoveries of more than 115 percent for that product line, which  helped the Federal Reserve Banks achieve their overall cost recovery  goals for that year and in the 10-year periods that included 2013 and  2014.", "From 2005 to 2014, annual revenues and expenses across the Federal  Reserve Banks\u2019 payment service products varied. Since 2005, the total  revenue the Federal Reserve Banks earned from providing check, ACH,  and wire transfer services declined by nearly 54 percent, from about $881  million in 2005 to $409 million in 2014 (a decline of nearly $1.1 billion to  $414 million, almost 61 percent in 2015 dollars). This decline was largely  due to a steep reduction in the expenses and imputed costs related to the  Federal Reserve Banks\u2019 check services, which corresponded with the  transition to digital check images and the decline in commercial check  transactions. From 2005 to 2014, the number of checks the Federal  Reserve Banks processed fell from 12.2 billion to 5.7 billion. The decline  in expenses correspondingly reduced the need for the Federal Reserve  Banks to obtain as much revenue from this product line (that is, to  achieve cost recovery). Check service revenue fell from over $740 million  in 2005 to almost $175 million in 2014, which was a decline from $888  million to nearly $177 million in 2015 dollars (see fig. 6). In contrast, total  revenues for ACH and Fedwire increased from a combined total of about  $140 million in 2005 to over $234 million in 2014. In inflation-adjusted  2015 dollars, this equals an increase of almost $69 million.", "Federal Reserve staff said that the cost structures for each of the check,  ACH, and wire payment services have significant differences. For  example, check clearing is more labor-intensive than the other services  and consequently incurs more personnel costs as a share of its  expenses. In 2015, personnel costs for check services represented more  than 15 percent of that service\u2019s operational costs, while personnel costs  represented less than 3 percent of operational costs for Fedwire.

As previously noted, in 1984, shortly after  it was mandated to capture and recover these costs, the Board had an  external review by an independent public accounting firm of its pricing  methodology, including evaluations of its cost accounting PACS process  and the PSAF. At that time, the accounting firm\u2019s report concluded that  the processes the Federal Reserve had implemented to capture its costs  were sound and that the overall PSAF methodology was logical and  complied with the Monetary Control Act.", "The Federal Reserve obtains some assurance that cost accounting  practices for its payment services continue to be adequate from a unit  within the staff of the Board that conducts rotating reviews of the Reserve  Banks\u2019 operations. Federal Reserve staff said that this unit reviews all the  Reserve Banks on a triennial basis (4 of the 12 banks each year) to  evaluate each bank\u2019s effectiveness in producing reliable expense  information in compliance with PACS manual requirements. These  reviews examine the processes and controls relating to the cost-allocation  processes (including how expenses related to centrally provided  information technology activities are allocated) and internal support  charges. In these reviews, this internal unit identifies deficiencies and  control weaknesses and makes recommendations for improvement. In  addition, we reviewed the reviews the internal unit performed of the 12  Reserve Banks and of the Federal Reserve Information Technology  group between 2012 and 2015.

In addition, we reviewed a sample of nine audits that Reserve  Banks\u2019 internal auditors had completed since 2011. Of these nine audits,  eight included reviews of controls relating to cost accounting practices.

However, these audits do not include detailed testing of the accuracy of  the processes used to capture or allocate costs associated with the  payment services, and thus the Federal Reserve does not obtain specific  assurance about the accuracy of these practices. Although staff from the  independent public accounting firm that conducted the Federal Reserve\u2019s  financial audit in 2014 told us that the Federal Reserve Banks have  thorough processes, their audits did not include steps to review payment  services costs and revenues because these costs were not in the scope  of the audit.", "The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission\u2019s (COSO) Internal Control-Integrated Framework\u2014a leading  framework for designing, implementing, and conducting internal control  and assessing the effectiveness of internal control\u2014states that  compliance with applicable laws and regulations is a key objective for an  organization establishing internal controls. Under this framework, a key  means of providing such assurance can be the performance of monitoring  activities, which includes the use of an independent third party to perform  specific evaluations of whether aspects of an organization\u2019s internal  controls are present and functioning. The annual financial audit does not  address the Federal Reserve\u2019s payment services, representatives from  the accounting firm told us, because they do not meet the materiality  threshold.

Although we analyzed the processes  by which the Federal Reserve accounts for actual and imputed costs, we  did not include detailed testing of the Federal Reserve\u2019s calculations or  cost accounting controls related to its priced services activities. By  obtaining periodic independent reviews to determine if the practices used  to capture all costs directly incurred by payment service activities and the  methods used to identify costs arising in other areas that should be  allocated to payment services are sound and that staff are adequately  complying with these practices, the Federal Reserve could attain greater  assurance that it is complying with its requirements under the Monetary  Control Act to set fees on the basis of all direct and indirect costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "While Some Competitors Expressed Concerns about Some Federal Reserve Payment Service Practices, Users Appeared to Benefit", "paragraphs": ["The Reserve Banks have added new services and fee structures  (including volume-based pricing) for customers to help ensure that they  retain adequate revenues to maintain their presence in the market.

According to Federal Reserve documents, the Reserve Banks have  introduced new services and pricing structures to retain existing  customers and attract volume from both existing and new customers. As  noted earlier, the Reserve Banks provide payment services both to  promote the efficiency of the payments mechanism and to ensure that  payment services are provided to all depository institutions on an  equitable basis. To achieve this, the Reserve Banks expanded the use of  pricing structures that provide discounts to customers that send them  higher volumes of transactions to process. In 1993, the Board approved  volume-based fees for the Reserve Banks\u2019 noncash collection service  and several check products. One of the objectives of adopting volume- based fees at that time was to encourage more efficient use of payment  services (by addressing differences in demand through fees). In  approving these fees, the Board asked its staff to recommend guidelines  on the use of volume-based fees, which were then adopted in 1997 and  published in the Federal Register. At that time the Board also approved  specific volume-based fees for the ACH origination service. In 2010, the  Reserve Banks expanded this practice by introducing several volume- based pricing tiers for customers receiving ACH transactions. The new  pricing tiers charge customers lower per-item fees as transaction volumes  with the Federal Reserve increase.", "The Reserve Banks also introduced fixed monthly fees to retain or  increase their payment services revenues. In 2009, the Board approved a  new monthly participation fee for the Reserve Banks\u2019 Fedwire service in  addition to the per-item charges. Originally set at $60 per month, by 2014  this fee had increased to $90. For the ACH service, the Board approved a  new monthly minimum fee in 2010, which was $25 for customers that  originated payments and $15 for customers that received payments. By  2015, these fees had risen to $35 and $25, respectively. Because fixed  expenses constitute much of the costs of providing these services,  Federal Reserve staff said that adding fixed fees was their way of better  matching pricing structures to corresponding cost structures.", "In addition to pricing changes, the Reserve Banks have introduced  discounts to benefit customers that use them to process transactions for  multiple payment products. For example, customers that transact at least  90 percent of their ACH payments a month through the Reserve Banks  and enable electronic receipt of checks from the Reserve Banks for all of  their routing numbers can receive a per-item fee discount on certain  check-clearing transactions.

For  example, the representative of one small community bank said that,  while private-sector payment service pricing generally may be lower  or even significantly cheaper, the bank will continue to use the  Reserve Banks\u2019 services because doing so allows it to remain  independent and provide top-quality service to its customers without  depending on a private-sector provider. A representative of a large  credit union said that, while the credit union might be able to get more  favorable pricing from private-sector providers, the difference would  not be enough to warrant switching from the Reserve Banks.

According to the Federal Reserve Act and Federal  Reserve regulations, the Federal Reserve can obtain a same-day  payment from a paying bank by debiting the paying bank\u2019s account at a  Reserve Bank without being charged a presentment fee. To address this  advantage the Board adopted Regulation CC\u2019s same-day settlement rule  in 1992, effective beginning in 1994. The same-day settlement rule  allowed any bank to present paper checks to any other bank by 8:00 a.m.  for settlement that same day without presentment fees. According to  Federal Reserve staff, this regulatory change reduced the Federal  Reserve\u2019s competitive advantage and allowed banks to compete more  effectively.", "However, according to ECCHO staff, the transition to the exchange of  check images has removed the effect of the competition-enhancing  change because Regulation CC does not apply to electronic images.  They explained that check image exchange, unlike the presentment of  paper checks, requires institutions to have legal agreements for and  electronic connections between both parties, both of which can be costly  to establish. The Board attempted to address this advantage by twice  requesting comment, in 2011 and in 2014, on whether to modify  Regulation CC to include similar presentment provisions for the exchange  of check images.

ACH payments generated by customers of TCH or the Federal Reserve  but bound for customers of the other provider must pass between both  operators, thus creating an interoperator transaction. In such cases, the  party that receives the item charges the other party \u201cinteroperator fees.\u201d  However, TCH sends more items to the Reserve Banks because its large  bank customers typically generate large volumes of payments on behalf  of their business customers\u2014many of which are sent to institutions that  use the Reserve Banks for ACH receipt.

For example, about 86 percent of the Reserve Banks\u2019 3,665  forward check customers and about 94 percent of their ACH receipt  customers had less than $1 billion in assets. Federal Reserve staff told us  that providing payment services to many of these customers is more  costly because low-volume users are the largest users of customer  support services, resulting in higher per-item costs for these customers.  The account setup and maintenance costs also result in higher per-item  costs for low-volume customers. The Federal Reserve staff also noted  that they incur other expenses not borne by their private-sector  competitors, such as those related to processing transactions manually in  the event of a disruption. If TCH had a similar customer base and costs  as the Reserve Banks, its costs would likely be higher on a per item basis  and would be more similar to that of the Reserve Banks. Similarly, if the  Reserve Banks left the market for payment services, and TCH and the  other providers took on these customers, their costs per transaction  would likely increase due to the higher costs of serving the customers  currently served by the Reserve Banks, thus reducing or eliminating any  cost-effectiveness advantage.

However, these cost differences may not be significant enough incentive  for current Federal Reserve customers to turn to other providers.

Other market participants said  that the Federal Reserve has been leading the way on faster payment  initiatives such as same-day ACH (payments can clear and settle on the  same day they are submitted). The Reserve Banks began offering an opt- in same-day ACH settlement service for certain debit transactions in  2010, and expanded this service to include support for credit transactions  in 2013.

For example, they said  that higher-volume customers are fairly price sensitive; that is, they are  more likely to send more or less business to the Reserve Banks  depending on the prices charged. With the cost to provide services to  higher-volume customers being lower than for other customers, staff said  that using volume pricing to set lower prices for higher-volume customers  was reasonable. Federal Reserve staff also said that they sometimes use  pricing to influence consumer demand. For example, for a legacy product  such as the access fee for using a dial-up connection to the Reserve  Banks, they might increase the price to discourage its use. The Federal  Reserve considers the various competitive factors for each pricing or  service change proposal (typically during its annual pricing process).  Each pricing or service change proposal during the process must  consider customer, competitive, and policy implications before the  Reserve Banks bring a formal proposal to the Board. At the beginning of  this process, Federal Reserve staff consider market feedback from the  prior year\u2019s pricing changes and analyze market trends and projections as  they develop new pricing proposals.", "The Board also has policies to prevent the Reserve Banks from engaging  in anticompetitive or predatory pricing. According to the Department of  Justice, predatory pricing occurs when a firm charges prices that are  temporarily set below its incremental costs in an attempt to harm  competitors. Department of Justice staff involved in antitrust and  anticompetitive legal cases told us that a firm can be deemed to be  competing unfairly if it is engaged in predatory pricing, bundling its  products anticompetitively, or engaged in anticompetitive tying\u2014requiring  the purchase of additional products as part of another purchase. Federal  Reserve staff told us that they used volume-based pricing in accordance  with principles the Board published in the Federal Register in 1997, which  are intended to avoid the risk of predatory pricing.

According to these principles, this  type of pricing constraint is well established in antitrust law and is  intended to prevent predatory pricing.", "In addition to these principles, the Federal Reserve conducts a  competitive impact analysis for all proposed changes to products and  prices and for all new products and prices.

Federal Reserve staff told us that by competing actively to gain  more volume and new customers through their pricing and product  offerings, they have exerted downward pressure on prices for payment  services.

Board staff noted that the Reserve  Banks have groups that monitor credit risks to the Reserve Bank to  protect the assets of the Reserve Bank as well as to protect the payment  system generally. The staff in these groups have access to confidential  supervisory information to perform this activity, and sometimes must  share information with the payment services staff when implementing risk  controls on particular institutions\u2019 accounts. The guidance that Federal  Reserve staff provided to us addressing credit risk monitoring activities  includes a section reminding Reserve Bank staff to share information on a  need-to-know basis only. A Board review conducted in 2005 that  surveyed the Reserve Banks on their information-sharing practices found  that staff were sharing information only when appropriate.", "To limit potential for conflicts, Federal Reserve staff also have limited the  extent to which the information technology systems that financial  institutions use to access payment systems activities integrate with  functions related to other Federal Reserve activities. For instance, the  Reserve Banks offer a system known as Fedline, which provides the  ability to conduct transactions across various payment system services. A  July 2015 memorandum to staff responsible for statistics and deposit  reserves activities noted that staff responsible for payment services sales  had suggested that the applications for other business lines be more fully  integrated into Fedline to allow more seamless movement among these  activities. However, the memorandum reminds these staff that the  applications for the other business line functions were purposefully  segregated from the payment system applications in Fedline to better  ensure that staff adhered to conflict-of-interest standards for payment  services.", "The Federal Reserve also includes information in training to help ensure  that relevant staff are aware of restrictions intended to prevent payment  services activities from benefiting from information obtained from other  Federal Reserve activities. Federal Reserve Board staff explained that  conflict-of-interest issues are not covered in a separate training course  but instead are addressed as part of other training. The 1984 standards  note that Reserve Bank staff are expected to provide full and accurate  information on Federal Reserve services (including features, quality,  prices, and operating requirements) to enable depository institutions to  make informed decisions, and that comparisons of Federal Reserve  services with those of other providers should be fair and objective. During  initial training, employees who work in the sales and marketing areas are  made aware of these policies to help ensure that their sales interactions  with banks avoid any inappropriate discussions. The staff noted that the  credit risk management staff developed some training modules and an  online training course that was shared among the 12 Reserve Banks that  includes information on the Board\u2019s guidance on information sharing.", "In addition to the Board\u2019s policies, the individual Reserve Banks whose  staff conduct payment service activities also have policies that restricted  information sharing and other activities that could create potential  conflicts. We reviewed the policies of five of the Reserve Banks that  conduct payment services activities to determine if they addressed  behavior that could create conflicts of interest among supervisory,  payment services, and other activities. Each of the five Reserve Banks  have policies that restrict the sharing of information between payment  services staff and supervisory or other Reserve Bank staff. In addition,  four of the banks specifically restrict supervisory staff from discussing  payment services issues with financial institutions. Three of the banks\u2019  policies also note that payment services staff should not disclose to other  Reserve Bank staff whether a financial institution was a payment services  customer. In addition, three of the banks\u2019 policies note that decisions on  whether to take supervisory actions against a financial institution should  not be based on whether or not the institution was a payment services  customer. The Reserve Bank policies generally note that sharing of  information between payment services and staff with other responsibilities  could occur if such sharing served a specific supervisory purpose or if the  information was otherwise publicly available.", "To determine compliance with the policies to prevent staff from sharing  information or exerting influence to advantage its payment services  activities, the Board also conducts periodic reviews to evaluate the  Reserve Banks\u2019 application of the policies. The Division of Reserve Bank  Operations and Payment Systems within the Board is responsible for  conducting operations reviews of the Reserve Banks. As previously  discussed, Board staff told us that they review operations at four Reserve  Banks each year. As part of these reviews, Board staff discuss the  Reserve Banks\u2019 information sharing practices for staff and provide  feedback to the banks about any concerns with the management of  confidential supervisory information.", "The Federal Reserve also indicated that oversight by other auditors also  helps provide assurance that it is taking adequate steps to minimize  conflicts between its payment system activities and its other roles. The  Board\u2019s Inspector General conducts reviews that sometimes address the  Board\u2019s oversight of Reserve Bank payment systems activities. For  example, in September 2014 the Inspector General reported on the  extent and effectiveness of oversight (by the Division of Reserve Bank  Operations and Payment Systems) of the Reserve Banks\u2019 Fedwire and  other wholesale financial services activities. The Inspector General\u2019s  review stated that it had not identified any deficiencies regarding the  efficiency and effectiveness of the Board staff\u2019s oversight, and that the  staff employed off-site monitoring, ongoing communication, on-site  reviews, and assistance from the general auditors at the Reserve Banks  to provide oversight of the Reserve Banks\u2019 wholesale financial services.  The Board\u2019s 1984 policy that sets out standards for the Reserve Banks\u2019  payment services activities notes that an additional level of external  review comes from providing the public with the ability to comment on  significant Board proposals on Reserve Bank payment services activities.", "The Federal Reserve also has a process for addressing complaints about  its payment system activities. Federal Reserve staff told us that they have  sometimes received questions from market participants on these  operations. If the issue is not resolved to the participant\u2019s satisfaction,  they can escalate the matter to the chair of the Board\u2019s Committee on  Federal Reserve Bank Affairs. This person is responsible for investigating  and responding to complaints concerning actions of Reserve Bank  personnel who are alleged to be inconsistent with the standards related to  conflicts arising from its payment systems\u2019 activities.", "Discussions with Federal Reserve staff and market participants suggest  that the Reserve Banks comply with the policies intended to prevent them  from using their other roles to benefit their payment services activities.  When we last reported on the potential conflicts between the Reserve  Bank\u2019s payment services activities and the other roles of the Federal  Reserve in 2000, we found no evidence to suggest that the Reserve  Banks had not adequately separated their multiple roles. Since then,  Board staff told us that they have rarely received complaints relating to  conflicting roles in the payments system. For example, in the last 5 years,  staff recalled one instance in which they received a complaint from a  competing payment clearing organization. The complaint related to an  alleged incident in which a Reserve Bank payment systems sales  employee purportedly told a financial institution that use of Reserve Bank  payment services would help them comply with any regulatory  requirements. Board staff pursued the complaint, but were unable to  address the specific allegation due to lack of details regarding the  incident. However, Board staff held discussions with Reserve Bank staff  responsible for payment services sales to reinforce policies concerning  conflicts of interest. According to the Federal Reserve staff, Board staff  advised the competing payment clearing organization of the steps that  were taken in response to its complaint, and the organization did not  pursue its concern with the chair of the Board\u2019s Committee on Federal  Reserve Bank Affairs.", "Most market participants we interviewed also indicated that they did not  have concerns that the Reserve Banks were inappropriately using their  various roles to benefit their payment services activities. To help assess  how well the Reserve Banks were managing potential conflicts among  their different roles, we interviewed 24 providers and users of payment  services (including the top 5 largest banks and a randomly selected group  of service providers and end users). These entities included:", "12 financial institutions and nonbank entities that compete with the  Reserve Banks to provide payment services; and", "12 banks and credit unions that were end-user customers of private- sector providers, the Reserve Banks, or both (including 6 also  supervised by the Federal Reserve).", "Of the 12 entities we interviewed that were end-user customers of  payment services, most (10 of 12) did not express concerns with the  Federal Reserve\u2019s multiple roles. For example, staff at one large bank  said the Federal Reserve managed any potential conflicts of interest  between its payments side and its regulatory side well and that they had  not seen evidence of conflicts. They noted that their discussions with  Federal Reserve examination staff focused on safety and soundness, and  conversations with the Federal Reserve payments services staff were  similar to those they would have with a private-sector vendor. Of the  entities with concerns, one was a credit union not supervised by the  Federal Reserve whose representatives said that they were unsure of the  need for the Federal Reserve to function as both a regulator and provider  in the payment system. The other was a large bank, whose staff noted  that although they were not aware of any situation where a Federal  Reserve examiner raised concerns with their bank\u2019s use of private-sector  providers, they did note that concerns existed over whether the Federal  Reserve is fully recovering its costs or whether it uses its advantages  over private-sector competitors.", "Similarly, of the 12 entities we interviewed that competed with the  Reserve Banks, representatives of 9 of these entities did not express any  concerns over the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of its multiple roles.", "Representatives of the 3 remaining entities did express some concerns.  For example, staff at one payment services provider told us that some  banks have been told by Federal Reserve staff that if they did not process  sufficient volumes on both of the competing ACH networks\u2014those  operated by The Clearing House and by the Reserve Banks\u2014it could be  seen as a supervisory issue. Representatives of another institution told us  that when they moved their check-clearing business from the Federal  Reserve to a competing provider more than 3 years ago, Federal Reserve  payment services employees allegedly made comments suggesting  negative implications for the institution. But since then, the Federal  Reserve has been this entity\u2019s primary supervisor and the representatives  said that the Federal Reserve has not taken any inappropriate actions.  The third entity that expressed concerns was a large bank that is  supervised by the Federal Reserve and offers payment services to  others. Representatives of this bank noted their Federal Reserve  examiners had not exercised any pressure on their institution to use the  Federal Reserve\u2019s payment services but questioned the appropriateness  of the Federal Reserve offering comments on pricing on the ACH  payment association\u2019s proposal to implement same-day ACH  transactions. Federal Reserve staff noted that these concerns related to  the establishment, calculation, and future management of an interbank  fee (in the nature of an interchange fee) for the ACH system\u2019s same-day  settlement transactions that would be processed by the Reserve Banks  as an ACH operator under the proposed rules of NACHA for this service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market Participants Generally Support a Continued Role for the Federal Reserve in the Payments System", "paragraphs": ["Market participants we interviewed generally support the Reserve Banks\u2019  role as providers of payment services. Many of the 34 market participants  we interviewed\u2014bank and credit union users of payment services and  private-sector providers of payment services (both direct competitors and  others involved in payment services activities)\u2014said that the Federal  Reserve has an important role in the payment system. Several market  participants, including those that compete with the Reserve Banks in  providing payment services, said that the Federal Reserve successfully  promotes ubiquitous access to payment services and should continue to  do so.", "Representatives of all 12 financial institutions that we interviewed that  used the Reserve Banks\u2019 payment services generally expressed positive  views about the Federal Reserve\u2019s roles in the payment system, including  comments about the Federal Reserve providing stability, promoting  competition, ensuring access to all institutions, and promoting innovation  in the payments industry. Representatives of one large bank said that the  Reserve Banks have strengthened competition in the market and put  pressure on private-sector providers, which has benefitted all parties.  Representatives of a community bank said that they think the Reserve  Banks provide a valuable service, especially to community banks.  Representatives from 2 of the 12 financial institutions had concerns about  the Federal Reserve\u2019s roles in payment services. Representatives from  one large federal credit union said that the Reserve Banks\u2019 prices were  low and their service very good, but worried that the Reserve Banks\u2019  actions to lower prices might weaken competition in this market. In  contrast, representatives of several smaller financial institutions with  whom we met said that they appreciated the Reserve Banks\u2019 services in  the payments system and preferred to use their services over a private- sector competitor. One bank official from a smaller institution said that  although the Reserve Banks\u2019 prices were not necessarily lower than the  prices of private-sector providers, the official preferred the quality of  service in the provision of services.", "Similarly, in our interviews all three payment service providers that do not  compete directly with the Reserve Banks said that they generally thought  the Reserve Banks\u2019 provision of payment services has helped the  payment services industry. One provider said that the Federal Reserve  actively promoted innovation in the payments industry, citing the Federal  Reserve\u2019s involvement in transitioning the check industry to digital  imaging, despite the resulting decrease in its own market share in that  payment service. Representatives from another provider said that they  believed that the Federal Reserve has always played the role of an  \u201cindustry helper\u201d and cited the Federal Reserve\u2019s roles in guiding the  industry toward adopting innovations in the coming years.", "However, representatives from some competing payment service  providers said that they would prefer the Reserve Banks to compete less  actively in the payment services market. At least 6 of 12 competing  payment service providers and one trade association with members that  are competing providers said that they thought the Reserve Banks should  compete less actively in the payment services market, and several  suggested that the Federal Reserve instead become more of a payment  service \u201cprovider of last resort,\u201d as illustrated in the following examples.", "Representatives from one large bank said that for years they  considered the Reserve Banks as providing a critical function through  their connections to many institutions. But they noted that the Reserve  Banks recently made price and product changes to attract more  business and that undermined market competition. The staff said that  they would prefer the Reserve Banks to become providers of last  resort.", "Some private-sector providers suggested that the Federal Reserve  stop providing payment services and instead focus more on ensuring  ubiquitous access to all financial institutions or simply act as a  regulator by creating and overseeing rules for the private-sector  providers. Staff from one medium-sized bank said that they thought  the Reserve Banks should instead focus on setting the rules as a  regulator of the payments system, while staff from a corporate credit  union said the Reserve Banks should instead focus on settlement,  and not clearing of payments. However, Federal Reserve staff told us  that cost recovery requirements dictate that the Reserve Banks  remain an active service provider, because being a \u201cprovider of last  resort\u201d would require them to make transactions too expensive. They  said that larger-volume customers likely would use other providers,  leaving revenue from the lower-volume customers that remained to  recover costs. Moreover, they indicated that, if the Reserve Banks  were providers of last resort, the Federal Reserve would likely not be  able to meet its statutory cost-recovery requirement and would not  further its mission to foster the efficiency of the payments system or  ensure ubiquitous access.", "Representatives of two payment service providers said that the  Federal Reserve could be more transparent in its payment service  pricing and compliance with the Monetary Control Act\u2019s cost recovery  requirements. The pricing principles the Board developed in response  to the Monetary Control Act require the Reserve Banks to publish their  prices and to solicit public comments when proposing pricing or  product changes that are expected to have significant longer-term  effects on the payments system.", "Representatives of TCH said that, while TCH welcomes competition from  the Federal Reserve, they believe that such competition should be strictly  in compliance with the Monetary Control Act, and that the Federal  Reserve should be transparent about such compliance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Reserve Has Been Engaging Stakeholders to Improve the Payments System", "paragraphs": ["In acknowledgment of the need to ensure that the United States keeps  pace with advancements in the payments system, the Federal Reserve  has been convening groups of stakeholders to explore ways to improve  the payments system, including bringing about faster and more secure  payments. The Federal Reserve cited the rapid changes to the payments  process brought on by high-speed data networks and other technology,  as well as the escalating security threats towards existing payment  systems, as evidence of the need for all stakeholders to join to improve  the payment system. (Payment system stakeholders include large and  small businesses, emerging payments firms, card networks, payment  processors, consumers, financial institutions, and government agencies.)  Furthermore, consumers and businesses have begun to desire fast,  convenient, ubiquitous, safe, and inexpensive payment options, according  to an international payments network. While other countries have  developed real-time or near real-time retail payments systems, the U.S.  payments system does not have a ubiquitous, convenient, and cost- effective way for consumers and businesses to make real-time or near  real-time payments. According to a 2015 white paper from the same  international payments network, 18 countries have real-time retail  payments systems, an additional 12 countries have been either exploring  or developing them, and another 17 have been considering developing a  system that would span multiple countries. In one example, Australia  has been making the transition to its New Payments Platform, which is  designed to enable future payments to be processed and settled in real  time with finality, even outside of normal banking hours.", "To help begin the process and explore and solicit input on concepts and  criteria for a new system for the United States, the Federal Reserve  published a public consultation paper on improving the payments system  in September 2013. This paper provided perspectives on the key gaps  in the current U.S. payment system and identified desired outcomes to  address the gaps. Specifically, the Federal Reserve identified eight gaps  and opportunities for improvement in the current payment environment,  which included end users\u2019 increased demand for real-time transactions  and timely notifications; the lack of ubiquity in currently operating  electronic payment services (as compared with legacy systems such as  checks); and the challenges associated with cross-border payments. The  paper also identified five desired outcomes to be achieved within 10 years  to address these gaps and opportunities. These desired outcomes  included having payment participants collectively identify and embrace  key improvements, implementing process improvements that reduce  costs and increase innovations over the long run, and having a system  that offers consumers and businesses greater choice and security.", "The Federal Reserve obtained nearly 200 written responses from industry  stakeholders on the consultation paper, and published these responses  and the Federal Reserve staff summary of the responses on its website.  According to the summary document, about 75 percent of the written  responses agreed with the gaps, opportunities, and desired outcomes the  paper had identified. Commenters also suggested additional areas for  focus, particularly related to ensuring comparable regulation for payment  providers and addressing the needs of the unbanked or underbanked.  For example, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s summary document,  depository institutions broadly argued that they are held to higher  regulatory and risk-management standards than nonbank payment  providers, and merchants expressed desire for a payment system  governance structure that allows them to have more influence. According  to the summary document, many respondents opined that a 10-year plan  to improve the payments system was not aggressive enough, and that  more action should be taken in the near term.", "To advance this effort, in January of 2015 the Federal Reserve issued  Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System, a document that sets  forth its strategies for bringing together all stakeholders to improve the  payment system. In this document, the Federal Reserve refined and  finalized the five desired outcomes into the following categories: speed,  security, efficiency, international, and collaboration. In addition, the  Federal Reserve identified five strategies to improve the payment system  in the United States: actively engage with stakeholders on initiatives designed to improve  the U.S. payment system;  identify effective approaches for implementing a safe, ubiquitous,  faster payments capability in the United States; work to reduce fraud risk and advance the safety, security, and  resiliency of the payment system; achieve greater end-to-end efficiency for domestic and cross-border enhance Reserve Bank payments, settlement, and risk-management  services.", "Since then, the Federal Reserve has been forming task forces of industry  stakeholders, with one task force focused on evaluating effective  approaches of a faster payments system, and the other focused on  promoting payment security. These task forces have developed  effectiveness criteria for assessing alternative solutions for faster  payments and the Federal Reserve has also appointed key staff to  support and guide these efforts.", "Although some market participants expressed concerns to us about the  Federal Reserve\u2019s process for moving toward a faster payments solution,  Federal Reserve staff told us that these concerns appeared to reflect  misunderstandings of the process. For example, representatives from a  payment service trade association with whom we spoke said that the  Federal Reserve was making edits and inserting criteria in documents  containing stakeholder perspectives to emphasize its own service  offerings. Specifically, they said that the Federal Reserve inserted a  criterion that suggested that all faster payments positions should settle  with the Reserve Banks. However, Federal Reserve staff noted that the  criterion in question states \u201cThe solution should either enable settlement  in central bank money, or minimize and strictly control the credit and  liquidity risk arising from the use of commercial bank money for the inter- provider settlement process.\u201d They added that settlement in central bank  money does not mean that the Reserve Banks would operate the faster  payments solution, as evident in TCH\u2019s ACH service that settles using  central bank money. Federal Reserve staff also told us that the drafting of  the criteria documents for the Faster Payments Initiative took place during  meetings of the Faster Payments Task Force and Steering Committee,  and that this was a transparent and rigorous process.", "Representatives from a large bank also said that they were concerned  about an intellectual property requirement contained in the participation  agreement for stakeholders involved in the faster payments planning  process. They said that the Federal Reserve required participants to sign  an agreement that included language noting anything coming out of the  discussion would be the intellectual property of the Federal Reserve.  Because of these terms, the bank decided not to participate, and they  said that they knew of other financial institutions that felt similarly.  However, Federal Reserve staff said that the characterization of the  participation agreement language is not correct and that the agreement  does not limit a participant\u2019s use of its own intellectual property. Instead,  they said that the agreement includes terms for fair, reasonable, and  nondiscriminatory licensing of intellectual property. In addition, there is an  opt-out provision in the agreement that allows participants to identify any  intellectual property present in a final report before it is published and  decline to grant the license for it. Furthermore, based on feedback from  the industry related to the intellectual property provisions, the Federal  Reserve revised the participation agreement in March 2016 to reduce the  scope and legal burdens for the participant in licensing its intellectual  property.

It also uses a reasonable approach to impute the costs that it  would bear if it was a private entity and includes these in the costs that it  recovers with its payment services revenues. However, the Federal  Reserve has not included in its imputed costs some costs that its  competitors incur. These include those related to developing plans for  recovery and orderly wind down, which are costs that its primary  competitor in wire transfers has had to incur to comply with new  requirements for resolution planning for systemically important payment  system entities. Also, the Federal Reserve has not included costs borne  by private-sector providers related to complying with antimoney- laundering requirements. By including these costs, the Federal Reserve  would more completely impute and recover costs that it would have  incurred as a private firm.", "In addition, although it also conducts internal reviews to help ensure that  it captures the required costs accurately, the cost accounting system has  not been specifically reviewed by an external auditor in more than 30  years.

We analyzed 12 reviews conducted by an internal Board staff  between 2012 and 2015 and a judgmental selection of 9 audits conducted  by the internal audit staff of the Reserve Banks to determine the extent of  their findings related to cost accounting practices. We also reviewed the  only external audit that had examined the cost accounting practices at the  Federal Reserve Banks that had been conducted in 1984. No private- sector cost accounting standards existed to compare to the cost  accounting practices followed by the Reserve Banks, which are federally  chartered but organized as private corporations. As a result, we  compared the design of PACS to the elements that federal managerial  cost accounting standards\u2014Statement of Federal Financial Accounting  Standards 4\u2014recommend be included in federal agency cost accounting  systems to determine how the Federal Reserve\u2019s practices aligned with a  comparable standard.", "To determine how the Federal Reserve was imputing and recovering  costs that would have been incurred had its payment services been  provided by a private firm, in accordance with the Monetary Control Act,  we examined data and documentation relating to the Federal Reserve\u2019s  methodology for computing this \u201cprivate sector adjustment factor\u201d (PSAF).  Based on our assessment of the controls and quality assurance practices  the Federal Reserve used to compile these data, we determined the data  were reliable for this purpose.

We also reviewed industry  documentation on criticisms of the Federal Reserve\u2019s PSAF methodology.", "To examine how the Federal Reserve prices its payment services and  assesses the impact of its competition in this market, we analyzed volume  and pricing data for the Federal Reserve\u2019s check, wire, and ACH payment  services from 2004 to 2014, including publicly available fee schedules.  We also analyzed Federal Reserve pricing and revenue data for each of  these services, including examining trends in service prices over time. To  ensure that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, we  verified that we had obtained complete data on the revenue by type of  customer by comparing them to the annual revenue totals reported  publicly by the Federal Reserve. Based on this comparison and our  assessment of the controls and quality assurance practices the Federal  Reserve used to compile these data, we determined the data were  reliable for this purpose.

Therefore, if the  salaries in the department represented 1 percent of the salaries of the  Reserve Bank, 1 percent of the retirement plan contribution ($100)  would be allocated to the Retail Electronic Payments Department.", "Subsequently, the Federal Reserve would further allocate this  departmental expense among the various activities that the  department tracks. For example, if 70 percent of the department\u2019s  operations were devoted to automated clearing house (ACH) activities  and 30 percent were associated with check processing, $70 of the  department\u2019s allocated retirement expense would be recorded under  ACH activity and $30 under check activity.", "Similarly, the Federal Reserve Banks\u2019 payment services would be  allocated support and overhead expenses using the methods and  procedures prescribed in the PACS manual, such as using a fixed  percentage of some other factor or on a dollar-ratio basis.

A private  firm providing payment services would need to raise capital to obtain the  funds to invest in the necessary facilities, equipment, and other assets  needed to conduct these activities. To determine the financing costs  associated with this debt and equity capital, the Federal Reserve  compiles the values of the actual assets it uses to conduct payment  services activities. In addition to its premises, furniture, and equipment,  these values may include an asset corresponding to the Federal  Reserve\u2019s net pension plan obligations. The PSAF methodology assumes  that any short-term assets\u2014such as supplies\u2014are to be financed with  short-term debt and that long-term assets\u2014such as facilities and  equipment\u2014would be financed with long-term liabilities and a  combination of imputed long-term debt and equity. The methodology also  assumes that the Federal Reserve would use the same percentage mix of  long-term debt and equity that it derives from the U.S. publicly traded firm  index to finance its long-term assets not offset by long-term liabilities.", "Once it has identified the imputed amount of debt and equity it would  need to fund its capital structure, the Federal Reserve calculates the rates  for debt and equity financing. Using publicly available, market-based  interest rates, it calculates a total amount of interest that it would have to  pay for the year on the mix of short- and long-term debt amounts that  were identified based on its asset structure. In 2016, the Federal  Reserve\u2019s PSAF methodology determined that it would have paid a rate  of 0.3 percent on $19 million of short-term debt. The long-term debt  financing rate was 4.2 percent.", "To determine the cost of the equity it would have to use to finance its  payment services activities\u2019 assets, the Federal Reserve uses a generally  accepted financial formula for calculating the expected rate of return on  equity that investors would demand based on its risk relative to the  market as a whole. In 2016, the PSAF model calculated a pre-tax return  on equity of about 9.8 percent, which represented additional imputed  financing costs of $5.3 million.", "After these total imputed financing costs of debt and return on equity are  calculated, the Federal Reserve\u2019s PSAF methodology imputes two  additional costs that a private-sector firm likely would incur. The first of  these additional costs is an amount equivalent to the sales taxes that the  Federal Reserve Banks would have incurred based on budgeted outlays  for materials, supplies, and capital. These costs must be included as part  of the allocation of imputed costs under the criteria listed in the Monetary  Control Act. Furthermore, these costs are imputed rather than actual  because the Federal Reserve Banks are exempt from paying sales taxes  under the Federal Reserve Act. Then payment services\u2019 share of Federal  Reserve Board expenses, which Federal Reserve staff said are costs  associated with the Board\u2019s supervision of the payment services  operations conducted by the Reserve Banks, are included in the PSAF,  because, Federal Reserve staff told us, these costs are not captured by  the PACS (which captures the actual costs Reserve Banks incur). In  2016, the expenses related to Board supervision and to imputed sales  taxes were calculated to be $5.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively.", "Using its PSAF methodology, in 2016 the Federal Reserve calculated a  total PSAF cost of $13.1 million that would have been incurred if the  Reserve Banks were a private-sector provider, down from $18.0 million in  2015, as shown in table 3.

This change was made because the value of the  prepaid pension assets began to increase significantly due to large  returns generated from its investments and because the effects of prepaid  pension assets were being included in the balance sheets of the bank  holding companies the Federal Reserve was using as its peer group to  compute the PSAF\u2019s financing rates and return on equity. This change  resulted in an additional $60.5 million of pretax imputed costs being  included in the 2000 PSAF amount. In 2005, the Federal Reserve  simplified its methodology for calculating the PSAF\u2019s equity financing rate  by shifting from an average of three separate financing models to a single  calculation based on the return on equity investors would demand based  on the risk in the market.", "In the past, the Federal Reserve used financial information from large  U.S. bank holding companies to calculate elements of the PSAF. For  example, from 1981 to 2001, the Federal Reserve had been using the  average debt and equity proportions used by the top bank holding  companies in the United States, before setting the equity imputed into the  PSAF to meet the FDIC definition of a well-capitalized institution.  Additionally, the financial information from large bank holding companies  was used to calculate the PSAF\u2019s return on equity until 2006 and imputed  taxes until 2013. In 2012, the Board adopted a policy of basing the  imputed capital structure, debt and ROE rates, and tax rates on data for  the U.S. publicly traded firm market. Federal Reserve staff noted that over  time bank holding companies were engaged in different businesses and  had risk profiles that were beyond those represented by the payment  services of the Reserve Banks, many of which are now provided by  nonbank entities. In 2012, the Federal Reserve amended Regulation D,  governing reserve requirements, to eliminate the clearing balance  program, which was largely modeled after similar programs offered by  correspondent banks, wherein banks maintain balances with their  correspondents. The level of clearing balances held at the Reserve Banks  had declined after the Federal Reserve began paying interest on deposit  balances held at Reserve Banks. Federal Reserve staff noted that the  elimination of the clearing balance program significantly changed the size  and nature of the assets and liabilities associated with the payment  services to such an extent that the Federal Reserve determined that the  use of bank holding companies as the peer group was no longer  appropriate for the PSAF methodology."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Competitive Impact Assessment Process", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that it is not unfairly leveraging a possible legal advantage to  benefit its payment service activities, the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Board) formally analyzes the potential  competitive impact of any significant changes in the Reserve Banks\u2019  payment services pricing or product offerings. The process it uses for  conducting competitive impact analyses involves determining if a  proposed change would harm other providers due to legal differences,  and then weighing the potential harm of the change to competitors  against the potential benefits to the overall payments system. For each  price or service change proposal, the Board first considers whether the  change would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of  other service providers to compete with the Reserve Banks. According to  its policy, if the Board identifies such an effect, staff then determine  whether the effect was due to differing legal powers or the Reserve  Banks\u2019 dominant market position deriving from such legal differences.  According to the Federal Reserve, existing legal disparities between the  Reserve Banks and the private sector include differences in the rules for  same-day settlement of paper checks, check presentment deadlines and  locations, the ability of the paying bank to impose reasonable delivery  requirements, and the control and timing of settlement. For example,  according to the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve regulations,  every paying bank must accept paper checks from the Reserve Banks,  and the Reserve Banks can obtain a same-day payment from a paying  bank by debiting the paying bank\u2019s account at a Reserve Bank without  being charged a presentment fee. While the Board addressed this  advantage through the adoption of Regulation CC in 1992 (effective in  1994), some market participants we interviewed noted that Regulation CC  applied to paper check clearing only, and does not address the Reserve  Banks\u2019 advantage in the exchange of check images. In 1998 the Board  proposed limiting or eliminating this and all remaining legal disparities  between it and the private-sector competitors, but based on the public  comments they received, the Board concluded that the significant costs  associated with reducing the remaining legal disparities would outweigh  any efficiency gains to the payment services industry, and could result in  a reduction in efficiency to the payments system. For example, they said  that providing for a later settlement of Reserve Bank presentments would  delay the ability of the Reserve Banks to post credits for check deposits,  making intraday account management more difficult for many banks and  potentially increasing their daylight overdraft charges.", "Federal Reserve staff told us that a competitive impact analysis could  indicate that a proposed change might have an adverse effect on private- sector competitors, but still not be considered unfair as long as it was  determined that the Reserve Banks would not be leveraging their legal  advantages. For example, the use of volume-based pricing and the  bundling of services that has concerned some private-sector competitors  did not raise objections in the Board\u2019s competitive impact analysis  process because these changes were not deemed to rely on a legal  advantage.", "If the analysis of a proposed new product or pricing change determines  that the Reserve Banks would obtain a competitive advantage stemming  from their legal advantages, Federal Reserve staff then must continue to  evaluate the proposed change to determine if the change furthers any  overarching Board objectives, such as increasing the efficiency of the  payments system or ensuring ubiquitous access. Staff must also consider  whether the objective of the proposed change could be met in another  way that would less adversely affect competing private-sector service  providers. Finally, the Board may decide to modify the proposed change  to lessen any adverse effects, or decide that the benefits to customers  are significant enough to adopt the proposed change despite the potential  for adverse effects on other competing market participants.", "To help ensure that it is complying with its pricing policies and effectively  assessing its competitive impact, the Federal Reserve conducts various  internal reviews. Federal Reserve staff said that all product and pricing  changes must first be documented in a proposal by the relevant Reserve  Bank product office. These proposals are to include customer and market  competitive impact analyses. During proposal development, product office  staff sometimes also consult with industry work groups to solicit their  feedback. Once senior leadership in the product office achieve consensus  on the proposals, staff may then send the proposals to the Reserve  Banks\u2019 Financial Services Policy Committee for its review and approval.  The proposals\u2014including the associated competitive impact analyses\u2014 then are sent to the Board, although Federal Reserve staff said that they  often have ongoing and iterative discussions with Board staff prior to its  receipt of the proposals. Board staff then conduct their own independent  analysis of the proposals, and the Board will occasionally solicit additional  public comments if it anticipates any significant long-term effects  associated with the proposal. Nonroutine changes to pricing and product  offerings are subject to approval by the Board or the director of its  Division of Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems.", "The Federal Reserve estimated that staff have completed 32 competitive  impact analyses for nonroutine proposals since 2000, in addition to the  analyses conducted for routine proposals and for the Board\u2019s public  rulemaking process, as necessary. Nonroutine proposals are those that  create a new service, create a new product line within an existing service,  introduce new pricing structures, or are expected to generate significant  comment from market participants. The Board\u2019s annual repricing exercise  is considered as a single, nonroutine analysis. A routine proposal,  alternatively, is a new product or proposed change that only moderately  affects existing products or is expected to result in minimal action from  market participants. Federal Reserve staff estimated that they performed  an average of 2\u20133 nonroutine analyses and 8\u20139 total analyses each year.", "After a new product introduction created controversy in 2013, the Federal  Reserve added additional controls to better ensure that any subsequent  changes would not result in unfair competition with the private sector. For  their 2013 fee schedule, the Reserve Banks introduced a new check- clearing product known as \u201cChoice Receiver,\u201d which offered preferential  prices to customers for using a Reserve Bank as the presentment bank.  The Choice Receiver product was initially approved by the Board but later  challenged by private-sector competitors as unfair. After reviewing more  complete information about the product, Board staff said that they  concluded that its approval had been inappropriate because the product  office had not provided sufficient information to allow the Board to  evaluate whether the product relied on the Federal Reserve\u2019s legal  advantages. Once all the relevant information had been considered, the  Board rescinded the product later that year because it was deemed to  have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other service  providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve due to legal  differences.", "As a result of this experience, Federal Reserve staff told us they modified  their internal processes for analysis and review of proposed price and  service changes. For example, they created a competitive impact analysis  template that serves as a training tool for staff (staff respond to a series of  questions evaluating the potential adverse effect of proposed changes).  Reserve Banks also implemented a concept evaluation process, which  provides a high-level overview of planned changes to products or prices  in advance of formal proposals, and an enhanced postimplementation  review process, which compares the actual performance of a product or  service to the estimated changes in the original proposal. Federal  Reserve staff said that these processes together have helped provide  clarity to internal stakeholders on products in development; improved the  transparency and collaboration between product offices and Board staff;  and provided validation for prices and products after they have been  implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Federal Reserve", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Cody Goebel (Assistant  Director), Nathan Gottfried (Analyst-in-Charge), William R.
