GAO's analysis of data for 132,000 parts requisitions from ships in 6 Atlantic and Pacific battle groups deployed in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 showed that 54 percent could be filled from inventories onboard ship. This supply rate falls short of Navy's long-standing 65 percent goal. When parts were requisitioned, maintenance crews waited an average of 18.1 days to get the parts--more than 3 times the Navy's wait-time goal of 5.6 days for ships outside the continental United States. The Navy recognizes it has not met its supply goals for over 20 years. Two key problems contribute to the Navy's inability to achieve its supply goals. Its ship configuration records, which identify the types of equipment and weapons systems that are installed on a ship, are often inaccurate because they are not updated in a timely manner and because audits to ensure their accuracy are not conducted periodically. In addition, the Navy's historical demand data are often out-of-date, incomplete, or erroneous because supply crews do not always enter the right information into the ships' supply system databases or do not enter it on a timely basis. Because configuration-record and demand data are used in models to estimate what a ship needs to carry in inventory, inaccuracies in this information can result in a ship's not stocking the right parts for the equipment on board or not carrying the right number of parts that may be needed during deployment. While precise impacts are not always well defined, the Navy's spare parts supply problems can affect a deployed ship's operations, mission readiness, and costs. GAO's analysis of data on 50,000 work orders from 6 deployed battle groups showed that 58 percent could not be completed because the right parts were not available onboard. More complete reporting of work orders identified as critical or important would have resulted in a more complete assessment of ship mission readiness. In addition, the Navy expends substantial funds--nearly $25 million for six ships GAO reviewed--to maintain large inventories that are not requisitioned during deployments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During deployments of U.S. Navy ships around the world, it is inevitable  that some of the equipment or weapons systems on board these ships will  break down and need repairs.

The  Naval Supply Systems Command provides naval forces with supplies and  services through a worldwide, integrated supply system. Its Naval  Inventory Control Point exercises centralized control over different line  items of repair parts, components, and assemblies for ships, aircraft, and  other weapons systems.", "Supplying spare parts to deployed ships requires coordination between  the supply command and the Naval operating forces. The operating forces  report to the Chief of Naval Operations and provide, train, and equip naval  forces. The operating forces also report to the appropriate Unified  Combatant Commanders. As units of the Navy enter one of the designated  worldwide areas of Naval responsibility, they are operationally assigned to  the appropriate numbered fleet. All Navy units also have an administrative  chain of command with the various ships reporting to the appropriate  ship type commander: aircraft carriers, aircraft squadrons, and air  stations are under the Commander, Naval Air Force; submarines come  under the Commander, Submarine Force; and all other ships fall under  the Commander, Naval Surface Forces. Normally, the type commander  controls the ship during its primary and intermediate training cycles, and  then it moves under the operational control of a fleet commander.", "The Navy determines what kinds of spare parts to carry on board deployed  ships by identifying the kinds of equipment that are installed (the ship\u2019s  configuration) and the types and quantities of repair parts and any special  tools, test equipment, or support equipment needed to do preventive and  corrective maintenance during extended and unreplenished periods at sea.  Specifically, the Navy identifies maintenance requirements and uses them  to develop a list of allowable parts for the equipment. For parts on the list,  the Navy uses predicted failure rates, which it updates using actual  demand for parts data in inventory allowance models. The office of the  Chief of Naval Operations approves these models.", "Although the Navy revised its instruction for determining spare parts  supply effectiveness in October 1999, it continues informally to use the  supply-system performance goals that were established in 1983. These  performance goals measure a ship\u2019s ability to fill all of the repair part  requisitions that it receives. Two important goals are: (1) that gross  availability of 65 percent of repair parts required by ships and aircraft  carriers are to be filled from onboard inventories and (2) that the average  customer wait-time for the delivery of high-priority parts from ships\u2019  supply inventories and off-ship sources is to occur within 135 hours (or  about 5.6 days) for ships outside of the continental United States. This  average customer wait-time is the supply system\u2019s response time from the  date an order for a required part is issued until it is received by the  customer.

Navy supply officials  said that wait-times of about 12 to 14 days for these critical parts are about  the best the Navy is achieving because it uses expeditors to locate the  parts and it employs premium transportation to deliver the parts to the  ships. For example, a ship will send a requisition for a critical part to a  shore-based team whose job is to determine quickly if the part is available  anywhere in the military supply system or elsewhere, and identify the  fastest mode of transportation available (usually commercial overnight  delivery) to an overseas point.

Specifically, they said  that (1) ship configuration records are not always updated in a timely  manner when equipment or weapons systems are modified and  (2) required configuration audits are not conducted regularly to ensure  that configuration data correspond with the equipment or weapons  systems on board. The Navy identifies current and accurate configuration  data as the cornerstone of logistics support to its ships. Configuration  records provide a detailed description of the characteristics, including  dimensions and technical information, of each piece of equipment or  weapon system on board the ship. This information is used in allowance  models to prepare a Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL).", "The allowance list identifies the individual spare parts related to each  piece of equipment or weapon system on board. Ships depend on  accurate configuration records to ensure that, among other things, the  right spare parts and special tools, along with the proper manuals and  other documentation, are available on board ship.", "Navy officials said that while it is difficult to attribute any one cause to  spare parts shortages on board, inaccurate ship configuration records are  a major problem. If inaccurate configuration records are used in allowance  models, the resulting allowance lists may identify some parts that should  be stocked but that do not match the equipment that is actually on board.  As a result, repair crews could requisition a part for a failed piece of  equipment but find that the part is not on the allowance list and, thus,  not in stock. The requisitions data from our sample of 6 battle group  deployments showed that about 17.3 percent of the 60,365 unfilled  requisitions were for parts that were not on the ships\u2019 allowance parts lists  (see app. III).", "One reason that ship configuration records are not current or accurate  is that they are not updated or changed, as required, when equipment or  systems are installed, removed, or modified. This problem can occur on  both new and older ships. According to Navy supply and fleet officials,  the allowance lists for new ships are often based on the configuration  of the first ship to be built in the production line, and subsequent  changes to follow-on ships\u2019 configurations are not always documented.  Thus, a ship\u2019s actual configuration could change\u2014and the records not be  modified\u2014even before the ship is delivered from the shipbuilder. On older  ships, the equipment and systems are frequently upgraded or replaced  without properly updating configuration data because the procedures in  place to change configuration records as equipment is changed are not  always followed. For example, when equipment is installed, removed,  or modified by contractors, ship personnel do not always promptly or  accurately enter these changes into the ship\u2019s configuration database in  order that the spare parts required to support the altered equipment can  be ordered.", "Moreover, the Navy has not performed the configuration audits it has  identified as needed to ensure that configuration data for equipment  and weapons systems on board are accurate. According to Navy  officials, these audits are supposed to be done periodically but none  were conducted between 1995 and 2000 because of budget constraints.  Officials said they are beginning to perform configuration audits again  and are developing an audit program, but its implementation will depend  on the funding available and whether funding is earmarked specifically for  audits. The officials estimated that a viable program might cost about  $500,000 a year. Without these audits, the extent of the configuration  records\u2019 accuracy will remain unclear.", "While audits have not been conducted for a period of time, validations\u2014 which are more in-depth than audits\u2014of ships\u2019 configuration data have  revealed problems with their accuracy. The Navy performs validations to  establish the precise configuration of critical systems and equipment that  is experiencing problems and corrects the configuration data (e.g., items  are added or deleted) to reflect what is actually found on board the ships.  Seven Pacific Fleet validations completed between October 2002 and  January 2003 identified inaccuracies averaging 37 percent of the records  reviewed. For example, Navy Pacific Fleet officials provided us with  information about a configuration record validation of a new ship  delivered to the fleet. The validation identified 901 errors (588 added and  313 deleted records) in the selected systems and equipment, or about  39 percent of the 2,337 configuration records that were reviewed. On an  older aircraft carrier, a January 2003 validation identified 3,712 errors  (1,790 added and 1,922 deleted records) in the selected systems and  equipment, or about 43 percent of 8,555 configuration records reviewed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parts Demand Data Are Frequently Incomplete and Out-of-Date", "paragraphs": ["In addition to inaccurate ship configuration information, the Navy  frequently uses incomplete, outdated, or erroneous historical demand data  in its parts allowance models. This can lead to incorrect estimates of the  number of parts needed during a deployment period and result in unmet  supply goals.

Each repair part listed on the allowance list is expected to fail at  some point in normal ship operations during deployment and is a potential  allowance item.

In some cases, ship or shore personnel may not report  that a particular spare part has been used and, thus, the information does  not get into the supply system database.

Officials also suggested that it could stem from  the inability of a ship\u2019s crew to obtain a high percentage of the spare parts  on their allowance lists prior to deployment. However, our analysis  showed that, at deployment, Navy ships generally are stocked with a high  percentage of the types of parts (range) and the quantities of parts (depth)  that are on their allowance lists. Supply officials from the Navy\u2019s Pacific  Fleet told us that their goal for surface ships was to stock 93 percent of the  range and 90 percent of the depth identified on their allowance lists and  that deploying ships, which were usually given a high funding priority,  generally deployed with percentages higher than these.", "As table 3 shows, our analysis of data for the Lincoln battle group (Pacific  Fleet) deployed in fiscal year 2002 indicated that the ships were stocked  with an average of 98.1 percent of the different types of parts (range) and  an average of 93.1 percent of the quantities of each part (depth) that were  on their allowance lists, which included the parts expected to be needed  during the first 90 days of deployment (July to September 2002). In  contrast, during this period, an average of only 58.3 percent of the ships\u2019  requisitions were filled from parts carried on board.

The two forms of  reporting are high-priority maintenance work orders and casualty  reports. The Navy uses four priority codes for maintenance work,  with priorities 1, 2, and 3 considered high priority. High priority work is  defined as critical, extremely important, or important to a ship\u2019s essential  equipment and systems, operations, or mission (see app. II for complete  definitions of these codes). Navy maintenance reporting instructions  require that any maintenance job with one of these three priority codes  should generate a casualty report. According to Navy guidance on casualty  reports, they are directly related to a unit\u2019s readiness reporting and  identify the ship\u2019s equipment status and impact on the ship\u2019s operations  and mission readiness. Where casualty reports are issued, these problems  are to be reflected in a ship\u2019s readiness reporting. Our review of about  4,000 casualty reports issued for deployed Pacific Fleet ships from 1999 to  2001 indicated that they generally resulted in degraded ship readiness, as  reported by the Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS).  SORTS is used DOD-wide to report the degree to which a unit is capable of  undertaking its assigned wartime missions.", "However, our analysis of ship maintenance work orders and casualty  reports for one battle group (Truman) in the Atlantic Fleet deployed in  fiscal year 2000 showed a discrepancy between the number of work orders  with priority 1, 2, or 3 and the number of casualty reports that were filled  out when a job was assigned one of these priority codes. The work orders  indicated that, of 5,435 total maintenance jobs, 2,635 were identified as  priority 1, 2, or 3. Although there should have been a similar number of  casualty reports, only 906, or one-third of the 2,635, were issued for these  ships during this period of time. One must assume that a more complete  reporting of casualty reports, as required for high priority maintenance  work orders, would provide the basis for a more complete assessment  of readiness.", "A similar discrepancy occurred between the number of high-priority  work orders and casualty reports issued for maintenance jobs on surface  ships in the Pacific Fleet between fiscal years 1995 and 2002. According  to a Pacific Fleet maintenance analyst, of about 1 million surface ship  maintenance jobs coded with priority 1, 2, or 3, only about 50,000 casualty  reports, or about 5 percent, were issued.", "Although Navy guidance calls for up-to-date and accurate casualty reports,  Navy officials said that the final decision on whether to submit a casualty  report is left to the judgment of the ships\u2019 commanders and is based on  their perception of the importance of the degraded equipment to the ships\u2019  assigned missions and the status of redundant equipment that the ships  carry. Navy officials said that the number of casualty reports that are  issued should be higher, but they suggested that commanders\u2019 concerns  that a high number of such reports could reflect negatively on their  leadership may limit the number of reports that are issued. For example,  we were told that casualty reports are usually not generated when ships  are getting ready to deploy; if too many are generated, it might be seen as a  failure of the ships\u2019 command leadership.", "Some ships that issued only a few minor casualty reports were found,  on closer inspection, to have significant ship operations and mission  readiness problems. For example, Navy ships are required to have periodic  inspections to determine if they are fit for further service and to identify  any conditions that limit their capability to carry out assigned missions.  Inspection reports we reviewed identified various deficiencies, such as  the failure of equipment to meet performance and safety requirements or  the need for excessive maintenance resources. During an inspection in  February 2002 of a destroyer forward-deployed in Yokosuka, Japan,  which had issued 16 low-priority casualty reports prior to the inspection,  inspectors gave the ship an unsatisfactory rating\u2014the lowest possible  rating\u2014in the areas of self-defense, full power, and steering tests; they  also found that it had significant material deficiencies and equipment  operational capabilities discrepancies.

They said that allowance lists used to be  reviewed and updated periodically, but these reviews are no  longer performed.

The Navy uses  inaccurate, out-of-date, or incomplete ship configuration and historical  demand information to develop the parts allowance lists that identify what  repair parts, manuals, and other related items a ship should carry in its  onboard inventory. Even though a ship may stock almost all of the parts  on the allowance list, it is likely to fall short of meeting the Navy\u2019s  supply performance goals because the data used to develop the  allowance lists are inaccurate.

Because of inaccuracies in the information the Navy uses to develop its  allowance lists, it often stocks the wrong types or the wrong quantities  of parts on board ships. As a result, the Navy has to spend additional  money to obtain the parts it needs from off-ship sources, often incurring  high expenses to locate the parts and transport them to the ships. It also  expends substantial funds to maintain large inventories on board its ships  that are not requisitioned during deployments. However, the Navy has  given low priority to purging unneeded parts from its ships\u2019 inventories  and, instead, has focused on purchasing additional spare parts to avoid  future shortages.", "Until the reliance on poor ship configuration records and historical  demand information to identify what spare parts should be carried on  board is broken, the Navy\u2019s deployed ships will continue to experience  critical spare parts shortages that undermine their ability to fulfill their  missions at sea."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve supply availability, enhance operations and mission  readiness, and reduce operating costs for deployed ships, we recommend  the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy to    develop plans to conduct periodic ship configuration audits and to ensure  that configuration records are updated and maintained in order that  accurate inventory data can be developed for deployed ships;    ensure that demand data for parts entered into ship supply systems are  recorded promptly and accurately as required to ensure that onboard ship  inventories reflect current usage or demands;    periodically identify and purge spare parts from ship inventories to reduce  costs when parts have not been requisitioned for long periods of time and  are not needed according to current and accurate configuration and parts  demand information; and    ensure that casualty reports are issued consistent with high priority  maintenance work orders, as required by Navy instruction, to provide a  more complete assessment of ship\u2019s readiness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with three  recommendations and concurred with the intent of the fourth  recommendation, but not its specific action. DOD\u2019s written comments are  reprinted in their entirety in appendix IV.", "In concurring with our first recommendation, DOD said that, although the  Navy has an audit plan to look at current ship configurations and provide  updated allowance listings, the Navy needs to be more aggressive in  following up on configuration changes to ensure that the configuration  records on board ship match those in the Navy\u2019s main configuration  database. At the time of our review, the procedures had not been validated  and reconciled, for example, with the high percentages of inaccuracies  identified during validations done to identify and correct problems;  moreover, sufficient funding to implement the program was not assured.  DOD also noted that the Navy recently set up a Maritime Allowancing  Working Group that is undertaking a comprehensive review of its current  inventory and allowance practices, including ship configuration  management. However, at the time of our review, the Navy had not  established time frames for reporting on this effort.", "Although DOD concurred with our second recommendation, it asserted  that our report does not adequately substantiate our claim about the  accuracy of demand data. In our report, however, we cited Navy officials  who told us that spare parts\u2019 failure rates, which rely on demand data, are  not always updated promptly or accurately. Moreover, 60,000 requisitions  for spare parts were not on ships in 6 battle groups deployed in fiscal  years 1999 and 2000 either because they were not on allowance parts  lists or were on these lists but were not in stock when requisitioned  (see app. III). Navy officials told us that such shortages occur in part from  relying on inaccurate demand data. DOD pointed out that many items on  the lists do not qualify for allowances. They said that these parts are not  stocked on board because of a ship\u2019s designated repair capability, the  results of the readiness optimization calculation used in the sparing model,  and the forecast for demand falling below the sparing threshold. However,  these determinations also rely on accurate and timely demand data.", "In concurring with our third recommendation, DOD said that the Navy  needs to undertake a more comprehensive program to identify and,  when appropriate, purge excess spare parts from ship inventories, but it  added that such efforts should not be based solely on parts demand  history. In our recommendation, we said that decisions to remove spare  parts from ship inventories should be based on both demand data and  current and accurate ship configuration information. DOD correctly  noted that critical items related to safety requirements and readiness  optimization should not be removed because they could jeopardize a  ship\u2019s safety and mission. We support the Navy\u2019s plan to focus initially on  identifying and purging those spare parts that support systems that are no  longer installed on board ships.", "DOD concurred with the intent of our fourth recommendation that called  for the Navy to ensure that casualty reports are issued consistent with high  priority maintenance work orders as required by Navy instruction, to  provide a more complete assessment of ship\u2019s readiness. We based our  recommendation on the Navy\u2019s current maintenance instruction that calls  for casualty reports to be issued for certain high-priority maintenance  actions according to the level of importance that the failed equipment has  on a ship\u2019s operations and mission. DOD said that casualty reports and  maintenance orders are inherently different in purpose, and the  instructions should be updated to ensure that casualty reports are  generated when deemed appropriate to get the attention required from the  logistics system. We believe that, while the instruction may need to be  updated or revised, the maintenance data that are gathered under the  current instruction are both relevant and important to the Navy\u2019s ability to  assess fully a ship\u2019s operations and mission readiness. In its response,  DOD said the Navy has emphasized the need to use standardized reporting  procedures and that fleet commanders have asked their commanding  officers to report on ship status accurately and in a timely manner through  the Status of Resources and Training System report.", "We are sending this report to other interested congressional committees;  the Secretary of Defense; the Secretary of the Navy; and the Director,  Office of Management and Budget.

We analyzed  the Navy\u2019s goal and supply effectiveness data from its Maintenance and  Material Management (3-M) Database Open Architectural Retrieval System  by identifying supply requisitions for repair parts that were either filled or  not filled from inventories on board deployed ships. We reviewed reports  regarding the Navy\u2019s overall ability to fill onboard spare parts requisitions  on deployed ships between 1982 and 2001 in order to identify any long- term trends.

We analyzed and categorized the reasons for parts shortages  based on the reported data. We also examined Navy policies and  procedures regarding ships\u2019 spare parts, including the need for accurate  data and the impact of inaccurate data on the allowed parts carried on  deployed ships. We examined and discussed with Navy officials the  procedures that are used to ensure that accurate ship configuration  and demand data records are maintained and the circumstances that  can affect this accuracy. Moreover, we analyzed the reasons for the  differences between the spare parts provisions, (e.g., the range and depth)  and the amounts that are actually used to fill spare parts requisitions in  order to gain a better understanding of why the Navy\u2019s provisioning  process does not more effectively and efficiently meet the deployed ships\u2019  spare parts requirements.", "To examine the impact of spare parts shortages on deployed ships\u2019  operations and mission readiness, we analyzed data on maintenance work  orders and requests for spare parts that were not available on board the  6 battle groups during selected fiscal year 1999-2000 deployments.  Also, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s criteria for assessing the effects of failed  equipment on a ship\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission, particularly  the standards for determining what maintenance work orders result in  casualty reports. We then applied the criteria to maintenance work orders  for the Truman (Atlantic Fleet) battle group deployed in fiscal year 2000 to  identify those that should have resulted in casualty reports reflecting ship  operations and mission readiness. We compared the results of this analysis  with data on Navy casualty reporting to determine if the number of failed  equipment items meeting the criteria for reporting mission readiness  degradation were reported in accordance with Navy criteria, policies, and  procedures. We also reviewed data on casualty reports and SORTS data  submitted by deployed Pacific Fleet surface ships during calendar years  1999, 2000, and 2001 to determine if the casualty reports were reflected in  SORTS equipment readiness reporting. In addition, for six ships in the  Lincoln (Pacific Fleet) battle group deployed in fiscal year 2002, we  identified the total number of parts carried, both range and depth, and  compared this to the number of requisitions submitted and filled from  onboard inventories. We compared the Navy\u2019s data on the estimated value  of the onboard inventory with the estimated value of the inventory actually  used in order to gain insight into the dollar impacts of carrying parts that  are not used during ships\u2019 deployments.
