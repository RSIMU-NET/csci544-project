For example, activities involving Congress or politically affiliated entities raised issues about whether they were covered by the acts' specific lobbying restrictions. Even if these activities were permitted, issues remained about whether Congress anticipated that assessment funds would be used to fund them, particularly when PERC and NORA classified this spending as \u201cconsumer education\u201d\u2014one of the functions required by the acts. Other issues GAO identified related to whether Congress anticipated that PERC and NORA would allocate the majority of their funding to education activities over the past decade (more than half), while allocating relatively little financial support to research and development (8 percent for PERC and less than 6 percent for NORA). When the laws were debated and before they were enacted, research and development had been a key area of congressional interest and ultimately was reflected as both a mandatory \u201cfunction\u201d and a high-focus \u201cpriority\u201d in the final version passed by Congress", "GAO found limited federal oversight of PERC and NORA. As of June 2010, the Department of Energy had not used the oversight authority granted by the Propane and Oilheat acts, such as by reviewing budgets or making recommendations to PERC and NORA, as authorized by law. This lack of oversight was long-standing.

We  also found that minutes of an August 2008 NORA executive committee  meeting indicated that the NORA President said he was seeking state  senators\u2019 support for NORA reauthorization and that a December 2008  NORA-qualified Massachusetts state association newsletter indicated that  the NORA President traveled to Washington to urge both Massachusetts  senators to support NORA reauthorization.", "We found that neither the Propane Act nor the Oilheat Act provided  guidance on what constitutes \u201cinfluencing legislation or elections;\u201d there  was little pertinent legislative history; no court had addressed what this  language means as used in these statutes; and other federal laws  containing similar language had been interpreted in different ways.
