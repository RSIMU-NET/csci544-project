GAO examined six federally-administered access control efforts across three federal departments. Efforts were selected, among other things, to represent a range of efforts that groups of users\u2014such as truck drivers\u2014may encounter while accessing multiple facilities.

Each of these efforts applies to a different type of infrastructure. For example, the Transportation Security Administration's Transportation Worker Identification Credential controls access to ports, the Department of Defense (DOD) Common Access Card controls access to military installations, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates access to commercial nuclear power plants. GAO found that selected characteristics, such as whether a federal agency or another party has responsibility for vetting or what types of prior criminal offenses might disqualify applicants, varied across these access control efforts. In addition, these access control efforts generally affect two groups of stakeholders\u2014users and operators\u2014differently depending on their specific roles and interests. Users are individuals who require access to critical infrastructure as an essential function of their job; while, operators own or manage facilities, such as airports and chemical facilities. Regardless of infrastructure type, users and operators that GAO interviewed reported some common factors that can present challenges in their use of these access controls. For example, both users and operators reported that applicants requiring access to similar types of infrastructure or facilities may be required to submit the same background information multiple times, which can be costly and inefficient.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) relies on partnership models to support collaboration efforts among federal and nonfederal critical infrastructure stakeholders, but has not taken actions to harmonize federally-administered access control efforts across critical infrastructure sectors. According to DHS officials, these partnerships have not explored harmonization of access control efforts across sectors, because this has not been raised as a key issue by the members and because DHS does not have a dedicated forum that would engage user groups in exploring these issues and identifying potential solutions. DHS's partnership models offer a mechanism by which DHS and its partners can explore the challenges users and operators may encounter and determine opportunities for harmonizing the screening and credentialing processes to address these challenges.", "DHS's Screening Coordination Office (SCO) has taken actions to support harmonization across DHS access control efforts, but it has not updated its goals and objectives to help guide progress toward the department's broader strategic framework for harmonization. SCO's strategic framework is based on two screening and credentialing policy documents\u2014the 2006 Credentialing Initiative Report and 2008 Credentialing Framework Initiative. According to SCO officials, they continue to rely on these documents to provide their office with a high-level strategic approach, but GAO found that the goals and objectives outlined in the two documents are no longer current or relevant. In recent years, SCO has helped the department make progress toward its harmonization efforts by responding to and assisting with department-wide initiatives and DHS component needs, such as developing new programs or restructuring existing ones. However, without updated goals and objectives, SCO cannot ensure that it is best supporting DHS-wide screening and credentialing harmonization efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that (1) DHS work with partners to identify any opportunities to harmonize access control efforts across critical infrastructure sectors and (2) SCO establish goals and objectives to support its broader strategic framework for harmonization.

Strengthening and  maintaining secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure  requires proactive and coordinated efforts. This endeavor is a shared  responsibility among federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial entities, and  public and private owners and operators of critical infrastructure. One  aspect of maintaining secure critical infrastructure is access control\u2014that  is, limiting the access to physical facilities and assets to only those who  have a legitimate need and have been vetted to ensure there is no  evidence that they pose a risk.

We selected four access control efforts administered by  DHS based on our review of the CIR and identified the seven DHS  screening and credentialing effort related to access control. Those seven  access related efforts are a subset of other DHS credentialing efforts that  focused on screening efforts related to access to controlled locations,  such as ports or secure areas. We selected three of these seven DHS  access efforts because they regulate or facilitate access to critical  infrastructure assets. Because the three access control efforts identified  from DHS\u2019s CIR were related to the transportation sector, we included  another effort within DHS, but for another sector\u2014CFATS, which is  related to the chemical sector but not included in the CIR because it was  implemented after 2006.", "To provide context and perspective on government-wide efforts, we also  selected federal efforts administered by agencies outside of DHS. To  identify these two efforts, we spoke with DHS federal administrators or  nonfederal stakeholders related to the four access control efforts we  selected above to obtain information on other frequently used access  control efforts they identified as relevant to accessing secure critical  infrastructure.

The results from our selection  are not generalizable, but they provide perspectives on organizational  structures and operational policies and procedures across different  infrastructure types and different federal agencies.", "To collect information on the key characteristics of the federal access  control efforts in our review, we developed a standard set of questions  based on the credentialing and screening phases identified in DHS\u2019s  2006 CIR and submitted it to DHS, DOD, and NRC federal administrators.  We reviewed relevant regulations, policies and procedures, and  interviewed DHS, DOD, and NRC administrators to corroborate the  information obtained from the standard set of questions.", "To determine the factors that had an impact on stakeholders\u2019 use of the  access control efforts, we interviewed user and operator stakeholder  groups. To identify the types of users and operators that may encounter  the federal critical infrastructure access control efforts in our review, we  consulted our prior critical infrastructure work, spoke with agency officials  from DHS, NRC, and DOD, and reviewed published DHS critical  infrastructure documentation. We met with nonfederal stakeholder groups  that represented owners and operators who are responsible for managing  critical infrastructure facilities, for example, the American Association of  Airport Executives. To select associations representing user groups, we  limited our selection to users that would regularly require access to  multiple types of critical infrastructure, such as truck drivers and skilled  trades workers, such as the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.

These federal  administrators help operators of critical infrastructure assets safeguard  the assets against attacks, sabotage, theft, or misuse while facilitating  legitimate access to help ensure the flow of business and operations. In  efforts to serve operator needs, administrators must also ensure  compliance with federal laws and regulations. Federal agencies play a  variety of roles in helping to strike this balance, including but not limited to  (1) owning and operating certain types of infrastructure, (2) wholesale  operation and management of credentialing programs for specific kinds of  infrastructure, (3) partial operation and management of credentialing  programs, and (4) providing regulations and guidance to help owners and  operators implement effective access control. For example, DHS\u2019s  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) manages the entire  Transportation Worker Identification  Credential (TWIC) qualification  process including enrollment, background checks, and credential  issuance. However, for the Secure Identification  Display Area (SIDA)  badge, which facilitates access at airports, and is managed in part by  TSA, airport operators use TSA\u2019s background check information to  ultimately make final decisions about airport access and badge issuance.  Similarly, NRC issues regulations related to access control requirements,  which are to be implemented by commercial nuclear power plants, and  DOD owns and operates U.S. military installations and facilities and uses  the Common Access Card (CAC) as one method to facilitate access to  semi-restricted areas within the installations.", "Workers who need access to multiple types of critical infrastructure to  realize their livelihoods\u2014such as truck drivers and carpenters\u2014often  encounter different access control efforts.

Similarly, industries that work across different critical infrastructure  sectors may encounter multiple federal access control efforts. For  example, a company producing or storing regulated chemicals on both  land and at seaports may encounter different access control efforts  depending on the location of the facility.", "See Table 1 for a list of selected federally-administered critical  infrastructure access control efforts and a brief description of each effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Federal Access Control Efforts have Similar Processes, but Three Key Factors Had an Impact on Stakeholders", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Access Control Efforts Follow Similar Processes, but Specific Characteristics of the Efforts Vary", "paragraphs": ["While the six selected federally administered access control efforts we  reviewed had varying purposes, standards, or agency responsibilities,  they generally included the following process components or phases of  DHS\u2019s credentialing lifecycle as depicted in Figure 1.", "Although the six efforts we reviewed generally follow similar processes,  certain characteristics within these efforts can vary.

Users  are individuals who require access to critical infrastructure as an essential  function of their job. Users we interviewed that require access to multiple  types of critical infrastructure said they recognize the need for security,  but are interested in streamlined access control efforts to facilitate  legitimate access in a manner that minimizes the related time and costs  they incur. They also told us they desire the maximum possible uniformity  across standards for background investigation and disqualifying offenses  to enhance predictability. Operators are individuals or groups who own or  are responsible for managing facilities, such as airports, seaports, and  chemical facilities, which may be privately owned, but can also include  other government-owned facilities such as military installations.  Operators, we spoke with, who are responsible for providing security for  critical infrastructure, said they need to maintain control over who enters  their facilities so they can manage their accepted level of risk along with  the associated costs. Operators said they prefer to retain maximum  decision-making authority for granting access as well as the type of  credential they use to verify proper vetting.", "Based on our interviews with stakeholder groups and associations, the  issues mentioned that had an impact on users and operators included (1)  operators may add access requirements to vetting and background  checks already conducted for federally administered programs; (2)  credentials that cannot be used within and across critical infrastructure  sectors; and (3) enrollment information that has to be entered multiple  times for the same user for similar purposes. It is important to note that  although these issues can present challenges for various users and  operators, they do not necessarily reflect a deficiency on the part of any  specific access control effort or stakeholder group. For the most part,  these six selected efforts were created separately in response to different  needs, are largely governed by different laws and regulations, and were  not necessarily designed to work together."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Facility Operators May Consider Additional Requirements in Making Final Access Decisions", "paragraphs": ["User groups we interviewed expressed a desire to be able to predict  denial of access based on clear and standardized requirements; while  operator groups described the need for some variability in requirements  across sites, so they can manage their context-specific risks. Part of the  eligibility  vetting process for all the six selected access control efforts we  reviewed includes determining if an applicant is on the known or  suspected terrorist list or has a criminal history with certain disqualifying  offenses that warrant denial of the access. Specific disqualifying offenses  can vary across these federal efforts because of differences in the  statutes that established the federal efforts. This variability can create  some level of complexity for the users of multiple federally-administered  efforts, which is compounded when individual  on-site critical infrastructure  operators impose additional requirements. For example, according to  association members representing carpenters, the lack of consistency  around whether individuals can qualify for access has led to difficulties  aligning staff with critical project tasks. As a result, the time associated  with identifying disqualifying offenses can lead to challenges with meeting  scheduled project timelines and budgets.", "For all six selected federal access control efforts we reviewed, regardless  of the way the access effort was structured (whether the infrastructure is  government or privately owned and whether an effort is wholly managed  by a federal agency or guided by regulation), we found that on-site  operators can make the final decision about who can enter their facilities.  During our interviews with users and operators we found that on-site  operators across multiple infrastructure types have considered additional  disqualifying offenses beyond federal baseline requirements. For example  with SIDA, CFATS, and commercial nuclear power plants that are  regulated under NRC the individual operator examines the individual\u2019s  criminal background information and makes his or her own determination  regarding access based on their perception of acceptable risk.", "In addition, we found that site-specific decision making was taking place  under federal efforts for which the government was the sole vetting  authority, such as TWIC. For example, port authority representatives told  us that ports often perform site-specific background checks even for  those individuals with an issued TWIC. Port authority representatives  provided two key reasons for conducting their own site-specific  background checks on top of the federal government\u2019s process: (1) the  ability to view an individual\u2019s comprehensive and recent criminal history  and (2) the ability to consider factors that may not be covered in TWIC\u2019s  list of disqualifying offenses. Some operator groups that we spoke with  noted that the disqualifying offenses covered by programs like TWIC,  which is designed to limit terrorism risk, do not cover the full range of  safety and security concerns that are ultimately their responsibility to  control. For example, a representative from the American Association of  Airport Executives told us that airports have the discretion to consider  requirements beyond federal regulations, which can be used to disqualify  applicants for a SIDA. These additional requirements may reside in state  or local ordinance, and can vary from airport to airport. Consequently,  some operators perform additional vetting on site, which allows them to  align vetting policies and procedures with their accepted types and level  of risk.", "Even when the federal government has sole vetting authority, facility  operators and military installation commanders can choose to add  additional vetting procedures to ensure they are managing their facilities  based on their own accepted level of risk. For example, in 2009, DOD  issued a policy directive to accept, among others, the TWIC and the CAC  as identification documents authorized to facilitate physical access to  installations. However, according to DOD headquarters officials, the  military services maintained that the TWIC was not intended to be used  for access to military installations, and consequently this policy has not  been implemented uniformly across DOD. For example, truck drivers  holding TWIC cards and serving military installations have been at times  required to undergo additional background and security checks.  According to trucking industry representatives, inconsistency across DOD  installations is a source of concern as they do not know what might be  required of drivers who are trying to gain access. In addition, delays in  gaining access to installations can result in increased costs for the truck  drivers, and potentially create cascading delays for their subsequent  deliveries. Installation commanders have been given the authority to  supplement the DOD procedures and process for accessing their  installation to help ensure appropriate response to risk with real-time  information and decision making. Consequently, the requirements for  access can vary by installation. A TSA official also noted that certain  sex offenders may be able to get a TWIC, depending on the offense and  when the individual was convicted or released from incarceration. The  TSA official stated that this is because sexual offenses are not  permanently disqualifying under the TWIC statute and may not point to a  terrorism or security risk of a regulated maritime facility; however, a  military commander may not want to allow that individual onto his or her  installation where families with young children are housed and so may  consider such offenses disqualifying."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credentials Generally Cannot be Used Within or Across Critical Infrastructure Sectors", "paragraphs": ["User groups we interviewed generally expressed a desire for reciprocity  across federally-administered access control efforts, in particular when  such efforts have or appear to have the same or similar underlying vetting  processes and associated risks. Operators, on the other hand, had mixed  perspectives on this issue. While some operators emphasized finding  solutions to enhance access control reciprocity, others cited barriers to or  challenges with a more uniform approach.", "Among the six selected access control efforts we reviewed, we found  limited mechanisms to use one credential for access to similar facilities  within and across sectors (i.e., reciprocity). Two examples of reciprocity  are DOD\u2019s CAC, which generally allows access into the semi-restricted  areas of most military installations, and the CFATS Personnel Surety  Program, which allows regulated high-risk chemical facilities to accept  previously-issued TWICs to grant access if they are electronically verified,  or other credentials issued through a federally administered screening  program, if they are visually verified, and if the screening program  periodically vets enrolled individuals against the Terrorist Screening  Database. Across the chemical sector, chemical facility access is  facilitated by two different access control efforts depending on where the  chemical facility is located\u2014land-based facilities are governed by CFATS  and maritime-based facilities are governed by TWIC. Officials from  NPPD, the DHS component that administers CFATS, stated that NPPD  explored allowing land-based chemical facility users to enroll in the TWIC  program, but DHS has interpreted the Maritime Transportation Security  Act of 2002 to provide limited authority to do so. However, individuals in  the field of transportation who are eligible for a TWIC may apply for and  receive that credential to satisfy the CFATS requirement. NPPD officials  stated that facilities may also use screening results from other agencies,  such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, as  long as the vetting process includes checking against the Terrorist  Screening Database."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biographic Information is Collected Multiple Times across Selected Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The user stakeholders we interviewed expressed a desire to be able to  enter their biographic information once during the registration and  enrollment phase, and have that information reused for other access  control efforts, and where possible, for background check processing.  Some operator groups we interviewed indicated that it was costly and  inefficient for operators and users to enter biographic data multiple times.  However, federal administrators are limited in their ability to share  biographic information across screening efforts because of information  technology, and privacy considerations. Among the six access control  efforts we reviewed, there are some mechanisms to reuse biographic  information; however, there are no set requirements to do so. For  example, operators may collect complete biographic information each  time a user applies for a SIDA badge for an airport facility. A user group  said that it would like to be able to reuse their biographic information for  airports, but TSA officials we interviewed stated that any proposed  solution to reuse biographic information would be affected by privacy  considerations. Under federal law, personal information collected and  maintained by an agency for a particular effort may not be disclosed to  another agency, with certain exceptions.", "In contrast, within NRC\u2019s regulated commercial nuclear power plants,  operators use the Personnel Access Database System (PADS) in  cooperation with NRC that allows users to provide biographic information  once to access multiple facilities because potential employees sign a  release of information form to use the system. Users and operators  agreed that they benefited from the ease of PADS because they do not  have to submit biographic information for each facility. They told us that  PADS allows for employee data to be shared across NRC nuclear power  plant facilities in part because it is an industry-operated system that is not  constrained by federal privacy requirements that would apply to federal  systems."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Partnership Structures Provide Opportunities to Harmonize Access Control Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Uses Partnership Structures for Critical Infrastructure Protection", "paragraphs": ["DHS has established roles and responsibilities for supporting  collaboration efforts among key stakeholders across critical infrastructure  sectors.

However, NPPD IP officials responsible for  overseeing CIPAC and ISC stated that their cross-sector partnership  structures have engaged in limited efforts to explore harmonization of  access control efforts, because harmonization has not been raised as a  key issue or urgent concern by its members.", "However, NPPD IP officials stated that issues raised when considering  the user perspectives alongside the operator perspectives would not  necessarily have emerged in these groups, because as of October 2016,  none of the existing CIPAC partnership forums would be appropriate for  users or user groups\u2014such as contractors, workers, and others seeking  access to multiple critical infrastructure facilities\u2014to share their  experiences or concerns. As of October 2016, DHS does not have a  dedicated partnership structure that allows for users to share their  experiences in navigating through federal access control efforts.  Additionally,  DHS officials stated that users are not specifically included in  the NIPP\u2019s Sector Partnership Model.", "Moreover, NPPD IP officials from the Sector Outreach and Programs  Division, who are responsible for coordinating DHS\u2019s partnership  structures, stated that government and industry stakeholders have begun  initial discussions to enhance information sharing efforts, which could  include leveraging information across access control efforts. Specifically,  NPPD IP officials reported that during a biannual meeting in July 2016,  CIPAC members discussed ways to improve information sharing efforts  between government and industry stakeholders related to harmonizing  access control efforts. Further, they reported that government and  industry stakeholders agreed to create a CIPAC standing committee  designed to identify key concerns and engage with members to propose  recommendations aimed at enhancing information sharing efforts.  Although this effort represents a step towards beginning the discussion of  harmonizing access controls efforts, DHS has not fully engaged all  relevant stakeholders, specifically users, to explore whether additional  opportunities exist to harmonize access control efforts across critical  infrastructure sectors. Using existing partnership structures or creating  new forums could help DHS more effectively fulfill its role as the facilitator  of shared best practices and enhanced collaboration across critical  infrastructure partners. In doing so, DHS may be better positioned to  identify and implement opportunities to enhance efficiencies within and  across related access control efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SCO Has Taken Actions to Harmonize DHS Access Control Efforts, but Has Not Updated Its Goals and Objectives to Support Its Strategic Framework", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SCO Goals and Actions to Harmonize DHS Access Control Efforts", "paragraphs": ["A role of SCO, according to DHS Office of Policy officials, is to serve as a  department-wide policy advocate for coordination and harmonization of  credentialing and screening efforts within DHS. SCO, which is located in  the DHS Office of Policy, maintains roughly 30 full-time equivalent staff  across different portfolio teams, such as Identity  and Credentialing and  Watchlisting and Vetting. SCO officials stated that while it is not the sole  entity responsible for assessing and harmonizing screening processes  across the department, the office provides subject matter expertise and  guidance on screening and credentialing policies and practices with the  aim of reducing duplicative, stand-alone DHS programs and processes.  SCO works with DHS components that are responsible for overseeing  screening and credentialing efforts, such as TSA and NPPD, to achieve  DHS\u2019s screening and credentialing harmonization objectives. These  objectives include identifying and resolving policy issues and program  challenges associated with screening and credentialing, supporting  department-wide resources that service screening and credentialing  efforts, integrating interdependent resources and processes across DHS  programs, and representing DHS to external stakeholders.", "SCO officials reported that their primary activities fall into three general  categories: consultant activities, investment-related decision activities,  and working group participatory activities. Specifically, SCO officials  stated that they assist DHS components in developing and improving  credentialing and screening programs by participating in department-wide  budget decisions, and through departmental or component-specific  working groups that help guide the development of new programs or the  restructuring of existing programs.", "According to officials, SCO relies on two foundational policy documents  as the overarching strategic framework for promoting harmonization and  instructing components on methods for improving access control  programs and processes\u2014the 2006 Credentialing Initiative Report (CIR)  and the 2008 Credentialing Framework Initiative (CFI). The CIR  identified common problems, challenges, and areas where DHS could  improve screening and credentialing programs and processes. Examples  of identified problem areas include inconsistent vetting processes for  similar programs and the issuance of multiple credentials in cases where  one would be sufficient. The report also identified four recommendations  for addressing the aforementioned problems. As part of its efforts to  address the recommendations outlined in the CIR, SCO published the  CFI, an implementation strategy document designed to guide investments  and improve the department\u2019s ability to meet its mission by improving  screening and credentialing processes.", "SCO officials stated that they have engaged with DHS components to  advance screening and credentialing efficiencies over the past ten years  of operation. Through internal annual accomplishment reports and in  interviews, SCO provided several examples of activities they have  undertaken to advance each of the recommendations outlined in the CIR  to advance screening and credentialing efficiencies.", "Recommendation 1: Design credentials to support multiple  licenses, privileges or status. SCO led a Common Enrollment  Coordinating Council (CECC) sub-team, which was tasked to  identify opportunities to develop best practices in DHS\u2019 screening  and credentialing enrollment environment.

SCO partnered  with NPPD and TSA to implement the CFATS Personnel Surety  Program, which requires that individuals seeking access to  restricted areas or critical assets within high-risk chemical facilities  are vetted for ties to terrorism. According to SCO and NPPD  officials, SCO worked with NPPD to ensure that CFATS vetting  standards were aligned with existing DHS vetting efforts to allow  the use of screening resources from TSA.", "Recommendation 3: Entitlement to a license, privilege, or  status should be verified using electronic scanning  technology. SCO officials stated they consulted with the U.S.  Coast Guard to develop draft regulations pertaining to the  implementation of electronic card readers at maritime facilities to  more effectively validate the authenticity of TWIC cards.  SCO  officials stated that many maritime facilities are currently validating  TWICs using visual inspection, and these regulations are  designed to help reduce that practice. As we have previously  reported, the reliance on the visual inspection of TWICs is  vulnerable to the use of counterfeit credentials to gain access.", "Recommendation 4: Establish a preference for \u2018enroll once,  use many\u2019  environments.

Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government calls for agencies to define objectives clearly to meet its  mission, strategic plan, goals, and requirements of applicable laws and  regulations. Further, the standards call for management to define  objectives in specific and measurable terms so they are understood at all  levels of the entity. This involves clearly defining what is to be achieved,  who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the timeframes for  achievement.
