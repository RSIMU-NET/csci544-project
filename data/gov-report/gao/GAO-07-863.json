These resources generally occur within four ecosystem types: coasts and oceans, forests, fresh waters, and grasslands and shrublands. GAO obtained experts' views on (1) the effects of climate change on federal resources and (2) the challenges managers face in addressing climate change effects on these resources. GAO held a workshop with the National Academies in which 54 scientists, economists, and federal resource managers participated, and conducted 4 case studies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to experts at the GAO workshop, federal land and water resources are vulnerable to a wide range of effects from climate change, some of which are already occurring. These effects include, among others, (1) physical effects, such as droughts, floods, glacial melting, and sea level rise; (2) biological effects, such as increases in insect and disease infestations, shifts in species distribution, and changes in the timing of natural events; and (3) economic and social effects, such as adverse impacts on tourism, infrastructure, fishing, and other resource uses. Experts at the GAO workshop also identified several challenges that resource managers face in addressing the observed and potential effects of climate change in their management and planning efforts. In particular, BLM, FS, FWS, NOAA, and NPS have not made climate change a priority, and the agencies' strategic plans do not specifically address climate change. Resource managers focus first on near-term, required activities, leaving less time for addressing longer-term issues such as climate change. In addition, resource managers have limited guidance about whether or how to address climate change and, therefore, are uncertain about what actions, if any, they should take. In general, resource managers lack specific guidance for incorporating climate change into their management actions and planning efforts. Without such guidance, their ability to address climate change and effectively manage resources is constrained. While a broad order developed in January 2001 directed BLM, FWS, and NPS to consider and analyze potential climate change effects in their management plans and activities, the agencies have not yet provided specific direction to managers on how they are to implement the order. A BLM official stated at an April 2007 hearing that BLM is establishing policy and technical committees to address necessary actions and develop guidance to address climate change in agency management practices. FWS and NPS officials said that their agencies have not developed specific guidance but believe that they are operating in a manner consistent with the 2001 order. While NOAA and FS have not provided specific guidance to their resource managers, NOAA officials said that the agency is establishing a working group to determine what actions to take to address climate change effects. FS officials said that FS planning processes are designed to identify and respond to emerging issues such as climate change. Finally, resource managers do not have sufficient site-specific information to plan for and manage the effects of climate change on the federal resources they manage. In particular, the managers lack computational models for local projections of expected changes and detailed inventories and monitoring systems for an adequate baseline understanding of existing local species. Without such information, managers are limited to reacting to already-observed climate change effects on their units, which makes it difficult to plan for future changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A growing body of evidence shows that increasing concentrations of  greenhouse gases\u2014primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous  oxide\u2014in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere have resulted in a warmer global climate  system, among other changes.

The  stresses caused by climate change could be exacerbated by existing  stresses on ecosystems from such sources as pollution, human settlement,  land-use change, and invasion by nonnative species. Together, climate  change and ecosystem stresses may cause substantial damage to, or the  complete loss of, some ecosystems and the extinction of species.  Furthermore, scientists project that changes in temperature and  precipitation may result in more extreme weather events, such as more  frequent and severe droughts, storms, and floods as well as changes in local  climate conditions.", "Federal agencies manage over 600 million acres of land\u2014almost 30 percent  of the land area of the United States\u2014and more than 150,000 square miles  of protected waters, including 13 national marine sanctuaries and 1 marine  national monument.

Federal resources also support a range of  economically and socially valuable activities, such as mineral extraction  and recreation. In fiscal year 2005, the public visited federal lands over   600 million times, according to estimates by Agriculture and Interior.", "These agencies manage their resources for a variety of purposes related to  preservation; recreation; and, in some cases, resource use, yet each agency  has distinct responsibilities for the resources it administers. The statutes  governing these agencies\u2019 resource management activities generally do not  require the agencies to manage for specific outcomes, such as a certain  number of visitors, or to provide a specific response to changes in  ecological conditions, such as insect outbreaks. Instead, these laws give  the agencies discretion to decide how best to carry out their  responsibilities in light of their respective statutory missions as well as the  need to comply with or implement specific substantive and procedural  laws, such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), or the Clean Air Act. The agencies are  generally authorized to plan and manage for changes in resource  conditions, regardless of the cause that brings about the change. As a  result, federal resource management agencies are generally authorized, but  are not specifically required, to address changes in resource conditions  resulting from climate change in their management activities.", "In this context, we obtained (1) experts\u2019 views on the observed and  potential effects of climate change on federal resources within the four  principal ecosystem types and (2) the views of federal resource managers  on the challenges they face in addressing the observed and potential future  effects of climate change in their management actions and planning efforts.  In addition, four case studies illustrate some of the effects of climate  change on federal resources as well as the challenges to addressing them.", "To solicit experts\u2019 views on the effects of climate change and federal  resource managers\u2019 views on the challenges to addressing climate change  on federal resources within the four ecosystem types, we convened a 2-day  workshop in collaboration with the National Academies\u2019 Board on  Atmospheric Sciences and Climate. Descriptions in this report of the  effects of climate change come from experts at the workshop; we did not  independently review articles from the scientific literature or verify  participants\u2019 statements. To identify experts for the first day of the  workshop, which addressed science issues, the National Academies and  GAO agreed on selection criteria, which included recommendations from  other experts, a demonstrated record of publication in the field, and  experience contributing to climate change impact assessments or other  peer-reviewed scientific reports and articles relating to climate change.  Individuals\u2019 availability on the date of the workshop was also a key factor.  The National Academies and GAO gave particular preference to individuals  recommended by more than one expert. In addition to ecosystem  expertise, we gave priority to those candidates whose expertise also  included an understanding of climate change (e.g., an understanding of  how climate change might affect coral reefs or forests). GAO identified  most of the federal resource managers for the second day of the workshop  because the National Academies does not interact extensively with the  federal resource management community. To select these managers, we  asked for recommendations from both agency headquarters officials and  managers in the field. We gave priority to senior federal resource managers  with management experience in the field. We also invited managers from  Washington, D.C., headquarters offices to ensure a balanced perspective.  We selected managers who had a general familiarity with relevant statutes,  regulations, agreements, executive orders, and other management  directives aimed at protecting the resources under their agencies\u2019  jurisdictions. We also selected managers who had a general familiarity with  the issue of climate change and how it could affect one of the four relevant  ecosystem types\u2014although this knowledge was not essential. We sought to  have representation from each major agency that manages resources  corresponding to each of the four ecosystem types. Fifty-four scientists,  economists, and federal resource managers from academia, government,  and nongovernmental organizations attended the workshop. Appendix I  contains a list of the workshop participants and moderators.", "To illustrate the vulnerability of federal resources to the potential effects of  climate change as well as the various management challenges discussed at  the workshop, we conducted case studies of four federal resource units,  one case study for each ecosystem type, using a nonprobability approach.  The four units are the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in southern  Florida (coasts and oceans ecosystem); the Chugach National Forest in  south-central Alaska (forests ecosystem); Glacier National Park in  northwestern Montana (fresh waters ecosystem); and the BLM Kingman  Field Office in northwestern Arizona (grasslands and shrublands  ecosystem). We selected our specific case study units after soliciting  selected experts\u2019 views on which federal resources may be most vulnerable  to climate change. We then visited each of the four units, interviewed a  number of experts and resource managers at the units, and viewed some of  the resources discussed at the meetings. More detailed information on our  objectives, scope, and methodology is presented in appendix II. A summary  of the workshop can be found in appendix III, and summaries of the  individual case studies can be found in appendix IV.", "In this report, we use the term \u201cfederal resources\u201d to refer to federal lands  managed by BLM, FS, FWS, and NPS and to national marine sanctuaries  and one marine national monument managed by NOAA; the term  \u201cecosystem\u201d to refer to a system of interacting living organisms together  with their physical environment; the term \u201cresource managers\u201d to refer to  individuals who manage federal resources; the term \u201cphysical effects\u201d to  refer to observable changes in the physical condition of some part of a  natural system, including, among others, extreme weather events\u2014that is,  weather events that are rare at a particular place (this may vary from place  to place); the term \u201cbiological effects\u201d to refer to changes in the interaction  among organisms living in a given ecosystem; and the phrase \u201ceconomic  and social goods and services\u201d to refer to economic resources, such as  revenue-producing industries, including forestry and fishing, among others,  and social or cultural resources, such as recreational activities, scenic  views, and historical artifacts, among others. We recognize that all of these  effects are interrelated, and that certain effects may belong to more than  one category. Although the workshop experts discussed a wide range of  possible climate-related effects, we describe only some of these effects in  our report because we could not cover the full range of effects on all  federal resources across the country.

However, according to the IPCC,  global atmospheric concentrations of these greenhouse gases have  increased markedly as a result of human activities over the past 200 years  and now far exceed preindustrial levels. The IPCC further reports that  these increases have contributed to a warming of the Earth\u2019s climate.   Table 1 shows the shares of greenhouse gas emissions and their global  warming potentials from U.S. sources.", "The IPCC attributes increases in average global air and ocean  temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising mean global  sea levels to a warming of the Earth\u2019s climate system. The IPCC reports  that 11 of the 12 years between 1995 and 2006 rank among the 12 warmest  years since 1850 (the first year that global temperatures were recorded)  and are indicative of a strong upward warming trend over the last 50 years.  Furthermore, according to the IPCC, since 1961, average global ocean  temperatures have increased, because the oceans have absorbed more than  80 percent of the heat added to the Earth\u2019s climate system. Such warming  causes seawater to expand, contributing to sea level rise. The IPCC also  reports that mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined, on average,  in both hemispheres, and that widespread decreases in the sizes of glaciers  and polar ice caps, combined with losses in the ice sheets of Greenland and  Antarctica, have very likely contributed to a sea level rise of 0.17 meters  during the 20th century.", "The federal government manages nearly 30 percent of the land in the  United States.

Climate change will also cause biological changes,  such as increases in insect and disease infestations, shifts in species  distribution and abundance, and changes in the timing of natural events  (referred to as phenological changes), among others. The experts further  said that climate change is likely to adversely affect economic and social  goods and services supported by federal resources, including recreation,  tourism, infrastructure, water supplies, fishing, ranching, and other  resource uses. Officials at our four case study sites provided us with  additional examples of some of these climate-related effects already  occurring on federal resources. As we have previously mentioned, these  four sites are the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in southern  Florida (coasts and oceans ecosystem); the Chugach National Forest in  south-central Alaska (forests ecosystem); Glacier National Park in  northwestern Montana (fresh waters ecosystem); and the BLM Kingman  Field Office in northwestern Arizona (grasslands and shrublands  ecosystem)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Physical Effects of Climate Change on Federal Resources Are Already Apparent and Will Likely Increase", "paragraphs": ["Experts at our workshop and officials at our four case study sites stated  that climate change can result in physical changes, and that many such  changes have already occurred and are likely to continue in the future.  Physical effects of climate change include warmer temperatures, drought,  glacial melting, floods, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, among  others.", "Experts from the workshop identified increased temperatures as one of the  key physical effects of climate change. According to these experts, effects  of increasing temperatures that have already been observed include the  declining duration of lake and river ice cover throughout the northern  hemisphere and increased temperatures of 7 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit in  eastern water bodies after storm events.", "A scientist at Glacier National Park told us that, while the estimated global  average temperature has risen 0.6 degree Celsius (about 1 degree  Fahrenheit) since about 1897, the estimated average temperatures of the  highest elevations in the park have risen 1.6 degrees Celsius (about   3 degrees Fahrenheit) over the same period. This scientist expects this  trend to continue. Winter and summer temperatures within the park also  are increasing. The data suggest that the number of frost days below   0 degree Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) in Montana from 1900 to 2005  declined by 3 weeks. Furthermore, in 1900, the estimated number of  extreme heat days\u2014defined as days with temperatures above 90 degrees  Fahrenheit\u2014was about 5 days per year in Glacier National Park (and  western Montana); in 2005, this estimated number was about 20 days per  year. A record was set in 2003, with 31 days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.  Experts consider 90 degrees to be a major threshold beyond which there  are negative impacts on human health and plants in the region. Increased  moisture stress due to increased temperatures makes plants more  vulnerable to fire, and fire activity in the region has increased in recent  years. In 2003, 74,000 hectares in Glacier National Park\u2014about 13 percent  of the park\u2019s total area\u2014burned, in what was the largest fire year since  1910, when the park was founded. Other major fires occurred in 1988 and  2001, according to NPS and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) officials.", "According to experts at the workshop, warmer spring seasons\u2014due at  least partly to climate change\u2014have already resulted in earlier snowmelt,  longer summer dry periods, and increased wildland fire activity in western  U.S. forest ecosystems, where the experts stated that fires are linked more  to climatic conditions than to land management techniques. Both the  frequency of large fires (greater than 400 hectares) and the area burned  increased significantly in the western United States during the period of  1987 through 2003 compared with 1970 through 1986, and wildland fire size  and severity are likely to further increase with climate change, according to  these experts. Furthermore, workshop participants noted that, in general,  climate change will likely increase droughts in the future.", "Drought conditions that are potentially caused by climate change are  already affecting trees, shrubs, and water resources in some areas. For  example, according to officials from the BLM Kingman Field Office, about  30 percent of old growth pinyon pine trees in the Cerbat Mountains of  Arizona; extensive stands of black brush near Dolan Springs in Arizona;  and shrubs, such as cliffrose and juniper on shallow soils on the Colorado  Plateau, have died due to severe drought conditions. Similarly, officials  from the Chugach National Forest told us that closed-basin lake levels in  the Kenai Lowlands in south-central Alaska have declined by as much as 1  meter as a result of drought, and many ponds that appeared on 1950 maps  and aerial photographs are now grassy basins with spruce and hardwood  trees.", "Experts participating in all of our workshop discussions also identified ice  and glacial melting as physical effects resulting from climate change.  Experts said that there is evidence that sea ice retreat, accelerating glacier  melt, and measurable coastal erosion in the Arctic\u2014due, at least in part, to  climate change\u2014are now greater than they were just 5 years ago. These  experts noted that there also has been a major loss of glaciers in the  western United States, such as in Montana and Alaska. According to a  scientist at Glacier National Park, the estimated number of glaciers in the  park has dropped from 150 to 26 since 1850, and some projections suggest  that if current trends in the rate of melting continue, the remaining glaciers  will be gone in the next 25 to 30 years. Figure 3 shows the melting of  Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2005. Furthermore, according to  officials at the Chugach, many Kenai Peninsula glaciers in south-central  Alaska began retreating in the 1850s. For example, the Harding Icefield lost  70 vertical feet and 5 percent in surface area in the last 50 years, according  to these officials. In addition, an official at the Chugach said that glaciers in  the forest have generally been declining very quickly in surface area and  volume, with a few exceptions due to local topography. Furthermore,  according to our workshop participants, increasing air, ocean, and coastal  water temperatures will likely lead to a continuing loss of sea ice, a  reduction in permafrost, decreased snowpack, and increased glacial  melting.", "According to experts discussing the fresh waters ecosystem at our  workshop, flooding is another physical effect potentially caused by climate  change. For example, they noted that rain-on-snow events (i.e., rain  following snow) increase the potential for flooding, because rainwater and  melted snow cause very high runoff rates in winter and early spring.  Officials at Glacier National Park who have observed such changes told us  that regional precipitation patterns are changing, such that more  precipitation falls as rain and less as snow. (They said that snowpack has  declined by up to 30 percent since the mid-20th century.) With less snow and  warmer winters, the timing of spring runoff can be up to 20 days earlier  than normal. This is causing winter streamflow to increase and summer  streamflow to decrease. Scientists expect to continue to receive less snow  in winter with more rain, rain-on-snow conditions, and midwinter melting  of snowpack. These warmer winters may lead to more winter flooding in  the park\u2014as well as more avalanches. The experts further noted that high  runoff in winter and early spring is likely to increase soil erosion, enlarge  stream channels, increase sediment loads in streams, and increase stream  turbidity. Because of the higher volume of runoff in the spring, combined  with less snowpack, streams could shrink or dry up completely every  summer. Not only would this affect riparian vegetation growth and aquatic  animals, the associated drying of adjacent soils and vegetation would also  increase the risk of forest fires.", "Experts discussing the coasts and oceans ecosystem at our workshop also  identified sea level rise as one of the key physical effects of climate change.  Global ocean and coastal trend analyses that are based on satellite  measurements of sea level change suggest that sea levels are rising faster to  higher levels at different rates in different places. According to these  experts, sea level rise may lead to flooding and the permanent loss of  coastal wetlands and barrier shorelines; degradation of fresh waters,  brackish coastal waters, and low-lying ecosystems, which could impact the  drinking water supply; the loss of storm buffers for low-lying areas;  increased vulnerability to storm surge and flooding; and increased erosion  and retreat of shorelines around barrier islands and estuaries. For example,  these experts said that the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North  Carolina, the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Maryland, as well as  various southeast and southwest Louisiana national wildlife refuges, are  among the federal resources particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. Also,  according to experts discussing the grasslands and shrublands ecosystem,  as sea levels rise, saltwater will encroach on coastal prairies, turning them  into coastal wetlands.", "Rising sea levels that are attributable to climate change already have  affected low-lying areas, such as Big Pine Key in the Florida Keys.  According to an FWS official in this area, saltwater intrusion on land,  amplified by increased hurricane activity, has overwhelmed sources of  fresh waters and habitat that support resident plants and animals, such as  the Key deer and the Lower Key marsh rabbit that live on the Keys  refuges. This official further stated that these effects will pose a threat in  the future, not only to wildlife, but also to humans who live on the islands.", "Finally, experts discussing the coasts and oceans ecosystem at our  workshop also identified ocean acidification as one of the physical effects  of climate change. Acidification occurs when increased carbon dioxide  levels decrease the concentration of carbonate ion in seawater. Because  carbonate ion is a substance that coral reefs need to build their skeletons,  ocean acidification may reduce the calcification rate in corals (and other  calcium carbonate-based species) and cause other changes in the oceanic  food chain, plankton communities, and the distribution of certain species.  This could affect the coral reefs comprising the Florida Keys National  Marine Sanctuary and corals in any other marine protected area, state, or  territory. A University of Miami scientist who has been studying coral reefs  and climate change for a number of years, and with whom we spoke while  conducting our Florida Keys case study, told us that by 2050, carbonate ion  could be 34 percent less abundant than today."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biological Effects of Climate Change on Federal Resources Are Already Apparent and Are Likely to Increase", "paragraphs": ["Experts participating in our workshop and officials at our four case study  sites stated that climate change can result in biological changes, and that  many such changes have already occurred and are likely to continue in the  future. The biological effects of climate change include increases in insect  and disease infestations, shifts in species distribution, and changes in the  timing of natural events (referred to as phenological changes), among  others.", "Experts discussing the forests and the grasslands and shrublands  ecosystems noted that the infestation of pests\u2014especially those that  emerge under warmer or drier conditions\u2014is a key biological effect  attributable, at least in part, to climate change. Examples of such pests  include bark beetles, grasshoppers, and various fungi as well as diseases  caused by bacteria, parasites, and viruses. According to experts at the  workshop plenary session, the spruce bark beetle, the mountain pine  beetle, and the southern pine beetle have already infested some U.S.  forests, thriving in areas where the cold winters would have previously  prevented them from colonizing. These experts noted, for example, that the  southern pine beetle has migrated into red spruce areas in the southeastern  United States, and that pests have also damaged New England sugar  maples. The experts further noted that increased temperatures will  increase the range and effects of insects and disease infestation. In  particular, experts stated that there have been shifts in the intensity and  extent of the spruce bark beetle in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska  caused by an acceleration of the beetle\u2019s life cycle due to warmer and drier  climatic conditions.", "A spruce bark beetle infestation has already occurred at the Chugach  National Forest, according to an FS official at the forest. Warmer  temperatures and reduced precipitation associated with climate change  have contributed to a spruce bark beetle outbreak that has led to high  mortality rates for certain types of spruce trees on over 400,000 acres of the  forest (see fig. 4). About 20 percent of the forest\u2019s land and the adjacent  Kenai National Wildlife Refuge are located on the Kenai Peninsula.  According to FS experts, about 1 million acres of the peninsula have been  affected by the beetles, including 400,000 acres within the forest itself.  Officials at the Chugach indicated that continued increases in temperature  and decreases in precipitation could further change vegetation  composition and structure and increase the incidence and severity of  future insect outbreaks. The officials stated that spruce bark beetle  populations increase greatly when warm weather climate events combine  with forest stresses. (Officials at the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge noted,  however, that not all spruce bark beetle damage is attributable to climate  change. Another scientist explained that the key link to climate change is  that outbreaks are now persistent and not episodic.)", "Experts discussing the fresh waters ecosystem said that increased water  body temperatures may increase the risk of toxic algal blooms as well as  the severity of fish diseases. They said that there have been recent  observations of severe pathogen problems in the Yukon River in Alaska.  (The Yukon River flows through the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.)  Experts in the coasts and oceans ecosystem likewise noted that increasing  air and water temperatures could increase the incidence of toxic algal  blooms in ocean environments. They observed that increased microbial  activity could affect fish, shellfish, corals, sea turtles, and some sea grasses.", "Another biological effect of climate change that was identified by the  workshop experts is anticipated shifts in the distribution, abundance, and  ranges of both plant and animal species. As an example of one observed  change that is due at least in part to climate change, fresh waters  ecosystem experts noted that the nonnative zebra mussel has extended its  range in the Great Lakes as lake temperatures have warmed. Experts  discussing other ecosystem types similarly agreed that changes in species  distribution are likely to occur in the future, and that nonnative species  might eventually dominate or replace native species in some areas. For  example, experts discussing the coasts and oceans ecosystem noted that  marine and nonnative species may invade estuaries where they have  typically not lived. Oyster predators from the ocean may move into the  Chesapeake Bay, for example. Likewise, experts on the forests ecosystem  said that forest species composition\u2014both the trees and the species that  depend on the trees and forest vegetation\u2014may change. They indicated  that sugar maple, white bark pine at high elevations, and subalpine spruce  fir forests in the Rocky Mountains have already experienced such changes.  Experts discussing the grasslands and shrublands ecosystem, moreover,  stated that tree die-offs triggered by drought and exacerbated by higher  temperatures may lead to a shift from woodland to shrubland or grassland.  They said that midwestern savannas and the southwestern pinyon and  juniper woodlands are particularly vulnerable to such changes. They  further noted that some rare ecosystems, such as alpine tundra, California  chaparral, and blue oak woodlands in California may become extinct  altogether. These experts said that native biodiversity will decrease in  many areas, and that new assemblages of species will be living together,  with unknown consequences.", "Evidence of changes in species distribution is already apparent on some  federal resources. For example, according to officials at the BLM Kingman  Field Office, drought conditions are causing native Mojave Desert scrub  plant communities in the region to convert into nonnative annual grassland  communities, which are more vulnerable to fire. This phenomenon has  contributed to problems related to fire management. Prolonged drought  acts as a source of stress to native plant communities. Then, in periods of  wetness, invasive species (typically, invasive annual grasses) fill in the gaps  between native vegetation. Invasive species can spread and grow faster  than native species. As a result, the thicker and less evenly spaced  vegetation leads to fire danger. If a fire starts, it burns much longer and  hotter due to the invasive grasses. Native plant communities, such as  saguaro cacti and Joshua trees, are not fire resistant, so fire damages these  communities and provides further environment for invasive species and  increased fire danger. In some instances, repeated fires of this nature have  destroyed native plant communities, such that only invasive grasslands  remain. A severe drought occurred in 2002 that resulted in the loss of  perennial grasses, shrubs, and trees. Drought, coupled with increased  annual growth in wet years, accelerates the conversion of hot desert plant  communities into annual grasslands. Should continued severe drought  become the norm, this conversion can be expected to continue.", "Furthermore, according to BLM Kingman officials, pinyon-juniper  woodlands (which include pinyon pine trees and various types of junipers)  near the BLM site have died off, as have some ponderosa pines and  chaparral. These officials said these changes are likely due to the severe  drought the region has experienced since about 1996. According to these  officials, even pinyon pines hundreds of years old that have survived  drought events in the past are dying, which the officials said was unusual  and unique. Ponderosa bark beetles and mistletoe infestations have also  stressed the trees, contributing to the die-off of the ponderosa pines. BLM  officials said that changes to forested plant communities would be  significant, since these communities already are small and disjunct. The  resource managers said that these communities probably would either be  greatly reduced in size or eliminated from many areas.", "Experts discussing fresh waters told us that temperature increases are  most likely to threaten cold-water species, such as trout, salmon, and  amphibians. An FWS fish biologist who studies and provides expertise on  certain resources in Glacier National Park told us about a park species, the  bull trout, that is at particular risk from climate change. The bull trout,  listed as a threatened species under the ESA, is native to the western  United States. It migrates in the spring from lakes and streams, such as  Flathead Lake up the Flathead River system near the park, where it spawns  in the fall in tributaries as far as 150 miles upstream. This fish is very  sensitive to water temperature and clarity. Its spawning temperature range  is 6 to 10 degrees Celsius (43 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit), and its young- rearing temperature range is below 16 degrees Celsius (61 degrees  Fahrenheit). It is found in only the coldest streams. If temperatures  increase, streams may become intolerable for the bull trout. In addition, if  isolated glaciers disappear due to temperature increase, the mountain  streams the glaciers feed may dry up late in the season, further reducing  habitat. Therefore, the bull trout can only survive in a very limited area, and  many of its migration corridors have been cut off as a result of ecosystem  fragmentation.", "Scientists at Glacier National Park further noted that warming trends are  expected to cause an upward migration of vegetation, changing the ground  cover in many areas of the park and affecting wildlife species that depend  on those habitats. As alpine habitats warm, the tree line is expected to  move upslope, with forests beginning to invade alpine and subalpine  meadows. Some of these changes are already occurring. Animals that may  be harmed by the loss of alpine and subalpine habitat include bighorn  sheep, pikas (relatives of the rabbit), mountain goats, wolverines, and  grizzly bears. Many rare plants and animals in Glacier are near extinction,  and the experts said that climate change may increase the likelihood that  these species will cease to exist in the park.", "Experts on several ecosystem types also stated that climate change will  affect phenology, that is, plant and animal life-cycle events that are  influenced by environmental changes, especially seasonal variations in  temperature and precipitation. Experts discussing the forests ecosystem,  for example, said that changes will affect critical species interactions, such  as pollination and seed dispersal. Experts discussing the grasslands and  shrublands ecosystem observed that the distribution of plants that undergo  photosynthesis during the cool season and plants that undergo  photosynthesis during the warm season may change, with implications for  the animals\u2014both vertebrates and invertebrates\u2014that are associated with  them. They further noted that pollination could become out-of-sync with  flowering. Likewise, one expert on the fresh waters ecosystem also stated  that the phenology of fish migration and reproduction may be disrupted by  changing patterns of water flow or availability.", "Officials at the Chugach National Forest indicated that the recent spruce  bark beetle outbreaks on the Kenai Peninsula may be attributed, to some  extent, to phenological changes. For example, the spruce bark beetle\u2019s life  cycle has accelerated from 2 years to 1 year. These officials explained that  populations of many insects are regulated by low winter temperatures and  many outbreaks end by episodes of cold temperature. However, as the  climate warms, infestations by insects whose populations are controlled by  cold will likely increase. Furthermore, an FWS biologist in the Florida Keys  pointed out that, on the basis of some limited data sets, it appears that  green turtles in the Keys region may be nesting earlier, possibly as a result  of climate change. The biologist also noted that a larger study of  loggerhead turtles conducted in another part of Florida between 1989 and  2003 found that the median date of loggerhead turtle nesting occurred  approximately 10 days sooner. During this same 15-year period, according  to the study, average sea surface temperatures increased by 0.8 degree  Celsius during May, when loggerheads typically begin to nest on these  beaches. This study suggests that the turtles may be responding to recent  climate trends."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Climate Change Is Likely to Affect the Economic and Social Goods and Services Supported by Federal Resources", "paragraphs": ["Experts participating in our workshop noted that climate change is likely to  have adverse effects on a range of economic and social goods and services  supported by federal resources, including recreation and tourism,  infrastructure, water supplies, fishing, ranching, and other resource-use  activities.", "According to experts on the grasslands and shrublands ecosystem, if FWS- managed wetlands\u2014called prairie potholes\u2014in the upper midwest dry up,  waterfowl populations would decline, since these wetlands serve as  resting, feeding, and nesting habitat for migratory waterfowl. The loss of  the prairie potholes would hurt midcontinent waterfowl populations and  the many resources that interact with them. This loss would further result  in wide-ranging economic impacts on a variety of industries, such as  hunting, and on communities in that part of the country.", "The experts also pointed out that the increasing frequency of extreme  events, such as fire or drought, could limit recreational activities on federal  lands. For example, experts on the coasts and oceans ecosystem observed  that accelerated sea level rise could result in a loss of beaches and  associated recreational activities. They further stated that increasing air  and water temperatures could affect such recreational activities as fishing  and bird-watching, and that ocean acidification could negatively affect  tourism and sport fishing in coastal areas. Similarly, managers at the BLM  Kingman Field Office told us that climate change could cause declines in  the recreational use of the land by hunters (owing to less game to hunt) and  by the visiting public.", "NOAA officials at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary told us that  the continued bleaching of coral reefs in the Florida Keys\u2014caused, at least  in part, by climate change\u2014may adversely affect the tourism and fishing  industries, which are important sources of revenue for communities in the  area. Coral reefs play a key role in these industries because they are  important habitats for fish and other marine species and are popular with  snorkelers and scuba divers. Bleaching occurs when corals eject the  microscopic algae that live within their tissues in response to stressful  conditions, such as warmer water. (Corals can recover from bleaching  events if the stress is not too severe or long-lasting, but the stress caused by  bleaching can lead to secondary problems, such as coral diseases.) If water  temperatures in the Florida Keys continue to increase as a result of climate  change, more coral bleaching may occur, adversely affecting the area\u2019s  tourism and fishing industries. Figure 5 shows two brain coral colonies in  the Upper Keys area of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in July  2005. The smaller colony (bottom of the figure) shows healthy coloration,  while the larger colony (top of the figure) is nearly completely bleached.", "Experts from three workshop groups noted that climate change could  affect infrastructure and operational costs on federal lands. For example,  experts in the grasslands and shrublands ecosystem noted that, as wildland  fires become more frequent and severe as the climate changes, the costs of  fire-fighting and rehabilitating land increases. Experts stated that rising sea  levels will affect resource use on federal lands, and that changes in  precipitation will affect dams, canals, flood protection, and reservoirs.  Experts discussing the fresh waters ecosystem said that some park  visitation levels, particularly in colder climates, have been restricted by  weather conditions. Climate change, they noted, is expected to result in a  change of visitor patterns and may result in a wider use of the land\u2019s  resources and infrastructure. Managers at Glacier National Park agreed  with this perspective, saying that climate change may lengthen the primary  visitation period for the park as spring comes earlier and winter comes  later. According to these officials, June through August used to be the peak  visitation time frame, but already companies affiliated with the park   (e.g., concession owners) are getting more requests to conduct activities in  May and September. Roads and facilities may need to stay open longer,  which will require more staff and resources, and the potential for weather- related infrastructure damage will require more maintenance and  improvements. These officials further noted that if the park is open longer,  there will be more crime, more bear-human interactions, and a greater need  for search-and-rescue operations, all of which will require more resources  to manage.", "Climate change has already affected the infrastructure on some federal  lands. For example, officials from the Chugach National Forest indicated  that, to the extent that large storm events are related to climate change,  there have been significant impacts on bridges and infrastructure in Alaska,  and that the frequency of severe storm events appears to be increasing.  (Forest officials noted that in the last 10 years, the Chugach National  Forest region has experienced two 100-year storm events.) Similar effects  and other impacts on infrastructure are illustrated at Glacier National Park.  Officials at the park told us that, in 2003, the most popular and scenic road  in the park, the Going-to-the-Sun Road, was shut down for 23 days due to  fire. To the extent that climate change is linked to more frequent and severe  forest fires, western Montana could face more fires. Glacier National Park  staff noted that fires distract FS and NPS staff from their regular duties,  and that if more fires occur, the visitor experience could be diminished by  poor air quality and limited access to fire-ravaged areas of the park. As a  result, the park and local communities could face lost revenues associated  with declines in visitation.", "Experts in the fresh waters ecosystem indicated that climate change may  also adversely affect water supplies and quality. Snow and ice serve as  natural reservoirs in mountainous areas and northern regions of the United  States, gradually supplying water into the summer months. Much of the  west relies on spring snowmelt to provide a steady stream of water into  summer months, when demand is highest. However, warmer temperatures  and changes in winter precipitation patterns from snow to rain are  expected to continue causing reduced snowpack and early snowmelt.  Water supply shortages will likely increase the cost of water. In addition,  the experts said that water quality is likely to decline if harmful algal  blooms, bacteria, or botulism occur as a result of increased temperature;  such occurrences would likely result in increased water treatment costs.  Moreover, coastal areas that rely on groundwater supplies will have to be  careful not to overdraw from the aquifer to avoid saltwater intrusion and  contamination, particularly in water-stressed areas of the southwest.  Experts on the coasts and oceans ecosystem stated that accelerated sea  level rise could increase saltwater intrusion, affecting drinking water  supplies in some regions.", "Water issues are particularly significant in the southwestern United States.  For example, BLM Kingman Field Office managers told us that climate  change-related economic costs resulting from declines in the availability of  water in the region could be extremely high. According to experts  discussing the fresh waters ecosystem, less surface water availability  means lower groundwater recharge rates and further demand on the  existing groundwater resources. The BLM managers further said that  reductions in groundwater could affect communities within the field office  boundary by causing wells to dry up, thereby forcing people to abandon  homes or greatly increasing the cost of living in the area.", "Experts on various ecosystem types noted that the use of certain resources  on public lands could be affected by climate change. For example, experts  discussing the fresh waters ecosystem noted that Alaska may be affected  economically by climate change. They said that many fish species are  adapted to cold-water conditions, and that temperature increases and  seasonal shifts may adversely impact fisheries upon which commercial,  sport, and subsistence fishers depend. Also, experts discussing the  grasslands and shrublands ecosystem stated that changing climate  conditions might reduce Native Americans\u2019 use of federal lands and reduce  revenue from natural resources on their lands. They also noted that  changes in the water supply might lead to greater competition for water,  which could have a negative economic impact on ranchers and some  communities situated near federal lands. Officials at the BLM Kingman  Field Office agreed that if the climate becomes hotter and drier, there could  be a decline in the ranching industry in the Kingman area. In addition,  officials at the Chugach National Forest told us that large storms can be  harmful for the fishing industry; they said that the last major storm  destroyed salmon spawning areas in the Chugach for 1 year.", "Scientific experts at the workshop noted that the nature and extent of  climate change effects will depend on the rate and magnitude of this  change.

However, they said that specifically addressing  the current and potential future effects of climate change is not a priority.  For example, in discussing the grasslands and shrublands ecosystem at the  workshop, resource managers agreed that climate change is not on their  agencies\u2019 agendas as a policy issue. Furthermore, resource managers from  the BLM Kingman Field Office and the Chugach National Forest stated  explicitly that climate change is not a priority for them.", "Resource managers in all of the workshop groups agreed that they have a  wide range of responsibilities and that, because none of the agencies have  designated climate change as a priority, the managers focus first on near- term activities that they are specifically required to undertake, leaving less  time and resources for longer-term issues such as climate change. For  example, resource managers discussing the fresh waters ecosystem told us  that they are typically accountable for things on a short-term time frame,  and current planning horizons may be too short for incorporating long-term  factors such as climate change into management practices. In addition,  managers at the BLM Kingman Field Office said that, due to resource  constraints, they can only address the most immediate, highest-priority  issues, and that backlogs of required actions, such as permits, are  continually growing, leaving other issues unaddressed, including the  effects of climate change. Furthermore, NOAA resource managers at the  Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary said that, due to limited staffing  and fiscal resources, NOAA expects sanctuary managers to place a priority  on meeting the many daily challenges they face, such as implementing the  management plan for the 2,900 square nautical mile sanctuary and,  specifically, managing no-boating or no-fishing zones to protect sensitive  areas. Climate change has not been identified as a priority in the National  Marine Sanctuaries. Resource managers discussing all four ecosystem  types at the workshop stated that, to address the long-term issue of climate  change, agencies would have to change how they approach their missions.  In this regard, they said that resource managers are currently bound to  using historical data to react to observed changes, while addressing the  effects of climate change would require managers to anticipate potential  future changes in their planning processes.", "In our workshop, resource managers told us that climate change effects are  typically not addressed in agency planning activities. Specifically, resource  managers discussing the coasts and oceans ecosystem at the workshop  said that climate change has not been considered in management plans.  BLM, FWS, and NPS resource managers discussing the grasslands and  shrublands ecosystem also said that current management plans do not  specifically account for climate change. Similarly, resource managers  discussing the fresh waters ecosystem agreed that climate change effects  are not explicitly addressed in agency strategic plans. Furthermore,  resource managers interviewed for the Chugach National Forest case study  stated that they do not consider addressing the effects of climate change in  the forest to be a priority because it is not included in the most recent list  of priority threats developed by the FS Chief and is not considered a  strategic issue by the agency. However, some resource managers from the  workshop and case studies said that climate change effects are beginning  to be addressed in resource unit planning processes, but on an  inconsistent, case-by-case basis. For example, resource managers  discussing the coasts and oceans ecosystem said that planning for  individual units is bottom up, not top down, and is driven by local  constituents. They said that climate change vulnerability issues have begun  to get consideration in some planning efforts.", "Resource managers at our workshop also said that climate change is not a  priority, in part, because of limited support from agency leaders.  Specifically, resource managers discussing the coasts and oceans  ecosystem said that there has been little support from agency leaders to  comprehensively address climate change issues. In addition, resource  managers discussing the fresh waters ecosystem at our workshop told us  that there are political hazards associated with discussing climate change,  and that it is not politically profitable to talk about the issue. Resource  managers interviewed for our case studies made similar points. For  example, NOAA resource managers at the Florida Keys National Marine  Sanctuary said that they have difficulty using terms like \u201cglobal warming\u201d  in presentations and in publications due to concerns raised within NOAA.  Similarly, an official at Glacier National Park said that top NPS  management monitored public statements on climate change more closely  than any other issue, and that park managers are reluctant to talk about  climate change.

Interior issued an  order in 2001 directing its agencies, including BLM, FWS, and NPS, to  consider and analyze, among other things, potential climate change effects  in management plans and activities developed for public lands. However,  headquarters officials from these agencies told us that they have not yet  provided specific direction to resource managers about how to implement  this order. Officials at BLM headquarters stated that the order was signed  during the prior administration, and that the order has not been  emphasized because it was not consistent with the current administration\u2019s  previous position on climate change. These BLM headquarters officials  added that the lack of specific authority, guidance, and direction may have  limited the agency\u2019s efforts to address the effects of climate change, and  that an authoritative statute, a regulation, or guidance would provide a  greater impetus to address climate change effects. In testimony before the  House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies, on April 26, 2007, BLM\u2019s National  Science Coordinator acknowledged that there is little current guidance at  BLM dealing with climate change.

For example, resource managers  discussing the coasts and oceans ecosystem said that they are not aware of  any formal climate change guidance from their respective agencies\u2014FWS,  NOAA, NPS, and USGS. Resource managers discussing the forests  ecosystem said that agency policies are, in some cases, geared toward  responding to events as they occur, constraining the ability of managers to  incorporate anticipated events in their planning efforts. These individuals  added that managers are unclear about the nature of their agencies\u2019\u2014FS,  FWS, and NPS\u2014mandates with respect to climate change and, accordingly,  differences in interpretation and implementation take place at the  management level. In addition, resource managers from the Bureau of  Reclamation, FWS, and NPS discussing the fresh waters ecosystem told us  that most managers do not know how to build climate change into the  management process but believed that there is a need to do so.

They further noted that there are differing views in their agencies  about how to interpret broad resource management authorities with  respect to climate change, and that, as a result, efforts to address the  effects of climate change are ad hoc and piecemeal. These managers also  stated that they need better guidance at all levels on the effects of climate  change and the appropriate agency responses to those effects. They also  said that their agencies need an overall mandate and a coordinated  approach to address the issue, and that it will take very strong direction  from high-level officials to get agencies to address the effects of climate  change. Moreover, resource managers at the workshop generally agreed  that they need direction on how to account for climate change when  making land management decisions, and that high-level planning should  recognize the potential effects of climate change and promote integrated,  cross-agency approaches to addressing these effects.", "Resource managers we interviewed for our case studies also said that they  are not aware of any guidance or requirement to address the effects of  climate change, and that they have not received direction regarding how to  incorporate climate change into their planning activities. Resource  managers from the BLM Kingman Field Office, the Chugach National  Forest, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and Glacier National  Park all explicitly stated that they do not have guidance for how or whether  they should account for climate change in planning and management  decisions. Resource managers from the Kingman Field Office said that they  need a national directive from headquarters to implement climate change- related activities, and that such a directive could give some imperative to  take action. In addition, Chugach resource managers stated that they need  a clear policy about how to address the effects of climate change, including  clear and focused goals. They added that they are not sure whom to contact  if climate change becomes an issue because there is no agencywide  facilitator or contact point regarding climate change. Furthermore,  resource managers at the Everglades National Park, which is ecologically  linked to the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, told us that limited  guidance makes deciding what, if anything, to do about climate change  difficult.

In our workshop, resource managers  discussing the grasslands and shrublands ecosystem said that policy  development can take years; therefore, in their view, the agencies may not  be able to respond to climate change in an appropriate time frame. In  addition, BLM Kingman Field Office resource managers said that social,  political, and legal obstacles would likely present challenges to addressing  the effects of climate change, even if guidance were issued. Furthermore,  they told us that if they received a directive to address the effects of climate  change, the field office would adjust its work priorities for the year and  would have to shift or delay other activities. Moreover, resource managers  at the Chugach National Forest thought that a general requirement for each  forest to address the effects of climate change in its land management  plans may be counterproductive because each forest would be forced to  \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d on its own.

For example, officials at the Chugach National Forest said that  climate change is a larger issue than one federal land management unit can  address. They further said that climate change is a global issue that  transcends forests and agencies, and that any strategy to address the  effects of climate change should be integrated across broad landscapes,  not individual forests. Similarly, managers at the BLM Kingman Field Office  noted that climate change is a national issue that is difficult to address  locally. Resource managers further noted that climate change-related  effects can interact with and amplify the effects of other, preexisting  environmental problems on a given resource unit, such as nonnative  species and fire, making resource managers\u2019 jobs more difficult. Despite  these challenges, some resource managers said they have taken steps to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions at their units. For example, resource  managers at Glacier National Park and Everglades National Park told us  that they participate in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Climate  Friendly Parks Program, which focuses on reducing parks\u2019 greenhouse gas  emissions. Glacier also has an Environmental Management Plan that  includes a number of energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In  addition, Glacier requires the concessioners that run businesses in the park  to abide by certain environmental requirements, some of which affect  greenhouse gas emissions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Climate change has already begun to adversely affect federal resources in a  variety of ways. Most experts with whom we spoke believe that these  effects will continue\u2014and likely intensify\u2014over the coming decades.  Some federal resources, depending on a variety of factors, may be more  vulnerable than others. Because this issue is long term, global, and may  affect federal resources in a number of ways, it will require foresight on the  part of federal agencies to prepare for and minimize the adverse effects of  climate change. However, federal resource management agencies have not  yet made climate change a high priority. BLM, FS, FWS, NOAA, and NPS  are generally authorized, but not specifically required, to address changes  in resource conditions resulting from climate change in either their  resource management actions or planning efforts. However, none of these  agencies have specific guidance in place advising their managers how to  address the effects of climate change in either their resource management  actions or planning efforts. The resource managers with whom we spoke  stated that in the absence of such guidance, they are unsure whether or  how to take the effects of climate change into account when carrying out  their responsibilities. Such uncertainty may, as unanticipated  circumstances arise, force resource managers to set their own priorities,  which may be inconsistent with those of the agencies\u2019 management and  may result in misdirected efforts and wasted resources. Because there is  growing evidence that climate change is likely to have wide-ranging  consequences for the nation\u2019s land and water resources, elevating the  importance of the issue in their respective strategies and plans would  enable BLM, FS, FWS, NOAA, and NPS to provide effective long-term  stewardship of the resources under their purview.", "At least one resource management agency\u2014BLM\u2014has acknowledged if  not the need for, at least the value of, guidance on climate change. In April  2007, BLM\u2019s National Science Coordinator testified in a congressional  hearing that BLM is establishing committees to, among other actions,  develop guidance to address the effects of climate change in agency  management practices. BLM officials told us that the lack of specific  guidance, among other factors, may have limited that agency\u2019s efforts to  address the effects of climate change, and that having such guidance would  help to provide a greater impetus to address climate change effects. In this  light, at a minimum, guidance on addressing the effects of climate change  would allow resource managers to better take into account one of the key  factors that is likely to affect all aspects of the resources they manage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better enable federal resource management agencies to take into  account the existing and potential future effects of climate change on  federal resources, we recommend that the Secretaries of Agriculture,  Commerce, and the Interior\u2014in consultation with the Director of FS; the  Administrator of NOAA; and the Directors of BLM, FWS, and NPS,  respectively\u2014develop clear, written communication to resource managers  that explains how managers are expected to address the effects of climate  change, identifies how managers are to obtain any site-specific information  that may be necessary, and reflects best practices shared among the  relevant agencies, while also recognizing the unique missions, objectives,  and responsibilities of each agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Agriculture (FS), Commerce (NOAA),  and Interior (BLM, FWS, and NPS) for review and comment. We received  written comments from all three departments. These comments are  included in this report as appendixes V, VI, and VII, respectively. In addition  to the comments addressed in the following text, each department also  provided technical comments, which we have incorporated into this report  as appropriate. While we have acknowledged many of the departments\u2019  comments regarding efforts they are undertaking to address climate  change, we did not have sufficient time to verify the accuracy of the  information presented in either their letters or technical comments prior to  issuing this report.", "In its written comments, Agriculture\u2019s FS agreed with our recommendation,  acknowledging the need to develop clear, written communication for  resource managers that explains how they should address the effects of  climate change, and the need to coordinate with other departments and  agencies on resource management practices in preparing this guidance. FS  said that the agency will work to address clarity in communicating climate  change mitigation and adaptation strategies to field units.", "With regard to the draft report\u2019s contents, FS stated that the report did not  adequately capture the scope and urgency of the agency\u2019s commitment to  climate change adaptation, mitigation, and research. FS listed a number of  initiatives that were omitted, including research measuring forest-based  carbon, participation in the California Climate Action Registry, efforts to  reduce the agency\u2019s own carbon emissions, and other efforts. Although we  commend FS for undertaking these useful activities, an examination of  mitigation and research activities was beyond the scope of this report,  which focused primarily on management actions.", "FS also stated that our examination of one national forest (the Chugach  National Forest) is inadequate as a proxy for the 193 million acres of  diverse ecosystems managed by FS, and that 12 national forest plans do, in  fact, consider the effects of climate change on existing programs and local  resource values. The agency further noted that forest plans are revised  every 10 to 15 years to incorporate new scientific information and  management strategies. Although we used only one forest as an illustrative  example in our report, FS resource managers participating in several  workshop sessions and the case study said that they had limited guidance  from their agencies about whether or how to address the effects of climate  change in management actions and planning efforts. Furthermore, these  officials said that efforts to address climate change were lacking, due to a  general absence of guidance and differences in interpretation and  implementation of broad resource management authority. FS headquarters  officials also confirmed that they have not provided specific guidance on  addressing the effects of climate change. We also believe that, out of 155  national forests and 20 national grasslands, 12 forests with plans that  consider the effects of climate change is not a high percentage; we  encourage all 175 units managed by FS to incorporate climate change into  their plans when they next update them. FS also pointed out that we  neglected to mention efforts under way at the Chugach to treat thousands  of acres in the forests to mitigate the threat posed by spruce bark beetles.  In the second objective of our report, we sought to identify challenges that  resource managers face in addressing the observed and potential effects of  climate change. These challenges include the priority of the climate change  issue, the lack of agency guidance, and the lack of site-specific data.  Although we believe it is important to react to individual changes observed  at the site level, such as treating forests to mitigate spruce bark beetle  outbreaks, the larger issue\u2014that is, the absence of a coordinated response  to climate change in agency guidance\u2014remains.", "Finally, FS stated that we did not give adequate recognition to FS\u2019s Four  Threats to the Health of the Nation\u2019s Forests and Grasslands, a messaging  tool that disseminates the strategic view of the agency. (The Four Threats  identified by FS are fuels and fires, invasive species, unmanaged  recreation, and habitat fragmentation.) FS commented that the Four  Threats include two aspects of climate change discussed in this report:  forest fire and invasive species. Although we agree that at least some of the  Four Threats may be related to climate change, we believe that climate  change is a larger, overarching issue that should be addressed in a more  comprehensive manner.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, Commerce\u2019s NOAA agreed with  our recommendation. In this regard, NOAA stated that the agency will work  toward clarifying written communication to resource managers to explain  how they are to address the effects of climate change on federal resources  and identify how they are to obtain site-specific information that may be  needed to implement these efforts. Furthermore, NOAA stated that the  agency will continue to work with relevant federal resource management  agencies on a range of climate change and land management issues and, as  applicable, strive to share best practices.", "With regard to the information presented in the draft report, NOAA noted  that we did not present information on several cross-government initiatives  and NOAA management actions to address climate change. For example,  NOAA stated that we did not examine the current state of modeling and  observation systems, such as the Global Earth Observation System of  Systems and the National Integrated Drought Information System, or the  agency\u2019s contribution to the collaborative efforts with federal, state, and  local partners, including the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.  Although we recognize that NOAA has a well-developed research and  monitoring program, a detailed review of NOAA\u2019s many research programs  was beyond the scope of our work: the focus of the second objective of our  report was to obtain the views of federal resource managers on the  challenges they face in addressing the observed and potential future effects  of climate change in their management actions and planning efforts. In this  regard, a number of NOAA managers at our November workshop, at our  site visit, and at NOAA headquarters told us that resource managers need  more localized, site-specific information, and that there is often a  disconnect between physical science research and implementation  activities at the site level. Thus, while NOAA may be undertaking a number  of initiatives, these initiatives do not appear to address the site-specific  information needs of the on-site resource managers.", "NOAA also said that the Reef Manager\u2019s Guide, prepared by NOAA with  Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, details strategies to  help local and regional reef managers reduce threats to coral reefs, and that  NOAA staff implement some of these ideas. Although we agree that the  Reef Manager\u2019s Guide contains many useful suggestions for managers in  their efforts to respond to coral bleaching, we do not believe that it is a  substitute for official agency headquarters guidance. Similarly, we applaud  NOAA\u2019s involvement with the Nature Conservancy\u2019s Florida Reef Resiliency  Program, aimed at measuring the extent of coral bleaching and improving  the ability of reefs to survive bleaching events. However, we continue to  believe that NOAA needs a more comprehensive approach to managing for  the effects of climate change throughout the entire sanctuary system.", "In its comments, Interior agreed with our recommendation, and said that  the department will be using the information in the report to ensure that  the department is addressing concerns it shares with GAO regarding  climate change. Interior also pointed out that it had already taken steps to  assess the effects of climate change on public lands by convening a task  force involving nearly 100 people, including the department\u2019s assistant  secretaries and other top leaders as well as career scientists,  superintendents, refuge managers, and others. According to Interior, the  task force is examining how possible climate changes would affect disaster  management, water resource management, and habitat management and is  evaluating, among other things, new responses to manage changing  landscapes. Furthermore, according to Interior, the task force is currently  reviewing the development of accurate modeling and the weight to put on  modeling relative to the use of historic data and agrees with our  recommendation that the department will need to provide direction on how  to implement these new tools as they are developed and validated. The task  force is also evaluating how Interior might set priorities for generating  essential information to create baseline assessments of plants and animals  to appropriately manage the species the department oversees.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

In  addition, four case studies illustrate some of the effects of climate change  on federal resources as well as the challenges to addressing them.", "To select the four ecosystem types, we used a classification system used by  the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment  (the Heinz Center) in its 2002 report entitled The State of the Nation\u2019s  Ecosystems: Measuring the Lands, Waters, and Living Resources of the  United States. This classification system is generally accepted by the  scientific community and uses a limited number of distinct divisions to  identify ecosystem types (in contrast to certain other classification  systems). The Heinz Center\u2019s classification is also based on a \u201cland cover\u201d  approach. That is, it is based on dominant vegetation or other physical  characteristics, as opposed to a geographic approach. We found this  classification useful because many natural resource management decisions  are differentiated by land type. The Heinz Center classification system  identifies six ecosystem types: (1) coasts and oceans, (2) farmlands  (primarily croplands), (3) forests, (4) fresh waters, (5) grasslands and  shrublands, and (6) urban and suburban areas. Our work excluded  farmlands and urban and suburban areas because resources within these  ecosystem types are generally not managed by federal agencies.", "To solicit experts\u2019 views on the potential effects of climate change on the  four ecosystem types, we convened an expert workshop on November 2  and 3, 2006, in collaboration with the National Academies\u2019 Board on  Atmospheric Sciences and Climate. The workshop consisted of concurrent  breakout sessions for experts in each ecosystem type, and plenary sessions  in which all participants contributed. The National Academies, under  contract to GAO, helped identify appropriate workshop moderators and  participants, organized logistics, and issued the workshop invitations. The  National Academies and GAO worked together to prepare the agenda and  to identify scientific experts and economists for the first day of the  workshop, using specific selection criteria (described in greater detail in  the following text). GAO identified most of the federal resource managers  for the second day of the workshop because the National Academies does  not interact extensively with the federal resource management community.", "We asked National Academies staff to help us identify four individuals with  the following attributes to serve as breakout session moderators:   (1) experience in leading climate change assessments; (2) a strong  professional reputation that might attract other highly regarded experts;  (3) knowledge of one of the four ecosystem types; (4) a balanced  perspective on climate change (i.e., politically neutral, with no strong  ideological views on climate change expressed in past work); and (5) a  willingness to assist in planning the workshop\u2019s substance.", "To identify experts for the first day of the workshop on science issues, the  National Academies and GAO agreed on selection criteria, which included  recommendations from other experts, a demonstrated record of  publication in the field, and experience contributing to climate change  impact assessments or other peer-reviewed scientific reports and articles  relating to climate change. Other factors were also considered, such as the  individuals\u2019 availability on the date of the workshop. The National  Academies and GAO gave particular preference to individuals  recommended by more than one expert. In addition to ecosystem  expertise, we gave priority to those candidates whose expertise also  included an understanding of climate change (e.g., an understanding of  how climate change might affect coral reefs or forests). We also sought to  have an economist in each session. The National Academies reviewed  names in its database of experts and solicited recommendations from  various National Academies officials and scientists with whom National  Academies\u2019 staff regularly collaborate. In addition, GAO identified  scientists on the basis of interviews with climate change experts that we  conducted in the early phases of our work; we had asked these individuals  to name others with ecosystem expertise who might be good candidates for  the workshop. Workshop moderators also suggested participant names.  Once a consolidated list of potential invitees was finalized, it was reviewed  by the Chairman of the Executive Office of the National Research Council,  the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences  and the National Academy of Engineering.", "GAO and the National Academies focused the search for experts primarily  on individuals from government, academia, and nongovernmental  organizations (NGO) because most climate impact-related work is either  funded by these types of institutions or carried out by experts from these  types of bodies. However, since many NGOs have taken strong positions on  climate change, we drew upon this community to only a limited extent.", "To select experts for the second day of the workshop on management  issues, we asked for recommendations from both federal resource  management agency headquarters officials and managers in the field as  well as our workshop moderators. We gave priority to senior federal  resource managers with \u201con-the-ground\u201d management experience in the  field. We also invited managers from Washington, D.C., headquarters  offices to ensure a balanced perspective. We selected managers who had a  general familiarity with relevant statutes, regulations, agreements,  executive orders, and other management directives aimed at protecting the  resources under their agencies\u2019 jurisdictions. We also selected managers  who had a general familiarity with the issue of climate change and how it  could affect one of the four relevant ecosystem types\u2014although this  knowledge was not essential. We sought to have representation from each  major agency that manages resources corresponding to each of the four  ecosystem types. For example, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM),  Forest Service (FS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National  Park Service (NPS) all manage grasslands, and each of these agencies was  represented in the grasslands and shrublands breakout session. To keep the  scope of the project manageable, we did not include all federal agencies  that oversee federal resources, such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the  Department of Defense, the Tennessee Valley Authority, or others  (although we did have one representative from the Bureau of Reclamation,  which manages water resources in the west). We also did not include  Exclusive Economic Zone waters managed by the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).", "Fifty-four scientists, economists, and federal resource managers from  academia, government, and NGOs, attended the workshop. Appendix I  contains a list of the workshop participants and moderators.", "Prior to the workshop, we sent all participants an information packet  containing, among other things, graphs showing the range and average of  model projections for the change in monthly temperature (degrees Celsius)  and precipitation (millimeters per day) in the years 2020 and 2090 for   11 U.S. regions under a medium impact Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC) scenario. The graphs were based on publicly  available results from the full suite of models used in the IPCC\u2019s Fourth  Assessment report. The graphs, prepared for GAO by the National Center  for Atmospheric Research, were intended to provide a framework for the  workshop discussions by bounding the range of possible future  temperature and precipitation outcomes. We provided this material to  participants for background information purposes only; participants were  given the option of referring to these graphs when responding to the  questions posed at the workshop. We also sent participants, as background  reading, copies of the IPCC Third Assessment Report Working Group II\u2019s  first chapter, entitled \u201cOverview of Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability  to Climate Change.\u201d Each participant was further sent the IPCC Third  Assessment chapter that corresponded to the ecosystem type (e.g., forests  or coasts and oceans) on which the participant was expected to speak.", "On the first day of the workshop, 27 scientific experts and economists,  each having particular expertise on 1 of the 4 ecosystem types, discussed  scientific questions related to the potential effects of climate change on  federal resources. (These questions can be found in app. III.) On the second  day of the workshop, also organized according to ecosystem type, 28  resource managers discussed the challenges, constraints, and limitations  they faced in managing federal resources, given the potential effects of  climate change identified on the previous day. The workshop was designed  to give the scientists the leading role on the first day and managers the  leading role on the second day. However, in most cases, both sets of  individuals participated in discussions both days because some managers  had scientific backgrounds, and some scientists had experience in resource  management. There were also two plenary sessions addressing questions  of science and management that applied to all four ecosystem types.  Summaries of the ecosystem breakout sessions and the plenary sessions  are presented in appendix III. After the workshop, we sent drafts of the  findings from each of the breakout sessions to participants, giving them an  opportunity to comment on the accuracy of the information.", "It is important to note that the expert views represented at the workshop  are the views of scientists and managers, not those of GAO. We did not  independently review articles from the scientific literature or verify  participants\u2019 statements. In addition, although the workshop experts  discussed a wide range of possible climate-related effects, we describe only  some of these effects in our report. We also did not attempt to rank effects  according to severity, owing to a lack of criteria to make such rankings.", "To illustrate some of the effects of climate change on federal resources and  possible options for addressing them at federal resource units, we  conducted four case studies, one case study for each ecosystem type, using  a nonprobability approach. We selected our specific case study sites after  soliciting selected experts\u2019 views on which federal resources may be most  vulnerable to climate change. The experts we consulted included many of  those whom we invited to the first day of the workshop (including some  unable to attend), as well as others recommended by other experts or  individuals whose names appeared frequently in the peer-reviewed  literature for the relevant ecosystem type. We e-mailed these individuals,  soliciting their views on which specific federal land units they considered  to be most vulnerable to climate change impacts and the nature of any  adverse impacts. In making our final land unit selections, we also  considered responses obtained at the workshop; one of our workshop  questions asked participants which areas of the United States may be most  vulnerable to climate change. Furthermore, we took into consideration  land unit visitation levels, size, location, geographical diversity, ecological  and geological variation, and land unit management agency in making our  selections. For example, we gave priority to larger land units and to units  with high levels of visitation and a range of geographic features. We also  gave priority to units where more than one agency is involved in  management decisions. We further considered accessibility, since it was  important to visit each site. The four units we selected on the basis of these  criteria are the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in southern Florida  (coasts and oceans ecosystem); the Chugach National Forest in south- central Alaska (forests ecosystem); Glacier National Park in northwestern  Montana (fresh waters ecosystem); and the BLM Kingman Field Office in  northwestern Arizona (grasslands and shrublands ecosystem). All of these  units encompass multiple ecosystem types. For example, Glacier consists  of glaciers, lakes, forests, and alpine meadows, among other features, while  the Chugach contains a mix of forests, coasts and oceans, and fresh waters  ecosystems.", "Management agencies for these four sites include BLM (Kingman, Arizona);  FWS (four national wildlife refuges near the Florida Keys National Marine  Sanctuary, the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge adjacent to the Chugach, and  certain resources within Glacier); and NPS (Glacier), all under the  jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior; FS, which falls under the  jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture (the Chugach and the  Flathead National Forest near Glacier); and NOAA, which falls under the  jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce (Florida Keys National Marine  Sanctuary). In addition to the managers and experts at each case study  location, we also spoke with officials from adjacent federal lands. We  spoke with these officials because resource units in our specific case study  land units coordinate with adjacent land units, and the ecosystems  supported by the case studies generally overlap with surrounding federal  resource units. For example, for the Chugach case study, we spoke with  FWS experts and managers from the adjacent Kenai National Wildlife  Refuge as well as staff from FS\u2019s Alaska Regional Office in Juneau. For the  Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary case study, we spoke with experts  and managers from the Everglades and Dry Tortugas National Parks as well  as FWS experts and staff who oversee four Keys national wildlife refuges  located near the sanctuary. For the Glacier case study, we spoke with  experts and managers from FS\u2019s Flathead National Forest as well as an  FWS fish biologist based in the park. At a number of sites, we viewed  firsthand some of the resources discussed at the meetings.", "We also spoke to representatives of some private sector organizations. For  example, for the Glacier National Park case study, we also spoke with  representatives of firms that do business in the park and with staff from a  private foundation. We also spoke with local academic researchers, state  government offices, and representatives of NGOs with expertise on the  respective sites, as appropriate. It is important to note that the four case  studies are illustrative only and not projectable. That is, physical and  management conditions that apply to a given federal resource may not  apply to all federal land or water units of a similar ecosystem type or  managed by the same agency. Detailed summaries of the individual case  studies can be found in appendix IV.", "To assess the reliability of data related to changes in Glacier National Park,  spruce bark beetle infestations in Alaska, and loggerhead turtle nesting  patterns in Florida, we spoke with park officials, Kenai National Wildlife  Refuge officials, and University of Central Florida researchers,  respectively, about data quality control procedures and reviewed relevant  studies. We determined that the data and expert views obtained were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "Finally, in concluding our work, we contacted legal counsel at each of the  five resource management agencies as well as the White House Council on  Environmental Quality, to ascertain the scope and nature of federal  authority and requirements to address the impacts of climate change in  resource management and planning.", "In this report, we use the term \u201cfederal resources\u201d to refer to federal lands  managed by BLM, FS, FWS, and NPS, and to national marine sanctuaries  and one marine national monument managed by NOAA; the term  \u201cecosystem\u201d to refer to a system of interacting living organisms together  with their physical environment; the term \u201cresource managers\u201d to refer to  individuals who manage federal resources; the term \u201cphysical effects\u201d to  refer to observable changes in the physical condition of some part of a  natural system, including, among others, extreme weather events\u2014that is,  weather events that are rare at a particular place (this may vary from place  to place); the term \u201cbiological effects\u201d to refer to changes in the interaction  among organisms living in a given ecosystem; and the phrase \u201ceconomic  and social goods and services\u201d to refer to economic resources, such as  revenue-producing industries, including forestry and fishing, among others,  and social or cultural resources, such as recreational activities, scenic  views, and historical artifacts, among others.

Much of the west relies on spring snowmelt to  provide a steady stream of water into summer months, when demand  is highest; however, warmer temperatures and a shift of the winter  precipitation regime from snow to rain are expected to cause  reduced snowpack and early snowmelt. \u201cRain-on-snow\u201d events  increase the potential for flooding, as rainwater and melted snow  cause very high runoff rates in winter and early spring. Because of  this temperature-driven shift of precipitation (from snow to rain),  there is an increased variance in annual streamflow volumes, with  greater flow in winter months and decreased streamflows in summer  months, and increased reliance on groundwater stores (which are  themselves affected by precipitation changes).", "High runoff in winter and early spring is likely to increase soil  erosion, enlarge stream channels and increase channel instability,  increase sediment load, and increase turbidity in rivers and streams.  If a high runoff event follows dry periods, high nutrient flux is  expected, as nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural fertilizers  and decayed organic matter will be washed into streams. The extra  nutrient load may stimulate plant growth (eutrophication), resulting  in oxygen depletion in the water body, and the increased turbidity  will likely reduce ecosystem productivity. Furthermore, disturbance  events, such as peak streamflow events, are likely to occur and are  expected to adversely affect the biodiversity of aquatic species,  particularly insects.", "The reduction of summer streamflows will limit the amount of  habitat available for every species dependent on the stream, since  reduced streamflow and reduced stream connectivity inhibits an  aquatic species\u2019 ability to move through an area. Low summer  streamflows will limit hydropower generation capacity, and it will be  necessary to balance human and ecological demands for water  resources. The phenology of critical biological functions, such as  fish migration and reproduction, may be disrupted by changing  patterns of water flow or availability, according to one expert  commenting after completion of the workshop. Reduced summer  flows can limit habitat directly by decreasing available habitat area,  in addition to reducing connectivity, according to another expert  commenting after the workshop. Furthermore, according to one  expert commenting after the workshop, reduced summer  streamflows will result in a contraction of the stream network and a  reduction in the density of headwater streams. Since most of the total  length of the stream network is in these headwater streams, there is  likely to be a fairly dramatic decrease in the amount of flowing  surface water late in the summer, meaning that streams will dry up  sooner, according to this expert.", "Increased temperature of lakes, reservoirs, and rivers  Higher land surface temperatures will increase temperatures of  surface water bodies and will cause warmer runoff to enter streams,  raising the temperature of receiving waters. For example, increased  temperatures of 7 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit have been observed in  water bodies in the east after storm events. Increased water body  temperatures may include the following adverse effects: increased  risk of toxic algal blooms; reduction in summer habitat or increased  juvenile mortality of cold water and headwater obligate aquatic  species (this may have  significant economic consequences). For example, the nonnative  zebra mussel has extended its range in the Great Lakes as lake water  temperatures have warmed. Furthermore, temperature changes may  result in the introduction of disease or extirpation (elimination of a  species or subspecies from a particular area, but not from its entire  range), particularly if the species cannot migrate to other areas.", "Headwater obligate aquatic species are species that must live at the headwaters, or source  waters of a stream. may lead to increased rates of hypoxia (conditions of low oxygen in  water), reducing ecosystem health.", "Lake mixing cycles and stratification of lake water are temperature- driven processes, which are necessary for nutrient cycling (turnover)  and ecosystem health. If temperatures do not drop low enough in  winter months, lake mixing may be reduced or stopped altogether.", "Reduced winter ice cover on large lakes, such as the Great Lakes,  may alter \u201clake effect\u201d snow patterns, resulting in more rain and less  snow in areas down wind or down weather. Reduced ice cover also  allows for a great deal of evaporation from the lakes through winter  months, reducing the springtime water levels in the lake. This is  likely to affect the shipping industry by opening routes in the winter,  but restricting routes in the summer if lake levels are too shallow. If  water levels of the Great Lakes are shallow during summer months  and require smaller ships or dredging in lake inlets, substantial costs  may ensue.", "Cold temperatures and lack of biological activity also help to  preserve submerged cultural resources, such as shipwrecks (e.g.,  Lake Huron). Similarly, the United Nations has been looking at  preservation challenges at archeological sites around the world, due  to increased decay and erosion resulting from climate change.", "An FWS representative said that the fisheries in Alaska may be  conditions in western North America. Salmon also play an important  role in the energy and nutrient cycle in many northern streams, and if  salmon abundance declines substantially, the availability of energy  and nutrients to numerous aquatic and terrestrial species, such as  insects, birds, and bears, will be reduced accordingly. In general,  most climate forcing ecosystem impacts are occurring in higher  latitudes, where ecosystems are simpler and potentially more  vulnerable to both change and disturbance.", "Coastal areas that rely on groundwater supplies will have to be  careful not to overdraw from the aquifer to avoid saltwater intrusion  and contamination.

Also, coastal wetlands may become  contaminated with salt, killing off grasses that would normally assist  in the water purification process.", "Increased storm surges or flow volumes may damage infrastructure,  including roads, offices, and housing built in floodplains. Experts  acknowledged the importance of maintaining public access to public  lands, but they questioned societal decisions made to construct  facilities on sites that may be vulnerable.

One participant noted that  ecologists use the word, \u201cthreshold\u201d to describe physical parameters that  stray from the traditional path of an ecosystem.", "Some experts questioned the importance of identifying thresholds,  although they acknowledged the value of understanding the issues  surrounding thresholds and identifying the types of thresholds that could  be crossed, and the factors that could contribute to approaching a  threshold. Land managers believed that it may be useful to set aside lands  to serve as buffers to mitigate potential damages associated with reaching a  threshold.", "Whereas land managers are accountable for protecting endangered species  and upholding agency mission, they believed that they may be driven more  and more to managing toward the protection of \u201cniche\u201d species, or  managing against invasive, \u201copportunistic\u201d species. They expressed  concern that the threshold question may be species-specific, rather than a  biodiversity issue. They also believed that there may be a false security in  \u201cmanaging to thresholds\u201d (versus \u201cmanaging at levels beneath thresholds\u201d).  The fresh waters scientists and managers agreed that an understanding of  thresholds is important so that early-warning signals that a threshold is  approaching may be developed.", "The fresh waters group of experts identified the following thresholds:  Temperature threshold (stratified lakes)", "Lakes will not thermally stratify and \u201cturnover\u201d in the spring if winter  temperatures do not drop below 4 degrees Celsius. Lake turnover is  an important temperature-driven process that helps to oxygenate  waters and cycle organic matter and nutrients through the water  column. This threshold is presumably more significant in large lakes  and has to do with the depth of the lake and latitude.", "Temperature threshold (cold-water species)", "According to an expert commenting after completion of the  workshop, the mortality rate of some cold-water species, such as  salmon, increases dramatically above certain temperatures.", "If streams dry up earlier within the annual hydrologic cycle, the  threshold itself may shift as a result of changing precipitation  patterns and/or warmer temperatures associated with climate  change. Year-round streams may become ephemeral streams, small  ponds may become vernal pools, etc. We may see a dramatic  reduction of nitrogen removal from microbes in streams and  wetlands, and a possible loss of species (e.g., salamanders). Areas  with greater precipitation will likely result in increased connectivity  (which opens migration corridors for invasive and endemic species).  An expert commenting after completion of the workshop said that  there is not a clear threshold for stream network connectivity. The  expert said that the area necessary to sustain certain streams will be  larger if more water falls as rain in the winter with less snowpack.", "Topographically driven and elevation-controlled incremental change  in the rain-to-snow ratio affects the position of the snowline (the  dynamic position where snow typically accumulates on the  landscape) for areas with snow-dominated precipitation in the west.  If the climate forces the snowline to move up in elevation, there will  be a radically nonlinear decline in snow area, likely to cause huge  changes in fresh waters systems in those areas. Migration corridors  may open (for warm-water species), or species habitat may become  fragmented (especially true for cold-water species). Even if  migration corridors exist, they would have to be temperature- appropriate for species migration and interaction. Land use/Land  management systems, such as dams, canals, and construction  projects, increase this effect of habitat fragmentation. With added  terrestrial connectivity (due to less winter snow cover), there is  possibility of a bark beetle invasion across the United States (i.e.,  achieve continental connectivity). One expert commenting after  completion of the workshop said that bark beetle invasions would be  triggered by warmer temperatures that allow the beetles to reach  existing forests to the north that are connected across Canada to  eastern forests. The expert said that beetle invasions have nothing  specifically to do with less winter snow cover because the  connectivity is already there. According to the expert, it has been too  cold for the beetles to survive until recently.", "Land managers may want to manage to protect the habitat of these  species, which have a disproportionate positive impact on ecosystem  processes (e.g., beaver, Black-Tailed Prairie Dogs). An NPS  representative asked, \u201cUnder what conditions will species migrate  out of particular national parks?\u201d A species shift could have social  ramifications, since park visitors value the experience of seeing  species within the park. In some cases, federal land acquisition has  been motivated by the presence of particular species, which may  migrate to unprotected areas, according to an expert commenting  after completion of the workshop.", "Temperature- or climate-sensitive species may be indicators of  impending thresholds; enormous regional shifts are possible in  systems with a high degree of connectivity, but this is not necessarily  true for species that cannot easily migrate to other areas (i.e., insects  can fly, fish cannot easily migrate).", "Wildfires are strongly dependent on the degree of spring \u201cwet-up\u201d  conditions and the sequence of wet and dry years, since presence of  an adequate amount of moisture can protect against burning. Fire is a  huge driver of ecological change, so anything that changes the fire  regime is likely to have ramifications and ripple effects through  feedbacks into hydrological, geomorphic, and temperature response.  This threshold is expressed in terms of years (i.e., years between fire  events).", "Humans have installed a great deal of infrastructure in the west to  manage water resources, including dams. Increased storminess will  adversely affect aging infrastructure. With thousands of small dams  in the United States, climate change may exacerbate existing stresses  of aging infrastructure and inadequate water supplies in growing  areas. Rain-on-snow events, characteristic of \u201cwarm\u201d snowpacks, are  a recipe for big floods and may result in damage to docks, roads, or  other infrastructure on or adjacent to streams, lakes, and coasts. One  expert commenting after completion of the workshop said that rain- on-snow induced floods generally result in increased damage to river- related infrastructure, not coastal infrastructure.", "Panelists expressed concern that society may become less tolerant  for taking action to mitigate climate change, such as spending money  or reconstructing infrastructure (levees) to address climate change  issues.", "Minimum flow rate in rivers  As metropolitan areas grow, water demand increases, resulting in a  decrease in water levels. If we do not keep minimum flows available  for aquatic species, there will be more problems for species survival;  natural storage facilities (lakes, reservoirs, and streams) may not be  sufficient if water demand increases.", "Water quality degradation  Water quality is likely to decline if harmful algal blooms, bacteria,  botulism, etc., occur as a result of increased temperature.

The regular disturbance of snow  avalanches is ecologically important at high elevations, allowing  herbaceous plants to grow in tree-laden forests. A reduction in  herbaceous plants results in reduced grizzly bear habitat (a culturally  valued animal). Greater variability of winter runoff volumes, from  high snow followed by rain, is likely to result in more snow  avalanches and increased frequency of landslides and debris flows.  This is a threshold-driven phenomenon sensitive to small changes in  precipitation with the potential to result in extreme events in soil  erosion.", "Salinity level of aquatic systems  fresh waters inundation to saltwaters\u2014for example, through  increased runoff volumes in early spring\u2014rapidly decreases salinity.

For example, many man-made dams currently create a wider range of  flow than anticipated with climate change. Land managers identified  examples of a dam\u2019s role in isolating populations versus opening  migration corridors, and they asked whether dam operators should  change practices in light of climate change. If dams are removed  from an area, or if they can no longer function, a migration corridor is  opened for nonnative species to move beyond the dam area.

According  to NOAA scientists, if the climate\u2014and sea temperature\u2014warm, the reefs  could be increasingly vulnerable to coral bleaching, a stress response that  occurs when the corals expel the algae that live within the coral tissues and  give the healthy corals their color. Bleaching, which turns the corals white,  has affected the sanctuary with increasing frequency. Corals can recover  from bleaching events if the stress is not too severe and long-lasting, but  the stress on corals caused by coral bleaching has led to secondary  problems, such as coral diseases. The corals are first stressed by the  conditions that lead to coral bleaching, which is directly related to  increased sea surface temperatures, and then afterward may succumb to a  variety of coral diseases. A NOAA scientist told us that, as a result of  climate change and seawater temperature increases, coral reefs could  bleach every year, starting around midcentury. NOAA officials stated that  climate-related factors, in conjunction with other environmental factors  that stress the ecosystem, such as pollution, disease, and overfishing, may  make coral reefs increasingly vulnerable to bleaching and degradation.  Many other species in the surrounding marine ecosystem, such as fish and  crustaceans that depend on the reefs for food or shelter, may be threatened  by widespread bleaching. Officials stated that, in the long term, the  deterioration of coral reefs and the attendant loss of biodiversity could be  \u201cdevastating.\u201d", "A University of Miami scientist who has been studying coral reefs and  climate change for 11 years told us that coral reefs are also vulnerable to  ocean acidification, which occurs when increased carbon dioxide levels  decrease carbonate ion in the seawater; carbonate ion is a substance that  corals need to build their skeletons. By 2050, carbonate ion could be 34  percent less abundant, according to this scientist.", "FWS officials told us that various habitats found on the Keys Wildlife  Refuges may be vulnerable to climate-related changes and other factors  that stress the environment. These officials stated that endangered species,  such as the Key deer and Lower Keys marsh rabbit, may have greater  difficulty surviving as a result. In addition, rising sea levels and increased  storm surges after hurricanes that may result from climate change can  cause saltwater intrusion on land, which can overwhelm sources of fresh  waters that support the ecosystem\u2019s plant and animal life. Increasing  salinity can change where fire occurs as well as the distribution of species,  according to FWS officials.", "FWS officials said that increased storm activity that may result from  climate change will pose a threat not only to humans on the low-lying  islands, but also to many animals\u2014including sea turtles\u2014which may find it  difficult to lay eggs on eroded beaches. NPS officials pointed out that  hurricanes, exacerbated by higher sea levels, will do more damage if they  become more frequent as a result of climate change.

These officials indicated that the  ocean front is already encroaching further inland, pushing the salt content  higher in border areas and traditionally fresh waters areas, a concern  because many fresh waters species cannot tolerate increased salinity. NPS  officials noted that increased saltwater intrusion will affect the endangered  Florida manatee, a fresh waters species, as well as the crocodile, which  flourishes in brackish water. Wading birds are also vulnerable to such  changes, since as salinity increases, their key food source\u2014fish\u2014also  decreases.

In this regard, they attributed a number of changes in the  forest ecosystem, at least in part, to the warming and drying of the climate  on the Kenai Peninsula area of the forest. For example, the peninsula has  been the center of a spruce bark beetle outbreak that has killed large  numbers of Sitka, White, and Lutz spruce trees on 4 million acres in south- central Alaska. In lowland areas of the peninsula, lake levels have declined  by as much as 1 meter, and many ponds documented in aerial photographs  from the 1950s are now grassy areas with spruce and hardwood trees. In  the Kenai Mountains, the tree line has risen an average of 1 meter per year  during the past 5 decades. Furthermore, many glaciers in the region have  been retreating since the 1850s, but the pace has greatly accelerated in  recent years in response to a warming and drying climate. For example,  one large ice field in the Kenai Peninsula has lost 70 vertical feet and   5 percent in surface area in the last 50 years. As they have continued to  melt and recede, the runoff from many glaciers has created glacial lakes,  which capture glacial sediment and decrease the amount of sediment going  into glacial rivers. As a result, the rivers are transforming from glacial,  multiple channel systems to single channel meandering systems that can  have considerable impacts on fish habitat, riparian and floodplain  vegetation, and water quality. Officials at the Chugach also told us that they  have observed an increase in the frequency of severe storm events, along  with a seeming increase in lightning strikes and fires caused by lightning in  recent years.", "In addition to changes that the region is already experiencing, managers  and scientists told us that they were concerned about a variety of potential  effects from climate change that may impact the Chugach in the future. For  example, although invasive species have not been a problem to date in  most of Alaska, occurrences of invasive species could increase in response  to disturbances associated with climate change, according to these  officials. Furthermore, as habitats shift, sensitive and rare species could be  adversely affected. Hydrological changes resulting from climate change  could affect salmon fisheries and spawning habitat. Although the impacts  are not yet known, climate change could affect tourism and recreation  activities in the region, according to the Chugach officials.

This, in turn,  could have negative consequences for the downstream communities\u2014both  natural and human\u2014that those species support.", "A USGS scientist informed us that, since 1850, the number of glaciers  within the park has dropped from 150 to 26, and that current trends in the  rate of glacial melting in the park suggest the remaining glaciers will be  gone in the next 25 to 30 years. According to scientists with whom we  spoke, the loss of glaciers is symbolic of the overall changes to the natural  systems in the park, including the water cycle and water temperatures.", "NPS officials told us that the increasing number and severity of storms and  lightning that may result from climate change may cause more forest fires,  while more dead vegetation and drier conditions late in the season may  feed larger, more intense wildland fires. An official also said that warmer  temperatures and more severe drought may increase the risk that insects  and diseases will harm already stressed trees. Greater disturbances to the  park\u2019s natural systems will place native plants and animals under greater  stress, and invasive (nonnative) species may be able to get a firmer hold  and spread more easily, out-competing native species. According to an NPS  official, warmer temperatures are expected to negatively affect mountain  aquatic organisms, including insect larvae, which are an important part of  the food chain as well as fish species, such as bull trout, that thrive in cold  water. An NPS official explained that organisms that cannot migrate  upstream to colder temperatures will not survive.", "An NPS scientist noted that climate change is expected to cause vegetation  in the park to migrate uphill in many places, where it is cooler, changing the  ground cover in many areas of the park and affecting wildlife species that  depend on those habitats. An official said that as alpine habitats warm,  trees are expected to move upslope into areas that are currently treeless.  Forests are already beginning to invade alpine and subalpine meadows.  (Alpine refers to the zone consisting of slopes above the timberline and  characterized by, among other things, the presence of low, shrubby, slow- growing woody plants.) These officials added that several animal species  may be negatively affected by the loss of alpine and subalpine habitat,  including bighorn sheep, grizzly bears, mountain goats, and wolverines.  They observed that because many rare plants and animals in the park are  living at the edge of their range, climate change may cause some of these  species in the park to die off. Officials noted that the park has already been  afflicted by a mountain pine beetle infestation. This insect has decimated  large areas of forest, owing to an increased vitality that has been linked, in  part, to warmer temperatures.", "Park and USGS officials are concerned that warmer winters resulting from  climate change may lead to more avalanches and to more winter flooding,  which will threaten park infrastructure. For example, they told us that  there may be an increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall on snow cover,  which can cause severe floods. According to these officials, if this happens,  trails would need to be modified to meet such conditions, and the greater  potential for weather-related infrastructure damage will require more  maintenance and improvements. In addition, climate change might result in  a longer park visitation season as spring comes earlier and winter comes  later; this would place additional demands on park resources. For example,  they said that there would be pressure for roads and facilities to stay open  longer, which will require more staff and resources. These officials also  said that if more fires occur, the visitor experience could be diminished by  reduced air quality or limited access to fire-ravaged areas of the park, and  the park and local communities could lose revenue from visitation. For  example, in 2003, the Going-to-the-Sun Road was shut down for 23 days due  to fire. Officials also noted that fires divert park and FS staff from their  regular duties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Resource managers from FS, NPS, and USGS told us that they face several  challenges in addressing climate change, including limited funds,  insufficient monitoring capability, the lack of baseline information,  competing priorities, the need to involve surrounding communities, and the  inability at the local level to make a significant impact on a global issue,  among others.", "NPS and USGS officials stated that monitoring systems\u2014programs that  monitor the health of various park plants, animals, and physical   features\u2014within the park are insufficient due to lack of funding. For  example, USGS, which has provided much of the monitoring effort for the  park in the past, has closed down about 28 percent of stream gauges  nationally. An NPS official noted that, while legislation directs NPS to  conduct and use research to support resource management decisions,  programs to support their efforts, and the efforts of their other federal  partners, have suffered from incomplete or partial funding due to budget  shortfalls. The NPS Inventory and Monitoring program was developed to  address managers\u2019 needs for better scientific information about park  resources. Although one of the goals of the Inventory and Monitoring  program is to create baseline inventories of basic biological and  geophysical natural resources, NPS officials stated they do not have  sufficient baseline information, and the program is not comprehensive  enough to meet all of their information needs. In addition, because no  systematic monitoring of species currently exists, it is very difficult to  determine which species are at risk, determine the health of the species\u2019  populations, and develop early warning systems to predict specific effects  of climate change.", "According to Glacier National Park officials, a number of issues may  compete with climate change for priority in receiving resources and  attention. These issues include the impacts of a proposed upstream coal  mine in Canada, a request from a railroad to trigger avalanches with  explosives inside the park, the proliferation of noxious weeds, the  deterioration of park infrastructure, and urban encroachment along the  park\u2019s borders.", "An NPS official expressed concern that high growth rates in the  surrounding community may exacerbate some of the impacts of climate  change on park resources. One of the ways in which plant and animal  populations might adapt to climate change is to migrate as conditions  change. For migration to occur, migration corridors must be connected to  other regions. As development and land-use pressures increase on  neighboring lands, these corridors will disappear, which may limit the  ability of park ecosystems to adapt, according to an NPS official.", "NPS officials emphasized that since climate change is a global issue, little  can be done to stem the problem of climate change within the park, other  than to respond, to the limited extent possible, to the symptoms of climate  change through activities such as prescribing burns, reducing vegetation  that may serve as kindling for forest fires, or controlling noxious weeds.  However, park officials said that they are trying to address climate  change\u2014to the extent possible\u2014by, among other actions, setting a good  example in reducing the park\u2019s own greenhouse gas emissions. For  example, they told us that the park is participating in the Environmental  Protection Agency\u2019s Climate Friendly Parks program, which focuses on  reducing parks\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions. The park also has an  Environmental Management Plan that includes a number of energy  efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. In addition, the park requires  the concessioners that run businesses in the park to abide by certain  environmental requirements, some of which affect greenhouse gas  emissions.", "NPS officials also told us that there is currently no explicit guidance from  NPS headquarters on addressing climate change, and that no funding or  resources have been allocated directly to the issue. In addition, an NPS  staff member felt that it would be useful for the park to produce a formal  written position on climate change to further clarify the park\u2019s stance on  the science and impacts and to outline a communication strategy for  discussing the issue. NPS staff also indicated that one of the greatest values  of parks such as Glacier may be in informing visitors about the potential of  climate change to disrupt natural ecosystems and decrease the benefits  that these systems provide to human society."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Grasslands and Shrublands Ecosystem: Bureau of Land Management Kingman Field Office, Arizona", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Site Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["We selected the land managed by the BLM Kingman Field Office, Arizona,  as our grasslands and shrublands ecosystem case study.

Also included are some  pastures and haylands, which represent an overlap with the farmland  system.", "The field office manages approximately 2.6 million acres of public land in  northwestern Arizona, including portions of the Sonoran Desert, Mojave  Desert, Colorado Plateau, and six different mountain ranges. This land unit  is home to a variety of wildlife, including the largest desert bighorn sheep  population in the world, the desert tortoise, and several other threatened  and endangered species. The land unit receives approximately 540,000  visitors per year for a variety of recreational activities, such as camping,  hunting, hiking, bird-watching, and all-terrain-vehicle 4-wheeling. It also  supports economic activity through multiple types of resource extraction,  most notably livestock grazing and sand, gravel, gold, and copper mining.

For example, the officials said  that a prolonged drought in the region had likely resulted in high mortality  rates of old growth pinyon pine trees, most notably those located on south- facing mountain slopes as well as some ponderosa pines and chaparral.  Ponderosa bark beetle and mistletoe infestations had also acted as  stressors, contributing to the die-off of ponderosa pines.", "Furthermore, according to field office staff, drought conditions in the  region are causing desert scrub plant communities to convert into annual  grassland communities, which are more vulnerable to fire. They said that  this phenomenon has contributed to problems related to fire management.  Prolonged drought acts as a stressor to native plant communities. Then, in  periods of wetness, invasive species (typically, invasive annual grasses) fill  in the gaps between native vegetation. Invasive species can spread and  grow faster than native species. As a result, the thicker and less-evenly  spaced vegetation leads to fire danger. If a fire starts, it burns much longer  and hotter due to the invasive grasses. Native plant communities, such as  saguaro cacti and Joshua trees are not fire resistant, so fire damages these  communities and provides further environment for invasive species and  increased fire danger. In some instances, according to officials, repeated  fires of this nature have destroyed native plant communities, such that only  invasive grasslands remain. A severe drought occurred in 2002 that resulted  in the loss of perennial grass, shrubs, and trees. This drought, coupled with  increased annual growth in wet years, accelerated conversion of hot  deserts plant communities into annual grasslands. Should continued severe  drought become the norm, this conversion can be expected to continue.", "The drier climatic conditions experienced in the region have created a list  of vulnerable species and natural systems on land managed by the field  office. For example, BLM scientists and resource managers told us that  continuing dry conditions will likely cause changes in vegetation  composition and species populations. They also said that dry conditions  increase soil erosion; decrease plant productivity, resulting in less forage  for cattle; decrease wildlife species abundance and diversity; decrease  habitats for certain endangered species; reduce water flows in creeks and  rivers; and dry up natural springs, leading to reduced water availability for  wildlife (including wild burros), livestock, and riparian (riverbank) plant  communities. With less precipitation, there would also be less groundwater  recharge, potentially creating a situation where groundwater removal  could exceed its replenishment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["BLM Kingman Field Office managers with whom we met told us that they  were unaware of any requirements or guidance for how to consider climate  change in their planning and management efforts. In addition, field office  staff said that climate change is not a priority, as partially evidenced by the  fact that climate change-related activities have not been included in agency  budgets. They further said that they evaluate priorities on a year-by-year  basis, due to resource constraints. Because of these constraints, the field  office is necessarily only addressing the highest priority issues, leaving  many other issues untouched.", "Another management challenge facing the field office is that much of the  land it oversees is situated in a \u201ccheckerboard\u201d pattern of land plots,  alternating between public and private ownership. This pattern is primarily  due to the system of railroad land grants, in which the federal government  gave the companies land parcels to encourage railroad development in the  region. The alternating pattern of land ownership makes managing these  parcels for habitat protection purposes very difficult. BLM can face public  resistance when making land management decisions. For example, fire  closures that restrict access to certain areas of land leads to public  complaints. Land managed by the field office is also under stress due to the  high level of development of lands adjacent to BLM land that has taken  place over the past several years.", "Furthermore, field office officials told us that they have adequate  management tools, such as reducing grazing-use levels, to reduce the  impacts of climate change. However, they said they must show a clear  pattern of historical data to make decisions or they risk opening  themselves to litigation. These managers added that they would likely face  challenges and opposition if they based their management actions on  theoretical projections. Therefore, the managers stated that they were  unsure whether they could base management actions on projected changes  that may be brought about by climate change. In addition, they stated that  climate change, because of its large scale, is difficult to deal with on the  local level. That is, although they might be able to react to the effects of  climate change on the land they manage, they are not able to control  changes in the atmosphere or greater climatic patterns."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (FS)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Commerce (NOAA)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Interior (BLM, FWS, and NPS)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Vincent P.
