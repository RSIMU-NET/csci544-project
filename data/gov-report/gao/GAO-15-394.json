As part of that process, BLM conducted an auction and two sales of federal helium in the summer of 2014.", "GAO was asked to assess BLM's implementation of the act. This report examines (1) the outcomes of BLM's summer 2014 helium auction and sales, (2) BLM's administration of the act's tolling provision (tolling refers to a helium refiner processing or refining another party's crude helium for an agreed upon price), and (3) upcoming decisions BLM faces as it continues implementing the act.

Two refiners purchased all 93 million cubic feet of helium that was auctioned at an average price of $161 per thousand cubic feet\u2014significantly above the prices offered by most other bidders. BLM, refiners, and nonrefiners identified possible reasons for the auction's outcome, including that refiners had an advantage at the auction because their costs for refining crude helium were lower than those of nonrefiners. After the auction, BLM sold more than 1 billion cubic feet of helium in two sales that were restricted to refiners. Since BLM used the average auction price to help set the sales price, the sales price also was higher than expected.", "BLM has taken steps to help improve reporting by refiners, but the agency does not have full assurance that refiners are satisfying the tolling provision. The tolling provision requires refiners, as a condition of sale or auction, to make excess refining capacity available at commercially reasonable rates to certain nonrefiners. BLM officials said that one way refiners can satisfy the tolling provision is to attempt to negotiate tolling agreements. The act does not require refiners to report information to BLM about their attempts to negotiate agreements that do not result in signed agreements, so the reporting of this information is voluntary. BLM requested that refiners report this information, but the refiners' responses were inconsistent. For example, some refiners reported that they had attempted to negotiate agreements but did not report details about volume or rates offered. Officials from Interior's Office of the Solicitor said BLM may need to issue a rule to require refiners to report about their attempts to negotiate tolling agreements. However, BLM officials said they do not intend to issue such a rule because it is a time-consuming process that might delay future auctions and sales. Nevertheless, without information about refiners' attempts to negotiate agreements, BLM cannot determine the extent to which refiners with excess capacity are satisfying the tolling provision.", "BLM faces a number of decisions about its continued implementation of the act, including decisions related to the auction of a portion of the helium BLM will make available for delivery during fiscal year 2016. Specifically, BLM officials said they plan to contract with a third party to conduct a survey of helium transactions that will form the basis for the fiscal year 2016 minimum auction price, but they have not determined the scope of the survey. Also, BLM officials said they are considering increasing the amount of helium the agency will auction for fiscal year 2016 above the amount set in the act because they think it will increase competition at the auction. In addition, BLM faces a decision in selecting a method for conducting the fiscal year 2016 auction. The act requires BLM to use an auction method that maximizes revenue. BLM officials said they considered multiple methods before selecting the live auction method used for the agency's first auction, but they did not assess the methods based on maximizing revenue. As of February 2015, BLM officials had not evaluated various methods, such as sealed bids or simultaneously auctioning multiple lots. Without assessing auction method options based on revenue generation, BLM does not have assurance that a live auction will maximize revenue as required."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that BLM (1) issue a rule to, among other things, collect information about refiners' attempts to negotiate tolling agreements and (2) assess and select an auction method that would maximize revenue.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, to fulfill the conservation objective of  the Helium Act Amendments of 1960, the Department of the Interior  (Interior) purchased about 34 billion cubic feet of helium from private  crude helium producers. Then, under the Helium Privatization Act of  1996, Interior was required to offer for sale all but 600 million cubic feet of  that crude helium by January 1, 2015. In February 2013, we testified that  there would likely be substantially more than 600 million cubic feet of  crude helium remaining on the January 2015 deadline, since not all of the  helium offered for sale under the 1996 act had sold.", "In October 2013, the Helium Stewardship Act of 2013 was enacted.

The 2013 act establishes a phased process through  fiscal year 2021 for Interior to dispose of the remaining helium. Phase A  of the 2013 act is a transition period of helium sales; Phase B introduces  competitive auctions in addition to sales; and the remaining phases  provide for continued access to federal users and eventual disposal of  assets, respectively. Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is  responsible for managing the federal helium program, including  implementing the 2013 act.", "The federal government has a reserve of crude helium near Amarillo,  Texas, that is stored in an area of a natural gas field that has a naturally  occurring underground structural dome. In addition to storing the federal  crude helium, this underground reservoir also holds crude helium that  private companies have previously purchased from BLM but have not  taken delivery of in accordance with storage contracts between the  companies and the agency. BLM delivers crude helium from the storage  reservoir through a pipeline to the private companies that are connected  to it. As of February 2015, four such companies were receiving crude  helium from BLM through the pipeline and refining it. These companies  are commonly referred to as \u201crefiners.\u201d Nine other companies\u2014commonly  referred to as \u201cnonrefiners\u201d\u2014have either purchased relatively small  volumes of crude helium from BLM or have expressed an interest in  buying federal crude helium. The nonrefiners, however, cannot receive  the crude helium they purchase directly because they are not connected  to the pipeline. Instead, each nonrefiner must enter into an agreement  with a refiner, whereby the refiner accepts delivery of the crude helium  and processes it into pure helium on the nonrefiner\u2019s behalf at an agreed  upon price. This practice is referred to as \u201ctolling.\u201d The 2013 act contains  a provision that requires refiners, as a condition of sale or auction, to  make excess refining capacity of helium available at commercially  reasonable rates to certain nonrefiners. In this report, we refer to this  condition as the act\u2019s tolling provision. If a refiner and nonrefiner do not  agree on terms for tolling, the act does not require the refiner to toll. As  part of its responsibilities for managing the federal helium program, BLM  has taken actions to ensure that refiners have satisfied the tolling  provision, including asking refiners to report information about their  excess refining capacity and tolling agreements.", "In July 2014, we testified before the House Natural Resources  Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources about BLM\u2019s initial  actions to implement the 2013 act.

We also interviewed  attorneys in Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor in Washington, D.C., and in  the Southwest Regional Office in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who work  with the federal helium program. In addition, we interviewed  representatives from 12 of the 13 companies that registered with BLM to  participate in the July 2014 auction, including the 4 refiners and  4 nonrefiners that had participated in helium sales in recent years, and  4 companies that had expressed an interest in purchasing helium for the  first time and connecting to BLM\u2019s pipeline. One company did not respond  to our request for an interview.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed BLM\u2019s documentation of the  results of the July 2014 auction and the two sales conducted in  August 2014. We also observed a recording of BLM\u2019s July 2014 auction  to identify winning and losing bids made by auction participants. We  assessed the potential effects of BLM\u2019s July 2014 Federal Register notice  on refiners as they prepared to participate in the auction. Specifically, we  compared the volumes of helium that refiners were likely to receive in  fiscal year 2015\u2014based on the agency\u2019s formula for delivering helium  contained in the notice\u2014with the volumes of helium refiners received  prior to fiscal year 2015. To address the second objective, we reviewed  the act\u2019s tolling provision. We examined two reporting forms that BLM  posted to its website in conjunction with the July 2014 Federal Register  notice: one used to collect information from refiners about their refining  capacity and the other to collect information about refiners\u2019 tolling  agreements. We compared the refining capacity reporting form to an  earlier draft of the form to assess changes BLM made. We also examined  information refiners submitted to BLM to identify occurrences of signed  tolling agreements and attempts to negotiate agreements during fiscal  year 2014. We also reviewed written comments BLM received in  response to a notice of proposed action that preceded the agency\u2019s  July 2014 Federal Register notice. To address the third objective, we  reviewed the provisions in the act that BLM is to continue to implement.  We examined BLM planning documents, including agendas and minutes  from internal BLM meetings where officials discussed the fiscal year 2016  auction and sale; we also listened to some of these internal meetings by  phone. We reviewed a draft of BLM\u2019s new storage contract and discussed  revisions to the contract with BLM officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2014 to April 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For example, helium has the lowest melting and boiling  points of any element, and as the second lightest element, gaseous  helium is much lighter than air. Certain natural gas fields contain a  relatively large amount of naturally occurring helium that can be  recovered as a secondary product. To do so, the helium is separated  from the natural gas and stored in a concentrated form that is referred to  as crude helium because it has yet to go through the final refining  process.", "As of September 30, 2013, the federal helium program stored about  10.84 billion cubic feet of crude helium\u2014roughly 9 billion cubic feet  owned by the government, and the rest owned by private companies\u2014 in an underground storage reservoir near Amarillo, Texas. BLM used a  geologic model to identify the most efficient way to extract this remaining  helium from storage. As of mid-2014, BLM estimated that it could make  available for delivery from the reservoir roughly 7 billion cubic feet of  helium over the life of the act, from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal  year 2021.", "After private companies\u2014refiners or nonrefiners\u2014purchase helium from  BLM and pay for it, the official ownership of the helium is transferred from  BLM to the company on the first day of the month after payment is  received, and it becomes part of the privately owned inventory in federal  storage. BLM stores and then delivers the privately owned helium through  the pipeline to refiners in accordance with the storage contracts it has  with the companies. As of February 2015, BLM held storage contracts  with 11 companies, and these storage contracts will expire at the end of  fiscal year 2015. The storage contracts govern the storage, withdrawal,  and delivery of helium from the federal reservoir and associated fees.  BLM officials explained that they calculate fees under the current  contracts based on the total amount necessary to recover BLM\u2019s costs.  The ability for companies to purchase crude helium and then leave it  stored in the federal storage reservoir until it is delivered at a later time is  a unique feature of the federal helium program compared with other  sources of helium in the world, which typically require a purchaser to  accept delivery of the helium when it is extracted or pay for it even if  delivery is not accepted upon extraction.", "When the Helium Stewardship Act of 2013 was enacted, the global  helium market had been operating under conditions of tight supplies for  multiple years. From 2010 to mid-2014, refiners requested delivery of  volumes of helium through the BLM pipeline that would have exceeded  BLM\u2019s production capacity. Under these conditions, refiners accepted  delivery of the maximum amount of helium that BLM could produce.  However, market conditions changed in 2014: supply increased due to  additional production from private sources in other parts of the world.  Because these additional supplies became available, starting in  mid-2014, refiners requested delivery of volumes of helium that were less  than BLM\u2019s production capacity. A January 2015 U.S. Geological Survey  report estimated that helium produced from the federal storage reservoir  represented 29 percent of the total estimated production of helium in the  United States and 17 percent of the total estimated helium production  worldwide in fiscal year 2014.", "The 2013 act significantly changed the federal helium program. The  1996 act required Interior to sell a certain amount of helium in the federal  helium reserve and to set helium sale prices to cover the reserve\u2019s  operating costs and to produce an amount sufficient to repay the debt  associated with the initial purchase of the helium. According to the 2013  act\u2019s legislative history, however, the purpose of the 2013 act is to  complete the privatization of the federal helium reserve in a competitive  market fashion that ensures stability in the helium markets while  protecting the interests of the taxpayers.

A  representative from one refiner, for example, called the auction prices  \u201coutrageously high.\u201d Others said the average price was not an indication  of the market price for crude helium, especially since the 93 million cubic  feet auctioned by BLM constituted a very small portion of the total volume  of crude helium sold in a year in the global market. Some  representatives of nonrefiners said that auction prices for crude helium  reached levels similar to some prices for refined liquid helium, which is  typically more expensive than crude helium. Others said that the auction  failed to increase the number of purchasers of federal helium beyond  companies that already participated in the federal helium program.", "BLM and some representatives of nonrefiners and a refiner, however,  said the auction was a success for the federal government since it  generated about $15 million in revenue. A senior BLM helium program  official said the auction exceeded revenue expectations, and an agency  press release stated that BLM achieved a key objective of the act: to  maximize the value of federal helium through a market-driven process.  In addition, representatives from a refiner and nonrefiner stated that the  free market nature of the auction was a good way to determine the  market price for crude helium. Also, BLM officials and a representative of  one nonrefiner stated that the high auction prices were beneficial because  they will help spur development of new helium supplies. The  representative explained that, when the price of crude helium increases,  the return from selling helium increases.

According to BLM officials, refiners utilize the  infrastructure they already have to refine crude helium. In contrast,  nonrefiners must pay another company to refine, or toll, their helium,  which represents additional costs that refiners do not pay. As a result,  according to representatives of nonrefiners, the costs of purchasing  auctioned helium and turning it into refined helium are lower for  refiners than nonrefiners, giving refiners an advantage at the auction.", "Nonrefiners may not have bid higher at the auction because they  did not know the costs and delivery terms for tolling.  Representatives of nonrefiners we interviewed said that few tolling  agreements were in place prior to the auction. Those agreements  would have specified the rates for tolling any helium they purchased  and provided details on when, where, and how purchased helium  would be delivered. As a result, the nonrefiner representatives said  they were unable to calculate the total costs associated with  purchasing and refining crude helium during the auction. By not  knowing the tolling costs in advance of the auction, nonrefiners could  have bid more conservatively than they might have otherwise. In  addition, according to one nonrefiner representative, not knowing  delivery terms before the auction made it difficult to plan ahead and  prepare to receive the helium.", "Refiners\u2019 expectation of paying less for helium at two  subsequent, noncompetitive sales may have led refiners to pay  higher prices at the auction. Before the auction, BLM announced in  its July 2014 Federal Register notice that it would make more than  1 billion cubic feet of helium available exclusively to refiners in  two sales of helium to be delivered in fiscal year 2015 and fiscal  year 2016, as compared with the 93 million cubic feet of helium to be  auctioned. The notice further specified that the average price paid by  auction winners would account for a small part\u201410 percent\u2014of the  sale price. According to BLM officials, when the amount of helium  purchased by refiners at the higher auction price was added to the  amount of helium purchased by refiners at the lower sales price, the  refiners\u2019 overall average price was considerably lower than the  auction price. Specifically, refiners paid an average of $161 per  thousand cubic feet for the auctioned helium, but refiners paid  $106 per thousand cubic feet for helium purchased at the two sales.  When the volumes and prices of the auction and sales were added  together, the refiners\u2019 overall purchase price averaged less than  $120 per thousand cubic feet. BLM officials and representatives of  nonrefiners told us that the refiners\u2019 ability to average auction prices  with sale prices provided an advantage to refiners because  nonrefiners were not eligible to participate in the two sales held in  August 2014 and therefore could not average auction and sale prices  as refiners could.", "Changes to the way BLM proposed to deliver helium purchased  at the auction may have provided an incentive to refiners to  purchase as much helium at the auction as possible. Specifically,  BLM had announced in its July 2014 Federal Register notice that it  would reserve some of its pipeline delivery capacity in fiscal year 2015  for helium purchased at the auction.

This market survey is one of  the options provided for in the act\u2019s price-setting provision. BLM officials  also said they did not give the auction price greater weight when setting  the sale price because they did not want to create a significant price  increase that would negatively affect federal users and other end users.  However, some representatives of refiners and nonrefiners said that they  disagreed with BLM\u2019s decision to consider the auction price when setting  the sale price because the auction accounted for a small amount of  helium when compared with the volume of helium that is sold on the  global market. Nevertheless, the act\u2019s price-setting provision authorizes  BLM to use the auction price to set sales prices and directs BLM to give  priority to this approach.", "BLM restricted the two August 2014 sales solely to refiners, which was a  departure from the agency\u2019s prior practice of offering a small portion of  sales to nonrefiners. BLM officials said they took this approach because  they interpreted the act as intending to have the auction replace the  portion of the sales that had previously been made available to  nonrefiners. Most representatives of nonrefiners, however, told us that  they disagreed with this interpretation, stating that the act does not  require BLM to eliminate the portion of sales open to nonrefiners. Some  nonrefiners told us that having a guaranteed supply of helium, even of  small volumes, would help level the playing field with refiners since the  refiners can participate in the sales, guaranteeing their supply. Moreover,  since nonrefiners were not eligible to participate in the sales and were  outbid at the auction, nonrefiners purchased none of the federal helium  that BLM made available for delivery in fiscal year 2015.

We found that, as a  result, refiners used different methods for calculating excess capacity  reported to BLM. Also, BLM and some nonrefiners questioned the  accuracy of the total volume of excess capacity that refiners reported in  January 2014. In June 2014, BLM posted a draft data collection form on  its website for refiners to use when reporting excess refining capacity.  This draft form included a definition of excess refining capacity. For  example, refiners were to report \u201cplanned demand\u201d as part of their  determination of excess capacity. However, some nonrefiners  commented to BLM that this definition left room for different  interpretations. In response to comments on its draft form, BLM  published the final version of the form on its website on July 23, 2014,  adding more specificity to its definition of excess refining capacity.

For example, some refiners reported that they had signed tolling  agreements and reported the volumes of helium to be tolled under those  agreements, but not all refiners reported the rates they charged for tolling.  According to BLM officials, a representative of one refiner said that the  refiner did not report the rate because the act does not require refiners to  disclose information about agreements covering less than 15 million cubic  feet of helium.

Without assessing each method based on revenue  generation, BLM does not have assurance that the live auction method  will maximize revenue, as required by the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide the agency with better information to support its decisions  when implementing the act, we recommend that the Secretary of the  Interior direct the Director of BLM to take the following two actions:  issue a rule\u2014perhaps an interim final rule if BLM finds there is good  cause to do so, given the time constraints\u2014to require refiners to  report information about signed agreements to toll less than 15 million  cubic feet of helium and about refiners\u2019 attempts to negotiate tolling  agreements that do not result in signed agreements; and assess auction methods based on revenue generation, using  available information, and select a method that would maximize  revenue for the upcoming helium auction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Department of the Interior. In its written comments, reproduced in  appendix I, Interior generally agreed with our findings and concurred with  our second recommendation to assess auction methods and select the  method that would maximize revenue, but the agency did not concur with  our first recommendation.", "Specifically, Interior did not concur with our first recommendation to issue  a rule to require refiners to report certain information about signed tolling  agreements and attempts to negotiate tolling agreements. In its written  comments, Interior stated that existing mechanisms are providing BLM  with sufficient information for the agency to administer the tolling  provision, and that BLM is not in a position to develop a rule due to  reduced resources, current workloads, and other high priority rulemakings  and initiatives in which the agency is engaged. Also, Interior stated that  the expense and time necessary to undertake a rule outweigh any  immediate benefit and that given the amount of time it is likely to take to  promulgate the rule, the federal helium program would likely be nearing  its conclusion by the time such a rule is in place.", "We do not agree that existing mechanisms are providing BLM with the  information it needs to have full assurance that refiners are satisfying the  tolling provision. BLM has obtained some of the relevant information from  refiners. However, refiners\u2019 reporting of certain information\u2014specifically,  signed agreements to toll less than 15 million cubic feet and their  attempts to negotiate tolling agreements that did not result in signed  agreements\u2014is voluntary, and not all refiners provided this information to  BLM. We continue to believe that BLM needs this information to  determine the extent to which refiners are satisfying the tolling provision.", "We recognize that Interior and BLM must consider current workloads and  other priorities when determining how to expend limited resources.  However, if BLM does not issue a rule to require refiners to report this  information, the agency cannot determine the extent to which refiners are  making excess capacity available at commercially reasonable rates. As  described in the report, BLM may have options for shortening the  rulemaking process, which could reduce the resources necessary to issue  a rule. Even if BLM cannot shorten the rulemaking process by, for  example, issuing an interim final rule, BLM will continue implementing the  act through fiscal year 2021, and the agency\u2019s administration of the tolling  provision could continue to affect nonrefiners\u2019 participation in the  auctions. We continue to believe that undertaking a rulemaking is  necessary so that BLM can have better assurance that refiners are  satisfying the tolling provision throughout the agency\u2019s implementation of  the act.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of the Interior, and other interested parties.
