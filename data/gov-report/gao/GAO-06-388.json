NRC has also restructured its program for testing security at the plants through force-on-force inspections, which consist of mock terrorist attacks. GAO was asked to review (1) the process NRC used to revise the DBT for nuclear power plants, (2) the actions nuclear power plants have taken to enhance security in response to the revised DBT, and (3) NRC's progress in strengthening the conduct of force-on-force inspections at the plants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NRC revised the DBT for nuclear power plants using a generally logical and well-defined process in which trained threat assessment staff made recommendations for changes based on an analysis of demonstrated terrorist capabilities. The process resulted in a DBT requiring plants to defend against a larger terrorist threat, including a larger number of attackers, a refined and expanded list of weapons, and an increase in the maximum size of a vehicle bomb. Key elements of the revised DBT, such as the number of attackers, generally correspond to the NRC threat assessment staff's original recommendations, but other important elements do not. For example, the NRC staff made changes to some recommendations after obtaining feedback from stakeholders, including the nuclear industry, which objected to certain proposed changes such as the inclusion of certain weapons. NRC officials said the changes resulted from further analysis of intelligence information. Nevertheless, GAO found that the process used to obtain stakeholder feedback created the appearance that changes were made based on what the industry considered reasonable and feasible to defend against rather than on an assessment of the terrorist threat itself. Nuclear power plants made substantial security improvements in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks and the revised DBT, including security barriers and detection equipment, new protective strategies, and additional security officers. It is too early, however, to conclude that all sites are capable of defending against the DBT because, as of November 1, 2005, NRC had conducted force-on-force inspections at about one-third of the plants. NRC has improved its force-on-force inspections--for example, by conducting inspections more frequently at each site. Nevertheless, in observing three inspections and discussing the program with NRC, GAO noted potential issues in the inspections that warrant NRC's continued attention. For example, a lapse in the protection of information about the planned scenario for a mock attack GAO observed may have given the plant's security officers knowledge that allowed them to perform better than they otherwise would have.

Such a release, which may result from a  meltdown of a plant\u2019s nuclear reactor core or damage to the spent nuclear  fuel located at the site, could endanger public health and safety through  exposure to radiation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), an  independent agency headed by five commissioners, licenses commercial  nuclear power plants and is responsible for regulating and overseeing their  safe operation and security. According to NRC, there is a general credible  threat of a terrorist attack to the nation\u2019s commercial nuclear power plants,  in particular by al Qaeda and like-minded Islamic terrorist groups. For  example, as discussed in The 9/11 Commission Report, nuclear power  plants were among the targets considered in the original plan for the  September 11, 2001, attacks. However, NRC and intelligence agency  officials we spoke with said they are not aware of current intelligence  information indicating specific plans for an attack on a nuclear power  plant.", "NRC issues and enforces security-related regulations and orders, and  nuclear power plant licensees implement security measures to meet NRC  requirements. In particular, to ensure that nuclear power plants are secure  against a terrorist attack, NRC formulates a design basis threat (DBT)\u2014the  threat that plants must defend against\u2014and tests plants\u2019 ability to defend  against the DBT. The DBT characterizes the elements of a potential attack,  including the number of attackers, their training, and the weapons and  tactics they are capable of employing. NRC established the first DBT for  nuclear power plants in the late 1970s. NRC conducts semiannual reviews  of the potential terrorist threat to determine whether to make changes to  the DBT and has revised it twice in response to changes in the threat. First,  NRC expanded the DBT to include a vehicle laden with explosives after  two incidents in 1993\u2014the vehicle bombing of the World Trade Center and  a vehicle intrusion incident at one of the nuclear power plant sites. NRC  revised the DBT again in April 2003 in response to the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001. Among other changes, this most recent DBT increased  the number of attackers, refined and expanded the list of weapons and  equipment that might be used in an attack, and increased the maximum  size of a vehicle bomb that plants must defend against.", "The DBT does not represent the maximum size and capability of a terrorist  attack that is possible, but rather NRC\u2019s assessment of the threat that the  nuclear power plants must be prepared to defend against \u201cto ensure  adequate protection of public health and safety.\u201d Furthermore, NRC  regulations do not require nuclear power plants to protect against attacks  directed against the sites by an \u201cenemy of the United States,\u201d whether a  foreign government or other person. NRC originally included this  provision in its regulations in 1967 (prior to issuing the first DBT for  nuclear power plants). According to NRC officials, the provision was  intended to address the possibility that Cuba might launch an attack on a  nuclear power plant in Florida. In revising the DBT in April 2003, NRC did  not use this provision to exempt plants from defending against terrorist  groups such as al Qaeda but rather stated that a private security force (such  as at a nuclear power plant) cannot reasonably be expected to defend  against all threats\u2014for example, airborne attacks.", "Importantly, NRC also works with the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), and other federal, state, and local authorities to  coordinate an integrated response to a terrorist threat or attack on a  nuclear power plant. Furthermore, NRC does not directly gather  intelligence information but rather receives intelligence from other  agencies that it uses to formulate the DBT for nuclear power plants. NRC  has access to intelligence information on terrorist activities and the  domestic terrorist threat, including information from secure databases and  intelligence reports from intelligence and other agencies.", "Before receiving a license to operate a nuclear power plant, owners must  develop and implement an NRC-approved security plan describing how  they will defend the site against the threat presented in the DBT. As set  forth in the security plan, the licensees employ private security forces  (either hired directly or through a contractor) and provide them with the  weapons, training, and equipment to defend the site. When NRC revised the  DBT in 2003, it required licensees to develop new security plans describing  their strategy for defending the sites against the revised DBT and to  implement any security enhancements outlined in the plans by October 29,  2004. These security enhancements were in addition to other measures  licensees implemented\u2014such as stricter requirements for obtaining  physical access to nuclear power plants, minimum training requirements  for security officers, and limits on the work hours of the security force to  address the potential for fatigue\u2014in response to a series of security orders  NRC issued after September 11, 2001.

Consequently, NRC does not make this information available  to the general public, which has made it difficult for the agency to alleviate  concerns about the level of security at nuclear power plants. The concerns  center on whether the revised DBT adequately reflects the post-September  11 threat to nuclear power plants, and whether sites have done enough to  respond to the threat.", "You asked us to (1) examine the process NRC used to develop the April  2003 DBT for nuclear power plants, and (2) determine what actions nuclear  power plants have taken to enhance security in response to the revised  DBT.

In response, we have prepared  this unclassified public report, which does not include certain details about  the DBT and security at nuclear power plants that NRC considers to be  safeguards information. We have prepared a classified version of this  report in which we include such details.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed the process NRC uses to  analyze terrorist and criminal activities to assess the threat to nuclear  power plants. We interviewed NRC officials responsible for analyzing  information received from the intelligence and law enforcement  communities and three of the four NRC commissioners serving at the time  the DBT was revised to determine what factors they took into account in  deciding on changes to the DBT. We compared the April 2003 DBT with  NRC documents summarizing the threat to nuclear power plants and with  the Department of Energy (DOE) DBT for its nuclear weapons facilities.  We also interviewed officials from other federal agencies, including DHS  and FBI, to obtain their assessments of the terrorist threat to nuclear  power plants, and we interviewed DOE officials regarding the DOE DBT. To  address the second objective, we visited four nuclear power plant sites  (one in each of the four NRC regions) to observe the security  enhancements that sites made to address the revised DBT. We selected the  four sites using a number of criteria, including size and type of reactor.  GAO staff with a professional background in security accompanied us on  our visits in order to provide the expertise needed to fully comprehend the  sites\u2019 security strategies. At each site, we interviewed senior plant  management, security managers, and security officers. Before visiting the  four sites, we visited two other nuclear power plants to familiarize  ourselves with NRC security requirements and the sites\u2019 security  equipment and strategies; at one site, we observed an NRC baseline  security inspection, and at the other, we observed a force-on-force  inspection. We did not test the effectiveness of the security strategies at the  four sites, and we cannot project the results of our work to all nuclear  power plants. In addition to visiting four sites, we reviewed a sample of  NRC\u2019s baseline and force-on-force inspection reports. To review NRC\u2019s  progress in improving the force-on-force inspection program, we observed  a total of three force-on-force inspections at two sites, reviewed NRC  reports on force-on-force inspections, and interviewed NRC officials  responsible for implementing the program. For other views on security at  nuclear power plants, we interviewed officials from the nuclear industry  group NEI and from the Project on Government Oversight, an independent  nonprofit organization.

Security for  commercial nuclear power plants is addressed by NRC\u2019s Office of Nuclear  Security and Incident Response. This office develops policy on security at  nuclear facilities and is the agency\u2019s security interface with DHS, the  intelligence and law enforcement communities, DOE, and other agencies.  Within this office, the Threat Assessment Section assesses security threats  involving NRC-licensed activities and develops recommendations  regarding the DBT for the commission\u2019s consideration.", "The DBT for radiological sabotage applied to nuclear power plants  identifies the terrorist capabilities (or \u201cadversary characteristics\u201d) that  sites are required to defend against. The adversary characteristics generally  describe the components of a ground assault and include the number of  attackers; the size of a vehicle bomb; and the weapons, equipment, and  tactics that could be used in an attack. Other threats in the DBT include a  waterborne assault and the threat of an insider. The DBT does not include  the threat of an airborne attack. However, according to NRC officials, NRC  regulations do require nuclear power plants to implement readily available  measures to mitigate against the potential consequences of such an attack.  In its publicly available regulations governing the licensing of nuclear  power plants, NRC has issued a general description of the DBT\u2014for  example, requiring sites to defend against an attack by several well-trained  and dedicated individuals armed with hand-carried weapons and  equipment and assisted by a knowledgeable insider who participates in a  passive or active role. In April 2003, NRC issued orders to nuclear power  plant licensees containing a more detailed description of the revised DBT,  which NRC considers safeguards information.", "NRC requires nuclear power plants to have and implement a security plan  that describes their strategy for defending against an attack having the  characteristics of the DBT. Nuclear power plant sites are responsible for  installing barriers and intrusion detection equipment, hiring security  officers, and implementing other measures in accordance with their  security plans. NRC then inspects the sites\u2019 compliance with the plans and  ability to defend against the DBT. After revising the DBT, NRC required  sites to submit new plans by April 29, 2004, for NRC\u2019s review and approval  and to implement the security described in their new plans by October 29,  2004. The plans contain information about the sites, including  a description of sites\u2019 physical layout, such as barriers and buildings,  and a description of any environmental features important to the  effective coordination of response operations;  the minimum number of security officers defending the vital areas (the  areas containing equipment needed to ensure the safe shutdown of the  reactor and protection of spent fuel pools); and  a description of the protective strategy that sites will enact in response  to an attack or threat defined in the DBT, such as an external land-based  assault, a vehicle bomb, a waterborne assault, or an insider threat.", "NRC\u2019s performance-based means for testing the effectiveness of nuclear  power plant security programs is through force-on-force inspections. These  inspections, which consist of 350 hours of on-site inspection activity, are  intended to demonstrate how well a nuclear power plant might defend  against a real-life threat. In a force-on-force inspection, a professional team  of adversaries attempts to reach specific \u201ctarget sets\u201d within a nuclear  power plant that would allow them to commit radiological sabotage. These  target sets represent the minimum pieces of equipment or infrastructure an  attacker would need to destroy or disable to commit radiological sabotage  resulting in an elevated release of radioactive material to the environment.  Force-on-force exercises do not directly test the response of outside  agencies, such as local law enforcement. However, sites simulate actions  they would take to notify local law enforcement and other outside  agencies. In addition, according to NRC officials, sites routinely conduct  liaison activity with local law enforcement and emergency response  agencies.", "While the adversary characteristics terrorists might use in an actual attack  are uncertain, the DBT provides parameters for the conduct of force-on- force inspections. For example, the mock adversary force is constrained to  using the specific number of attackers, amount of explosives, and weapons  and tactics included in the DBT. According to NRC officials, the  commission recently approved an option to conduct force-on-force  inspections using adversary characteristics that go beyond those in the  DBT. This option would be available on a voluntary basis to nuclear power  plant licensees that are clearly successful in defending against the first two  mock attacks of the force-on-force inspection, which typically includes  three mock exercises over 3 days.", "NRC also conducts baseline inspections at nuclear power plants to  determine that licensees have established measures to deter, detect, and  protect against the DBT for radiological sabotage. Security inspectors in  NRC\u2019s four regional offices conduct the inspections. NRC\u2019s policy is to  conduct a baseline inspection at each site every year, with the complete  range of baseline inspection activities conducted over a 3-year cycle. One  element of a baseline inspection is evaluating the site\u2019s protective  strategy\u2014for example, by conducting tabletop drills (simulated attacks  using a model of the site) to gain a better understanding of the strategy.  Inspectors also examine areas such as officer training, fitness for duty,  positioning and operational readiness of multiple physical and technical  security components, and the controls the licensee has in place to ensure  that unauthorized personnel do not gain access to the protected area.  According to NRC officials, agency inspectors spend a total of 136 hours  annually at a site for a baseline inspection, and the 3-year baseline  inspection cycle involves more than 400 hours of inspection activity.", "For both force-on-force and baseline inspections, licensees are responsible  for immediately correcting or compensating for any deficiency in which  NRC concludes that security is not in accordance with the approved  security plans or other security orders.

Nuclear power plants represent  one sector of the critical infrastructure. Other sectors include such things  as agriculture, chemical facilities, and transportation systems. In 2005, DHS  began a series of visits to nuclear power plant sites to conduct  comprehensive security reviews in order to assess the risks and  consequences of various types of events and to provide better information  on the most effective allocation of federal resources to improve security at  critical infrastructure sites. DHS conducts the comprehensive reviews  with relevant agencies such as the FBI and, in the case of nuclear power  plants, NRC.

In addition, the threat assessment staff promptly report changes in the  threat to the commissioners and coordinate with the intelligence agencies  to help ensure that the staff are aware of all pertinent intelligence  information.", "In 1999, the NRC staff began developing a set of criteria\u2014the adversary  characteristics screening process\u2014to decide whether to recommend  particular adversary characteristics for inclusion in the DBT and to  enhance the predictability and consistency of their recommendations.  According to the NRC staff, the adversary characteristics screening  process, which they used to develop the April 2003 revised DBT, begins  with a thorough review of intelligence reports and application of initial  screening criteria to evaluate adversary characteristics. The staff use the  initial screening criteria to exclude from further consideration certain  adversary characteristics, such as those that are already in the DBT or  those that would more likely be used by a foreign military than by a  terrorist group.", "For adversary characteristics that pass the initial round of screening, the  threat assessment staff apply additional screening factors. Examples of  such factors include the following:  The type of terrorist group that demonstrated the characteristic. For  example, the staff consider whether an adversary characteristic has  been demonstrated by transnational or terrorist groups operating in the  United States, or by terrorist groups that operate only in foreign  countries.", "The location and level of social stability where the characteristic was  demonstrated. For example, the staff consider whether the adversary  characteristic has been demonstrated in North America and other  countries with a high level of social stability or in countries with an  active insurgency or civil war. NRC considers that terrorists planning to  attack a nuclear power plant in the United States would face greater  operational security and logistical challenges than terrorists operating  in countries where there is an internal insurgency.", "The frequency with which the characteristic has been demonstrated  and its availability. For example, the staff consider the availability of  an adversary characteristic on the open or the black market.", "The type of target the characteristic has been used against, the tactical  use of the characteristic, and the motive behind its use.

Finally, on the  basis of their analysis and interaction with other agencies, the staff decide  whether to recommend that the commission include the adversary  characteristics in the DBT for nuclear power plants. NRC\u2019s Office of  Nuclear Security and Incident Response, which includes the Threat  Assessment Section, reviews and endorses the threat assessment staff\u2019s  analysis and recommendations.", "Since issuing the revised DBT in April 2003, NRC has continued to use the  adversary characteristics screening process to consider additional  changes\u2014for example, to consider new intelligence information on  weapons not included in the revised DBT. In addition, the Energy Policy  Act of 2005 directed NRC to undertake a rulemaking to revise the DBT for  nuclear power plants.

The act directed NRC to consider the  events of September 11, 2001; the potential for an attack on facilities by  multiple, coordinated teams of a large number of individuals; the potential  for suicide attacks; and other factors. The April 2003 DBT already includes  some (but not all) of the adversary characteristics listed in the Energy  Policy Act, such as attackers who are willing to commit suicide, the  potential for a waterborne assault, and the use of explosive devices.

As  a result, one of the NRC threat assessment staff\u2019s major challenges has  been to decide how to apply this limited information to nuclear power  plants in the United States. For example, one of the key elements in the  revised DBT, the number of attackers, is based on NRC\u2019s analysis of the  group size of previous terrorist attacks worldwide. According to NRC  threat assessment staff, the number of attackers in the revised DBT falls  within the range of most known terrorist cells worldwide. Furthermore,  the threat assessment staff told us they considered but decided against an  even larger number of attackers in the draft DBT because a larger cell  would face an increased potential of detection before it could successfully  carry out a terrorist attack in the United States. The staff also concluded  that multiple cells along the lines of the September 11, 2001, attacks would  not necessarily target a single nuclear power plant. Intelligence and law  enforcement officials we spoke with did not have information  contradicting NRC\u2019s interpretation regarding the number of attackers (or  other parts of the NRC DBT) but did point to the uncertainty regarding the  size of potential attacks and the relative lack of intelligence on the terrorist  threat to nuclear power plants.", "NRC staff recommendations regarding other adversary characteristics also  reflected the staff\u2019s interpretation of intelligence information. For example,  the staff considered increasing the vehicle bomb in the revised DBT to a  range of sizes and ultimately recommended a size that was based on an  analysis of previous terrorist attacks using vehicle bombs. One of the  largest vehicle bombs ever detonated was used in the 1996 bombing of the  U.S. military residence in Saudi Arabia, and the maximum size of a vehicle  bomb used in the United States\u2014the 1995 bombing of the federal building  in Oklahoma City\u2014consisted of the equivalent of 4,800 pounds of TNT.  Additional examples of NRC\u2019s interpretation of intelligence information  and recommendations for the revised DBT included the following:  The threat assessment staff recommended a maximum weight of  equipment and explosives per attacker. The staff based this weight on  the experience and professional knowledge of NRC staff and  contractors with security backgrounds. In developing these limits, the  staff evaluated the degree to which attackers would rely on speed of  movement rather than be encumbered by large amounts of equipment.  They also considered that a relatively small amount of explosives could  cause a large amount of damage.", "The NRC staff recommended including a waterborne assault with a  bomb size based on available intelligence on waterborne terrorist  bombs. In addition, according to NRC, watercraft found near nuclear  power plants would generally be constrained in terms of payload.  Furthermore, the bomb size recommended by the staff was considered  sufficient to significantly damage a nuclear power plant\u2019s water intake  structure. The staff considered that a larger bomb would add little to the  potential damage to the intake structure.", "The NRC staff supported the inclusion of equipment that is readily  available through commercial sources but recommended against  weapons with limited use by terrorists.", "The staff recommended against including infiltration into a nuclear  power plant by air because their review of terrorist attacks did not  demonstrate significant use of such tactics against a fixed site.", "Table 1 summarizes, by adversary characteristic, the key changes to the  DBT recommended by the NRC staff and the final changes approved by the  NRC commissioners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Generally Established Requirements Less Rigorous Than DOE\u2019s DBT for Radiological Sabotage", "paragraphs": ["According to the NRC staff\u2019s report on recommended changes to the DBT  for nuclear power plants, NRC has a long-standing commitment to work  closely with DOE in an effort to maintain comparable protection for  comparable facilities. Thus, as part of the process for revising the DBT for  nuclear power plants, NRC monitored and exchanged information with  DOE, which also has a DBT for comparable facilities that process or store  radiological materials and are, therefore, potential targets for radiological  sabotage. However, while certain aspects of the two agencies\u2019 DBTs for  radiological sabotage are similar, NRC generally established less rigorous  requirements than DOE\u2014for example, with regard to the types of  equipment that could be used in an attack. Additional information  regarding key adversary characteristics found in both agencies\u2019 DBTs  includes the following:  Number of attackers. Both DOE and NRC based the number of attackers  on intelligence on the size of terrorist cells. According to DOE officials,  it is challenging to find intelligence on terrorist activities that can be  considered equivalent to a ground assault on a fixed facility such as a  nuclear power plant or DOE site. However, DOE officials said they used  similar intelligence as NRC to derive the number of attackers.", "Vehicle bomb. DOE and NRC officials provided us with similar analyses  of intelligence information on previous terrorist attacks using vehicle  bombs. In particular, DOE and NRC officials told us that most vehicle  bombs used in terrorist attacks are smaller than the size vehicle bomb in  NRC\u2019s revised DBT. DOE officials also said that site-specific  characteristics affect the size of vehicle bomb that sites are capable of  defending against.", "Weapons. The DOE DBT includes a number of weapons not included in  the NRC DBT. Inclusion of such weapons in the NRC DBT for nuclear  power plants would have required plants to take substantial additional  security measures. Furthermore, DOE included other capabilities in its  DBT that are not included in the NRC DBT. As discussed below, NRC  staff considered some of the weapons in DOE\u2019s DBT for inclusion in the  DBT for nuclear power plants but removed them while drafting the DBT.", "DOE established an even more stringent DBT for its sites that store nuclear  weapons (or material that could be used in a nuclear weapon). The security  objective for these sites is to prevent the theft or detonation of a nuclear  weapon. DOE decided on a more stringent DBT to protect nuclear weapons  facilities than sites with the potential for radiological sabotage in  accordance with its graded approach, which provides for a higher level of  protection to sites with greater potential consequences to public health and  safety in the event of a terrorist attack. According to DOE officials, the  consequences of theft or detonation of a nuclear weapon would be \u201corders  of magnitude\u201d greater than radiological sabotage at a DOE site or nuclear  power plant.", "Consistent with DOE\u2019s graded approach, NRC officials told us they do not  consider comparisons between the DOE DBT for nuclear weapons  facilities and the NRC DBT for nuclear power plants valid. NRC considers  that the potential consequences of the theft of material that could be used  in a nuclear weapon could be much greater than radiological sabotage at a  nuclear power plant. Furthermore, according to NRC officials, terrorists  seeking to steal or detonate a nuclear weapon would require greater  capabilities to accomplish their objectives than terrorists seeking to cause  radiological sabotage. For example, theft of a nuclear weapon (or material  that could be used in a weapon) would require terrorists to defeat a site\u2019s  security systems when entering and leaving a site. In contrast, attackers  willing to commit suicide in the process of causing the release of  radiological material from a nuclear power plant would have to overcome  security to enter a site and reach a target set but would not have to leave  the site. Like DOE, NRC uses a graded approach to security, and, therefore,  the NRC DBT for NRC-licensed facilities that store or process material that  could be used in a nuclear weapon is more stringent than the NRC DBT for  nuclear power plants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC\u2019s Process for Obtaining Feedback on the Draft DBT Created the Appearance of Industry Influence on the Threat Assessment Staff\u2019s Analysis of Intelligence Information", "paragraphs": ["NRC staff sent a draft DBT to stakeholders in January 2003, held a series of  meetings with them to obtain their comments, and received written  comments. In addition to nuclear power plant licensees and NEI, which  represents the nuclear industry, these stakeholders included other federal  agencies and government authorities in affected states. NRC specifically  sought and received feedback from the nuclear industry on what is  reasonable for a private security force to defend against and the cost of and  time frame for implementing security measures to defend against specific  adversary characteristics. During the same period that the threat  assessment staff was receiving industry and other stakeholder feedback,  they continued to analyze intelligence information and modify the draft  DBT. In April 2003, NRC staff submitted their final draft DBT to the  commissioners for their review and approval, together with a summary of  stakeholder comments.", "In its written comments on the January 2003 draft DBT, NEI objected to the  size of the vehicle bomb, the inclusion of certain weapons, and the  inclusion of an active violent insider. The NRC staff\u2019s draft DBT submitted  to the commissioners reflected some (but not all) of NEI\u2019s objections. The  reasons for NEI\u2019s objections to key adversary characteristics and changes  to the NRC threat assessment staff\u2019s recommendations included the  following:  Vehicle bomb. NEI objected to the vehicle bomb in the draft DBT  because of its assessment of (1) the low probability of a vehicle bomb of  the size proposed by NRC, (2) the likelihood that federal authorities or  local law enforcement would detect a large vehicle bomb, and (3) the  inability of some sites to protect against the size of the vehicle bomb  proposed by NRC because of insufficient land for installation of vehicle  barrier systems at a necessary distance. Instead, NEI agreed that it  would be reasonable to protect against a smaller vehicle bomb. In its  recommendations to the commissioners, the NRC staff subsequently  reduced the size of the vehicle bomb to the amount proposed by NEI.  After review, the staff\u2019s reason for agreement with NEI was that vehicle  bombs as large as that included in the draft provided to stakeholders  had rarely been used in previous terrorist attacks and would not be  reasonable or practical to include in the DBT.", "Weapons. NEI argued against the inclusion of a number of weapons. For  example, NEI wrote that (1) one particular weapon recommended by  the NRC staff would render the ballistic shielding used at nuclear power  plants obsolete, and (2) another proposed weapon would initially cost  $1 million to $7 million per site to defend against, with annual recurring  costs of up to $2 million per site. Furthermore, NEI argued that these  weapons (as well as the vehicle bomb size initially proposed by the NRC  staff) would be indicative of an enemy of the United States, which sites  are not required to protect against under NRC regulations. In the final  draft submitted to the NRC commissioners, the NRC staff removed a  number of weapons NEI had objected to. The staff reasoned that the  weapons had rarely been used in armed assaults, or had been used  infrequently in terrorist assaults despite their wide availability and use  by violent criminals in the United States. NRC staff did not remove one  particular weapon NEI had objected to, which, according to NRC\u2019s  analysis, has been a staple in the terrorist arsenal since the 1970s and  has been used extensively worldwide. (As discussed below, the NRC  commissioners later voted to remove this particular weapon.)", "Inside assistance. NEI wrote that the nuclear power industry had taken  a number of steps to reduce the likelihood of an active violent insider\u2014 for example, it tightened the process for granting employees unescorted  access to nuclear power plants. Furthermore, NEI wrote that the  industry had been unable to identify cost-effective solutions to defend  against an active violent insider, and that costs would range from $2  million to $8 million per site for equipment and $5 million per site per  year for additional personnel. Despite these objections, the NRC staff  recommended the inclusion of an active violent insider in the final draft  of the DBT. (The NRC commissioners later allowed nuclear power  plants to reduce the likelihood of an active violent insider through a  human reliability program.)", "The chief of NRC\u2019s threat assessment staff told us that NRC did not make  changes to the draft DBT based solely on industry views. Rather, according  to NRC officials, the changes were made based on multiple internal  analyses and discussions among the threat assessment staff and higher  levels of review within NRC and its Office of Nuclear Security and Incident  Response, which includes the Threat Assessment Section. Nevertheless, in  our view, the process NRC used to obtain feedback from stakeholders,  including the nuclear industry, created the opportunity for, and appearance  of, industry influence on the threat assessment regarding the  characteristics of an attack.", "When we raised this issue with NRC officials, they told us that under  normal circumstances the threat assessment process is initially undertaken  utilizing intelligence and law enforcement information, with other  stakeholders subsequently having an opportunity to provide feedback\u2014for  example, regarding the cost of implementing security measures in response  to proposed changes to the DBT. Furthermore, NRC threat assessment staff  and other intelligence agency officials told us they support the separation  of intelligence analysis from other responsibilities, such as obtaining  stakeholder feedback on changes to the DBT, in order to insulate analysis  of intelligence from other considerations. However, according to NRC, the  agency made a deliberate decision as part of the process for revising the  DBT in 2003 to have the threat assessment staff analyze intelligence  information and obtain stakeholder feedback simultaneously, rather than  sequentially, in order to accelerate the process in response to the increase  in the terrorist threat. NRC officials said that in considering future changes  to the DBT, NRC plans to ensure the initial separation of intelligence  analysis from interaction with stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The NRC Commission Made Key Policy Judgments about Changes to the DBT without Criteria on Threats That a Private Security Force Could Reasonably Defend Against", "paragraphs": ["The NRC staff provided the commissioners with a number of documents to  consider in making the final decision on changes to the DBT. These  included, but were not limited to, two assessments in the fall of 2002 on the  terrorist threat to nuclear power plants (one specifically on the potential  use of vehicle bombs) and a final paper in April 2003 with the staff  recommendations for revisions to the DBT. The April 2003 document also  included a summary of comments on the draft DBT received from the  nuclear industry and other federal and state agencies; a summary of NEI\u2019s  estimates of the cost of and time frame for implementing security measures  to address specific changes to the DBT; and an updated assessment of the  terrorist threat to nuclear power plants. The NRC commissioners told us  they also had direct contacts with intelligence agencies that provided them  with information on the terrorist threat.", "The commissioners made the final decision on changes to the DBT by  majority vote. While the commission largely supported the NRC staff\u2019s  recommendations for changes to the DBT, it also made some significant  changes that reflected policy judgments. Specifically, the commissioners  considered whether any of the recommended changes to the DBT  constituted characteristics representative of an enemy of the United States,  which sites are not required to protect against under NRC regulations. In  approving the revised DBT, the commission stated that nuclear power  plants\u2019 civilian security forces cannot reasonably be expected to defend  against all threats, and that defense against certain threats (such as an  airborne attack) is the primary responsibility of the federal government, in  coordination with state and local law enforcement officials. In connection  with this position, the commission directed NRC\u2019s Office of General  Counsel to prepare a paper for commission approval articulating the  factors to be considered in determining whether particular characteristics  of an attack constitute an enemy of the United States. (Officials from NRC\u2019s  Office of General Counsel told us they prepared a document with an  analysis of this issue for the commission, but that the document was not a  decision paper for approval by the commissioners.)", "We recognize that consideration of issues such as what is reasonable for a  private security force to defend against is an appropriate role of the  commission in approving changes to the DBT. However, in approving the  revised DBT, the commission did not identify explicit criteria for  determining whether specific adversary characteristics constitute an  enemy of the United States or criteria for what is reasonable for a private  security force to defend against. For example, the commission did not  define whether the criteria include the cost for nuclear power plants to  defend against an adversary characteristic or the efforts of local, state, and  federal agencies to address particular threats. The lack of such criteria can  reduce the transparency of commission decisions to make changes to the  threat assessment staff\u2019s recommendations. NRC officials said detailed  criteria on what is reasonable for a private guard force would reduce the  commissioners\u2019 discretion in approving changes to the DBT. Furthermore,  in NRC\u2019s view, the basis for the commission\u2019s policy decisions and direction  to the NRC staff regarding the DBT are sufficiently articulated in the  commission\u2019s voting record, in which individual commissioners provided  the rationale for their votes, and in the related staff requirements  memorandum, which documented the commission\u2019s decisions.", "As indicated in table 1, the significant changes the commission made to the  NRC staff\u2019s recommendations included removal of certain weapons, a  decrease in the maximum amount of weight carried by the attackers, and  mitigation of an active insider through a human reliability program. In  other cases, such as the size of the vehicle bomb, the commission  supported the recommendations of the NRC staff. Based on our review of  the commissioners\u2019 voting records, the commission\u2019s decisions on key  aspects of the DBT included the following:  Vehicle bomb. A majority of commissioners voted to increase the  maximum vehicle bomb to the size recommended by the NRC staff.  However, one commissioner supported a larger vehicle bomb that the  NRC staff had included in a previous draft of the DBT. The  commissioner recognized that some sites would not have sufficient  property to install vehicle barrier systems far enough from the plants to  protect against the larger vehicle bomb and suggested NRC could  provide such sites with an exemption and require them to protect  against a smaller vehicle bomb.", "Weapons. The commission decided to remove two weapons the NRC  staff had recommended for inclusion in the revised DBT. As part of this  decision, the commission directed the staff to conduct an in-depth  analysis of the additional defensive capabilities, changes to sites\u2019  protective strategies, and costs associated with protecting against one  of the weapons. Removal of weapons from the revised DBT was  significant because of the strength of the NRC staff\u2019s intelligence  analysis supporting their inclusion. For example, in the April 2003 report  to the commissioners, the NRC staff reported that while one such  weapon had not been used in the United States, it had been found in  weapons caches in the United States. Similarly, the staff noted the use of  the other weapon in captured terrorist training videos and its ready  availability. The document summarizing the commission\u2019s changes to  the proposed DBT did not provide a reason for excluding these  weapons. However, in written comments on their votes, one  commissioner identified these weapons as representative of an enemy  of the United States; another commissioner agreed that threat data  showed an increased possibility of the use of these weapons but stated  that NRC staff needed to assess whether it would be reasonable for a  private security force to defend against such weapons. One of the  commissioners supported inclusion of these weapons in the DBT, as  well as other weapons the staff had not recommended, but nevertheless  told us there was more agreement than disagreement among the  commissioners about what weapons should be included. The same  commissioner told us he supported inclusion of one of the weapons  because he considered the means for defending against it to be  affordable.", "Weight of equipment and explosives. In voting to decrease the  maximum weight of equipment, weapons, and explosives (such as  grenades) per attacker in the final DBT, three of the commissioners  indicated they supported decreasing the weight that an attacker could  be expected to carry. In their written comments, the three  commissioners indicated that the staff\u2019s recommendation regarding  carry weight would require further study\u2014for example, to determine  whether the greater amount of weight could reduce the capability of the  attack force by reducing individual attackers\u2019 mobility.", "Inside assistance. The commission added language to the DBT stating  that a human reliability program for monitoring employees at the sites  could reduce the likelihood of an active insider. To qualify, the sites\u2019  human reliability program would have to include background checks,  substance abuse testing, psychological evaluations, annual supervisory  review, and periodic background reinvestigations. The commissioners  told us they made this decision based, in part, on the long-standing  assumption by NRC that a human reliability program reduces the  likelihood of an active insider. The commissioners also told us that other  factors, such as increased awareness about the potential for an attack in  the communities where nuclear power plants are located, would reduce  the likelihood of an active insider.", "In addition to making changes to specific elements of the DBT for nuclear  power plants, the commission provided overall policy direction on NRC\u2019s  oversight of security of the sites. In particular, recognizing that an attack on  a site could exceed the characteristics identified in the DBT, the  commission directed the staff to continue coordinating with DHS and other  federal and state authorities to help assure the security of nuclear power  plants. For example, the commissioners told us that NRC works with the  Federal Aviation Administration to address the threat of air strikes against  a site. Similarly, NRC supports and participates in DHS comprehensive  security reviews of nuclear power plant sites.", "Other significant policy direction included the following:   The commission affirmed the NRC staff\u2019s operating assumption that  there may be no specific advance warning of an attack on a nuclear  power plant but indicated that a general warning of a potential attack  may be provided.", "The commission directed the staff to continue providing the  commissioners with assessments of specific adversary characteristics,  including those not in the revised DBT, and to provide additional  recommendations as part of the semiannual review of threats to nuclear  power plants. However, the commission also indicated its expectation  that there would be a period of \u201cregulatory stability\u201d (a period with no  major changes to security regulations) in order to allow sites time to  adjust to the changes already made to the DBT and other security  requirements.", "The commission supported the clarification that sites are not required to  \u201cdefeat\u201d an attack, because such a requirement could require sites\u2019  security forces to employ offensive tactics beyond what is allowed  under law for private security forces.

Despite the industry\u2019s considerable efforts, the changes have not been  completely without problems and licensees can continue to make  improvements.

The  sites varied in how they implemented these measures, primarily depending  on site-specific characteristics such as topography and on the degree to  which they planned to interdict attackers within the owner-controlled area  and far from the sites\u2019 vital area, as opposed to inside the protected area  but before they could reach the vital equipment. (See fig. 1 for a diagram of  the areas commonly found at nuclear power plants.) NRC officials told us  that licensees have the freedom to design their protective strategies to  accommodate site-specific conditions, so long as the strategies satisfy NRC  requirements and prove successful in a force-on-force inspection.", "The sites we visited implemented security measures corresponding to the  three elements generally recognized as constituting an effective security  system for defending fixed sites. These include early detection of an attack,  sufficient delay for security officers to report to their defensive positions,  and capability of the security force to respond to the attack:  Detection. At all four sites, the owners installed additional cameras  throughout different areas of the sites and instituted random patrols in  the owner-controlled areas. The owner-controlled areas generally  contain undeveloped property and administrative buildings that would  not be targets for terrorists seeking to commit radiological sabotage.  Nevertheless, by upgrading security in this area, the sites increased the  chance that they would detect attackers before the attackers would be  able to approach or infiltrate the protected area, where they might be  able to gain access to vital equipment. Patrols can be used to  accommodate areas of the sites that are remote or where the view of  cameras is obstructed, while cameras provide for a safer inspection of  questionable activities than sending a security officer.", "Delay. The sites we visited installed a variety of devices designed to  delay attackers and allow security officers more time to respond to their  posts and fire upon attackers. The sites generally installed these delay  devices throughout the protected areas so that attackers would have to  defeat multiple security systems before reaching vital areas or  equipment. For example, the sites installed fences outside the buildings  housing the reactors and other vital equipment and blocked off  entrances to make it more difficult for attackers to enter the buildings.  Similarly, the sites installed a variety of delay devices within the reactor  and other buildings, some of which are permanent and others that  security officers would deploy in the event of an attack.", "Response. Each of the four sites we visited constructed bullet-resistant  structures at various locations in the protected area or within buildings,  increased the minimum number of security officers defending the sites  at all times, and expanded the amount of training provided to them.  Security officers are stationed in the bullet-resistant structures or move  to them during an attack, at which point they can fire at attackers  through gun ports while not exposing themselves to the attackers\u2019  gunfire. (See fig. 2 for an example of a bullet-resistant structure.) Having  more security officers on duty at any given time means that more  individuals can respond to more locations in the event of an attack. It  can also increase the sites\u2019 ability to detect attackers by allowing more  security officers to observe the owner-controlled area and monitor  video cameras. Security managers at each site told us they also made  changes to their training\u2014for example, to train officers to use new  security equipment or to comply with NRC\u2019s training order, issued at the  same time as the revised DBT. Moreover, each of the licensees told us  they implemented measures to comply with NRC\u2019s requirements limiting  the number of hours security officers can work to 72 hours during a 7- day period. The majority of the security officers we interviewed told us  that their training was adequate or had improved and that they generally  did not experience fatigue on the job.", "Security managers at the four sites considered the layouts of their sites and  the paths that attackers might use to reach vital equipment in deciding  where to deploy these enhancements. As a result, the sites employed  different protective strategies that primarily varied by the degree to which  they implemented an external strategy designed to interdict attackers  within the owner-controlled area, but far from the sites\u2019 vital area, rather  than an internal strategy designed to interdict attackers inside the  protected area. For example, one site with a predominantly external  strategy installed an intrusion detection system in the owner-controlled  area. While NRC requires all sites to have an intrusion detection system at  the perimeter of the protected area, security managers at this site decided  to install a second intrusion detection system so that security officers  would be able to identify intruders as soon as they cross into the owner- controlled area. The site was able to install such a system because of the  large amount of open, unobstructed space in the owner-controlled area.  Similarly, the protective strategy at another site focused on the ability of  security officers to deny attackers access to the vital area buildings. The  site uses cameras and patrols to detect attackers in the owner-controlled  area and deploys security officers in bullet-resistant structures. From the  structures, located on the roof and attached to the walls of the vital area  buildings, security officers could fire upon attackers before they could  enter the buildings.", "In contrast, security managers at the other two sites we visited described  protective strategies that combined elements of an external strategy and an  internal strategy. At both sites, the external strategy included bullet- resistant structures positioned so that security officers could fire on  attackers attempting to enter vital area buildings. Other security officers  are stationed inside the vital area buildings and would move to bullet- resistant structures within the buildings to interdict attackers who defeat  the external security. At one of these sites in particular, security managers  decided to implement a protective strategy that relied more heavily on  interdicting attackers inside the protected area. The site uses elements of  an external strategy, such as cameras and patrols for detecting attackers in  the owner-controlled area, but in contrast to the sites described above,  relies to a lesser extent on security officers to stop the attackers in the  owner-controlled area. Instead, security managers told us they had  implemented an internal protective strategy by identifying \u201cchoke  points\u201d\u2014locations inside the protected area attackers would need to pass  before reaching their targets\u2014and installing bullet-resistant structures at  the choke points where officers would be waiting to interdict the attackers.  Security managers at the site also told us one of the reasons for  implementing a more internal strategy was their desire to maintain  radiation doses to security officers as low as is reasonably achievable. In  particular, the internal strategy allowed the site to not install bullet- resistant structures on one side of the site, where security officers who  would be stationed in the structures could receive elevated radiation doses.", "In addition to the security enhancements we observed, security managers  at each site described changes they plan to make as they continue to  improve their protective strategies, such as adding fencing to block a path  attackers might use to enter the protected area and a device at the entrance  to the site that can detect explosives. Security managers at three of the  sites we visited also told us the number of security officers on duty at any  one shift exceeded the minimum number of security officers that NRC  requires be dedicated to responding to attacks. (The fourth site  maintained the minimum number of armed dedicated security officers.)  According to NRC\u2019s analysis, sites typically exceeded the minimum number  of responders required by NRC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sites Addressed the Increase in the Size of a Vehicle Bomb by Designing Comprehensive Systems of Sturdy Barriers", "paragraphs": ["To protect against the increase in the vehicle bomb size, the licensees at the  sites we visited designed comprehensive systems consisting of sturdy  barriers to prevent a potential vehicle bomb from approaching the sites and  to channel vehicles to entrances where security officers could search them  for explosives and other prohibited items. Prior to increasing the maximum  size vehicle bomb sites must defend against, NRC required the sites to have  a vehicle barrier system encircling the reactors and other vital equipment  and set at a distance far enough from the plants to prevent a smaller vehicle  bomb from damaging vital equipment and releasing radiation. After NRC  increased the maximum size of the vehicle bomb in the revised DBT, plants  installed a second vehicle barrier system at an even greater distance from  the vital equipment, while also keeping the original vehicle barrier systems  as a second layer of defense.", "At the sites we visited, the new vehicle barrier systems consisted of rows of  large steel-reinforced concrete blocks, or (at one plant) large boulders  weighing up to 7 tons in combination with piles of smaller rocks. (See fig. 3  for an illustration of a vehicle barrier system.) The vehicle barrier systems  either completely encircled the plants (except for entrances manned by  armed security officers) or formed a continuous barrier in combination  with natural or manmade terrain features, such as bodies of water or  trenches, that would prevent a vehicle from approaching the sites.", "Licensees at the four sites adapted their vehicle barrier systems to the  unique conditions at each site. The vehicle barrier systems also shared  many features in common and generally consisted of a combination of the  following basic elements:  Vehicle searches. Generally, the security managers told us they  implemented procedures to search vehicles at the entry point to the  outer vehicle barrier systems. (NRC requires sites to search all vehicles  capable of carrying more than a certain amount of TNT and to search a  random sample of vehicles capable of carrying a smaller amount of  explosives). Examples of search procedures included visual  examination of the compartments of vehicles and use of detection  equipment to test for explosives. Security managers told us security  officers would conduct a second search of all vehicles, regardless of  size, at a second checkpoint where vehicles pass through the inner  vehicle barrier system. During this search, security officers would look  for weapons and other prohibited equipment in addition to any  explosives.  \u201cOverwatches.\u201d The sites stationed security officers in bullet-resistant  structures, or \u201coverwatches,\u201d from which the officers could observe the  vehicle searches and provide backup support in case of an attack. Like  the other bullet-resistant structures installed by the sites, these  structures included gun ports for firing at attackers.  \u201cActive\u201d vehicle barrier systems. These systems were installed in the  roadways leading into the plants and were designed to block  unauthorized vehicles from entering the site. They consisted either of  steel plates that could be raised or lowered or rolling gates. (See fig. 4  for an example of an active vehicle barrier system.) Security officers in  multiple locations, such as alarm stations and overwatches, could  activate the systems if security officers manning the vehicle entrances,  who are more vulnerable to attack, were unable to do so. At two of the  plants, the barriers were always in the closed position and required two  security officers at separate locations to open them. At the other two  plants, the barriers were generally in the open position but could be  closed by a single security officer to prevent unauthorized entry.", "In some cases, the new vehicle barrier systems at the sites we visited  appeared to exceed the requirements necessary to protect against the  revised DBT. For example, security managers at one site told us that the  vehicle barrier system was wider than necessary in order to protect against  the vehicle bomb. Furthermore, in at least some areas of the sites, the new  vehicle barrier systems were farther from the reactors and other vital  equipment than necessary to protect the sites against the size of vehicle  bomb in the revised DBT. In particular, security managers at the site with a  more external protective strategy decided to take advantage of the large  amount of open, unobstructed property surrounding the site to create a  large zone between the vehicle barrier system and the site buildings.  Although we generally toured the complete perimeter of the vehicle barrier  systems at the four sites, we did not calculate how far the barrier systems  were installed from the vital equipment, test the equipment performance,  or determine how well security officers conducted vehicle searches. Like  other aspects of security at the plants, these factors would affect how well  the vehicle barrier systems would work in the event of a terrorist attack.", "In addition, the sites implemented other related measures, such as winding  lanes designed to cause vehicles to slow down as they approach entrances;  emergency exits to facilitate evacuation of employees from the plant;  devices to block unauthorized trains from reaching the plant; parking lots  outside the vehicle barrier system for use during an outage to limit the  number of additional vehicles entering the vehicle barrier systems and  requiring searches; and, at one site, receiving deliveries at an off-site  warehouse to limit the number of trucks entering the site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sites Have Generally Complied with NRC Security Requirements and Performed Well in Force-on- Force Inspections, but Problems Remain", "paragraphs": ["As of November 1, 2005, NRC had completed force-on-force inspections\u2014 testing sites\u2019 ability to defend against the revised DBT\u2014at 20 sites. NRC  officials told us, and our review of baseline and force-on-force inspection  reports indicated, that plants have generally complied with their security  plans and other NRC security requirements and have generally performed  well during force-on-force inspections. However, we also noted from the  reports, as well as from our own observations, that sites have encountered  a range of problems in meeting NRC security requirements, including a  force-on-force inspection in which the site had problems demonstrating it  could defend against the revised DBT. (According to NRC officials,  inspectors do not leave the site at which a problem is identified until it is  corrected or until sufficient compensatory measures are put in place.)  Twelve of the 18 baseline inspection reports and 4 of the 9 force-on-force  inspection reports we reviewed identified problems or items needing  correction. These findings, such as failures in the intrusion detection  system at one site and not including certain elements of training at several  sites, demonstrate that NRC\u2019s baseline and force-on-force inspections are  important to identifying problems that need correction. (See app. II for a  discussion of the findings in the force-on-force and baseline inspection  reports we reviewed.)", "During a force-on-force inspection at one site, we observed that although  the security measures appeared impressive, the site\u2019s ability to defend  against the DBT was at best questionable. The site\u2019s security measures  were similar to those we observed at other sites, such as an intrusion  detection system equipped with cameras for assessing alarms, bullet- resistant structures both in the protected and vital areas, and a vehicle  barrier system consisting of large concrete blocks and large boulders.  However, some or all of the attackers were able to enter the protected area  in each of the three exercise scenarios. Furthermore, attackers made it to  the targets in two of the scenarios, although the outcomes of the two  scenarios were called into question by uncertainties regarding whether the  attackers had actually been neutralized before reaching the targets. NRC, in  turn, raised concerns about the site\u2019s lack of \u201cdefense in depth\u201d and  concluded that it could not validate the licensee\u2019s protective strategy in the  two scenarios. NRC noted that security officers\u2019 ability to interdict  attackers was impacted due to problems in the site\u2019s detection and  assessment, and that, in two of the scenarios, security officers left the  external bullet-resistant structures to which they were assigned and  transitioned to internal positions once they could account for the number  of attackers in the revised DBT. This meant that the security officers left  positions that covered a \u201cbreach\u201d the attackers had made in the protected  area perimeter. As a result of the inspection, NRC required the licensee to  install additional security equipment immediately after the inspection, NRC  inspectors remained on site until the equipment was put in place, and NRC  decided to conduct another force-on-force inspection at the site.", "At the follow-up force-on-force inspection at the same site, which we also  observed, the licensee told us it had spent an additional $37 million to  improve security in the 6 months following the first inspection. Some of  these changes were clearly visible, such as elevating the bullet-resistant  structures that had been on the ground to give officers greater visibility and  firing opportunities, razing several buildings to reduce opportunities for  attacker concealment, and increasing the distance between the vehicle  barrier system and the protected area in a part of the site. The licensee also  told us about other changes directly related to the internal aspect of the  protective strategy, including positioning more security officers within the  vital area, installing additional cameras to increase security officers\u2019 ability  to detect attackers, and creating new bullet-resistant structures that  provided additional protected positions for firing upon the attackers. From  the second exercise, NRC officials concluded that they could evaluate the  protective strategy and that the site had adequately defended against a  DBT-style attack.", "In addition to our observations of security during force-on-force  inspections, GAO security experts who accompanied us to the four other  sites we visited suggested a number of opportunities to improve security at  the sites. While our experts did not find a lack of compliance with NRC  regulations or an inability to defend the sites against the adversary  characteristics in the revised DBT, the suggestions support our assessment  that security at nuclear power plants is an ongoing process of identifying  and implementing potential improvements. For example, at one site, we  observed a bullet-resistant enclosure in which curtains\u2014installed to  reduce glare from the sun\u2014obstructed the view through windows, and  video equipment associated with surveillance cameras blocked access to  several gun ports. We suggested that the site consider replacing the  curtains with tinted glass and providing the security officer in the bullet- resistant enclosure with better access to the gun ports. At another site, we  suggested that the addition of a bullet-resistant structure on one side of the  site would provide the site\u2019s security force with greater opportunity to  interdict attackers entering on that side of the site."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NRC Has Significantly Improved the Force- on-Force Inspection Program, but Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["NRC has made a number of improvements to the force-on-force inspection  program, several of which address recommendations we made in our  September 2003 report on NRC\u2019s oversight of security at commercial  nuclear power plants. We had made our recommendations when NRC was  restructuring the force-on-force program to provide a more rigorous test of  security at the sites in accordance with the DBT, which was also under  revision. For example, we had recommended that NRC strengthen the  force-on-force inspections by (1) conducting the inspections more  frequently at each site, (2) using laser equipment to better simulate  attackers\u2019 and security officers\u2019 weapons, and (3) requiring the inspections  to make use of the full terrorist capabilities stated in the DBT, including the  use of an adversary force trained in terrorist tactics.", "NRC has taken a number of actions as part of its restructuring of the force- on-force program that satisfy the recommendations we made to strengthen  the program. For example, NRC has begun conducting the exercises more  frequently at each site and is using laser equipment to simulate weapons.  Furthermore, the attackers in the force-on-force exercise scenarios we  observed used many of the adversary characteristics of the revised DBT,  including the number of attackers in the revised DBT, a vehicle bomb, a  passive insider, and explosives. In addition, NRC officials told us that the  adversaries were trained in military tactics. Nevertheless, in observing  three force-on-force inspections and discussing the program with NRC  officials, we noted the following issues that continue to warrant NRC\u2019s  attention:  Problems with laser equipment. At the three force-on-force inspections  we observed, the sites used laser equipment to simulate firing live  weapons. In general, the equipment appeared to help make the  inspections a realistic test of security at the sites. For example, laser  equipment provides a much more reliable account of shots fired in  comparison with the equipment NRC and the sites had been using,  which relied on the judgment of individual participants to determine  shooting accuracy. However, problems in using the equipment  contributed to NRC\u2019s limited ability to evaluate security at one of the  sites. In part because of problems with the laser equipment, NRC  decided to conduct a second force-on-force inspection at this site. The  second inspection made better use of the laser equipment, which proved  to be a valuable tool in determining that several security officers  engaged attackers unsuccessfully by firing at the attackers while they  were too far away. NRC raised this issue to the licensee in the context of  improving training so that security officers would not waste ammunition  on targets that are beyond the range of their weapons.", "Inspection schedules. The way in which NRC schedules force-on-force  exercises may create artificialities that enable sites to perform better  than they otherwise would. NRC officials said they notify sites of the  date of their force-on-force inspection only 8 to 12 weeks in advance.  Nevertheless, NRC may be able to further reduce the artificiality of the  inspection schedules and thereby enhance its ability to test security at  the sites. For example, in each of the exercises we observed, NRC  followed the same schedule for conducting nighttime and daytime  attacks. Furthermore, the adversary force typically initiated the attack  soon after the opening of the exercise \u201cwindow\u201d (the agreed-upon time  for the exercise to begin). Consequently, the sites\u2019 security forces might  have been able to anticipate the approximate time that the attack would  begin, and industry observers from other sites might have more  information than necessary prior to inspections at their own sites about  NRC\u2019s standard practices for conducting the inspections. NRC officials  told us that, while the attacks began soon after the opening of the  exercise window in the exercises we observed, the attackers do  sometimes wait longer in order to increase the level of uncertainty  among the site\u2019s security force and thereby create a more realistic  scenario.", "Testing of sites\u2019 internal security strategies. Given the amount of  resources invested in preparing for and implementing a force-on-force  inspection, we believe inspections should test the full extent of sites\u2019  \u201cdefense-in-depth\u201d strategies, including both the external and internal  elements of the strategies. However, the force-on-force exercises end  when a site\u2019s security force successfully stops an attack. Consequently,  if the security force stops an attack before the attackers enter the vital  area, NRC would not have an opportunity to observe how the security  force would perform in the event that the attackers successfully defeat  the site\u2019s external security strategy. In a number of the force-on-force  exercises we observed, the security force did, in fact, stop the attackers  early in the scenario. According to NEI officials, force-on-force  inspections would be more valuable if NRC allowed the adversaries to  challenge each layer of defense until reaching their targets, or being  defeated at the last possible point of defense. NRC officials also told us  such an approach is worth considering but that NRC would have to first  determine how to implement it.", "Operational security. At two of the force-on-force inspections we  observed, we noted areas in which \u201coperational security\u201d\u2014the  protection of information about the planned scenarios for the mock  attacks\u2014could be improved. For example, during a safety \u201cwalk  down\u201d\u2014a physical site check conducted prior to every exercise  scenario to ensure the safety of exercise participants\u2014a site employee  made motions that may have alerted security officers to the targets the  adversaries would be trying to reach that evening. In another inspection,  security officers could observe adversaries getting into position inside  the protected area prior to the start of an exercise, potentially providing  clues about the route the adversaries would use to enter the site. We  also observed that each force-on-force exercise was attended by a large  number of people who had access to scenario information, after signing  a nondisclosure form, thus increasing the chance that details about an  exercise scenario might be compromised. While we recognize that  procedures such as safety walk downs and prepositioning of adversary  teams are necessary to the proper conduct of the force-on-force  inspections, lapses in operational security have the potential to give  security officers knowledge that would allow them to perform better  than they would otherwise and raise questions about whether the force- on-force inspections are a true test of the sites\u2019 protective strategy.  According to NRC officials, NRC inspectors have been instructed to be  vigilant regarding any indications that a site\u2019s security force may have  received advance knowledge of an attack scenario, and procedures for  safety walk downs have been revised to improve operational security.", "Standards for controllers. NRC relies on the sites to assign and train  controllers to observe each participant (both the adversaries and  security officers) in the force-on-force inspections. In the three  inspections we observed, the level of security expertise and training  among the controllers varied among the sites. For example, one site  assigned as controllers plant employees who did not have security- related backgrounds but who volunteered to help. In its force-on-force  inspection report for this site, NRC concluded that the level of controller  training was a factor in the force-on-force exercises not being brought to  a definitive conclusion. (As discussed above, NRC decided to conduct  another force-on-force inspection at this site.) In contrast, another plant  used personnel with security backgrounds. NEI has prepared a set of  guidelines for controllers in force-on-force inspections that NRC has  reviewed. NEI has also created a controller-training workshop in which  NEI shares lessons learned from force-on-force exercises.", "Quality of feedback to licensee. The quality of the feedback among the  force-on-force inspections we observed was inconsistent. In particular,  during the first inspection, NRC failed to discuss with the licensee  several potential problems raised by the NRC team after each scenario.  In the two subsequent inspections we observed, NRC appeared to have  improved the quality of its feedback to the licensees. Specifically, the  team leader provided the licensee with concise feedback that accurately  reflected what the team members had expressed in closed NRC  meetings. An NRC official told us that, based on comments from us as  well as from NRC team members, NRC took measures to improve the  quality of the feedback.", "Force-on-force inspection schedule. So far, NRC is on schedule to  conduct the first round of force-on-force inspections at all sites within 3  years. As we reported in 2004, NRC is planning to conduct an inspection  at each site every 3 years instead of every 8 years, as the agency had  been doing. NRC initiated a new force-on-force program in November  2004, together with a 3-year schedule to complete inspections at all  sites, after the revised DBT took effect on October 29, 2004. NRC  officials told us they had completed inspections at 20 (or about 31  percent) of the 65 sites as of November 1, 2005. Furthermore, NRC  officials told us that three teams are conducting the inspections and that  NRC is hiring additional force-on-force personnel. Given the importance  of the force-on-force inspections in demonstrating how well a nuclear  power plant might defend against a real-life threat, we believe it is  important that NRC devote the necessary resources to ensure that it  continues to meet the inspection schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The nuclear power industry and NRC have taken very seriously the need to  protect nuclear power plants against a potential terrorist attack and have  made important investments to this end. However, NRC\u2019s process for  revising the DBT for nuclear power plants raises a fundamental question\u2014 the extent to which the DBT represents the terrorist threat as indicated by  intelligence data versus the extent to which it represents the threat that  NRC considers reasonable for the plants to defend against. Specifically,  NRC\u2019s process for deciding on the DBT raised the possibility that the  industry may have inappropriately influenced the staff\u2019s interpretation of  intelligence data. The NRC threat assessment staff obtained the views of  the nuclear industry on a draft of the revised DBT while they continued to  assess intelligence information, and the staff made industry-recommended  changes to the DBT even though the intelligence information had not  changed. We recognize that NRC should and would want to obtain  feedback from the industry and other stakeholders on the implications of  the proposed changes before finalizing the DBT. In addition, NRC has  stated that it has altered its process for obtaining industry feedback so that  the threat assessment staff interacts with industry only after it has made its  proposals for changes to the DBT. However, this approach does not entirely  eliminate the appearance of industry influence. Threat assessment is a  continuous process, and this sequential approach would still allow for  interactions between the agency\u2019s threat assessment staff and the nuclear  industry. Assigning responsibility for obtaining feedback from the nuclear  industry to an office within NRC other than the Threat Assessment Section  would further reduce any appearance of industry influence on the process  of assessing the terrorist threat to nuclear power plants. The  commissioners would then be able to review the threat assessment staff\u2019s  recommended changes to the DBT with confidence that the  recommendations are based strictly on an assessment of the threat. In  making the final decision to revise the DBT, the commissioners would also  consider industry feedback on the staff\u2019s recommendations.", "Furthermore, the commissioners did not have explicit criteria that they  used as the basis for removing certain weapons from the DBT  recommended by the NRC staff. Consideration of what is reasonable for a  private security force to defend against, as well as industry views on  proposed changes to the DBT, is an appropriate function of the  commissioners. However, explicit criteria setting out the factors and how  they would be weighed to determine what adversary characteristics are not  reasonable for a private security force to defend against would have  provided greater transparency for the commissioners\u2019 decisions to exclude  certain characteristics from the DBT. Such criteria would also potentially  increase the rigor and consistency of the process. The underlying process  used by NRC was logical and well defined and should enable NRC to  produce a more credible DBT if these shortcomings are addressed.", "In our visits to nuclear power plants, we saw a clear connection between  the changes in the DBT and the plants\u2019 recent security enhancements. The  plants\u2019 response to the revised DBT and other NRC orders following the  September 11 terrorist attacks has been substantial and, in some cases, has  gone beyond what was required. Nevertheless, because the plants  essentially designed their security to defend against the DBT outlined by  NRC, their capability to defend against an attack is essentially limited to  how similar such an attack would be to the DBT. Therefore, it is imperative  that NRC and the plants continue to work with DHS and other federal,  state, and local authorities to ensure they have coordinated their efforts to  defend plants in the event of an attack, particularly one that exceeds the  adversary characteristics in the revised DBT. Furthermore, although  security has improved, the results of NRC\u2019s baseline and force-on-force  inspections conducted thus far have uncovered some problems that needed  to be addressed. Moreover, the effectiveness of any nuclear power plant\u2019s  security depends on the various parts and systems working well together  during the stress of an actual attack. Therefore, NRC\u2019s continued vigilance  at the plant level, especially in conducting force-on-force inspections, is  needed to ensure that plants are consistently well protected.", "In conjunction with revising the DBT, NRC has implemented improvements  to its force-on-force inspection program that put the agency in a better  position to evaluate the nuclear power plants\u2019 protective strategies. These  improvements have addressed several of our previous recommendations  regarding the force-on-force inspections. However, in observing three  inspections, we noted additional opportunities for improvement, such as  artificialities that could be further reduced to better test how plants would  respond to an actual terrorist attack. Making further improvements to the  force-on-force program would enhance NRC\u2019s ability to assure the public  and Congress that nuclear power plants are capable of defending against a  DBT-style terrorist attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the process by which NRC makes future revisions to the DBT  for nuclear power plants, we recommend that the NRC commissioners take  the following two actions:  Assign responsibility for obtaining feedback from the nuclear industry  and other stakeholders on proposed changes to the DBT to an office  within NRC other than the Threat Assessment Section, so that the threat  assessment staff is able to assess the terrorist threat to nuclear power  plants without creating the potential for or appearance of industry  influencing their analysis. The commissioners, in turn, could consider  both the staff\u2019s analysis of the terrorist threat and industry feedback to  make the final determination as to whether and how to revise the DBT.", "Develop explicit criteria to guide the commissioners in their  deliberations to approve changes to the DBT. These criteria should  include setting out the specific factors and how they will be weighed in  deciding what characteristics of an attack on a nuclear power plant  would constitute an enemy of the United States, or otherwise would not  be reasonable for a private security force to defend against.", "We further recommend that the NRC commissioners continue to evaluate  and implement measures to further strengthen the force-on-force  inspection program.

In its  written comments (see app. III), NRC commended GAO\u2019s effort to ensure  that the report is accurate and constructive. It also provided additional  clarifying comments on two areas of the report pertaining to the process  NRC used in 2003 to revise the DBT for nuclear power plants. First, NRC  stated that the report should provide a better description of the context for  the process by which the agency obtained industry input and the  appearance of industry influence on the development of the revised DBT.  NRC wrote that the agency made a deliberate decision to develop the  revised DBT while simultaneously (rather than sequentially) seeking input  from stakeholders, including the nuclear industry. NRC stated that this was  a departure from its typical approach and was intended to advance public  health and safety and the common defense and security, similar to other  government actions taken after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In  addition, NRC stated that it has returned to its normal sequential approach  to developing DBT revisions and seeking input from stakeholders.", "We are pleased that NRC recognizes the need to separate the process of  analyzing intelligence information from seeking input from stakeholders,  including the nuclear industry. In response to NRC\u2019s earlier comments on  the classified version of this report, which were essentially the same, we  revised the reports to clarify that NRC deliberately decided to develop the  revised DBT while simultaneously obtaining stakeholder input to speed up  the process in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  However, whether NRC chooses to use a simultaneous or sequential  process, we continue to believe that the best approach would be to insulate  the threat assessment staff from interactions with the nuclear industry by  assigning responsibility for such interactions to a different office in NRC.  This would best separate the fact-based analysis of the threat to  commercial nuclear power plants from policy-level considerations  regarding what is reasonable for a private security force to defend against.  We also clarified our recommendation to indicate our view that the threat  assessment staff should be insulated from interacting with the nuclear  industry and other stakeholders.", "Second, regarding the criteria the commission used to make decisions  regarding the DBT, NRC wrote that a more comprehensive discussion in  the report of the commission\u2019s deliberative decision-making process would  provide important perspective. NRC stated that the agency first established  a DBT for nuclear power plants in the late 1970s and has a long history in  this area. Furthermore, NRC wrote that the commission\u2019s decision-making  authority does not require, and could be unduly restricted by, detailed  prescriptive criteria. Finally, NRC stated its view that the basis for the  commission\u2019s policy decisions and direction to the NRC staff with regard to  the DBT are sufficiently articulated in the commission\u2019s voting record and  related staff requirements memorandums.", "We revised the reports to include NRC\u2019s view that the basis for the  commission\u2019s policy decisions regarding the DBT is articulated in the  commission\u2019s voting record and related staff requirements memorandum.  However, based on our review of the voting record and staff requirements  memorandum, as well as other documents related to the April 2003 revised  DBT, we remain concerned that the basis for how the commissioners made  decisions to exclude certain characteristics from the DBT is not as  transparent as it could be. We did not find that the commissioners agreed  upon a definition of \u201cenemy of the United States\u201d or explicit criteria for  what adversary characteristics would not be reasonable for a private  security force to defend against. For example, the memorandum  accompanying the commission\u2019s April 2003 decision approving changes to  the DBT for nuclear power plants did not provide the reason for the  commission\u2019s decision to remove two weapons the NRC threat assessment  staff had recommended for inclusion. Rather, the voting record showed  that individual commissioners used differing criteria and emphasized  different factors, such as cost or practicality of defensive measures. The  staff requirements memorandum set forth the general criteria that a civilian  security force cannot reasonably be expected to defend against all threats.  Furthermore, the intent of our recommendation that NRC develop criteria  for what adversary characteristics constitute an enemy of the United  States, or otherwise would not be reasonable for a private security force to  defend against, is not to restrict the commission\u2019s decision-making  authority through detailed prescriptive criteria. Instead, the intent of our  recommendation is to have general criteria or definitions to guide the  commissioners\u2019 decisions and to provide greater transparency for  commission decisions, the details of which are safeguards information and  withheld from the public.", "Finally, NRC commented that NRC and GAO staffs discussed potential  issues related to the draft report that needed to be addressed. NRC also  wrote that the draft report contained safeguards information, which should  be removed prior to the report being made public. The potential issues  have been resolved, and we have revised the report for the purpose of  removing safeguards information. The resulting report is substantially the  same as the classified version of the report, with the exception that the  classified version contains additional details about the DBT and security at  nuclear power plants.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

In particular, we compared the adversary characteristics of  the April 2003 revised DBT approved by the commissioners with the  adversary characteristics in the previous DBT, as described in a February  2000 NRC staff position paper; the January 2003 draft DBT provided to  stakeholders for comment; and the NRC staff\u2019s April 2003 recommended  changes to the DBT submitted to the commissioners. Furthermore, for  each component of NRC\u2019s process, we analyzed documents and conducted  a series of interviews:  To examine the role of intelligence analysis, we analyzed the NRC staff\u2019s  reports on the terrorist threat to nuclear power plants and the results of  their analysis of intelligence information on terrorist activities  worldwide. The three key reports we analyzed included an October 2002  report on the use of vehicle bombs; a November 2002 report on the  potential use of other adversary characteristics against nuclear power  plants; and the April 2003 report that included the staff  recommendations on the DBT. To obtain further insight into the NRC\u2019s  use of intelligence information, we interviewed NRC officials, including  the head of NRC\u2019s Threat Assessment Section; reviewed a description of  the adversary characteristics screening process; and received briefings  on the process from NRC. We also interviewed officials from other  federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). NRC redacted text from a  number of the documents provided to us if the text contained classified  information from other federal agencies, including the Department of  Energy (DOE). As agreed with NRC, we identified the selected portions  of the redacted text that we wanted to review, and NRC requested  permission from the other agencies to provide the text to us. All of the  agencies NRC contacted except one granted permission to release the  redacted text to us.", "We compared NRC\u2019s April 2003 revised DBT with DOE\u2019s October 2004  DBT and February 2004 Terrorist Adversary Capabilities List and  interviewed DOE Office of Security officials regarding the DOE DBT  and differences with the NRC DBT. We also reviewed the September  2004 final report of the DOE DBT re-examination task force. We did not  compare the implementation of security measures at DOE sites to  defend against the DOE DBT with security at commercial nuclear power  plants.", "To examine NRC\u2019s consultation with the nuclear industry, we reviewed  the written comments submitted by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI)  on the January 2003 draft DBT and compared NEI\u2019s comments with the  changes the NRC staff made to the draft DBT. We also interviewed NEI  officials and senior officials at the nuclear power plant sites we visited,  including some who served on the NEI working group responsible for  security matters.", "To examine the decisions by the NRC commission, we analyzed the  commission voting record (including written comments of individual  commissioners), the April 2003 memorandum summarizing the  commission\u2019s final decisions, and the NRC regulation on enemy of the  United States (10 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.13). Furthermore, we interviewed three of  the four commissioners who were serving on the commission at the  time the DBT was revised and who participated in the decision-making  process. We interviewed the three commissioners as a group in a  meeting that was not subject to the requirements of the Government in  the Sunshine Act. This meant that the commissioners could discuss  previous actions, including their April 2003 decisions on changes to the  DBT, but not the formulation of future policy. For example, we did not  ask the commissioners about the potential for future changes to the  DBT. In addition to this meeting, we met individually with the two  commissioners who assumed their posts in 2005 and did not participate  in the decision-making process for the April 2003 revised DBT.", "To determine what actions nuclear power plants have taken to enhance  security in response to the revised DBT, we interviewed staff from NRC\u2019s  Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response, reviewed security orders  NRC has issued since September 11, 2001, and visited a nonprobability  sample of four nuclear power plant sites. We do not name the sites we  visited in this report because information about security at particular sites  is sensitive and considered safeguards information, and because the  objective of our visits was to provide a general description of the changes  in security sites implemented in response to the revised DBT, rather than  the changes at a particular site. Prior to our site visits, we observed a  baseline inspection at one site and a multiexercise force-on-force  inspection at another site in order to better familiarize ourselves with NRC  security requirements as well as sites\u2019 security equipment and strategies.  We selected these two sites based on the timing of the activities.", "To select the nonprobability sample of four sites we visited, we first  eliminated certain sites, such as those we had recently visited for security- related work (including the two sites where we observed NRC inspections)  and sites frequently visited by Congress. We then selected one site from  each of the four NRC regions using the following criteria:  sites representing different sizes and types of licensees, including  licensees that own or operate a single nuclear power plant site,  licensees that own or operate two to six sites, and licensees that own or  operate seven or more sites;  sites with different surroundings, such as different topography and  proximity to water, in order to consider the effect of such factors on  sites\u2019 security strategies;  sites with security forces hired both directly as site employees as well as  through a contractor, including one site that uses security officers  employed by Wackenhut Corporation, which provides security services  to about half of the nuclear power plant sites;  sites with the two different categories of reactors licensed by NRC for  operation in the United States\u2014two sites with boiling-water reactors  and two sites with pressurized-water reactors; and  sites with different numbers of reactors.", "At each of the four sites, we used a semistructured guide to interview  security managers and other site officials, and interviewed a random  selection of security officers. We worked with site management so that our  interviews with the security officers did not interfere with their duties. We  conducted individual interviews with security officers in private rooms,  without the attendance of plant management or other plant staff. We also  examined security equipment and reviewed documents, including security  plans, protective strategy documents, safeguards event logs, security  officer work-hour records, training materials, and equipment testing  records. GAO staff with a professional background in security  accompanied us on our visits in order to provide the expertise needed to  fully comprehend the sites\u2019 security equipment and strategies.", "In addition to site visits, we reviewed 9 of the 16 force-on-force inspection  reports and a sample of 18 baseline inspection reports that NRC had  completed between November 2004 and the time we reviewed the reports.  The 18 baseline inspection reports we reviewed consisted of reports  provided by NRC from each of the four regions, plus additional reports we  randomly selected ourselves. Time constraints prevented us from  reviewing additional reports. We also discussed the revised DBT and  security improvements at nuclear power plant sites with the Nuclear  Energy Institute and the Project on Government Oversight, an independent  nonprofit organization.", "To review NRC\u2019s progress in strengthening the conduct of force-on-force  inspections, we observed a total of three inspections at two sites. Two of  the inspections were at a site where NRC decided to conduct a second  inspection as a result of the agency\u2019s limited ability to evaluate security  during the first inspection. After the first inspection at this site, but before  the second, we also attended a meeting at the site in which the licensee  briefed NRC on security improvements the site had made in response to the  first inspection, and we observed these improvements. GAO staff with a  professional background in security accompanied us to the third  inspection. In addition, as discussed above, we reviewed NRC reports on 9  of the 16 force-on-force inspections NRC had completed at the time we  reviewed the reports.

We conducted our  work from November 2004 through January 2006 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Details of Findings from NRC Reports on Baseline and Force-on-Force Inspections", "paragraphs": ["Of the 27 baseline and force-on-force inspection reports we reviewed, NRC  identified no findings in 11 of the reports but did describe a variety of  problems with the sites\u2019 security in the remaining 16. The reports we  reviewed included one on a force-on-force inspection we observed, in  which NRC required the licensee to implement measures to address  weaknesses in the site\u2019s protective strategy and decided to return for a  second force-on-force inspection. The following are additional examples of  NRC findings from the 16 reports, including corrective actions taken by the  licensees: In a baseline inspection at a site, several alarms failed to activate during  a test of the intrusion detection system, which alerts security officers to  the occurrence and location of a breach. Further testing identified  multiple alarms that were not functioning properly, and the site  subsequently declared the entire intrusion detection system inoperable.  Prior to leaving the site, NRC inspectors confirmed that the site  implemented compensatory measures to address problems with the  intrusion detection system, and NRC determined that further inspection  of the site at a later date was warranted. According to NRC, the  subsequent inspection at the site confirmed that the problem had been  corrected.", "During a force-on-force exercise at another site, NRC observed two  officers performing duties other than their assigned patrols of the  owner-controlled area. The patrols are a component of NRC\u2019s  requirement for continuous surveillance of the owner-controlled area.  Further inspection revealed that the security officers manning the site\u2019s  central and secondary alarm stations were unaware that the owner- controlled area was not being continuously patrolled. In the event of an  attack, owner-controlled area observations can be crucial both for  setting a response in motion by detecting intruders as early as possible  and for providing information about where attackers have entered the  site and where they are going so that security officers know how to  respond. According to NRC, the licensee took immediate corrective  action. Also during this inspection, NRC observed that the licensee  deployed too many officers in the force-on-force scenarios as a result of  a misunderstanding. In particular, the licensee had temporarily  increased the number of dedicated responders above the minimum  listed in the security plan to respond to the increased national threat  level. However, according to NRC, the additional officers did not play a  role in stopping the attackers in the scenarios.", "In a baseline inspection, NRC observed three examples of failure to  perform proper searches of personnel entering the protected area. For  example, a security officer did not examine items that had alarmed a  metal detector and allowed an individual to collect and carry the items  into the protected area without further examination. Based on  discussions with security officers and supervisors, NRC found that this  deficiency was routine and commonly accepted at the site. NRC  concluded that this situation had the potential to reduce the overall  effectiveness of the protective strategy by allowing the uncontrolled  introduction of weapons or explosives into the protected area.  According to NRC, the licensee took immediate corrective action, and  security staff were required to attend remedial training on search  techniques and policy.", "In a force-on-force exercise, the attackers were able to destroy three out  of four targeted components. NRC observed that the attackers faced an  insufficient level of delay, which allowed them to reach the three  components before being interdicted by security officers. According to  the inspection report, sufficient delay is an essential component of a  protective strategy to prevent radiological sabotage. As a result of the  inspection, the licensee agreed to add delay locks to doors and relocate  security officers to ensure they could interdict attackers.", "NRC found that a number of sites ran weapons-training qualification  courses in which security officers were not trained in the way they  would be expected to perform during an attack. For example, sites did  not train security officers to use backup weapons for when they could  not use their primary weapons, or to undergo the level of physical stress  an officer would experience during an attack. At one of the sites, NRC  also found that the site had lowered the minimum qualification score  related to training security officers to use their weapons, potentially  resulting in security officers being less qualified in the use of their  weapons than what NRC believes is necessary. In addition, the licensee  did not seek NRC approval for the change as mandated by NRC\u2019s  regulations. However, NRC found that all of the security officers who  had received the training before the issue was observed and corrected  had qualified on the use of their weapons at the higher score.  Furthermore, according to NRC, the agency issued amplified guidance  to all nuclear power plant sites regarding weapons-training qualification  courses.", "During the force-on-force inspection we observed, NRC inspectors  found that a site had not included the control room, spent fuel pool, and  the alternative shutdown panel among its targets. NRC required the  licensee to redevelop its target components for use in the force-on-force  scenarios. The adequate identification of target components is vital to a  site\u2019s ability to position security officers or direct them to locations  where they can interpose themselves between the attacker and target  components.", "In an inspection initiated after the licensee observed security officers  who were inattentive at their posts, NRC inspectors found the licensee  had recorded 19 incidences in which security officers worked more  hours in a specific time period than allowed by NRC regulations. NRC  concluded that failure to meet the work-hour limits increased the  susceptibility of security officers to fatigue and had the potential to  reduce the effectiveness of the site\u2019s protective strategy. According to  the inspection report, the licensee identified several causes that  contributed to the problem and took immediate corrective actions.  According to NRC, the agency verified that the site updated its  procedures to conform to NRC\u2019s work-hour regulations. (At the four  sites we visited, we reviewed work-hour logs and found that each site  had generally stayed within security officer work-hour limits.)", "In a baseline inspection, the licensee was unable to provide engineering  documents to demonstrate the acceptable minimum safe standoff  distance from the inner vehicle barrier system, which is designed to  protect the site from a vehicle bomb. NRC requested that the licensee  measure the distance between several structures and the closest part of  the vehicle barrier system. The measurements showed that the barrier  was too close to at least two structures. As immediate corrective and  compensatory actions, the licensee installed additional vehicle barriers  in the area of concern and implemented direct observation by a security  officer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Raymond H.
