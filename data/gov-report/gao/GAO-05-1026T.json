A reauthorization of this law in 1996, the National Invasive Species Act, elevated ballast water management to a national level. As directed by the legislation, the federal government has promulgated several regulations requiring certain ships to take steps, such as exchanging their ballast water in the open ocean to flush it of potentially harmful organisms, to reduce the likelihood of species invasions via ballast water. Initially these regulations applied only to certain ships entering the Great Lakes; now they apply to certain ships entering all U.S. ports. In addition to these domestic developments, the United Nation's International Maritime Organization has recently adopted a convention on ballast water management that could affect the global fleet. Since 1998, Coast Guard data show that compliance with existing ballast water exchange requirements has generally been high. However, key agencies and stakeholders recognize that the current ballast water exchange program is not a viable long-term approach to minimizing the risks posed by ballast water discharges. The primary reasons for this are that: (1) many ships are exempt from current ballast water exchange requirements, (2) the Coast Guard has not established alternate discharge zones that could be used by ships unable to conduct ballast water exchange for various reasons, and (3) ballast water exchange is not always effective at removing or killing potentially invasive species. Developers are pursuing technologies to provide more reliable alternatives to ballast water exchange, some of which show promise. However, development of such technologies and their eventual use to meet ballast water regulatory requirements face many challenges including the daunting technological task of developing large scale water treatment systems that ships can accommodate, and the lack of a federal discharge standard that would provide a target for developers to aim for in terms of treatment efficiency. As a result, ballast water exchange is still the only approved method for treating ballast water despite the concerns with this method's effectiveness. Consequently, U.S. waters remain vulnerable to the introduction of invasive species via ships' ballast water. State governments and others have expressed frustration over the seemingly slow progress the federal government has made on more effectively protecting U.S. waters from future species invasions via ballast water. As a result, several states have passed legislation that authorizes procedures for managing ballast water that are stricter than federal regulations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss actions to address the  introduction of harmful invasive species via the ballast water in ships.  Numerous harmful species have been introduced into U.S. waters via  ballast water and have caused serious economic and ecologic damage. As  you know, many of these species are now permanent residents in U.S.  ecosystems and have significantly altered the structure of these systems,  or promise to do so in the future. We reported in 2002 that at least 160  nonnative aquatic species had become established in the Great Lakes since  the 1800s, more than one-third of which had been introduced in the prior  30 years. Ballast water is considered a major, although not the only, source  of those introductions.  This problem is not confined to the Great Lakes,  however. The environment and economy of the Chesapeake Bay, San  Francisco Bay, Puget Sound, and other coastal areas have also been  affected by species transported in ballast water.

When they arrive in  a new location, most of these species do not survive because  environmental conditions are not favorable. However, some of the newly  arrived species do survive and, unfortunately, a portion of these flourish to  the point that they begin to dominate native species and are thus labeled  as \u201cinvasive.\u201d These invasive, nonnative species can seriously damage  ecosystems, businesses, and recreation.", "Ballast water is one of many pathways by which nonnative and invasive  species have arrived in the United States. Ships are designed to sail safely  with their hulls submerged to a certain depth in the water. If a ship is not  filled to capacity with cargo, it needs to fill its ballast tanks with water to  maintain proper depth and balance during its travels. As a ship takes on  cargo at ports of call, it must then discharge some of its ballast water to  compensate for the weight of the cargo. When ships are fully loaded with  cargo, their ballast tanks may be pumped down to the point where only  residual water (also referred to as non-pumpable ballast water) is left.  Ship masters may also manipulate the amount of water in their ballast  tanks to account for different sea conditions. Different classes of ships  have different ballast capacities, ranging from tens of thousands to  millions of gallons of water.", "Ships generally fill and discharge their ballast tanks when they are in port,  and the water and associated sediment they take in is likely to contain  living organisms or their eggs. Because the ballast water may be fresh,  brackish, or salty depending on where it is obtained, the organisms in the  water will also vary accordingly. Worldwide, ships discharge an estimated  3 billion to 5 billion metric tons of ballast water each year, and it is  estimated that several thousand different species may be transported  globally in ballast tanks on any given day. Well-known examples of  invasive species brought to the United States in ballast tanks include the  zebra mussel, round goby, Japanese shore crab, Asian clam, and Black Sea  jellyfish. Collectively, these and other aquatic species transported in  ballast water have caused billions of dollars in damage to our economy  and unmeasured damage to the environment. For example, we reported in  2002 that the Great Lakes commercial and recreational fishing industry\u2014 which is worth about $4.5 billion annually\u2014was being damaged or  threatened by the sea lamprey, round goby, Eurasian ruffe, and two  invertebrates from eastern Europe, just to name a few.", "While the Great Lakes feature prominently in today\u2019s hearing, many other  waters around the United States have also been invaded by harmful  species. Notably, invasive species are found in virtually all of our coastal  bays and estuaries\u2014resources that are typically enormously productive  and support multibillion dollar commercial fisheries and recreation  industries.

In 1992, Congress amended NANPCA and called  for the promulgation of regulations for ships entering the Hudson River  north of the George Washington Bridge; in December 1994, the Coast  Guard extended its regulations to these ships. The regulations required  ships with pumpable ballast water to:    exchange ballast water beyond the EEZ at a minimum depth of 2,000  meters before entering the Great Lakes or Hudson River;   utilize another environmentally sound ballast water management method  approved by the Coast Guard; or retain the ballast water on board.", "The Coast Guard did not approve any alternative method and, therefore,  ships that did not exchange their ballast water beyond the EEZ were  required to retain it on board.

NISA required the voluntary guidelines to direct ships to  manage ballast water in a manner similar to the mandatory requirements  for ships sailing to the Great Lakes by conducting ballast water exchange  beyond the EEZ, exchanging their ballast water in an alternative discharge  zone recommended by the ANSTF, or using an alternative treatment  method approved by the Secretary. The law also required that the  guidelines direct ships to carry out other management practices that were  deemed necessary to reduce the probability of transferring species from  ship operations other than ballast discharge and from ballasting practices  of ships that enter U.S. waters with no ballast water on board. In addition,  the law required that the guidelines provide that ships keep records and  submit them to the Secretary to enable the Secretary to determine  compliance with the guidelines.", "The Coast Guard issued an interim rule in May 1999 and promulgated a  final rule in November 2001 setting forth national voluntary guidelines  under NISA. The guidelines encouraged ships carrying ballast water  taken on in areas less than 200 nautical miles from any shore or in waters  less than 2,000 meters deep to employ at least one of the following ballast  water management practices: exchange their ballast water outside of the  EEZ in waters at least 2,000 meters deep before entering U.S. waters,  retain it on board, use an approved alternative ballast water management  method, discharge the ballast water to an approved reception facility, or  under extraordinary conditions conduct an exchange in an area agreed to  by the Captain of the Port. The voluntary guidelines also encouraged all  ships equipped with ballast water tanks and operating in U.S. waters to  take various precautions to minimize the uptake and release of harmful  aquatic organisms, pathogens and sediments. Such precautions may  include regularly cleaning ballast tanks to remove sediment and  minimizing or avoiding the uptake of ballast water in areas known to have  infestations of harmful organisms and pathogens such as toxic algal  blooms. In issuing the voluntary guidelines, the Coast Guard said that it  was considering the results of a study on alternate discharge exchange  zones but had not decided whether to allow ballast water exchanges in  any of the possible locations the task force identified.", "NISA also required a report to Congress on, among other things,  compliance with the voluntary ballast water exchange and reporting  guidelines no later than 3 years after their issuance. In addition, NISA  required that the guidelines be revised, or additional regulations  promulgated, no later than 3 years after the issuance of the guidelines and  at least every 3 years thereafter, as necessary. Importantly, NISA required  the promulgation of regulations making the guidelines mandatory if the  Secretary determined that reporting or the rate of ship compliance was not  adequate. As required by NISA, the Coast Guard issued its report to  Congress in June 2002, but was not able to evaluate compliance with the  voluntary guidelines because the rate of reporting was so poor. (From July  1, 1999, to June 30, 2001, less than one-third of all vessels required to  report ballast water management information met the requirement.)  Accordingly, as authorized by NISA, the Coast Guard published a  proposed rule for a national mandatory program for ballast water  management for all ships operating in U.S. waters in July 2003 and a final  rule in July 2004. In addition, the Coast Guard promulgated another rule,  effective August 13, 2004, establishing penalties for, among other things,  ship owners who do not file the required reports on their ballast water  operations.", "Finally, a key provision in NISA recognized the need to stimulate  development of ballast water treatment technologies.

Two actions  in the plan relate to ballast water. First, because ballast water exchange  was recognized as only an interim measure to address nonnative species  introductions via ballast water, the plan called for NOAA, the Coast Guard,  Interior, and EPA to sponsor research to develop new technologies for  ballast water management by July 2001. Second, the plan called for the  Coast Guard to issue standards for approving the use of ballast water  management technologies as alternative ballast water management  methods by January 2002. NANPCA and NISA require that, in order for an  alternative ballast water management method to be used, the Secretary  must first approve the method as being \u201cat least as effective as ballast  water exchange in preventing and controlling infestations of aquatic  nuisance species,\u201d however, standards for approving alternative measures  had yet to be developed.", "The effect of the National Invasive Species Council and the national  management plan on efforts to address species introductions via ballast  water appears to be minimal.

The cross-cut budget effort is intended to encourage agencies to, among  other things, develop shared goals and strategies, and to promote  cooperation and coordination on invasive species issues. As a part of the  cross-cut budget, agencies have developed three performance measures  for ballast water management. For fiscal year 2005, agencies were to (1)  sponsor eight ballast water technology projects, (2) develop and  implement a standardized program to test and certify the performance  capabilities of ballast water treatment systems, and (3) conduct a pilot  scale verification trial of a full-scale treatment system to validate the  standardized program. However, these measures call for agencies to take  certain actions as opposed to achieving some desired outcome. This is  similar to what we observed in our 2002 report about the actions in the  national management plan.

In addition, the ballast water  performance standard would set limits on the discharge of several disease  causing pathogens including cholera and E. coli. The dates by which ships  would need to meet the ballast water performance standard, if the  convention enters into force, would depend upon when the ship was built  and what its ballast water capacity is. For example, the ships first required  to meet the standard would be those built in 2009 or later with a ballast  capacity of less than 5,000 cubic meters. Ships built before 2009 with a  ballast capacity between 1,500 cubic meters and 5,000 cubic meters would  have to meet the standard by 2014.

The Coast Guard attributes the  increase in reporting to an effort beginning in 2004 to encourage ship  masters to file reports electronically and to the new regulations that allow  the Coast Guard to levy penalties for non-reporting.

NOBOBs are a particular  concern in the Great Lakes, where greater than 80 percent of ships  entering from outside the EEZ fall into this category. While still a concern  for other U.S. ports, it appears that a significantly smaller portion (about  20 percent) of ships arriving at U.S. ports other than the Great Lakes from  beyond the EEZ claimed NOBOB status.

In May 2005, the Coast Guard  convened a public workshop in Cleveland to discuss and obtain comments  on NOBOBs, particularly as they affect the Great Lakes. Following the  public meeting, the Coast Guard held a closed meeting for an invited group  of government officials and technology experts.

This practice indicates that such ships should conduct salt  water flushing of their empty ballast tanks in an area 200 nautical miles  from any shore, whenever possible. Salt water flushing is defined as \u201cthe  addition of mid-ocean water to empty ballast water tanks; the mixing of  the flush water with residual water and sediment through the motion of  the vessel; and the discharge of the mixed water, such that the resultant  residual water remaining in the tank has as high a salinity as possible, and  preferably is greater than 30 parts per thousand.\u201d Scientists believe that  this process will either flush out residual organisms from the ballast tanks  or kill remaining organisms with highly saline ocean water. The  effectiveness of this process, however, has not been demonstrated.

The Coast Guard has also acknowledged this gap. Specifically,  the agency noted in its July 2003 assessment of the potential impacts of its  new regulations on mandatory ballast water exchange and in its  environmental assessment of the final regulations, that discharges from  coastal shipping could result in the introduction or spread of invasive  species within regions of the United States.

Congress required the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force  to conduct a study to identify any possible areas within the waters of the  United States and the EEZ where ballast water exchange would not pose a  threat of infestation or spread of aquatic invasive species.

However, in looking at conditions around the United  States, the study identified many locations where it appeared that ballast  water exchange could safely occur less than 200 nautical miles from shore.", "Ultimately, the Task Force did not recommend alternate discharge areas  and the Coast Guard has not authorized ballast water exchange in any  such areas under its regulations. In its 2004 final rule for the mandatory  national ballast management program, the Coast Guard stated that it was  examining the possibility of establishing alternate ballast water exchange  zones and that information obtained at an October 2003 workshop, and  future workshops, could provide a sound, scientific basis for establishing  ballast water exchange zones within the EEZ. In 2004, the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology published the proceedings from the October 2003  workshop. The workshop attendees\u2014which included stakeholders from  the marine industry, scientific community, policy makers, regulators, and  nongovernmental organizations\u2014developed a consensus statement  regarding proposed alternate exchange zones along the northeastern  coastline of the United States and Canada. The group proposed that  alternate ballast water exchange areas, where there is consensus, be  adopted as a working policy statement by both the United States and  Canada for coastal vessel traffic until other treatment methods are  available. In their statement, the attendees focused more on the depth of  waters than on the distance from shore, noting that the continental shelf  marks a location that helps determine whether organisms are likely to  float toward shore or away from shore.", "However, the Coast Guard reports that it has no plans to consider the use  of alternate discharge zones. The ballast water program manager told us  that designating alternate zones would take a significant amount of  environmental analysis and a lengthy rulemaking process. She also said  that alternate discharge zones will not be needed once other treatment  technologies are installed on ships.", "While the United States has not identified alternate locations for  conducting ballast water exchange, the IMO and other countries have  proposed allowing, or already allow, ballast exchange to occur in locations  closer than 200 nautical miles from shore. The IMO convention, should it  take effect as adopted, states that all ships conducting ballast water  exchange should, whenever possible, do so at least 200 nautical miles from  the nearest land and in water at least 200 meters deep. However, the  convention recognizes that exchange at that distance may not be possible;  if not, exchange should be conducted as far from the nearest land as  possible, and in all cases at least 50 nautical miles from the nearest land  and in water at least 200 meters deep. Australia requires that exchange be  done outside 12 nautical miles in water exceeding 200 meters in depth.", "The Canadian government proposed regulations in June 2005 that would  allow transoceanic ships, unable to exchange ballast water more than 200  nautical miles from shore where the water is at least 2,000 meters deep  because it would compromise the stability of the ship or the safety of the  ship or of persons on board, to make the exchange in one of five alternate  discharge zones that Canada\u2019s Department of Fisheries and Oceans  determined could receive ballast water with little risk. For non- transoceanic ships that do not travel at least 200 nautical miles from shore  and in waters at least 2,000 meters deep (for example, ships arriving from  U.S. ports that travel near the coast), the proposed regulations would  require ships to exchange ballast water at least 50 nautical miles from  shore where the water is at least 500 meters deep. If that were not  practical or possible, the ships would be allowed to use an alternate  discharge zone. The minimum allowable depth in the alternative areas  would be from 300 to 1,000 meters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns Persist Over the Effectiveness of Ballast Water Exchange", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, we reported on numerous concerns about the effectiveness of  ballast water exchange in removing potentially harmful organisms. There  are two presumptions behind ballast water exchange as a method for  ballast water treatment. First, it is presumed that the exchange will  physically remove the water and organisms from ballast tanks. Second,  ballast water exchange presumes that there are significant differences in  the salinity of the original ballast water, mid-ocean water, and the  ecosystem into which the water is ultimately discharged, such as the Great  Lakes. If the original ballast water were fresh, organisms in that water  would, in theory, not survive in the salt water taken on in mid-ocean.  Similarly, any mid-ocean organisms taken on during the exchange would  not survive in the fresh water of a destination port. Evidence has shown,  however, that these presumptions are not always borne out. For one thing,  ballast pumps are not always able to remove all of the original water,  sediment, and associated organisms. In addition, elevated levels of salinity  do not necessarily kill all forms of potentially invasive organisms.  Therefore, scientists believe that viable organisms can survive ballast  water exchange and possibly become invasive when discharged to a new  environment. The National Research Council highlighted the need for  alternatives to ballast water exchange by stating in its 1996 report on  ballast water management, \u201cwhile changing ballast may be an acceptable  and effective control method under certain circumstances, it is neither  universally applicable nor totally effective, and alternative strategies are  needed.\u201d We noted in our 2002 report that despite the high compliance  rate with mandatory ballast water exchange in the Great Lakes, invasive  organisms, such as the fish-hook water flea discovered in 1998, were still  entering the ecosystem."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Technologies Are Being Developed to Treat Ballast Water, but Challenges Remain Before They Can Be Used", "paragraphs": ["Developers are pursuing technologies for use in treating ballast water,  some of which show promise that a technical solution can be used to  provide more reliable removal of potentially invasive species.

NOAA\u2019s Ballast Water Technology Demonstration Program has assisted in  this regard by providing over $12 million in grants to 54 research projects  since 1998. Related to this issue, the International Maritime Organization  convention on ballast water required an assessment of the state of  treatment technology to determine whether appropriate technologies are  available to achieve the standard proposed in the convention. Toward this  end, the United States and five other member countries submitted  assessments of the state of treatment technology development. The United  States\u2019 assessment was based on a study conducted by the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. The  center assessed about a dozen potential ballast water technologies and  identified four basic approaches that it believed are sufficiently well  developed to indicate that effective and practicable systems will be  available to treat ballast water to some measurable performance standard.  These technologies are (1) heat, (2) chlorine dioxide, (3) separation  followed by ultraviolet radiation, and (4) separation followed by advanced  oxidation treatment.", "On the basis of this assessment, the United States took the position that  developers of treatment technologies have made enough progress to  suggest that the first proposed deadline in the convention could be met;  namely, that ships built on or after 2009 and with a ballast water capacity  of under 5,000 cubic meters could have treatment systems that could meet  the discharge standards. However, the United States also stated that it was  too early to tell whether treatment systems would be available for other  categories of ships that will need them at a later date. After reviewing and  discussing the evidence on the status of technology development provided  by the United States and other member countries, the IMO\u2019s Marine  Environment Protection Committee\u2019s technology review group  recommended that there was no need to consider amending the schedule  for implementing the convention due to a lack of progress on technology,  although it recommended that the committee reexamine the status of  technology in October 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development and Use of Ballast Water Treatment Technologies Face Many Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Several challenges hamper development and use of ballast water  treatment technologies.

Like wastewater  treatment facilities, ballast water treatment technology will need to be safe  for the environment and crew, and achieve a specific level of pollutant  removal (in the case of ballast water\u2014removal of potentially invasive  species). On the other hand, shipboard ballast water treatment systems  will have to meet additional challenges that land-based wastewater  treatment facilities do not, such as: (1) treating large volumes of water at  very high flow rates and (2) removing or killing a much broader range of  biological organisms\u2014including unknown organisms. Importantly, the  treatment systems must be able to operate in a manner that does not  compromise ship safety. In addition, to make any treatment option  palatable to the shipping industry, the systems must not displace an  unacceptable amount of valuable cargo space. Consequently, the  technologies must be dramatically smaller in scale than those currently  used in the wastewater industry while still achieving a high level of  removal or \u201ckill\u201d rates. Further complicating matters, because ships differ  in their structural designs, it is unlikely that one type of treatment  technology will be appropriate for all types of ships.

Notably, the program approves the  use of a system on a single ship; it does not approve the use of that system  for other ships. To be accepted into the program, the experimental  technology needs to be capable of removing or killing at least 98 percent  of organisms larger than 50 microns.

According to the stakeholders we spoke with, the primary  reason is the lack of a defined discharge standard, rather than any  particular aspect of the STEP program itself. The lack of a discharge  standard, as well as the fact that use of ballast water treatment technology  is not currently required, has made it difficult for technology developers to  gather the venture capital needed to proceed aggressively on technology  development since use of such technology is not required. Consequently,  few technologies are ready to be installed and tested on board ships. One  representative of a technology firm believes the Coast Guard should  expand the size of the STEP program to provide more incentive to  shipping companies and technology developers that want to test variations  of technologies or test their technology on different types of ships.  Currently, the agency is limiting the number of applicants to about 5 or 6  per year and expects each application to cover just one ship. Another  stakeholder echoed this point, saying that the program requires ship  owners to go to great lengths for the benefit of getting one ship approved.
