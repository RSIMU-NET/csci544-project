In particular, posts prepare by developing and updating Emergency Action Plans (EAP) and conducting drills. EAPs are to contain information to assist posts in responding to emergencies, such as checklists of response procedures and decision points to help determine when to evacuate post staff or family members. Posts are required to conduct nine types of drills each fiscal year to prepare for crises and evacuations. State also has established processes for conducting post evacuations. Following an evacuation, post staff are required to transmit an after-action report identifying lessons learned to State headquarters.", "State has gaps in its crisis and evacuation preparedness for overseas posts. In fiscal years 2013\u20132016, almost a quarter of posts, on average, were late completing required annual EAP updates. While the completion rate improved from 46 percent to 92 percent of posts completing updates on time in fiscal years 2013 and 2016, respectively, GAO's review of a nongeneralizable sample of EAPs from 20 posts that had been approved by State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security showed that only 2 of 20 had updated all key EAP sections. GAO also found that EAPs are viewed as lengthy and cumbersome documents that are not readily usable in emergency situations, as required. In addition, GAO found that, on average for fiscal years 2013\u20132016, posts worldwide reported completing 52 percent of required annual drills; posts rated high or critical in political violence or terrorism reported completing 44 percent of these drills. As shown in the figure below, 78 percent of posts reported completing duck and cover drills, but only 36 percent of posts reported completing evacuation training drills. Overall, less than 4 percent of posts reported completing all required drills during fiscal years 2013-2016. In addition, although posts are required to transmit an after-action report listing lessons learned to State headquarters following evacuations, no such reports were submitted in fiscal years 2013\u20132016.

First,  we reviewed DS data to determine the dates when overseas posts  completed required annual updates of their Emergency Action Plans  (EAP) for fiscal years 2013\u20132016. Second, we analyzed a  nongeneralizable, judgmental sample of 20 post EAPs that DS had  reviewed and approved to assess whether this sample of EAPs contained  evidence that key EAP sections, as identified by DS, had been updated.  More specifically, for all 20 EAPs, we examined the dates indicating each  key section\u2019s most recent update to determine if the post had reviewed  and updated the information within required time frames. We selected the  sample of post EAPs to review to ensure that we examined posts that had  experienced evacuations or suspended operations since September  2012, whose evacuations or suspended operations had occurred for a  variety of reasons (e.g., natural disasters as well as security threats), with  different statuses regarding accompaniment of family members, and from  different geographic regions.

Completion rates for the  drills ranged from a high of 78 percent to a low of 22 percent, depending  on the type of drill. For example, in fiscal years 2013 through 2016, an  average of 78 percent of posts reported completing required duck and  cover drills; an average of 58 percent of posts reported completing  required employee warden system drills; an average of 36 percent of  posts reported completing required evacuation/drawdown training drills;  and an average of 22 percent of posts reported completing the required  consular warden system drills.", "For fiscal years 2013 through 2016, we found that, on average, 3.4  percent of posts reported completing all required annual drills (see   table 3).", "For those posts rated high or critical in political violence or terrorism, we  found that, on average for fiscal years 2013 through 2016, 2.3 percent of  posts reported completing all drills at least twice per fiscal year as  required (see table 4).", "State headquarters officials told us that, while posts are aware of the  requirements to report completed drills, posts may be underreporting drills  completed. They said that post RSOs have significant workloads and that  this may result in RSOs failing to report a post\u2019s completion of some  required drills. When RSOs report completion of drills in the DS Security  Management Console, the FAH also requires that they record information  about how the drill was conducted, including post participation,  deficiencies identified, and corrective actions. These additional reporting  requirements further add to RSO workloads and may contribute to  underreporting, according to State headquarters officials. Moreover, State  officials told us that incident commanders responsible for conducting  certain types of drills may not notify RSOs about completed drills. Absent  more complete drill reporting, State headquarters and post leadership  lack information on posts\u2019 preparedness for responding to crises and  conducting evacuations.", "DS officials told us that\u2014partly in response to our ongoing work\u2014the  bureau recently has established a DS Drills Working Group to clarify RSO  roles and requirements for reporting drills and to address some of the  challenges leading to underreporting the completion of required drills. DS  officials also told us that they plan to modify the new electronic system for  drafting and updating EAPs to include a post drills reporting feature. This  feature, projected by DS to be incorporated into the new system in 2018,  would allow incident commanders to report completion of drills for which  they are responsible. DS officials said that they hope this new feature will  improve the reporting of completed required drills.", "Nevertheless, officials at three posts we met with told us that posts may  not be completing required drills because compliance with annual drilling  requirements is not a priority in State\u2019s organizational culture. For  example, officials at one post rated high in political violence and terrorism  told us that the previous RSO had not adhered to the post\u2019s drilling  schedule for meeting annual drilling requirements. The new RSO at this  post told us that the previous RSO had completed less than 40 percent of  required drills in fiscal year 2016. Another official at the same post told us  that the Ambassador had denied requests for additional drills that the new  RSO deemed necessary, saying that the post was too busy to hold such  drills. If drills are not conducted as required, overseas post staff may lack  the preparation to respond to a crisis, which could endanger post staff  and family members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overseas Posts Have Not Submitted Required Lessons Learned Reports following Evacuations", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 2013 through 2016, there were 31 evacuations from  overseas posts; however, according to CMS, none of the posts submitted  required lessons learned reports to State headquarters following the  termination of their authorized or ordered departures. We requested that  State headquarters provide us with any documents\u2014produced by  overseas posts\u2014containing lessons learned or any challenges  encountered by posts that experienced an evacuation during fiscal years  2013 through 2016. State was unable to provide any documents  responsive to our request. CMS officials told us that State currently does  not have an established process for centrally collecting and assessing  lessons learned documents, but that CMS is taking steps to develop and  implement such a process. In September 2016, CMS formed a new unit  to work on, among other tasks, lessons learned projects to ease the  burden on posts and to develop a collection and assessment process for  lessons learned. Separately from CMS, DS provided us with two  classified reports containing some lessons learned about overseas posts  that had experienced evacuations. However, neither of these documents  was produced by the overseas posts themselves and, according to DS  and CMS officials, DS is not the entity within State that is responsible for  collecting and assessing lessons learned reports from posts following  evacuations.", "As previously discussed, State guidance recommends that posts engage  in a lessons learned discussion after an authorized or ordered departure  has been terminated. State\u2019s CMS team at headquarters is to work with  the overseas post, the relevant regional bureau, and State\u2019s Management  Bureau to facilitate a lessons learned discussion for the record.  Additionally, the FAH requires post staff to transmit an after-action report  listing any lessons learned from their experience to State headquarters.  In addition, federal internal control standards call for agency management  to hold individuals accountable for their internal control responsibilities  and to establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal  control system and evaluate the results.", "CMS officials told us that overseas posts often lack sufficient resources to  produce lessons learned reports following termination of the post\u2019s  authorized or ordered departure. CMS officials also told us that even after  the crisis leading to an evacuation has abated and staff have returned to  post, there is often a backlog of tasks to be completed. They also said  completing these tasks is a priority for post staff, which limits their ability  to develop and submit lessons learned reports. Moreover, CMS officials  said that post staff curtailments also can challenge a post\u2019s ability to  develop and submit lessons learned reports following an evacuation, as  staff present during the evacuation may no longer be present when the  post resumes normal operations.", "We learned of several challenges that posts faced in different evacuations  in discussions with officials from the six posts with whom we met.  Different posts mentioned various challenges, including disorganized  evacuation logistics and transportation, unclear communication with local  staff, confusion surrounding the policy for evacuating pets, problems with  shipment and delivery of personal effects, difficulty tracking the  destination of staff who were relocated, poor communication with senior  State leadership regarding the post\u2019s evacuation status, difficulties getting  reimbursement for lodging or personal expenses related to the  evacuation, and other similar challenges.", "Absent a functioning lessons learned process, State\u2019s ability to identify  lessons learned and to share best practices from staff that have  experienced evacuations may be constrained. According to CMS officials,  holding lessons learned exercises can help to identify challenges that a  post faced during an evacuation within a reasonable time frame. The  subsequent after-action reports could be used to modify guidance for  posts on how to best respond to emergency situations. According to CMS  officials, these reports also can help staff at other overseas posts learn  about the challenges the evacuated posts faced, identify relevant insights  and best practices, and prepare for potential future evacuations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["U.S. personnel working at overseas posts, along with the family members  who accompany them, face a range of threats to their safety and  security\u2014such as terrorism, civil unrest, and natural disasters. To help  protect them, State has established processes to prepare overseas posts  for crises and to conduct evacuations. However, State has significant  gaps in implementation of its preparedness processes for crises and  evacuations at overseas posts. Overseas posts are not completing  required annual EAP updates, DS is not identifying incomplete updates in  its EAP reviews, and the EAPs themselves are not readily usable during  emergency situations. In addition, although regular drilling is a critical  crisis preparedness task, very few overseas posts have completed all  required annual drills. Finally, because overseas posts are not submitting  required after-action reports containing lessons learned following  evacuations, State is missing important opportunities to identify  challenges and best practices and to make changes to prepare for future  evacuations from overseas posts. While State has taken initial actions\u2014 including some actions in response to our ongoing work\u2014to improve  implementation of its preparedness processes for crises and evacuations,  significant shortcomings exist.

Establish a monitoring and tracking process to ensure that DS fully  reviews and documents the review of key sections of EAPs submitted  to it during the annual EAP review cycle.  3.  Take steps to make the EAP more readily usable during emergency  situations. For example, State could develop a more streamlined  version of the EAP\u2014consisting of key sections, checklists, and  contact lists\u2014that could be used by overseas post staff, in addition to  the full EAP. In addition, for its new system planned for later this year,  State could consider including requirements for streamlined EAPs.  4.

We  analyzed information from State\u2019s Emergency Action Plans (EAP) drilling  database, Security Environment Threat List, and the State account for  Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Service known as the K  fund. In addition, we interviewed officials from State\u2019s Bureau of  Diplomatic Security (DS); Office of Management Policy, Rightsizing, and  Innovation; Crisis Management Support; Africa Regional Bureau; Western  Hemisphere Regional Bureau; Near Eastern Affairs Regional Bureau; and  European Regional Bureau. We reviewed GAO\u2019s most recent work  regarding evacuations and the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) support  for State in crisis situations. We also interviewed representatives from  DOD\u2019s Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.", "We conducted fieldwork at four overseas posts in the Africa and the Near  East geographic regions. We are not naming the specific posts we visited  for this review due to security concerns. In addition, we conducted  interviews\u2014via secure video conference\u2014with two additional posts in the  Near East and Africa geographic regions, and with a DOD combatant  command to gather their perspectives on State\u2019s implementation of crisis  and evacuation preparedness processes for overseas posts. This sample  of countries was designed to account for geographic diversity and to  include posts that have experienced authorized departure, ordered  departure, and suspended operations since September 2012; had a mix  of posts where family members or members of household were  authorized or not authorized to reside; and a mix of both high-risk posts  and posts where a Vital Presence Validation Process (VP2) assessment  had been conducted. At posts we visited, we met with a variety of post  staff including Emergency Action Committee members, Ambassadors,  Deputy Chiefs of Mission, Regional Security Officers (RSO), Management  Counselors, Community Liaison Office Coordinators, and U.S. staff and  locally employed staff who had experienced previous evacuations.", "To examine the processes State has established to prepare overseas  posts for crises and to conduct evacuations, we reviewed State\u2019s policies  and procedures in the FAM and associated FAH requiring posts to  prepare EAPs and to conduct crisis-situation and evacuation drills, as well  as policies and procedures to conduct evacuations at overseas posts. We  also reviewed memoranda of agreement between State and DOD  regarding coordination of U.S. military support to posts during  evacuations. We interviewed State officials at headquarters, including  from relevant regional bureaus and other offices and groups that assist  posts during crises and evacuations, and at four overseas posts. Further,  we interviewed officials via secure video conferences at two additional  posts and a DOD combatant command to discuss State policies and  procedures that define their roles in crisis and evacuation preparedness.", "To determine the amount State had spent on evacuation-related  expenses, we assessed State-provided expenditure data from the K Fund  by totaling the amounts reported for overseas post evacuations that took  place in fiscal years 2010\u20132016; we did not conduct a financial audit of  the expenditure data. The K Fund is used to cover post evacuation- related expenditures. State provided K Fund data on overseas post  evacuations that it collects and tracks through its Global Financial  Management System for these years. We assessed the reliability of these  data by querying knowledgeable State officials about them. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to present State\u2019s  expenditures on evacuations in fiscal years 2010 through 2016.", "To assess State\u2019s implementation of preparedness processes for crises  and evacuations at overseas posts, we conducted several analyses. First,  to assess the extent to which overseas posts annually updated EAPs  within required time frames, we reviewed DS data to identify the dates  when overseas posts completed the required annual updates of their  EAPs for fiscal years 2013\u20132016. To assess the reliability of DS data on  when posts completed their annual EAP updates, we performed basic  logic checks on the data provided and reviewed DS\u2019s responses to a  series of data reliability questions. We concluded that the DS data on  EAP annual updates were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report. Second, to determine the extent to which DS met requirements to  fully review key sections of EAPs submitted by overseas posts, we  requested documentation from DS on the reviews completed, including  who conducted them and what deficiencies, if any, were found.", "Third, we analyzed a nongeneralizable, judgmental sample of 20 post  EAPs that DS had reviewed and approved to assess whether this sample  of EAPs contained evidence that key EAP sections, as identified by DS,  had been updated. We selected the sample of post EAPs to ensure that  we examined EAPs from posts that had experienced evacuations or  suspended operations since September 2012, whose evacuations or  suspended operations that had occurred for a variety of reasons (e.g.,  natural disasters as well as security threats), with different statuses  regarding accompaniment of family members, and from different  geographic regions. For all 20 EAPs, we examined the dates indicating  each key section\u2019s most recent update to determine if the overseas post  had reviewed and updated the information within required time frames.  The dates we reviewed are updated by State\u2019s current electronic system  for generating and updating EAPs whenever a section of the EAP is  edited and put through the approval process for republication. We  reviewed available unclassified and classified portions of the 20 EAPs  requested. However, the classified and unclassified portions of these  EAPs were not current as of the same date; therefore, we restricted our  analysis to the unclassified portions. By reviewing the available  unclassified portions of these EAPs, we were able to assess an average  of over 70 percent of the 27 key EAP sections for the 20 EAPs in our  nongeneralizable sample. State officials explained that each overseas  post determines which portions of its EAP should be classified. The  portions of EAPs that were classified varied by post\u2014both the number of  portions that were classified and which ones\u2014due to the differing  situations and risks faced by each post. To assess the degree to which  the EAPs are readily usable in emergency situations, we interviewed staff  at overseas posts and State headquarters about the utility of EAPs in  emergency situations. In addition, for the sample of 20 EAPs we  reviewed, we determined the average number of pages of those  documents.", "Fourth, to understand the extent to which posts have complied with  requirements to conduct drills intended to prepare them for crises and  evacuations, we reviewed DS\u2019s drilling database for overseas posts for  fiscal years 2013\u20132016. RSOs report completion of their post\u2019s drills into  DS\u2019s RSO Security Management Console, which logs the drill records  into a drilling database maintained by DS. The data elements we  assessed from the drilling database were for overseas posts that reported  completing required drills for fiscal years 2013\u20132016. DS officials  indicated that some posts may be underreporting completion of their  required drills. In addition, DS is unable to confirm that all drills completed  by posts for fiscal years 2013\u20132016 were reported in DS\u2019s RSO Security  Management Console. Consequently, the data elements we assessed  from the drilling database do not fully capture the extent to which drills  might have been completed at posts for fiscal years 2013\u20132016. In  analyzing the data, we also requested and received from DS information  on those posts that were rated high or critical for terrorism or political  violence on its Security Environment Threat List for fiscal years 2013\u2013 2016, as those posts have more frequent annual drilling requirements.", "Upon reviewing the Security Environment Threat List data along with the  data on posts from the drilling database, we found 23 posts with potential  data anomalies. We sent DS follow-up questions to clarify these  anomalies and received responses from DS. To assess the reliability of  the drilling database, we performed basic logic checks on the database  and reviewed State\u2019s responses to a series of data reliability questions.  We concluded that, although State does not independently verify the  accuracy of data reported within DS\u2019s RSO Security Management  Console to ensure its accuracy or validity, the data are sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of reviewing which overseas posts reported completing  required annual drills for fiscal years 2013-2016.", "Fifth, to determine the extent to which overseas posts that had  experienced evacuations complied with requirements to submit lessons  learned reports to State headquarters following the termination of an  authorized or ordered departure, we requested from State officials at  headquarters any required lessons learned reports submitted by posts  following evacuations for fiscal years 2013\u20132016.
