STEP is currently authorized through fiscal year 2020. In the  years since STEP was first authorized, SBA has awarded hundreds of  STEP grants, and these grants have provided about $139 million of  support to almost every U.S. state as well as several territories. According  to surveys conducted by State International Development Organizations  (SIDO), a national group that supports state trade offices, states that  have received support from the program report that their small  businesses have been able to successfully conduct export activities as a  result of this program. Many states report that STEP is important to their  export promotion operations.

We also  reviewed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) federal grant  guidance, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and  Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), and GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. In addition, we  analyzed SBA documentation, including sample grant files, application  forms, application scoring forms, grant reporting forms, and standard  operating procedures for managing SBA grants. We also interviewed  officials from SBA\u2019s Office of International Trade (OIT), which is  responsible for making the awards and administering the program; the  Office of Grants Management (OGM), which is responsible for managing  grants across SBA and officials from SBA\u2019s OIG to understand their work  on the program.", "To identify the states\u2019 challenges in fully using the grant funds, we spoke  with officials from 12 of the 40 states that received a grant in fiscal year  2015, the most recent year for which complete grant expenditure data  were available when we began this work. We selected these states  because they did not use 25 percent or more of their award in that year.  We selected this threshold after analyzing the data from that year and  determining that these states accounted for almost 70 percent of the  unused STEP grant funds in fiscal year 2015. This group of 12 states  constitutes a nongeneralizable sample, and as such, the challenges that  these states reported may not be common to all states receiving a STEP  grant.

State  trade offices, which conduct these activities, can be housed in various  state entities, including governors\u2019 offices, state departments of  commerce, universities, world trade centers, and state departments of  economic development. As we have previously reported, state trade  offices often offer export promotion services similar to those offered by  certain federal agencies; in addition to SBA, these include the  Department of Commerce and the Export-Import Bank. State trade  offices often have both domestic and international staff; domestic staff are  typically state employees.

Within either a 25  percent or 35 percent match amount, at least half of the total match must  be provided in the form of cash.

First, OIT  officials told us that of these four states, two submitted additional  information after the grant had closed, indicating that the states had met  the matching requirement.

Both of these states told us that they also reported staff salaries to OIT as  their cash matching funds. Using part of the grant to pay for staff salaries  in this way could have the effect of reducing the match below the  thresholds mandated by TFTEA. When we asked OIT officials what  process they had in place to determine whether states were using staff  salaries paid for with STEP funds as part of their match amount, OIT  officials told us that they were not aware that STEP grantees had  engaged in this practice, and therefore did not monitor for it. In order to  determine whether this was happening, officials stated that they would  need to inspect each state\u2019s grant files on a case-by-case basis.

According to the Uniform  Guidance, the federal awarding agency may restrict grant recipients\u2019  repurposing of funds in excess of 10 percent of the total grant amount,  and determine the level of detail required for requests to repurpose  funds. OIT officials told us that in cases of repurposing more than 10  percent of total funds, the documentation required is determined on a  case-by-case basis depending on the amount of funds involved and the degree of difference between the original approved use and the proposed  new use.

When a state applies for a STEP  grant using this approach, the state is typically less specific in its  performance targets, such as which trade shows will be attended and by  how many small businesses. One state official said that this approach can  increase use rates by providing states with more flexibility in distributing  the funds. OIT officials agreed that where a state is less prescriptive in its  application performance targets it is easier for the state to repurpose  funds, such as when federal trade missions are cancelled or small  businesses express interest in activities that were not originally proposed.

Officials from two states also pointed  out that the reporting requirements for STEP were much more detailed  and burdensome than grants they administered from other federal  agencies, such as the Department of Commerce.

However, SBA has not taken some  necessary steps to manage the program\u2019s total and cash matching  requirements according to applicable law or federal internal control  standards. SBA does not document that states are meeting the total  match requirement, and has not developed a process to determine  whether states are meeting the cash match requirement. As a result, SBA  does not have reasonable assurance that the states are meeting these  requirements. Matching requirements directly engage states, augment  federal funds, and ensure further support to small businesses that export.  As such, meeting the matching requirements is a key aspect of the  program\u2019s success. Although not every state has problems using the full  federal award amount, about a quarter of the states do, which may hinder  the program\u2019s ability to fully achieve its goals of increasing the number of  small businesses exporting, increasing the number of small businesses  exploring significant new trade opportunities, and increasing the value of  exports for small businesses already engaged in international trade.  While SBA has taken some steps to improve the program based on  feedback from states, it could do more in this regard, including finding  ways to assess and address the specific concerns raised by states that  have experienced difficulty using grant funds. SBA could also take further  steps to collect and disseminate best practices among states to  strengthen their ability to fully use grant funds.

To address these objectives, we did the  following:  Legal and regulatory review. We reviewed the Small Business Jobs Act  of 2010 and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015  (TFTEA), the statutes that established and reauthorized STEP,  respectively. We focused on SBA\u2019s compliance with the proportional  distribution, total match, and cash match requirements because these  requirements are consistent across both of the program\u2019s laws, and to  avoid duplication with ongoing Office of Inspector General (OIG) work on  the program.
