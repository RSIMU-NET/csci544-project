As part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), FPS is responsible for protecting federal employees and visitors in approximately 9,600 federal facilities under the control and custody the General Services Administration (GSA). To help accomplish its mission, FPS conducts facility security assessments and has approximately 13,500 contract security guards deployed to federal facilities. FPS charges fees for its security services to federal tenant agencies.", "This testimony discusses challenges FPS faces in (1) ensuring contract security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and certified and (2) conducting risk assessments at federal facilities. It is based on GAO reports issued from 2009 through 2014 on FPS's contract guard and risk assessment programs. To perform this work, GAO reviewed FPS and guard company data and interviewed officials about oversight of guards. GAO compared FPS's and eight federal agencies' risk assessment methodologies to ISC standards that federal agencies must use. GAO selected these agencies based on their missions and types of facilities. GAO also interviewed agency officials and 4 risk management experts about risk assessments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Protective Service continues to face challenges ensuring that contract guards have been properly trained and certified before being deployed to federal facilities around the country. In September 2013, for example, GAO reported that providing training for active shooter scenarios and screening access to federal facilities poses a challenge for FPS. According to officials at five guard companies, their contract guards have not received training on how to respond during incidents involving an active shooter. Without ensuring that all guards receive training on how to respond to active-shooter incidents at federal facilities, FPS has limited assurance that its guards are prepared for this threat. Similarly, an official from one of FPS's contract guard companies stated that 133 (about 38 percent) of its approximately 350 guards have never received screener training. As a result, guards deployed to federal facilities may be using x-ray and magnetometer equipment that they are not qualified to use raising questions about their ability to fulfill a primary responsibility of screening access control points at federal facilities. GAO was unable to determine the extent to which FPS's guards have received active-shooter response and screener training, in part, because FPS lacks a comprehensive and reliable system for guard oversight. GAO also found that FPS continues to lack effective management controls to ensure its guards have met its training and certification requirements. For instance, although FPS agreed with GAO's 2012 recommendations that it develop a comprehensive and reliable system for managing information on guards' training, certifications, and qualifications, it still does not have such a system. Additionally, 23 percent of the 276 contract guard files GAO reviewed did not have required training and certification documentation. For example, some files were missing items such as documentation of screener training, CPR certifications, and firearms qualifications.", "Assessing risk at federal facilities remains a challenge for FPS. GAO found in 2012 that federal agencies pay FPS millions of dollars to assess risk at their facilities, but FPS is not assessing risks in a manner consistent with federal standards. In March 2014, GAO found that this is still a challenge for FPS and several other agencies. The Interagency Security Committee's (ISC) Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard requires federal agencies to develop risk assessment methodologies that, among other things, assess the threat, vulnerability, and consequence to undesirable events. Risk assessments help decision-makers identify and evaluate security risks and implement protective measures. Instead of conducting risk assessments, FPS uses an interim vulnerability assessment tool, referred to as the Modified Infrastructure Survey Tool (MIST) to assess federal facilities until it develops a longer-term solution. However, MIST does not assess consequence (the level, duration, and nature of potential loss resulting from an undesirable event). Three of the four risk assessment experts GAO spoke with generally agreed that a tool that does not estimate consequences does not allow an agency to fully assess risks. Thus, FPS has limited knowledge of the risks facing about 9,600 federal facilities around the country. FPS officials stated that consequence information in MIST was not part of the original design, but they are exploring ways to incorporate it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 2010, GAO has made 31 recommendations to improve FPS's contract guard and risk assessment processes, of which 6 were implemented, 10 are in process, and 15 have not been implemented."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss the efforts of the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Protective Service (FPS) to protect  the nearly 9,600 federal facilities that are under the control and custody of  the General Services Administration (GSA), including the challenges  associated with FPS\u2019s use of contract guards and risk assessments. The  2012 shooting at the Anderson Federal Building in Long Beach,  California, the results of our 2009 covert testing, and FPS\u2019s ongoing  penetration testing demonstrate the continued vulnerability of federal  facilities. The challenge of protecting federal facilities is one of the major  reasons why we have designated federal real property management as a  high-risk area.", "FPS is authorized to (1) protect the buildings, grounds, and property that  are under the control and custody of GSA, as well as the persons on the  property; (2) enforce federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting  such property and persons on the property; and (3) investigate offenses  against these buildings and persons. FPS conducts its mission by providing security services through two types of activities: physical security activities\u2014conducting risk assessments and  recommending countermeasures aimed at preventing incidents\u2014and  law enforcement activities\u2014proactively patrolling facilities, responding  to incidents, conducting criminal investigations, and exercising arrest  authority. To accomplish its mission, FPS currently has almost 1,200  full-time employees and about 13,500 contract guards deployed at  federal facilities across the country. It expects to receive  approximately $1.2 billion in fees for fiscal year 2014.", "Since 2008, we have reported on the challenges FPS faces with carrying  out its mission, including overseeing its contract guards and assessing  risk at federal facilities. FPS\u2019s contract guard program is the most visible  component of the agency\u2019s operations, and the agency relies on its  guards to be its \u201ceyes and ears\u201d while performing their duties. However,  we reported in 2010 and again in 2013 that FPS continues to experience  difficulty ensuring that its guards have the required training and  certifications. Before guards are assigned to a post (an area of  responsibility) at a federal facility, FPS requires that they all undergo  employee fitness determinations and complete approximately 120 hours  of training provided by the contractor and FPS, including basic training  and firearms training. Guards must also possess the necessary  certificates, licenses, and permits as required by the contract, such as  CPR and first-aid certifications. Among other duties, contract guards are  responsible for controlling access to facilities; conducting screening at  access points to prevent the introduction of prohibited items, such as  weapons and explosives; and responding to emergency situations  involving facility safety and security. FPS also faces challenges  assessing risks at the 9,600 facilities under the control and custody of  GSA. In 2012 and in 2014, we reported that FPS\u2019s ability to protect and  secure federal facilities has been hampered by the absence of a risk  assessment program that is consistent with federal standards. To address  issues with overseeing contract guards and conducting risk assessments,  we made several recommendations which FPS agreed to implement.  These recommendations and their status are discussed later in this  statement.", "This testimony discusses challenges FPS faces in (1) ensuring contract  security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and  certified and (2) conducting risk assessments at federal facilities. It is  based on our reports and testimonies issued from 2009 through 2014 on  FPS\u2019s contract guard and risk assessment programs. A complete list of  these related products appears at the end of my statement. As part of the  work for these products, we reviewed relevant statutes and federal  guidance, examined FPS contract guard and risk assessment processes  and procedures, reviewed a sample of contract guard files, conducted site  visits to FPS\u2019s 11 regions where we interviewed FPS officials, and  conducted interviews with the 31 guard companies with which FPS has  contracted and 4 risk management experts. In addition, we reviewed  FPS\u2019s and eight other selected federal agencies\u2019 risk assessment  methodologies and compared it to the Risk Management Process for  Federal Facilities standard (RMP) that the Interagency Security  Committee (ISC) issued. The eight selected agencies include:  Department of Energy, Office of Health, Safety, and Security; Department  of Interior; Department of Justice, Justice Protective Service; Department  of State, Diplomatic Security; Department of Veterans Affairs; Federal  Emergency Management Agency; Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and  Office of Personnel Management. We selected these agencies to achieve  diversity with respect to the number and types of agencies\u2019 facilities, as  well as the agencies\u2019 missions.", "We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

However, in our September 2013 report, we  found that FPS has not provided required screener training to all guards.  Screener training is important because many guards control access  points at federal facilities and thus must be able to properly operate x-ray  and magnetometer machines and understand their results. In 2009 and  2010, we reported that FPS had not provided screener training to 1,500  contract guards in one FPS region. In response to those reports, FPS  stated that it planned to implement a program to train its inspectors to  provide screener training to all its contract guards by September 2015.", "Information from guard companies we contacted indicate that guards who  have never received this screener training continue to be deployed to  federal facilities.", "An official at one contract guard company stated that 133 of its  approximately 350 guards (about 38 percent) on three separate FPS  contracts (awarded in 2009) have never received their initial x-ray and  magnetometer training from FPS. The official stated that some of  these guards are working at screening posts.", "Officials at another contract guard company in a different FPS region  stated that, according to their records, 78 of 295 (about 26 percent)  guards deployed under their contract have never received FPS\u2019s x-ray  and magnetometer training. These officials stated that FPS\u2019s regional  officials were informed of the problem, but allowed guards to continue  to work under this contract, despite not having completed required  training.

For example, although FPS agreed with  our 2012 recommendations to develop a comprehensive and reliable  system to oversee contract guards, it still has not established such a  system. Without a comprehensive guard management system, FPS has  no independent means of ensuring that its contract guard companies  have met contract requirements, such as providing qualified guards to  federal facilities. Instead, FPS requires its guard companies to maintain  files containing guard-training and certification information. The  companies are then required to provide FPS with this information each  month.", "In our September 2013 report, we found that 23 percent of the 276 guard  files we reviewed (maintained by 11 of the 31 guard companies we  interviewed) lacked required training and certification documentation.
