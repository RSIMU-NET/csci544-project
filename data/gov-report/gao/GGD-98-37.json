The generic systems we studied are a national retail sales tax (RST), two types of value-added taxes (VAT), a flat tax, a personal consumption tax, and several versions of broad-based income taxes.

The basic design features we considered in contemplating alternative systems are the tax base (what is taxed); the types of taxpayers (whether individuals, businesses, or both are legally subject to tax); tax preferences (tax system provisions, including exemptions, deductions, credits, and multiple rates, directed at various economic and social goals); and the tax rate(s).

In this report, we focus on simplicity and administrability and do not analyze equity and efficiency. In deliberating on any changes to the current tax system, Congress would need to consider each of the four criteria.", "Designing a tax system that is superior on each of the four criteria is difficult because the criteria frequently conflict with one another and trade-offs must be made. For example, a tax system that provides credits to low-income individuals may be judged by some to be more equitable than a system without this feature. However, if including credits makes it necessary for more individuals to calculate their income and file tax returns, the tax system could become more complex for both taxpayers and tax administrators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Current System", "paragraphs": ["The federal tax system raised about $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 1995 through individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, various excise taxes on certain goods and services, and estate and gift taxes.

Wages, interest and dividend income, capital gains, and some types of business income, including that of sole proprietorships and partnerships, are taxed under the individual income tax. Individual income is taxed at graduated rates. Income earned by certain corporations is subject to a separate business income tax, also at different rates.", "The current system provides exemptions and different tax rates on savings and investment through a variety of special provisions, such as the preferential treatment of pensions, individual retirement accounts, life insurance, annuities, state and municipal bonds, and capital gains. The result is a hybrid income-consumption system of taxation that exempts some types of saving and investment from tax but taxes others.", "The current system includes numerous other tax preferences. Examples include the earned income credit; specific deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes; and exclusions of employer contributions for health insurance.", "Requirements for filing returns and performing other tax-related functions vary. All individuals with gross income above certain thresholds based on personal allowances and a standard deduction must file returns. Businesses have certain responsibilities beyond filing returns, including withholding and remitting employee income and payroll taxes, such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. Further, many businesses must send information returns to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and to individuals detailing income paid as wages, interest, and dividends.", "For more detailed descriptions of the federal income tax system, as well as its complexity and burdens for both taxpayers and tax administration, see appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Kinds of Alternative Tax Systems We Studied", "paragraphs": ["In the last several years, proposals for making fundamental changes to the tax system have been discussed by policymakers and tax experts in government, academia, and the private sector.

All types of businesses, not just retail businesses, are subject to the tax, and sales to both consumers and other businesses are taxable. With the credit method VAT, used by most industrialized countries, businesses claim a credit for tax paid on their purchases from other businesses, and with the subtraction method VAT, businesses deduct the amount of their purchases of goods and services from other businesses. Thus, under a VAT, businesses pay tax on the value they add to the goods and services they purchase.", "The flat tax discussed in this report would have both business and individual components. The business tax would be similar to the subtraction VAT, except that wages, salaries, and pensions would be deducted by businesses. Individuals would pay tax on wages, salaries, and pensions received above levels of allowances for themselves and their dependents. The same, single (flat) tax rate would apply to both individuals and businesses.", "A personal consumption tax would look much like the current individual income tax in that individuals would continue to pay tax on many kinds of income, such as wages, salaries, and interest and dividend payments received. It would differ in that borrowed funds would be included in the tax base, and funds that are saved or invested would be deducted. In most proposals, the personal consumption tax has been supplemented by a business tax designed to ensure that business purchases of goods and services for consumption, such as nonpension fringe benefits, would be taxed. Income tax reform options that would replace the current income tax with a more broadly based income tax have been discussed by the Department of the Treasury and others over the years. Instead of being replaced by a consumption tax system, the current tax system could be changed to a broad-based income tax system by, for example, eliminating preferences on certain types of income. Some proposals for reforming the income tax would also change the collection point, or level, of tax. Options we studied include levying taxes on businesses only, on businesses combined with a relatively simple individual tax, and primarily on individuals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Design Differences Among Alternative Tax Systems", "paragraphs": ["Table 1 lists four basic design features of the tax systems we studied: (1) the basis for taxation (income or consumption); (2) whether individuals, businesses, or both would be subject to tax; (3) whether tax preferences could exist for certain individuals, businesses, or goods and services; and (4) the rate structure for individuals (single or multiple rates)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "An Income or Consumption Tax Base", "paragraphs": ["One major difference in the design of alternative tax systems is whether the tax base is income or consumption.

Also, it generally requires that businesses depreciate their purchases of assets, that is, deduct the cost of assets over time rather than at the time they are purchased.", "Consumption-based tax systems differ from income-based tax systems in that they generally exempt from tax income from savings and investment. The national RST, VAT, flat tax, and personal consumption tax would achieve this exemption in different ways. Under a national RST, businesses would generally not pay tax on goods and services they buy. Under the VAT and the flat tax, businesses could immediately deduct purchases of goods and services, including purchases of plant and equipment, that they made from other businesses. Under a personal consumption tax, funds that are saved or invested would be deducted by individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Type of Taxpayer", "paragraphs": ["Another major design difference among alternative tax systems is who would be subject to tax. Consumption and income taxes could be levied on individuals, businesses, or both. By levying tax directly on individuals, a tax system can make distinctions among individuals or households to account for varying individual circumstances by, for example, allowing deductions and multiple rates. Alternatively, a tax system could focus only on businesses and thus require fewer taxpayers.", "The alternative consumption tax systems we considered differ from one another according to who would be taxed.", "The national RST and the VAT generally would only tax businesses. All types of businesses, including corporations, as well as partnerships and sole proprietorships, could be subject to tax. A national RST would differ from a VAT in that only businesses making retail sales would be subject to a national RST, while retail and wholesale businesses could be VAT taxpayers.", "The flat tax would collect much of the tax base from businesses but also would include a relatively simple individual tax.", "The personal consumption tax would continue to tax individuals. In conjunction with this tax, businesses could be subject to a supplemental tax.", "Similar to the national RST, VAT, or flat tax, an income tax could be designed to collect taxes from businesses rather than from individuals. Such an income tax could, for example, disallow business deductions for wages and free individuals from filing returns. It would collect tax on all or part of individuals\u2019 incomes where the incomes were generated and before they were paid.

These preferences could include special deductions, exemptions, and/or credits, as well as various tax rates on different types of income or goods and services.", "The types of taxpayers in a tax system would influence the type of preferences that could be allowed. Alternatives that tax individuals directly could include preferences designed to target specific groups of individuals. It would be more difficult for a tax system, such as a national RST or a VAT, that applied only to businesses to provide preferences for groups of individuals because businesses can apply different tax rates to goods and services but cannot distinguish among individuals.

All these options could include what is, in effect, a zero tax rate by providing a standard deduction or personal allowances.

Similarly, tax administration is affected both by the number of taxpayers and by the difficulty of carrying out administrative responsibilities related to each taxpayer. Table 2 shows the basic taxpayer and tax administration responsibilities we identified.", "In many respects, tax systems that are relatively easy for taxpayers to comply with will also be relatively easy to administer, and alternatives that are relatively burdensome for taxpayers will also be more difficult to administer. For instance, the more taxpayers that have to file returns, the more returns the administrators must process and accounts they must maintain. Likewise, a system\u2019s complexity resulting from exemptions, deductions, and other preferences could affect taxpayers and administrators similarly by increasing their respective burdens.", "However, in some instances, burden could be shifted from government administrators to taxpayers or from taxpayers to government administrators.

Even for the current income tax system, while IRS\u2019 administration costs are known, only very rough estimates exist for taxpayer compliance burden. This is because of the difficulty in separating accounting and recordkeeping costs for tax purposes from those that are incurred for other purposes and because taxpayers may not measure such costs. Estimates of taxpayer compliance burden for the current income tax vary widely, but all are many times larger than IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1998 budget of $7.8 billion.", "In a qualitative sense, changing from the current income tax system to an alternative system would potentially affect each of the basic responsibilities that taxpayers and tax administrators have. The following discussion of possible impacts on each area of responsibility precedes a table summarizing them and relating them to different tax systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Return Filing and Processing", "paragraphs": ["The tax systems we studied could differ significantly from each other in the number of returns filed by taxpayers and processed by administrators. Business-level tax systems generally have fewer filers than individual-level tax systems or systems that combine a business and individual tax. Business-level tax systems also generally require less information reporting.", "The current income tax system is relatively complex in the sense that some income is taxed at the individual level, some at the business level, and some at both levels. In 1995, taxpayers filed and IRS processed about 116 million individual tax returns, of which about 18 million reported income from a sole proprietorship. Another 6 million returns were filed by partnerships and corporations. Employers, investment institutions, and others sent IRS about 1.1 billion information returns, including withholding documents for wages and information on investment earnings.", "The alternative tax systems that would only tax businesses, such as the national RST or the VAT, would eliminate individual tax filing requirements. In addition, businesses would not be required to file information returns related to individuals. The total number of returns filed under these options would depend on how many businesses were subject to tax and on how frequently returns were required. For instance, while only businesses would be required to file tax returns under a national RST or a VAT, they could be required to file quarterly or monthly. Under a VAT, small businesses could be exempted, and under a national RST, wholesalers would not have to file tax returns.", "The alternatives that include a business tax and a relatively simple individual tax would likely require return filing by businesses and by some individuals. However, the number of individual returns filed and processed under these alternatives could be significantly less than under the current income tax system. Under a flat tax or one reformed income tax option, a \u201creturn-free\u201d filing system could be feasible because wages and salaries would be the only type of income subject to tax for many individuals. These employees would not have to file returns if employers withheld tax on wages during the year and made any necessary adjustments in withholding at the end of the year so that the amount of tax withheld equaled tax liability. If these alternatives also featured large standard deductions or personal allowances, the need for individual returns would be further reduced.", "Under the personal consumption tax or certain reformed income tax options we studied, large numbers of individual tax returns and information returns could still be required. The individual tax under these systems would be relatively complex in the sense that many types of funds or income would be taxable for individuals. Withholding correct amounts of tax would be more difficult for employers and other businesses because final tax liability would depend on the total amount of income or funds individuals receive from many sources. Unless withholding was extended to other types of taxable funds, individuals would likely be required to account for all types of taxable funds on their tax returns, and employers and businesses could be required to provide information returns to both individuals and tax administrators. Under a personal consumption tax, additional information returns related to borrowing and saving could be required, resulting in increased burden for the businesses required to file the returns and for tax administrators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Correct Tax Amounts and Assessing Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Because of differences in the four design features we discussed earlier, the tax systems we studied would differ in the burden experienced by taxpayers in determining their tax liability and in the costs to tax administrators of assessing compliance.", "In terms of the first design feature, the basis for taxation, consumption-based taxes, such as the national RST, VAT, flat tax, and personal consumption tax, could make determining tax liabilities by taxpayers and, correspondingly, tax administrators\u2019 assessment of taxpayers\u2019 compliance simpler in some respects than income-based taxes. This is because many difficulties of defining and recognizing income would be eliminated. To measure income from saving and investment as it is earned, taxpayers have to estimate costs for depreciation, account for income earned but not necessarily received as cash, and keep records on the value of assets over time. Also, taxpayers could have to decide if expenses are deductible or must be capitalized. Similarly, tax administrators must be able to verify the income measurements required under an income tax. In contrast, consumption tax liability can generally be accurately calculated by taxpayers and verified by tax administrators by using records of sales, purchases, and funds actually received.", "Whether an income or consumption tax system includes an individual tax and how complex that tax is would also affect the ease or difficulty of determining taxes and assessing compliance. Under the flat tax and one income tax option we considered, many individuals would face relatively few recordkeeping responsibilities and determining tax liability would be relatively simple, especially if taxes on wages were withheld by businesses. Tax administrators could largely administer these individual taxes by checking that proper amounts were withheld or by matching individual tax returns with information returns. Based on experience with the current income tax system, compliance would likely be high and few audits of individuals might be necessary. In contrast, under alternatives with more complex individual-level taxes, recordkeeping and tax determination burdens would likely be higher. For example, under some individual income tax options, individuals would have to keep records or receive information reports for many types of income. Under a personal consumption tax, individuals could be responsible for keeping records on borrowing and saving and including these amounts in their tax calculations. More extensive document matching and auditing would probably be needed to ensure a high level of compliance.", "Even though a national RST and a VAT tax the same base\u2014consumption\u2014and the same type of taxpayer\u2014businesses\u2014they could still affect assessing tax compliance differently. For a national RST and a subtraction VAT, administrators would have to rely on businesses\u2019 own records to verify that the proper tax had been paid. However, with a credit VAT, there would be a certain amount of checking available through records of other businesses; this is thought by some tax specialists to improve compliance. Also, based on state and international experience, many experts believe that including sales of all types in the tax base and allowing businesses to deduct or receive a tax credit for purchases from other businesses, as under a VAT or flat tax, would have some compliance advantages over a national RST. While including sales of all types in the tax base would require more recordkeeping and more taxpayers, it could better ensure that business purchases would not be overtaxed, taxes of sales to households would be reported, and a paper trail would be created so that compliance could be better assessed.", "Preferences\u2014that is, exemptions, deductions, credits, and multiple rates on goods and services\u2014could be part of any of the alternative tax systems we considered and could often complicate, but sometimes simplify, how tax liability is determined and verified. Preferences could force taxpayers to determine and tax administrators to verify whether an income or consumption item is taxable, nontaxable, deductible, or taxable at a different rate. The burdens associated with extensive use of preferences could include (1) more recordkeeping than otherwise, as was the case for the estimated 33 million individuals who reduced their tax liability by itemizing tax deductions for tax year 1993; (2) more time for determining and reporting tax liability; and (3) more tax planning by taxpayers. These burdens would require more audit time from tax administrators. On the other hand, in some instances, preferences given through exemptions could simplify taxpayers\u2019 burden. For example, if, as is commonly done with a VAT, large numbers of small businesses were exempted, they would not have to file returns or remit tax, thus easing their compliance burden. However, tax administrators would have to verify compliance by determining that only eligible taxpayers took the exemption.", "The fact that some tax systems\u2014the current income tax, versions of a reformed income tax, and the personal consumption tax\u2014have or could have multiple rates on individuals imposes little additional burden on taxpayers or tax administrators except to the extent that multiple rates encourage tax planning. Graduated rates alone have little effect on the actual tax calculation burden of taxpayers who can determine their tax liability through a tax table. Tax administrators still must verify that proper rates have been applied. However, multiple tax rates could encourage taxpayers to devote resources to tax planning in order to avoid high marginal rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Remittance and Collection", "paragraphs": ["The issues related to this third area of taxpayer and tax administration responsibilities we discuss\u2014tax remittances and collections\u2014may not differ greatly among the tax systems we considered except that widely different numbers of taxpayers would be responsible for remitting the taxes. If individuals, including the 18 million individuals owning sole proprietorships, no longer had to file tax returns as individuals but only in their capacity as business owners, nonbusiness collection issues related to them would disappear. Similarly, if a simpler tax reduced the problems tax administrators found during examinations, or if changes in withholding or other information reporting reduced the number of mismatches requiring follow-up, tax administrators would be less likely to assess additional taxes they would then have to collect.", "In its responsibility for collecting unpaid taxes from taxpayers who filed but did not pay the required tax or who did not file required returns, in fiscal year 1995, IRS\u2019 collection function disposed of millions of taxpayer delinquencies. Business delinquencies most commonly involved employment taxes.", "An issue of concern to administrators in the current tax system involves businesses, particularly small ones, getting into financial difficulty and using collected taxes as working capital rather than remitting them to the administrators. This problem could continue under many of the alternatives we considered, including a national RST or a VAT, and it could be more pervasive if the amounts of taxes to be collected and remitted by businesses were higher than under the current income tax system or state sales tax systems. The amounts could be higher because specific businesses would be processing federal taxes on their sales in addition to their payrolls and could face a greater temptation to retain some of the money for their own use. More frequent remitting and filing could reduce noncompliance but increase the burden on businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Taxpayer Questions and Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Although the universe of taxpayers who must file returns could change under the various alternatives, those who would still need to file would likely have questions that still needed to be answered. Even if a \u201creturn-free\u201d tax system were adopted, questions about individuals\u2019 involvement with the system would still arise. However, the probable reduction in the number of taxpayers, particularly individuals, under some of the alternatives and the removal of certain complex provisions, such as defining and recognizing income and providing deductions, would likely reduce the overall level of assistance needed.", "On the other hand, the more complications introduced under any alternative tax system, such those introduced with many preferences, the greater would be the need for tax administrator assistance in those areas. Greater assistance would also be needed for certain alternatives\u2019 distinctive complicating features, such as the personal consumption tax\u2019 reliance on borrowing and savings information.

Consumption taxes, while designed to encourage new saving, could tax existing saving when it is used for consumption; in general, existing saving would not be subject to tax again under the current income tax system. Special rules designed to exempt existing saving from tax could burden individuals with additional recordkeeping, filing, and tax determination requirements and create additional tax compliance issues for tax administrators. Another transition issue involves whether tax credits and other tax benefits already earned under the current tax should be made available under a new system. For example, what would happen to depreciation expenses for existing investments that businesses would have been able to deduct if the current tax were retained?

We also researched the literature for information that would enable us to analyze items, such as the amount of taxpayer recordkeeping and calculations that would be required in preparing tax returns, the type of information that would be included in the returns, and filing frequency. Finally, we pinpointed references in our previous reports to taxpayer compliance burden issues and assessed how these issues would be affected under new systems.", "We did similar work in accomplishing the last part of our second objective\u2014describing the alternative systems\u2019 potential impacts on tax administration. In reviewing the relevant literature, we specifically examined our previous reports covering various aspects of the tax systems and IRS. We also discussed specific administrative functions with tax specialists inside and outside IRS, reviewed data on IRS\u2019 recent administrative experiences from published sources and from within IRS, and studied summaries of state sales tax experiences. In analyzing the alternatives, we addressed (1) the administrative functions of returns processing, document matching and examination, collections, and taxpayer services; and (2) issues pertaining to transition, state tax administration, and international tax administration.", "In addition, to help accomplish the second objective, we interviewed officials of, and reviewed documents from, three state tax administrations and two state tax associations. The three states were New York, Florida, and New Mexico. We selected these three states based on suggestions from the Federation of Tax Administrators of states that were knowledgeable about issues we were examining. Because of the existence of actual sales tax systems in the various states and credit-invoice value-added taxes (VAT) in different countries, the collective experience with these taxes was more specific than the experience with other alternatives we were studying.", "Our intention in doing this study was to stress compliance and administration issues associated with the alternative systems using knowledge that we had accumulated throughout the 1980s and the 1990s. Our intention was not to examine other implications of the alternatives, such as their effect on the economy or on the distribution of the tax burden. Nor did we rank them against each other, assess the relative severity of the various implications, or weigh the administrative arguments and counterarguments regarding particular ideas.", "In identifying issues in as broad an arena as the potential impact of alternative tax systems on taxpayers and the potential implications for tax administration, we touched on some topics only briefly or not at all. For example, we did not do an in-depth analysis of the relationship of alternative systems to IRS\u2019 sweeping Tax Systems Modernization plans. This IRS effort, inextricably linked with streamlining whatever IRS-administered tax system might exist, regardless of whether it modified or replaced the current income tax, involves years of work and billions of dollars. However, basic tax administration functions, such as returns processing, document matching and examination, collections, and taxpayer services, would still be in place under a new system. We did not try to estimate the resources or costs involved in administering any of the systems, regardless of how the modernization effort proceeded.", "Similarly, our study did not focus on the relationship of individual alternatives to the particular problems of taxpayer compliance and tax system administration for specific types of entities. For example, this report does not concentrate on the special considerations that would apply under different alternatives regarding the financial services industry and nonprofit organizations. It does, however, describe how financial and nonprofit services might present administrative difficulties under a consumption tax.", "In focusing on the effects on the agency primarily responsible for tax administration, we did not analyze the impacts on other agencies. For instance, we did not examine how the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s taxation of imports and tracking of exports would be affected.

For instance, the complexity surrounding calculations and records needed for determining capital income is great, creating accompanying compliance and administrative costs. To determine capital income, taxpayers must separate capital gains from ordinary income, determine depreciation, and decide if expenses are deductible or must be capitalized. Complexity is also created by the tension between the ideal economic definition of income\u2014changes from one year to the next in asset value\u2014and the need to recognize income only when it is actually realized\u2014in a market transaction, such as a sale of stock.

The Little study used questionnaires to gather information on how much time individuals and businesses spent in 1983 to meet tax filing requirements. Individual costs were also measured through a diary study, in which taxpayers were asked to contemporaneously record costs as they occurred rather than recall costs. For businesses, burden categories included recordkeeping, getting advice and learning about filing requirements, obtaining materials, finding and using tax preparation services, preparing the tax return, and filing the tax return.

While several models were evaluated, the models ultimately chosen were those that could be easily updated by IRS rather than those that best predicted the survey results. The study noted that \u201cin a few instances significant accuracy was sacrificed by selecting a simplified model\u201d over a more complicated and accurate model. As a result, IRS estimates of recordkeeping burden for a business tax form are only dependent on the number of lines on the form and associated worksheets, and the estimated time for preparing a form is dependent on the number of lines on the form and worksheets, the number of references in the instructions to the Internal Revenue Code and accompanying regulations, and the number of attachments that are requested.

The estimates therefore rely on the underlying IRS methodology and are sensitive to the hourly dollar amount used. In theory, the dollar value chosen should represent the opportunity cost of spending an hour on tax matters; for individuals, for example, this could be an additional hour of wages, the value of an hour spent in a leisure activity, or the hourly amount that an individual would be willing to pay to not have to calculate taxes.", "Arthur Hall of the Tax Foundation, citing IRS and Office of Management and Budget historical data, recently estimated that taxpayers would spend about 5.3 billion hours complying with federal tax laws in 1996.

Based on his calculations, he asserted that at least 70 percent of this cost was due to the income tax. Applying this 70 percent to the total burden would make income tax compliance costs $157 billion for 1996.

In 1995 testimony, Payne estimated that taxpayer burden in terms of hours for 1995 was 10.2 billion hours. The increase in the estimate reflected, in part, increases in the number of taxpayers and an increase in total burden of 3.7 percent in each year from 1985 through 1995, based on findings in Blumenthal and Slemrod (1992) that individual burden had increased by 26 percent from 1982 to 1989.", "Recently, Slemrod offered what he described as \u201cback-of-the-envelope\u201d estimates of the compliance costs of the income tax, based on his views on the strengths and weaknesses of the existing evidence.

At that time, balance-due accounts are referred to as taxpayer delinquent accounts (TDA), and nonfiler cases are called taxpayer delinquency investigations (TDI). If telephone calls are not successful, IRS revenue officers must try to collect higher priority cases through personal visits to taxpayers and other collection enforcement actions. The cases may be resolved in many ways, ranging from taxpayers\u2019 voluntarily making full remittances to IRS\u2019 taking actions involving liens, levies, or seizures. As an example of the volume of activity that is involved, in fiscal year 1995, IRS issued about 800,000 notices of tax liens, sent out 2.7 million notices of levies, and made 11,000 seizures.", "IRS is involved with millions of TDA and TDI cases, although not all of them eventually need the attention of IRS collection officials. In fiscal year 1995, IRS disposed of 4.2 million TDAs and 1.7 million TDIs. About two-thirds of the accounts were for individuals, and about three-quarters of the business accounts related to employment tax returns. The business returns most commonly resulting in investigations were also employment tax returns. According to an IRS official, businesses holding employment taxes are tempted to keep them to overcome cash shortfalls.", "Our high-risk series 1995 report on IRS\u2019 accounts receivable illustrates how the problems in different IRS functions affect each other and therefore how a change in problem levels can affect a tax administrator\u2019s other operations. We pointed out that if returns processing did not properly account for a taxpayer\u2019s remittance, collection personnel may have to try resolving an invalid account receivable. Similarly, if an IRS compliance effort overstated a taxpayer\u2019s liability, it would make additional work for collection personnel with no guarantee of revenue generation.", "Concerning IRS\u2019 accounts receivable, we reported that individual taxpayers with primarily nonwage income owed about three-quarters of IRS\u2019 September 30, 1993, tax debt owed by individual taxpayers of $79.2 billion.

For instance, although IRS received many more calls than it was able to answer, IRS personnel staffing its toll-free system did respond to almost 38 million procedural, account, and tax law calls. Of these contacts, IRS disposed of over 29 million account calls concerning tax bills and notices, and it handled almost 8 million calls on tax law matters, which included technical tax information related to specific laws and regulations. IRS estimated that 8 different categories each covered almost 10 percent of the tax law calls, with each call being counted only once. These categories were (1) filing information; (2) dependents, exemptions, and filing status; (3) individual income; (4) individual business income and deductions; (5) capital gains and losses; (6) pensions and deferred compensation; (7) individual deductions and adjustments; and (8) tax computation, credits, and payments.

Refunds were especially problematic in 1995 when IRS enhanced its efforts to ensure the appropriateness of refund claims, resulting in millions of refunds being delayed and much adverse reaction. For the hits that did not involve refunds, IRS supplied us with lists of topics accessed by taxpayers for the years ended in June 1994 and June 1995. Other than general subjects, topics receiving more than 75,000 calls and thus ranking in the top 15 of the 1995 list were (1) electronic filing; (2) dependents; (3) medical and dental expenses; (4) earned income credit; (5) menu of filing requirements, filing status, and exemptions; (6) filing status; (7) which form\u20141040, 1040A, or 1040EZ; (8) business entertainment expense; (9) moving expenses; (10) child and dependent care credit; and (11) collection issues.", "In fiscal year 1995, IRS also provided over 4.2 million people with taxpayer education programs.

These proposals would significantly change tax rates, the tax base, and the level of tax (whether taxes are collected from individuals, businesses, or both). Some of the proposals would replace the federal income tax with some type of consumption tax levied only on businesses. Consumption taxes levied only on businesses include retail sales taxes (RST) and value-added taxes (VAT). The flat tax would also change the tax base to consumption but include both a relatively simple individual tax along with a business tax. A personal consumption tax, a consumption tax levied primarily on individuals, has also been proposed. Similar changes in the level at which taxes are collected could be made while retaining an income tax base.", "If Congress were to decide to fundamentally reform the tax system, it would have to make choices on several basic issues, all of which have ramifications for tax compliance and administration. First, should the tax base be income or consumption or, as under the current system, contain elements of both? Second, should taxes be levied on businesses, individuals, or both? Third, should the preferential tax treatment now given certain goods and services and types of income be maintained or eliminated, thereby affecting not only the economic and social purposes for which they were established but also the ease of tax compliance and administration? Fourth, if consumption is chosen as the appropriate base for taxation, what issues arise in making the transition to a new tax base, and how should certain types of consumption that are difficult to tax be treated? Fifth, how should a new system be designed to balance other goals for the tax system with the goals of minimizing administration costs and taxpayers\u2019 costs of compliance?", "This appendix provides some information to clarify these issues. To summarize, the fundamental difference between income and consumption taxes lies in the treatment of saving and investment. A broad-based income tax would tax all income, regardless of how it is used and regardless of its source. In particular, a broad-based income tax would tax income regardless of whether it is used for consumption or for saving and investment and would tax all income earned from saving and investment. In contrast, consumption taxes are designed to tax only income used for consumption, exempting from tax income used for saving and investment. Under certain conditions, this is equivalent to exempting income earned from saving and investment. As a result, different consumption taxes can in effect exempt saving and investment in different ways, so taxes that appear to be different may actually tax the same base\u2014consumption.", "Either income or consumption taxes could be levied on individuals, businesses, or both. The choice of level of tax (or collection point) alone does not determine the base of a tax or who will bear its economic burden. The choice does affect how equitable and how complicated a tax may be because it determines whether a tax can treat different individuals differently. A tax levied on individuals, whether income- or consumption-based, can tax different individuals at different rates or allow for adjustments such as standard deductions or exemptions for dependent children. Such provisions may make a tax system more equitable but may also make it more complicated. A tax levied solely on businesses (corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships) may be simpler to administer and less costly for taxpayers to comply with because the number of tax return filers may be substantially reduced and because only businesses would be burdened with tax-related recordkeeping and accounting tasks. Businesses may keep some of the same records for nontax purposes and are likely to be more efficient at recordkeeping and accounting than individuals. However, taxes levied solely on businesses are generally less able to make distinctions between individuals for reasons of equity.", "The current income tax is actually a hybrid tax because it exempts or lightly taxes some types of saving and investment from tax but fully taxes other forms. The current tax also grants preferential treatment to some types of consumption, such as employer-provided health insurance. A reformed tax system could treat saving and investment more uniformly, either by taxing all saving and investment (income tax) or by exempting all saving and investment (consumption tax). A reformed tax system could also eliminate the current tax code preferences for certain items of consumption, or it could maintain them.", "Any tax reform that replaces the current income tax with a consumption tax would have to address transition issues. In particular, the decision on whether to tax existing wealth could raise issues of fairness and administrability, as well as revenue. Moving to a consumption tax would also raise issues involving the taxation of some types of goods and services that could be difficult to tax from an administrative viewpoint. In particular, decisions would have to be made on whether to tax and how to tax financial services, housing, fringe benefits, and goods and services produced by governments and nonprofit organizations. Some of these items are also difficult to tax under an income tax.", "While some information is readily available on administration costs, policymakers have little quantitative evidence on compliance costs available to help them design new tax systems. Compliance costs are costs that individuals and businesses incur, in terms of both time and money directly spent, because of the requirements of the tax system. Compliance and administrative costs are interrelated because some of the tasks that need to be done to collect taxes can be done by the public sector or by the private sector. As a result, costs can be shifted from one sector to another. The distribution of compliance costs among different businesses and individuals is also important for understanding the full effects of a tax system. A major difficulty in measuring compliance costs is disentangling accounting and recordkeeping costs due to taxes from the costs that would have been incurred in the absence of the tax system. As a result, the reliability of the results of most compliance cost studies that have been done to date is limited."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Differences Between Income and Consumption Taxes", "paragraphs": ["The fundamental difference between income and consumption taxes lies in their treatment of saving and investment.

In the first year, the individual pays $20 in tax and saves the balance ($80). In the second year, the individual earns $8 in income from saving, and pays $1.60 in tax on this income, leaving $86.40 available for consumption. Because the earnings from saving were subject to income tax, the after-tax rate of return on the individual\u2019s saving is 8 percent ($6.40 of $80) instead of the 10-percent rate ($8 of $80) that would be earned without the income tax.", "The second column shows how the same individual would be taxed under a consumption tax that does not tax the earnings from saving. In the first year, the individual would be taxed on all income ($100), so as in the income tax case, $20 would be paid in tax and $80 would be available for saving. Once saved, the $80 would earn a 10-percent rate of return ($8), as in the income tax case, but the earnings from saving would not be taxed. Thus, in the second year, the individual has $80 in saving and $8 in earnings on saving available for consumption, for a total of $88. In comparison to the income tax, which reduced the after-tax return to saving, the rate of return on saving is not changed by the consumption tax, so incentives to consume today or save for the future are not affected by the tax.", "The third column shows how the individual would be taxed if a deduction from income for saving were allowed and all income was taxable when used for consumption. In the first year, the individual owes no tax because all income is saved. The $100 saved earns a 10-percent rate of return, so in the second year $110 would be available for consumption before tax. The individual would owe $22 in tax (20 percent of $110), leaving $88 for consumption after tax, the same amount as under the first consumption tax.", "While the two consumption taxes differ in the timing of the tax payment, as shown under this simple scenario, they would be equivalent in terms of the present value of the taxes owed. Under the first consumption tax, the individual owes $20 in tax the first year and none in the second; under the alternative consumption tax, the individual owes no tax in the first year and $22 in the second. In this case, having no tax liability in the first year would enable the person to save an additional $20 and therefore earn an additional $2, just enough to pay the additional tax in the second year.

Third, taxes can also distort economic behavior, leading to a misallocation of resources (excess burden).

For example, in the United States, businesses take on some responsibilities that encourage compliance by withholding tax on wages and providing information returns on payments of interest and dividend income. As a result, a high level of compliance on those forms of income may be achieved at lower administrative cost because matching information returns with tax returns can substitute for large numbers of audits.

Because public corporations must report financial statement income under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, some recordkeeping useful in calculating tax liability may be done for nontax purposes. For other businesses, calculating financial statement income may be required by banks or other potential lenders.

Reported compliance costs may be exaggerated if respondents include costs for nontax purposes. In addition, it is not known whether respondents did everything required to fully comply with the tax law. For example, if a particular tax rule was so complex that taxpayers did not even attempt to comply, respondents might truthfully answer that they spent no time or money to comply with the rule. The compliance costs as measured by the survey would be zero, so the results of the survey would not give an indication of just how complex the rule really is.

This could be done by including more types of income in the tax base and by eliminating some adjustments, credits, and deductions. Second, the calculation of income could include explicit inflation adjustments so that the tax base would better measure the real income of individuals and businesses.

That study and others have concluded that business income would be better measured if inventories, depreciation, interest income, interest expense, and capital gains were all indexed for inflation. Some analysts have stated that concern about added complexity was one reason why indexing was not adopted in the Tax Reform Act of 1986.", "An example can illustrate the income mismeasurement problem caused by inflation. Suppose a business bought equipment for $1,000 in 1985. Suppose also that the equipment was expected to be used for 10 years, and the business was allowed a deduction for depreciation over the course of the 10 years. The total amount deducted over time would add up to $1,000, the historical cost or purchase price of the equipment. Suppose further that the business could deduct $100 in each of the 10 years for depreciation. With inflation, the value of the deduction for depreciation erodes over time because the $1,000 is fixed in terms of 1985 dollars. In other words, a $100-deduction in 1995 would understate the real economic cost of operating the equipment because $100 was not worth as much in 1995 as it was in 1985. Thus, the income of the business would be overstated because its costs as calculated would not represent the real costs to the business.", "While inflation adjustments could correct this problem, the tax code has featured accelerated depreciation to indirectly offset inflation. If an inflation adjustment for the historical cost of the machine were made, the $1,000 historical cost figure would be increased to reflect inflation each year, and the deduction for depreciation would therefore be increased so that it reflected the real economic cost of operating the equipment. Instead, the tax code has allowed accelerated depreciation (allowing relatively larger deductions in the first few years after the asset is purchased) but kept historical basis calculations. While it is possible to develop accelerated depreciation schedules that offset the effects of a given rate of inflation, depreciation schedules would have to be changed to prevent renewed overstatement or understatement of income if the rate of inflation changes.", "A similar problem exists in the calculation of capital gains. As noted above, capital gains on the sale of assets are taxed when assets are sold. To calculate gain or loss, the sale price of the asset is compared to the price that was originally paid for the asset. Part of this gain may be the result of inflation. Assets that have lost value on an inflation-adjusted basis could show a gain when the effect of inflation is ignored. This problem is one justification for applying a preferential tax rate to capital gains income to, albeit imperfectly, offset the overstatement of income.

For example, currently taxpayers must use separate accounts for IRAs and other saving. A reformed income tax could treat savings more uniformly, eliminating the need for separate accounts and the associated recordkeeping.

Because businesses would no longer have the compliance burden of income tax withholding and information reporting under a national RST, the absence of withholding could tend to increase evasion opportunities, and the lack of information reporting could tend to decrease the perceived risks of detection. In addition, businesses would generally be responsible for remitting to the government more tax revenue than currently if an RST replaced existing individual and corporate income taxes. Small businesses in particular have been relatively noncompliant under the current system and might be tempted to use their collections as a source of business capital.", "A national RST\u2014particularly one with few exemptions\u2014could, however, be simpler than the current income tax because some existing sources of complexity, such as correctly measuring capital income, would be eliminated. A relatively simple tax could reduce intentional noncompliance by limiting opportunities for willful evaders to claim misunderstanding or ignorance of the rules. In that case, would-be evaders might be deterred by a greater risk of facing the stiffer penalties associated with intentional evasion. A simpler, clearer tax would also tend to reduce unintentional noncompliance resulting from misinterpretation of the rules. The income tax gap for large corporations, estimated at $24 billion for tax year 1992, was largely attributable to tax code complexity and ambiguity and illustrates the impact of these factors on noncompliance. In addition, businesses under a national RST could face a greater likelihood of being audited, if audit resources now devoted to individual filers were applied to businesses.", "The question of whether a national RST could be enforced to a greater degree than the current income tax on participants in the underground economy also requires careful consideration. The answer appears to depend on whether the registration system and associated enforcement efforts would be more effective than IRS\u2019 current nonfiler program at identifying and enlisting legal enterprises operating outside the tax system. Illegal enterprises, however, might tend to escape identification if, for example, their identification depended on cross-matching registration files against licensing records and business directories.", "One argument holds that a national RST would inherently capture more underground revenue than the income tax, because underground vendors who pay no income taxes would at least pay taxes on their purchases. However, the tax collection point would switch from income to purchases under a national RST.

Noncompliance issues encountered in state sales tax audits include those arising from a misunderstanding of system requirements as well as intentional evasion.", "Based on our, Treasury, and academic analyses, it appears that a relatively high national RST rate would tend to increase evasion incentives and associated administrative difficulties beyond those arising under state RSTs, assuming the perceived risks of detection by administrators remained constant. An RST also lacks certain deterrents to evasion found in a credit VAT (see app. VI). Some commentators have suggested that the resulting evasion would completely undermine a national system.However, we found no data allowing a quantified estimate of the impact of higher RST rates on noncompliance. The impact on the incidence of noncompliance would depend largely on the behavior of the more numerous small filers, while revenue effects would depend more on large filers, who account for most potential revenues, as noted above.", "Exemptions, such as for food or medicine, would add complexity and ambiguity to a national RST and could lead to both unintentional and intentional noncompliance. Vendors might inadvertently misapply an exemption to an item that fell in a gray area under the statutory criteria. For example, cashiers might face a decision on how to identify products with medicinal value if nonprescription drugs were exempt. In other cases, some business purchasers have intentionally misused their exemption certificates to acquire items for personal use, and some sellers have falsified certificates to inflate their apparent exempt sales. A study by the state of Florida estimated that about 5 percent of tax-free business purchases involved abuse or misuse of business exemption certificates, based on a sample limited to selected business sectors.", "Under a national RST, a relatively high tax rate could increase incentives for business exemptions abuse. For example, according to the Florida Department of Revenue, \u201cpaper\u201d businesses might be created solely as a means of obtaining business exemption certificates and avoiding taxes on purchases intended for personal use. Another potential difficulty is controlling the use of business exemptions for business purchases of services, as state experience indicates that distinguishing business purchases of services from personal purchases can be difficult. Also, business exemptions might be used to purchase tax-free fringe benefits for employees in lieu of an equivalent amount of wages, raising an issue now encountered under the income tax. This would tend to reduce the effective tax base inasmuch as the benefits would have been taxed if purchased directly by the employee.", "While a broad-based national RST could limit the noncompliance associated with exemptions, it could also complicate administration by involving more service providers, including many independent contractors, who have been particularly noncompliant under the current income tax. State RSTs do not broadly tax service providers. However, small vendors, particularly those operating on a cash basis, account for a large share of the noncompliance incidents detected with some state RSTs. Noncompliance among small vendors may be associated with state findings that they more often fail to keep adequate records of their taxable and exempt sales. Small vendors have also been known to use their tax collections as a source of business capital, even though the amount held in trust currently is relatively small compared with what it would be under a higher national rate. They may then go bankrupt or otherwise fail to repay the \u201cborrowed\u201d collections.", "Although small vendors could be responsible for a relatively small share of total taxable sales, their noncompliance might nonetheless cause significant revenue losses if it occurred frequently enough. Under the current system, IRS estimated in 1996 that noncompliant sole proprietorships were responsible for about $29 billion of the gross individual tax gap for tax year 1992. Further, IRS estimated in 1993 that sole proprietorships for tax year 1987 paid less than half their self-employment tax liabilities.", "Some administrative and compliance burdens, however, could be reduced under a broad-based national RST that included the service sector. For example, the requirement in many states to distinguish between untaxed repair labor and taxable repair parts would not apply at the federal level if repair services were taxed the same as repair parts.", "Another potential noncompliance problem under a national RST could mirror, at the international level, difficulties states have experienced with their interstate use taxes. The states have often been unable to enforce use taxes on sales to their residents from out-of-state vendors, including mail order sales. Similar problems could arise under a national RST. For example, absent an additional enforcement mechanism, residents could escape the U.S. sales tax by shopping in other countries, such as Canada or Mexico. Taxation of services obtained from foreign vendors through the Internet or other electronic media could raise another enforcement problem.", "Finally, special provisions in a national RST could raise additional enforcement considerations. For example, provisions to either limit taxation when previously taxed preenactment savings are consumed, exempt some level of foreign purchases, or rebate certain amounts to individuals could all have enforcement consequences.

The credit VAT is used as a major revenue source by most industrialized countries.", "With either the credit or subtraction VAT, businesses of all kinds would be responsible for reporting and remitting the tax to the tax agency, and most tax revenue would be remitted by only a relatively few taxpayers. If a VAT replaces the income tax, individual taxpayers would not be responsible for reporting or remitting taxes to the government. However, individuals generally would end up paying the tax, passed on to them by business.", "With a credit VAT, the tax is calculated on the difference between the tax the business collected on its sales and the tax it paid on business purchases, including capital goods.

If the VAT is complicated by exemptions or multiple rates, there can be substantial differences between the credit and subtraction VATs. A significant distinction between them is that only the credit VAT has the flexibility to readily accommodate a variety of rates or exemptions commonly used to offset regressivity, and even with the credit VAT, compliance and administration costs escalate if multiple rates or exemptions are used.", "Credits to individuals, such as the earned income credit, which is intended to offset taxes paid by the low-income working population, are not viable within either VAT system\u2014if either replaces the current income tax system.

A business exemption eliminates the tax by categorizing the business as exempt. However, if taxes have been paid by the exempt business to other businesses in the production and distribution chain, the business would not have a way to recover them. This problem is addressed through a mechanism known as zero-rating, which allows these businesses to be refunded the taxes they paid to others. Zero-rating removes the tax by charging a zero rate\u2014that is, no tax\u2014on the business\u2019 sales and still allows the business to claim credit for taxes it paid on goods and services used in the business\u2019 production or distribution.", "Three ways used for tax exemption with VATs are as follows: exemption by zero-rating specific goods and services at the retail or final level, such as food or medical services; exemption for a specific size of business, such as businesses with less than a certain amount in gross receipts per year; and exemption by zero-rating goods that are exported.", "The first of these exemptions is feasible with either the credit or subtraction VAT if (1) it is applied at the retail or final level or (2) all of a firm\u2019s sales are zero-rated.

Because a credit VAT is collected at the point where value is added in the production chain, businesses or goods or services can be omitted from the tax at any point in the chain without loss of revenue. A subtraction VAT is much less flexible for making such adjustments except at the retail level, where an item simply can be untaxed.", "As we pointed out in 1993, the second type of exemption commonly used may eliminate the burden for small businesses and lessen the cost of administration. Most European VATs were established with small business exemptions. Typically, in countries with these VATs, small businesses do not have to file returns or remit tax if their gross receipts are low, for example, less than $25,000 per year. They may, however, have to register with a tax agency. Exempt small businesses in these countries also lose the opportunity to claim the credit for the tax they pay to other businesses in the production and distribution chain. The same kind of exemption may be used to exempt a particular type of business, such as banks, from a VAT. In some cases, however, businesses have joined the system, if the option is available, preferring to pay the tax so they can take the credit for taxes paid to other businesses.", "An important feature of a VAT is border adjustments for exports, the third type of exemption. Taxing items at their place of use, rather than their place of production, is known as the destination principle. Under this principle, taxes are imposed on imports and rebated on exports. Under either a credit or a subtraction VAT, businesses that export goods can claim credit for taxes they paid on these goods by zero-rating the exported goods.

For this reason, other countries\u2019 experiences may be less applicable in predicting future U.S. experience with such things as tax evasion, tax collection, or fraud.

Because VATs are collected by businesses, individuals do not have to file, thus eliminating their compliance burden. Some estimates of compliance costs for businesses are 2.5 percent of tax revenue in Sweden, 3.7 percent in the United Kingdom, and 4 percent in the Netherlands. The European VATs, however, have multiple rates and are less simple and more costly to operate than an ideal VAT.

However, there is not general agreement in the tax literature as to the effectiveness of this approach in preventing noncompliance. Theoretically, a tax agency could require that all pertinent documents be turned over to it for audit purposes, but the sheer volume of data makes it unlikely that a tax agency would attempt to match documents.

Under a consumption tax, the original purchase price of an asset is irrelevant for tax calculations because all sale proceeds are subject to tax, so records related to the original purchase would not have to be kept."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Housing", "paragraphs": ["One of the more difficult issues for consumption taxation is the taxation of consumer durable goods. These goods can serve both as consumption goods and as a form of saving. A significant example of this type of good is owner-occupied housing, which generates consumption services for the owner and is a major investment for many individuals. If housing was treated like other saving or investment under a personal consumption tax, the purchase of the house would be deductible as saving and the income from the investment would then be taxable. In the case of owner-occupied housing, the income from the investment is the value of the consumption services received by the owner\u2014the amount the owner would pay to rent the house. However, since there is no rent transaction for owner-occupied housing, a value would have to be imputed either through appraisals or through some approximation method. Allowing a deduction for the purchase of housing and ignoring the rental value of housing would undertax owner-occupied housing relative to rental housing and other forms of consumption.", "Most discussions of personal consumption taxes have supported a \u201ctax prepayment\u201d treatment for owner-occupied housing, or a modified version of this approach. Under the tax prepayment approach, consumption tax would be paid when the house is purchased because the amount borrowed for the mortgage and the funds withdrawn from accounts for a down payment would be taxable. The imputed rental value of the housing services would not be taxed, and only the capital gain rather than the entire sale price of the house would be taxable if the house was sold. While this approach may be easier to administer than taxing imputed rent, it would require a large one-time tax payment. A modification of this approach would levy tax only on the down payment, but not allow a deduction for repayment of mortgage principal or interest, reducing the one-time tax payment. However, this modification would treat mortgage debt and interest payments differently than other debt and interest, and rules to define different types of debt would be necessary, as under current law.", "Before 1997 changes to the income tax, more homeowners than afterward were required to keep records on their purchases and sales of homes over their lifetime in order to calculate any capital gains tax they may have had upon sale. Recordkeeping requirements under a personal consumption tax would depend on the approach taken. If the modification of the prepayment approach was chosen, recordkeeping requirements for owner-occupied housing could be similar to those in effect before the recent changes in the law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Job and Business Expenses", "paragraphs": ["Some items that currently require detailed taxpayer recordkeeping would remain issues because they concern determining whether certain expenditures are legitimate business expenses or personal consumption.

For example, businesses would not have to keep records according to accrual accounting principles for tax purposes.

Thus, taxpayers would not have to distinguish between expenditures that can be deducted immediately and those that must be capitalized and depreciated over time. However, businesses would probably still calculate depreciation on capital assets for financial statements and other business purposes.", "However, unlike the VAT or the business tax component of the flat tax, a cash flow tax would include financial transactions in the base of the tax. Borrowed funds would be included and repayments of loans and interest would be deductible. A VAT would be simpler than a cash flow tax in this sense because fewer transactions would have to be accounted for in computing tax liability.

Taxpayers who sell assets would have to keep records on the proceeds of the sale, but all the proceeds of the sale would be taxable, not only capital gain or loss.", "More generally, businesses and individuals would not have to differentiate between the return of capital (original amounts invested or saved) and the return on capital (income earned from saving or investment). Under an income tax, the return of capital is not taxed, but the income earned from capital is taxed. Under a consumption tax, this distinction is not necessary because saving and investment is deducted immediately and both the return of capital and the return on capital are subject to tax.", "One area in which a personal consumption tax would be simpler than a reformed income tax involves the need to make adjustments for inflation. Many analysts believe that inflation adjustments should be made in the income tax because the measurement of income can be significantly distorted when inflation is high. The current income tax does not have such adjustments explicitly and requiring them might significantly complicate the income tax. In contrast, a personal consumption tax would not need to include inflation adjustments.

First, expanding information reporting to include loans may be necessary since loans would be included in the tax base. Second, funds that are saved would also generate a deduction, so it may also be useful for compliance reasons to require information reporting on amounts saved.

However, some relevant evidence does exist from experience with the current income tax because it shares many features with a personal consumption tax. For example, the proper reporting of sales of assets would be a major concern because the incentive to underreport sales is much less under the income tax than it would be under the personal consumption tax. Under the consumption tax, the entire proceeds of the sale would be subject to tax, not just the gain. In its 1984 review of a consumption tax, the Treasury Department (citing IRS estimates) reported that 40 percent of capital gains transactions were not reported.", "Because many types of income now subject to tax and information reporting would also be taxed under a personal consumption tax, information reporting and the matching of information returns with tax returns could continue to be a major activity for tax administration. To ensure sufficient compliance, information reporting could be expanded to include borrowed funds and amounts saved in qualified accounts. While information reporting would reduce the need to audit for underreported borrowing and overreported deductions for saving, an expansion in the number of information returns would clearly increase administration costs.", "Such expanded information reporting might improve the identification of delinquent nonfilers. Self-employed individuals without interest or dividend income are less likely to be identified to IRS now through information returns, and therefore, information returns on borrowed funds and repayment of debt could identify these individuals. This could create more taxpayer delinquent accounts and investigations for the tax administrator, but it could also decrease the number of delinquent nonfilers and increase amounts collected from nonfilers.", "The personal consumption tax and the business cash flow tax would offer some simplifications that would ease enforcement relative to the current tax. For example, (1) ascertaining whether repayment of debt is principal or interest, (2) determining whether business purchases of goods and services should be deductible or represent the acquisition of an asset that should be depreciated over time, or (3) determining the type of interest expense may not be necessary. As a result of these simplifications, audit focus under a personal consumption tax can concentrate on the underreporting of cash inflows and overstatement of deductions.", "As mentioned above, determining whether certain expenditures are legitimate business expenses or personal consumption would remain issues under a consumption tax.

Seventy-nine percent of the questions involve procedural questions, refunds, notices, and other account issues, and 4 percent concern filing information and filing status and rules for dependents and other exemptions.

For example, individuals who saved by depositing funds in bank or other accounts would pay consumption tax on all funds when they are withdrawn. Individuals who saved by purchasing stock or other assets and who sold the assets after the consumption tax was implemented would have to pay tax on all sale proceeds, rather than only the gain from the sale. Individuals who saved by lending funds to others or purchasing bonds would have to pay consumption tax on both principal and interest income paid to them by borrowers. If an income tax were retained, these savers would not have to pay income tax on the original amounts deposited, used to purchase assets, or lent. Thus, a consumption tax could be particularly burdensome for individuals who saved before the switch from the income tax to the consumption tax. In contrast, borrowers would be able to deduct repayments for many types of loans in full under the consumption tax; if the income tax was retained, they could not deduct repayments of principal and might not be able to deduct payments of interest.", "If policymakers want to limit such windfall gains and losses, transition rules would have to be devised and administered so that saving done before the switch was treated as it would have been treated under the income tax. Under such rules, distinctions between the return to saving (taxed) and the return of saving (not taxed) would have to continue to be made. In addition, the forms of saving that are granted preferential tax treatment under the current tax (certain IRA accounts and pensions) would have to be separately tracked. All distributions from these accounts should be subject to tax because contributions were originally deducted. Similar distinctions for debt issued before and after the switch would have to be made, and administrators would have to be able to track assets shifted among different accounts.", "Businesses with assets that have not been fully depreciated and with other unused tax deductions and credits could stand to lose substantially without transition rules. Since all businesses file returns under a cash flow tax, the tax could be used for transition. One option would be to allow businesses to continue to deduct depreciation on existing assets as they would have under the income tax. This would require the continuation of recordkeeping and auditing that is done currently. However, businesses would still face a windfall loss because the value of existing assets would fall relative to new assets, which could be deducted immediately. This situation creates incentives for the current owners of assets to sell; new owners could deduct the full cost immediately as new investment. Developing rules to prevent this and administering them could be difficult.", "Another option would be to allow businesses to deduct the remaining value of their not fully depreciated assets immediately or over a few years. This type of transition would limit the incentive to sell assets and eliminate the need to keep depreciation records and audit this issue in the future.
