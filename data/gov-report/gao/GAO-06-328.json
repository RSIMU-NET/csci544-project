In addition to the 40 previously reported weaknesses for which IRS has not completed actions, GAO identified new information security control weaknesses that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IRS's financial information systems and the information they process. For example, IRS has not implemented effective electronic access controls related to network management, user accounts and passwords, user rights and file permissions, and logging and monitoring of security-related events. In addition, it has not effectively implemented other information security controls to physically secure computer resources, and to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities and unauthorized changes to system software. Collectively, these weaknesses increase the risk that sensitive financial and taxpayer data will be inadequately protected against disclosure, modification, or loss, possibly without detection, and place IRS operations at risk of disruption. A key reason for IRS's weaknesses in information security controls is that it has not yet fully implemented an information security program to ensure that effective controls are established and maintained.

For example, the agency  did not always implement the use of complex passwords on its Windows  servers. It also set the password expiration on a Windows server to a value  inconsistent with its policy, and did not adequately control the storage of  passwords on its systems. For example, instead of using encryption, IRS  stored clear text passwords in readable form at one of the sites.

These methods include specifying security roles and  responsibilities in various policy manuals available to employees and  contractors, providing security awareness training during new hire  orientations, distributing security awareness bulletins and brochures, and  creating information security poster boards. As reported by TIGTA in its  2005 FISMA report, security awareness training was provided to all IRS  employees and contractors.", "Despite the agency\u2019s efforts in providing security awareness training, it did  not always provide specialized training to individuals with significant  information security responsibilities. In its fiscal year 2005 FISMA  submission, IRS reported it has 2,737 employees with significant  information technology security responsibilities, yet only 300 (11 percent)  of those employees received specialized training (see fig. 2).", "IRS did not always provide specialized training for its contractor personnel  with information security responsibilities. For example, it did not provide  Computer Security Incident Response Center contractors with specialized  training. IRS has taken some key steps to address this area, including  establishing a working group to improve its training program. Without  sufficiently trained security personnel, security lapses are more likely to  occur and could contribute to further information security weaknesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tests and Evaluations of Control Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Another key element of an information security program is the testing and  evaluation of systems to ensure that they are in compliance with security  policies and that those policies and controls are both appropriate and  effective. This type of oversight is a fundamental element because it  demonstrates management\u2019s commitment to the security program, reminds  employees of their roles and responsibilities, and identifies and mitigates  areas of noncompliance and ineffectiveness. Although control tests and  evaluations may encourage compliance with security policies, the full  benefits are not achieved unless the results improve the security program.  Analyzing the results of security reviews provides security specialists and  business managers with a means of identifying new problem areas,  reassessing the appropriateness of existing controls, and identifying the  need for new controls. FISMA requires that the frequency of tests and  evaluations be based on risks, but occur no less than annually.  Furthermore, IRS policy requires periodic testing and evaluation of the  effectiveness of information security policies and procedures.", "Although IRS had conducted system tests and evaluations for the three  systems we reviewed, its tests did not identify key security vulnerabilities.  For example:  At one of the IRS sites we visited, one system\u2019s security test and  evaluation report did not identify any vulnerabilities. However, during  our review, we identified several vulnerabilities, including unpatched  software.", "At the same site, IRS did not detect control deficiencies during its test  and evaluation of the mainframe. For example, IRS was not using  standardized naming conventions for its datasets and was not logging  changes to software on the mainframe. These weaknesses could have  been detected and corrected using the results of effective security tests  and evaluations.", "In addition, in its 2005 FISMA report, TIGTA reported that security tests  and evaluations for major applications did not comply with NIST  standards. Tests did not include all system components, such as  encryption, telecommunication links, and user account management.

They  assist agencies in identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and monitoring the  progress in correcting security weaknesses that are found in information  systems. According to OMB Circular A-123, agencies should take timely  and effective action to correct deficiencies that they have identified  through a variety of information sources. To accomplish this, remedial  action plans should be developed for each deficiency, and progress should  be tracked for each. IRS policy also requires a process for ensuring  remedial action to address any significant deficiencies.", "According to TIGTA, IRS has made noteworthy progress in the area of  tracking remedial actions. In its 2005 FISMA report, TIGTA reported that it  was able to verify that IRS\u2019s remedial action plans included weaknesses  from various reviews and were tailored to specific applications.", "Although IRS had developed remedial plans to address information  security weaknesses identified through previous reviews, the plans we  reviewed were incomplete. All four remedial plans were missing certain  key elements. For example, none of the four plans specified the funds  required to correct identified weaknesses. In addition, three of the plans  did not identify scheduled completion dates for correcting or mitigating  identified weaknesses. Further, the fourth plan was outdated because it  included scheduled completion dates that had already passed. For  example, weaknesses that were still considered \u201copen\u201d in June 2005 had  scheduled completion dates of April 2005. IRS officials explained that the  remedial plans were a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d since the documents were not  due to be submitted to OMB until September 2005.

Such analyses can pinpoint vulnerabilities that  need to be eliminated so that they will not be exploited again. Problem and  incident reports can provide valuable input for risk assessments, can help  in prioritizing security improvement efforts, and can be used to illustrate  risks and related trends for senior management.", "IRS has implemented an incident handling program and established the  Computer Security Incident Response Center in 2001. The center\u2019s mission  is to detect, react, and respond to computer security incidents targeting the  IRS enterprise information infrastructure. It provides assistance and  guidance in both cyber and physical incident response and uses a  centralized approach to incident handling across IRS. The agency has also  defined procedures for detecting, responding to, and reporting computer  and network security incidents, and has created several detailed incident  detection and response procedures outlining the roles and responsibilities  of center personnel and event analysis.

Also, the site\u2019s business  resumption plans did not include UNIX and Windows systems. Although  IRS has various initiatives under way to improve continuity of operations,  these and other shortcomings still exist. Specifically, IRS has not procured  and installed UNIX-based hardware and equipment for processing  applications and data at its disaster recovery hot-site\u2014an alternate  processing location that can be used in case of an emergency.
