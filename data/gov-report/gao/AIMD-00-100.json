There are growing concerns about gaps in the Medicare program, most notably the lack of outpatient prescription drug coverage, which may leave Medicare\u2019s most vulnerable beneficiaries with high out-of-pocket costs that they may not be able to afford. In 1996, almost a third of Medicare beneficiaries lacked prescription drug coverage. The remaining two-thirds had at least some drug coverage through other sources\u2014most commonly employer- sponsored health plans. Although the proportion of beneficiaries who had drug coverage rose between 1995 and 1996, recent evidence indicates that this trend of expanding drug coverage is unlikely to continue. Moreover, the burden of prescription drug costs falls most heavily on the Medicare beneficiaries who lack drug coverage or those who have substantial health care needs. In 1999, an estimated 20 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had drug costs of $1,500 or more\u2013a substantial sum for those lacking some form of insurance to subsidize the purchase.", "At the same time, however, long-term cost pressures facing the Medicare program are considerable. There appears to be an emerging consensus that substantive financing and programmatic reforms are necessary to put Medicare on a sustainable footing for the future. These fundamental program reforms are vital to reducing the program\u2019s growth, which threatens to absorb ever-increasing shares of the nation\u2019s budgetary and economic resources. Thus, proposals to help seniors with the costs of prescription drugs should be carefully crafted to avoid further erosion of the projected financial condition of the Medicare program, which, according to its trustees, is already unsustainable in its present form.", "On the one hand, you must grapple with the hard choices involved in making the Medicare program sustainable for future generations. On the other, you are faced with the plight of many seniors who cannot afford the medical miracles that may be achieved through access to pharmaceutical advances. Expanding Medicare\u2019s benefit package could address the latter. However, a recent study suggests that such an expansion could add between 7.2 and 10 percent annually to Medicare\u2019s costs.Increased spending of that magnitude would only exacerbate the tough choices that will be required to put Medicare on sustainable footing for the future.", "You are considering these issues at a historic crossroad. After nearly 30 years of deficits, the combination of hard choices and remarkable economic growth has led to a budget surplus. We appear\u2014at least for the near future\u2014to have slain the deficit dragon. In its most recent projections, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) shows both unified and on-budget surpluses throughout the next 10 years. While this is good news and even superior to the projections made last year, it does not mean that hard choices are a thing of the past. First, it is important to recognize that by their very nature projections are uncertain. This is especially true today because, as CBO notes, it is too soon to tell whether recent boosts in revenue reflect a major structural change in the economy or a more temporary divergence from historical trends. Indeed, CBO points out that assuming a return to historical trends and slightly faster growth in Medicare would change the on-budget surplus to a growing deficit. This means we should treat surplus predictions with caution. Current projected surpluses could well prove to be fleeting, and thus appropriate caution should be exercised when creating new entitlements that establish permanent claims on future resources.", "Moreover, while the size of future surpluses could exceed or fall short of projections, we know that demographic and cost trends will, in the absence of meaningful reform, drive Medicare spending to levels that will prove unsustainable for future generations of taxpayers. Accordingly, we need to view this period of projected prosperity as an opportunity to address the structural imbalances in Medicare, Social Security, and other entitlement programs before the approaching demographic tidal wave makes the imbalances more dramatic and possible solutions more painful.", "As the foregoing suggests, the stakes associated with Medicare reform are high for the program itself and for the rest of the federal budget, both now and for future generations. Current policy decisions can help us prepare for the challenges of an aging society in several important ways: (1) reducing public debt to increase national savings and investment, (2) reforming entitlement programs to reduce future claims and free up resources for other competing priorities, and (3) establishing a more sustainable Medicare program that delivers effective and affordable health care to our seniors.", "Medicare prescription drug coverage in the context of larger Medicare reform. Other proposals that focus only on increasing access to affordable prescription drugs are also being considered. These proposals would either subsidize prescription drug coverage or lower prices faced by beneficiaries without coverage. To put these proposals in context, I will discuss the factors contributing to the growth in prescription drug spending and efforts to control that growth. I will also discuss design and implementation issues to be considered regarding proposals to improve seniors\u2019 access to affordable prescription drugs. I then will repeat my message about the Medicare program\u2019s current financial condition and its long term sustainability.", "But before I turn to the specifics, let me reiterate that although people want unfettered access to health care, and some have needs that are not being met, health care costs compete with other legitimate priorities in the federal budget, and their projected growth threatens to crowd out future generations\u2019 flexibility to decide which of these competing priorities will be met. Thus, in making important fiscal decisions for our nation, policymakers need to consider the fundamental differences between wants, needs, and what both individuals and our nation can afford. This concept applies to all major aspects of government, from major weapons system acquisitions to issues affecting domestic programs. It also points to the fiduciary and stewardship responsibility that we all share to ensure the sustainability of Medicare for current and future generations within a broader context of also providing for other important national needs and economic growth. We have an opportunity to use our unprecedented economic wealth and fiscal good fortune to address today\u2019s needs but an obligation to do so in a way that improves the prospects for future generations. This generation has a responsibility to future generations to reduce the debt burden they will inherit, to provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and affordable.

Private insurance coverage for prescription drugs has likely contributed to the rise in spending, because insured consumers are shielded from the direct costs of prescription drugs. In the decade between 1988 and 1998, the share of prescription drug expenditures paid by private health insurers rose from almost a third to more than half. (See fig. 1.) The development of new, more expensive drug therapies\u2014 including new drugs that replace old drugs and new drugs that treat disease more effectively\u2014also contributed to the drug spending growth by boosting the volume of drugs used as well as the average price for drugs used. The average number of new drugs entering the market each year rose from 24 at the beginning of the 1990s to 33 now. Similarly, biotechnology advances and a growing knowledge of the human immune system are significantly shaping the discovery, design, and production of drugs. Advertising pitched to consumers has also likely upped the use of prescription drugs. A recent study found that the 10 drugs most heavily advertised directly to consumers in 1998 accounted for about 22 percent of the total increase in drug spending between 1993 and 1998.Between March 1998 and March 1999, industry spending on advertising grew 16 percent to $1.5 billion.

Furthermore, Medigap premiums have been increasing in recent years.

Additionally, the 1995 data show that drug coverage is slightly higher among those with poorer self-reported health status.

It could not effectively influence or steer utilization because it does not include incentives that would encourage beneficiaries to make cost-conscious decisions. The second approach would draw from private sector experience in negotiating price discounts from manufacturers in exchange for shifting market share. Some plans and insurers employ PBMs to manage their drug benefits, including claims processing, negotiating with manufacturers, establishing lists of drug products that are preferred because of efficacy or price, and developing beneficiary incentive approaches to control spending and use.

Although this may eventually prove necessary, such additional financing should be considered as part of a broader initiative to ensure the program\u2019s long-range financial integrity and sustainability.", "What concerns us most is that devoting general funds to the HI trust fund may be used to extend HI\u2019s solvency without addressing the hard choices needed to make the whole Medicare program more sustainable in economic or budgetary terms. Increasing the HI trust fund balance alone, without underlying program reform, does nothing to make the Medicare program more sustainable\u2014that is, it does not reduce the program\u2019s projected share of GDP or the federal budget. From a macroeconomic perspective, the critical question is not how much a trust fund has in assets but whether the government as a whole has the economic capacity to finance all Medicare\u2019s promised benefits\u2014both now and in the future. We must keep in mind the unprecedented challenge facing future generations in our aging society. Relieving them of some of the financial burden of today\u2019s commitments would help preserve some budgetary flexibility for future generations to make their own choices. portion of Medicare, which is projected to grow even faster than HI in coming decades, assuming no additional SMI benefits.", "The issue of the extent to which general funds are an appropriate financing mechanism for the Medicare program would remain important under financing arrangements that differed from those in place in the current HI and SMI structures. For example, under approaches that would combine the two trust funds, a continued need would exist for measures of program sustainability that would signal potential future fiscal imbalance. Such measures might include the percentage of program funding provided by general revenues, the percentage of total federal revenues or gross domestic product devoted to Medicare, or program spending per enrollee. As such measures were developed, questions would need to be asked about the appropriate level of general revenue funding. Regardless of the measure chosen, the real question would be what actions should be taken when and if the chosen cap is reached."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Fiscal Policy Choices", "paragraphs": ["Beyond reforming the Medicare program itself, maintaining an overall sustainable fiscal policy and strong economy is vital to enhancing our nation\u2019s future capacity to afford paying benefits in the face of an aging society. Decisions on how we use today\u2019s surpluses can have wide-ranging impacts on our ability to afford tomorrow\u2019s commitments.", "As we know, there have been a variety of proposals to use the surpluses for purposes other than debt reduction. Although these proposals have various pros and cons, we need to be mindful of the risk associated with using projected surpluses to finance permanent future claims on the budget, whether they are on the spending or the tax side. Commitments often prove to be permanent, while projected surpluses can be fleeting. For instance, current projections assume full compliance with tight discretionary spending caps. Moreover, relatively small changes in economic assumptions can lead to very large changes in the fiscal outlook, especially when carried out over a decade. In its January 2000 report,CBO compared the actual deficits or surpluses for 1986 through 1999 with the first projection it had produced 5 years before the start of each fiscal year. Excluding the estimated impact of legislation, CBO stated that its errors in projecting the federal surplus or deficit averaged about 2.4 percent of GDP in the fifth year beyond the current year. For example, such a shift in 2005 would mean a potential swing of about $285 billion in the projected surplus for that year.", "Although most would not argue for devoting 100 percent of the surplus to debt reduction over the next 10 years, saving a good portion of our surpluses would yield fiscal and economic dividends as the nation faces the challenges of financing an aging society. Our work on the long-term budget outlook illustrates the benefits of maintaining surpluses for debt reduction. Reducing the publicly held debt reduces interest costs, freeing up budgetary resources for other programmatic priorities. For the economy, running surpluses and reducing debt increase national saving and free up resources for private investment. These results, in turn, lead to stronger economic growth and higher incomes over the long term.", "Over the last several years, our simulations illustrate the long-term economic consequences flowing from different fiscal policy paths.Our models consistently show that saving all or a major share of projected budget surpluses ultimately leads to demonstrable gains in GDP per capita. Over a 50-year period, GDP per capita is estimated to more than double from present levels by saving all or most of projected surpluses, while incomes would eventually fall if we failed to sustain any of the surplus. Although rising productivity and living standards are always important, they are especially critical for the 21st century, for they will increase the economic capacity of the projected smaller workforce to finance future government programs along with the obligations and commitments for the baby boomers\u2019 retirement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Updating the Medicare benefit package may be a necessary part of any realistic reform program to address the legitimate expectations of an aging society for health care, both now and in the future. Expanding access to prescription drugs could ease the significant financial burden some Medicare beneficiaries face because of outpatient drug costs. Such changes, however, need to be considered as part of a broader initiative to address Medicare\u2019s current fiscal imbalance and promote the program\u2019s longer-term sustainability. Balancing these competing concerns may require the best from government-run programs and private sector efforts to modernize Medicare for the future. Further, the Congress should consider adequate fiscal incentives to control costs and a targeting strategy in connection with any proposal to provide new benefits such as prescription drugs. expectation and the future projected growth of the program, some additional revenue sources may in fact be a necessary component of Medicare reform. However, it is essential that we not take our eye off the ball. The most critical issue facing Medicare is the need to ensure the program\u2019s long range financial integrity and sustainability.

Care must be taken to ensure that any potential expansion of the program be balanced with other programmatic reforms so that we do not worsen Medicare\u2019s existing financial imbalances.", "Current budget surpluses represent both an opportunity and an obligation. We have an opportunity to use our unprecedented economic wealth and fiscal good fortune to address today\u2019s needs but an obligation to do so in a way that improves the prospects for future generations. This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future generations to reduce the debt burden they will inherit, to provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively large. National saving pays future dividends over the long term, but only if meaningful reform begins soon. Entitlement reform is best done with considerable lead-time to phase in changes and before the changes that are needed become dramatic and disruptive. The prudent use of the nation\u2019s current and projected budget surpluses combined with meaningful Medicare and Social Security program reforms can help achieve both of these goals.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
