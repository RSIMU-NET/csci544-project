Working alongside federal players, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Guard Bureau, EMAC members deployed an unprecedented level of assistance in response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Although EMAC played a critical role in our nation's response to these hurricanes, the magnitude of these events revealed limitations. GAO was asked to (1) examine how the use of EMAC has changed since its inception; (2) assess how well existing policies, procedures, and practices facilitate collaboration; and (3) evaluate the adequacy of the EMAC network's administrative capacity to achieve its mission. GAO examined documents and interviewed officials from 45 federal, state, and local agencies and offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since its inception in 1995, the EMAC network has grown significantly in size, volume, and the type of resources it provides. EMAC's membership has increased from a handful of states in 1995 to 52 states and territories today, and EMAC members have used the compact to obtain support for several types of disasters including hurricanes, floods, and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The volume and variety of resources states have requested under EMAC have also grown significantly. For example, after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, New York requested 26 support staff under EMAC to assist in emergency management operations; whereas, in response to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, approximately 66,000 personnel--about 46,500 National Guard and 19,500 civilian responders-- were deployed under EMAC from a wide variety of specialties, most of whom went to areas directly impacted by the storms. EMAC, along with its accompanying policies, procedures, and practices, enables its members to overcome differences to achieve a common mission--streamlining and expediting the delivery of resources among members during disasters. While these policies, procedures, and practices have worked well for smaller-scale deployments, they have not kept pace with the changing use of EMAC, sometimes resulting in confusion and deployment delays. The EMAC network has taken steps to address several of these challenges, but additional improvements can be made in a number of areas including clarifying roles and responsibilities of EMAC members and improving existing systems that track resources deployed under EMAC. In addition, a lack of sufficiently detailed federal standards and policies has led to some reimbursement delays and additional administrative burdens. While the EMAC network has developed a basic administrative capacity, opportunities exist for it to further build on and sustain these efforts. The EMAC network has adopted several good management practices, such as using after-action reports to learn from experiences and developing a 5-year strategic plan. However, the EMAC network can enhance its administrative capacity by improving how it plans, measures, and reports on its performance. FEMA provided $2 million to help build this capacity in 2003, but the agreement has recently expired. FEMA and EMAC leadership are in the process of finalizing a new 3-year cooperative agreement. Such an agreement would enhance the EMAC network's ability to support its collaborative efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Hurricanes Katrina and Rita provide powerful examples of how  catastrophic events can overwhelm the capacity of individual states,  requiring them to rely on outside sources for assistance.

For example, emergency  managers deployed under EMAC to Louisiana told us that they received  repeated requests simply for \u201csearch and rescue\u201d teams and that these  initial requests did not initially contain sufficient detail regarding the type  of skills and equipment needed to carry out the particular operation that  was needed. Search and rescue missions can vary significantly\u2014one type  of mission might require an aerial search and rescue team, while another  might require a canine search and rescue team. Therefore, identifying and  then clearly communicating the specific skills and equipment required is  critical. According to these officials, requests that initially omitted critical  mission details had to be clarified, causing delays in resource deployments  of up to 3 or more days as requesting and assisting state officials went  back and forth to clarify these details.", "A second shortcoming in how requests were communicated during the  2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes was that requesting states did not provide  sufficient details regarding conditions at the locations to which resources  were deployed. This led to teams arriving in the area of operations without  necessary support for responders. For example, the first firefighters  deployed to New Orleans under EMAC were given incorrect information  regarding the availability of food supplies and housing. Accordingly, these  firefighters were told they would receive transportation, food, and lodging  when they arrived. However, once they arrived at the initial staging area,  they quickly realized that they were not going to receive any of these  resources. As a result, they were delayed at the initial staging area until  they located necessary supplies on their own.", "Responding to concerns raised regarding the clarity of resource requests,  the EMAC network has taken several steps to improve its processes and  systems. For example, the EMAC network has adopted changes to the  EMAC Operations Manual that require requesting states to include  additional details such as the type of resources requested, specifying the  particular skills, abilities, or equipment needed.

EMAC leadership is currently transitioning part of the process  to an online format with templates, pull-down menus, and other tools to  help further specify mission details and improve the consistency of  language used in the request process. The new version of the form to  request assistance more effectively captures personnel deployment  considerations (e.g., recommended immunizations), but it does not  capture equipment considerations (e.g., fuel supplies, maintenance  provisions, and ownership of equipment purchased for the activation)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Comprehensive System to Track Resource Requests through Mission Completion", "paragraphs": ["The EMAC network does not have a comprehensive system in place to  support the tracking of resources from initial offers of assistance through  mission completion. Data systems in place to track resource requests and  deployments when Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005 did not  provide efficient tracking of resources deployed under EMAC. In addition,  requesting states maintained duplicate and ad hoc systems for tracking  resource requests and deployments. For example, when responding to the  2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes emergency management support personnel  responsible for facilitating requests for assistance recorded the same  mission-related information in two separate systems: an EMAC system  that cataloged all resource requests and a state-specific spreadsheet to  track resource requests solely for that individual state. In 2005, the EMAC  network itself found that these separate systems were often not aligned  with each other and required emergency managers to manually reenter  data into the EMAC system.", "Immediate access to these data systems was not given to personnel  deployed to state operations centers to facilitate requests under EMAC,  causing some to create ad hoc systems for tracking requests. In addition,  emergency managers deployed to state emergency operations centers to  facilitate requests under EMAC in the first weeks of the Hurricane Katrina  response efforts told us that they maintained duplicative systems to track  these requests, including using Post-ItsTM and notepads. Emergency  management officials responsible for coordinating assistance provided  under EMAC with other efforts at the federal level did not have accurate  information. In addition, there are no mechanisms in place to ensure that  data electronically cataloged by the EMAC network are complete or  accurate; of the 57 events for which the EMAC process was activated since  1995, the EMAC network has incomplete information for 72 percent of  these events.

For  example, after responding to a broadcast message to EMAC members for  assistance in responding to Hurricane Katrina, emergency management  officials from two states said that they sometimes had to wait several days  before finding out whether their offers to assist were ultimately accepted.  During this period, both states continued to ready their resources for  deployment although it had turned out that their offers to assist were not  selected by the requesting state. Because these officials were not informed  in a timely manner that they were not selected to provide assistance on  these missions, they incurred additional, nonreimbursable costs. As a  result, these officials stated that they were less likely to mobilize resources  in advance of a finalized agreement\u2014resulting in additional time to deploy  once an agreement was reached. In addition, some state officials stated  they were less likely to deploy resources under EMAC in the future as a  result of this lack of communication.", "Recognizing the need for a more coordinated data system, EMAC  leadership has taken steps to link requests for assistance with its existing  resource tracking system.

While  EMAC leadership and state emergency managers stated that this process  has worked reasonably well for smaller-scale deployments, EMAC  members encountered significant challenges with it during the large-scale  deployments in response to the Florida hurricanes of 2004 and the Gulf  Coast hurricanes of 2005. For example, although EMAC standards in effect  during these events required that disbursement of funds be made within 30  days after a mission ended, it took considerably longer to actually do so.  Specifically, assisting states were not completely reimbursed until 10  months after the conclusion of their missions following the 2004  hurricanes, and according to the latest data from provided to us by  Louisiana and Mississippi, 57 percent, or about $119 million, remains  outstanding for missions completed in Mississippi and Louisiana following  the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes.", "One of the causes of these delays is the lack of awareness among EMAC  members regarding recordkeeping requirements and how to process  reimbursement packages. For example, while EMAC protocols state that  the requesting state is obligated to reimburse assisting states for approved  missions deployed under EMAC, assisting states must first file  reimbursement packages with the requesting state documenting their  expenses and providing supporting documentation. After the 2005 Gulf  Coast hurricanes, the lack of awareness of this requirement on the part of  several assisting states resulted in additional burdens for requesting states.  In July 2006, Louisiana officials sent letters to 37 assisting states that had  not yet submitted reimbursement packages with the state\u201411 months  after Hurricane Katrina. In addition, assisting states were not always fully  aware of the documentation required to support deployment activities. For  example, officials from one state told us that they were not aware that  under EMAC protocols they were expected to complete a predeployment  inventory of all equipment and personnel taken into the impacted area. As  a result, these officials encountered reimbursement challenges because  the state could not document equipment lost during its response to the  2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes.", "Reimbursement was further complicated by the lack of consistent  understanding as to what is considered reasonably reimbursable  according to criteria outlined in the EMAC Operations Manual. While  EMAC protocols detailing reimbursement guidelines did identify a number  of broad eligible costs\u2014personnel costs, travel costs, equipment costs,  contractual costs, commodities, and other expenses\u2014they did not provide  any standards for how states were to determine what types of costs under  these broad categories were considered reasonable.", "The delays in reimbursing assisting state and local agencies in turn  delayed or eliminated planned expenditures to cover budgetary shortfalls.  For example, officials with the Virginia State Police told us that delays in  receiving reimbursement for $1.8 million in assistance they provided in  response to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes forced them to delay or cancel  the maintenance and purchase of critical equipment and supplies, such as  ammunition, uniforms, and office supplies. Additionally, state and local  officials told us that these reimbursement delays have caused them to  reconsider the level of assistance they would be willing to provide through  EMAC in the future.", "Following the 2005 hurricane season, the EMAC network has taken steps  to address some of these reimbursement concerns. For example, the  EMAC network recently updated the EMAC Operations Manual to  incorporate additional specificity on the types of costs eligible and not  eligible for reimbursement. The manual also contains new flexibilities,  including the elimination of the 30-day reimbursement requirement and  the option for an assisting state to delay paying actual service providers,  such as state agencies and local governments, until it first receives funds  to cover these expenses from the requesting state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Federal Guidance Delayed Some State-to-State Reimbursements under EMAC", "paragraphs": ["Although EMAC is an agreement between states, the involvement of the  federal government following presidentially declared disasters can affect  state-to-state reimbursements. Under EMAC, requesting states are  obligated to reimburse assisting states for missions performed under the  compact. However, catastrophic disasters can overwhelm the resources of  an impacted state, requiring it to seek financial assistance. While the  EMAC reimbursement process is intended to be independent of any efforts  by a requesting state to seek federal assistance, the federal government,  through FEMA, can offer funding for eligible response efforts following a  presidentially declared disaster. In such circumstances, a requesting state  works with FEMA to obtain financial assistance for eligible missions.   Once it receives this assistance, a requesting state can then reimburse  assisting states for missions performed under EMAC.", "Shortly after a presidentially declared disaster occurs, impacted states can  work with FEMA to seek financial assistance while response and recovery  efforts are under way to help cover anticipated costs. In 2004, in an effort  to expedite the reimbursement of localities that responded to the 2004  Florida hurricanes, FEMA developed a process for impacted states to  request and receive advance funding based on disaster estimates included  in an expedited project worksheet. Unlike standard project worksheets,  expedited project worksheets require less specificity as to how funding  should be spent, so long as the expedited project worksheets are  reconciled against actual, authorized spending at a later point. These funds  could be used to reimburse assisting states for responses provided under  EMAC or cover other anticipated costs. According to a senior FEMA  official for the Public Assistance Program, guidance on how to seek  expedited project worksheets does not exist. In 2005, neither Louisiana  officials nor Mississippi officials were aware that such payments existed.  According to Louisiana officials, FEMA officials suggested that they obtain  advance funding of $70 million to alleviate response and recovery costs\u2014 including assistance provided under EMAC. These officials added that this  advanced funding enabled them to reimburse assisting states in the  amount of almost $25 million, or slightly more than half of all  reimbursements Louisiana provided to assisting states for missions  conducted under EMAC in response to Hurricane Katrina. In contrast,  Mississippi officials stated that they were not aware that expedited project  worksheets could be used to cover eligible EMAC-related costs.

When units are in Title 32 status, units remain under the command  and control of the governor and continue to deploy under EMAC, but their  missions are federally funded. Under EMAC, the governor of the assisting  state delegates operational control to the emergency services authorities  of the state receiving assistance. If deemed appropriate, the Secretary of  Defense can approve federal funding of National Guard troops under Title  32.", "The first National Guard units that responded after Hurricane Katrina  deployed under State Active Duty status.

Units that remained in State Active Duty status were required by  EMAC procedures and their state emergency operations plans or other  guidance to maintain cost-supporting documentation throughout their  deployment, which was later used for reimbursement purposes. Following  the disaster, states that deployed National Guard units in State Active Duty  status submitted this documentation to the requesting state to obtain  reimbursement, negotiating the final amount of the reimbursement with  the requesting state. The requesting state, in turn, sought federal  reimbursement through the Public Assistance Program at FEMA.", "In contrast, states that deployed their units under EMAC in Title 32 status  were not required to seek reimbursement from the requesting state  directly, but were reimbursed by DOD. In Title 32 status, expenses are  directly tracked against a funding-site code assigned by DOD, which  enables direct payroll payment. Also, a record of equipment and  maintenance costs is kept for reimbursement through charges against the  funding-site code.", "Use of Title 32 status in response to Hurricane Katrina reduced the  administrative burdens on both the requesting and the assisting states,  eliminated the need for requesting states to fund National Guard  assistance from outside their states, and reduced the time assisting states  had to wait to be reimbursed. Iowa\u2019s and South Carolina\u2019s experience  during the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes illustrates the difference between  keeping a responding state\u2019s National Guard units in State Active Duty  status and switching to Title 32 status. For those units deployed in State  Active Duty status, Iowa was required to follow standard EMAC processes  for seeking reimbursement as opposed to being directly reimbursed for  missions performed in Title 32 status. It took until October 2006 for Iowa  to be reimbursed for a water purification unit that Iowa\u2019s National Guard  sent to Mississippi while in State Active Duty status in September 2005\u20149  months from the time the mission was completed. South Carolina National  Guard troops performed a similar mission in Title 32 status, and the state  was reimbursed within a month.", "In addition, switching from State Active Duty status to Title 32 status has  associated administrative costs. For example, one state recorded an  estimated $87,000 in administrative costs for National Guard personnel  and material expenses for making such a switch. Some of these costs were  derived from rescinding State Active Duty orders; backing out of state  payroll systems; performing audits to ensure that all data were adjusted  appropriately; correcting faults discovered; compiling, reviewing, and  transmitting troop personnel information for state processing; publishing  Title 32 status orders; and estimating payroll expenses and equipment use  costs.", "Following Hurricane Katrina, many reviews of lessons learned focused on  the failure of the federal government to implement the Catastrophic  Incident Annex and Supplement of the NRP, which could have rapidly  provided critical resources to assist and augment state and local response  efforts. However, even if the Catastrophic Incident Supplement had been  implemented, the decision to authorize the use of Title 32 might not have  come any sooner, because the supplement\u2019s execution schedule does not  specify a time at which DOD should consider whether it is appropriate to  authorize the use of Title 32 funding for National Guard response efforts  during an incident."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States Can Enhance Their Ability to Identify and Request Assistance under EMAC", "paragraphs": ["Some states have developed practices that may provide models or insights  to other members to enhance their ability to leverage resources under  EMAC\u2014including legislation and planning efforts\u2014providing additional  benefits that would not be otherwise available.

Intrastate mutual aid agreements  create a system for mutual aid between participating state counties,  parishes, or other political subdivisions in the prevention of, response to,  and recovery from any disaster that results in a formal state of emergency.  Firefighting, police, and medical personnel and equipment are examples of  emergency response assets that can be leveraged within a state using such  agreements. Through intrastate mutual aid, the types and volume of  resources available under EMAC are substantially greater than those  resources available solely at the state level. For example, in response to  Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Illinois, New York, and Texas were able to  deploy 1,663 local fire and hazardous materials response personnel and  supporting equipment to Louisiana under EMAC\u2014something that would  likely not have been possible without these types of mutual aid.", "Thirty-eight states have intrastate mutual or similar agreements in place  that enable states to leverage local resources under EMAC. However, only  16 EMAC members have instituted intrastate mutual aid agreements that  can also leverage private sector resources and 22 can deploy volunteer  resources. For example, Indiana\u2019s intrastate mutual aid agreement  includes a provision to call on state and private sector health professionals  throughout the state. When this provision is applied, as in response to  Hurricane Katrina deployment to Mississippi, through the Indiana  Governor\u2019s Executive Order, the private sector personnel become  temporary employees of the state\u2019s Department of Homeland Security. In  this status, they are eligible to be deployed as a state asset under EMAC  with all rights and licensing recognition afforded permanent state  employees under that compact. Figure 6 shows which states are able to  deploy private sector resources, volunteer resources, or both.", "Some states have begun to plan for how interstate resources deployed  under EMAC can supplement in-state resources, thereby improving their  ability to respond to a disaster more quickly and effectively. For example,  the Florida National Guard has a standing Memorandum of Understanding  with North Carolina for the use of C-130 aircraft for medical evacuation of  patients from the Florida Keys if required during a disaster. By having this  agreement in place, Florida is able to bypass the need to solicit assistance  across the EMAC network and reduce the time it would otherwise take to  negotiate mission details.", "Other states have also developed prescripted EMAC missions to fill in- state resource gaps. Louisiana, learning from its experiences during the  2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, has been working with neighboring states to  identify resources that can fill gaps identified through in-state planning  efforts. For example, according to Louisiana National Guard officials, they  have developed agreements to request security personnel from Arkansas  and commodity distribution support from Oklahoma. These agreements  include such details as: (1) mission description, (2) number of personnel  required, (3) approximate length of deployment, (4) arrival location,   (5) support/equipment requirements, (6) self-sustaining period (7) lodging  arrangements, and (8) on-site point of contact information.", "In addition, as states are more likely to turn to EMAC to fill in-state  resource gaps caused by competing deployments related to national  missions, such as missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, NGB is beginning to  encourage the prescripting of National Guard assets for emergency  response missions across several states. For example, officials from the  Florida and South Carolina National Guards told us that deployments in  support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and  Operation Jump Start have reduced their availability of in-state emergency  assets required for responding to disasters. These officials, citing similar  and pending deployments that may diminish their emergency response  capacity, stated that they expect an increased reliance on interstate  assistance provided under EMAC as a result of such deployments.", "While some states have identified situations where they will use EMAC to  supplement in-state resources, others have identified scenarios where they  were unlikely to do so. For example, EMAC leadership and emergency  managers from several states we spoke with cited three reasons why they  believe EMAC would not work well for an influenza pandemic. First, the  officials stated that they would be reluctant to send personnel into a  contaminated area. Second, the officials expressed their concern that  resources would not be available should the pandemic spread to their  respective states.

The Department of Defense did not  concur with the recommendation that calls for an expedited consideration  of whether to offer Title 32 following catastrophic disasters requiring  significant assistance from several states. DOD\u2019s response is reprinted in  appendix II.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Reserve Affairs did not concur with our recommendation that  the Secretary of Defense work with the Secretary of Homeland Security to  amend the National Response Plan\u2019s Catastrophic Incident Supplement  Execution Schedule to include early consideration of the use of Title 32 in  situations where the Secretary of Defense deems it appropriate. The  Department stated that use of National Guard forces in Title 32 status is an  inherent DOD function and, in accordance with Homeland Security  Presidential Directive-5, outside the purview of the Secretary of Homeland  Security.", "We agree that the use of National Guard forces in Title 32 status is an  inherent DOD function, and our recommendation recognizes the authority  of the Secretary of Defense to determine when use of that authority is  appropriate. While making clear that the directive in no way impairs or  affects the authority of the Secretary of Defense over DOD, Homeland  Security Presidential Directive-5 also states that the Secretary of Defense  and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish appropriate  relationships and mechanisms for cooperation and coordination between  their two departments. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security has responsibility for the National Response Plan, which already  assigns responsibilities to DOD, as a cooperating agency, and changes to  the plan must be coordinated through his department. Our reference to the  Secretary of Homeland Security was simply to acknowledge DHS\u2019s  coordinating role.", "DOD also stated that amending the Catastrophic Incident Supplement  Execution Schedule of the National Response Plan as we suggested \u201ccould  be interpreted to imply that it is DOD policy to place National Guard  forces into Title 32 status when in fact, the response to the event only  requires National Guard in State Active Duty status.\u201d Our recommendation  does not state that DOD should place National Guard forces into any  particular status. The intent behind our recommendation is to create a  mechanism that would trigger DOD\u2019s consideration of whether  authorization of Title 32 status is appropriate in the earlier stages of an  event, when the event has been designated as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d under the  National Response Plan. In our view, a decision point for consideration of  Title 32 status does not imply that the decision should be made in favor of  or in opposition to authorizing Title 32. The Secretary of Defense may  decide that it would not be appropriate to offer Title 32 status, and even if  the Secretary did decide to offer Title 32, states would still be free to  deploy their forces under State Active Duty status if they preferred. In  addition, the Department of Defense would not be precluded from  considering the issue again at a later time. However, a quicker decision  from DOD concerning the appropriateness of Title 32 would, in  circumstances where the authorization of Title 32 was deemed to be  appropriate, allow states to deploy their National Guard forces under a  single status rather than switching statuses in the midst of a catastrophe.  This could enhance state responses because, as our report highlights,  states face additional administrative burdens when they switch their  National Guard forces from State Active Duty status to Title 32 status.", "We also provided a draft of this report to the Chair of the EMAC Executive  Task Force and to the Executive Director of NEMA. Relevant sections of  the draft report were provided to state and local emergency offices whose  experiences we reference.

We also interviewed  emergency management officials and analyzed sources that provided  additional details for events for which the EMAC process was activated,  including after-action reports. Our work was constrained by data  limitations, since EMAC leadership maintained data only sporadically  prior to 2005, and data capturing deployments under EMAC for disasters  since 2005 were incomplete or inconsistent. To assess the reliability of the  deployment data, we reviewed additional documents and conducted  additional interviews with local, state, and federal emergency management  officials for selected events captured by the database. In cases where the  data were inaccurate, we supplemented them with data from more reliable  sources. For example, in determining the number of civilian and military  personnel deployed through EMAC for the September 11, 2001 terrorist  attack on New York and the 2004 Florida hurricanes, we obtained  additional data from New York and Florida officials. In addition, in  determining the number of out-of-state personnel deployed on September  10, 2005, in response to Hurricane Katrina, we worked with the  Department of Defense (DOD) to obtain more accurate data regarding  National Guard and active component, military deployment figures. We  also attended conferences that addressed interstate compacts and EMAC,  and we conducted literature and legal reviews of mutual assistance  compact structures and governance.", "To determine the degree to which existing policies, procedures, and  practices facilitate successful collaboration among EMAC members and  between the EMAC network and federal agencies, we interviewed various  local, state, and federal emergency management officials and analyzed the  procedures and practices they used during their response. We focused on  the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes emergency response since it presented the  largest use of the EMAC process to date, with approximately 66,000  civilian and National Guard responders deployed across several  disciplines. In addition, we also selected a cross section of disasters for  further analysis based on the type, scale, and timing of the disaster. To  gain firsthand knowledge of EMAC procedures, we held a combination of  in person and telephone interviews with some of the actual civilian and  National Guard emergency responders to the 2004 Florida hurricanes and  the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. In addition, we applied criteria for  practices GAO previously developed to assess collaboration among EMAC  members and between the EMAC network and key federal officials.  We  used the first six of these eight practices for this report:    defining and articulating a common outcome;    establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies;   identifying and addressing needs by leveraging resources;    agreeing on roles and responsibilities;    establishing compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate    developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results;  reinforcing agency accountability for collaboration efforts through agency  plans and reports; and  reinforcing individual accountability for collaborative efforts through  performance management systems.", "We did not use the last two practices because they were beyond the scope  of this review, and the sixth practice is discussed in our assessment of the  EMAC network\u2019s administrative capacity. We then selected examples that  illustrated and supported the need for improvement in specific areas  where the key practices could be used. We also spoke with individuals  who were responsible for various roles during these disasters such as  resource identification and requests, coordination, and reimbursement.
