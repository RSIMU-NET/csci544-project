DOD and State assess these programs together with other related activities through evaluations of security cooperation, counterterrorism, and other country goals. State policy requires human rights vetting of individuals and units of foreign security forces receiving U.S.-provided training. In Morocco and Tunisia, GAO found lapses in the vetting of trainees during fiscal years 2004 and 2005. These lapses include more than 400 trainees for whom no vetting files existed at the posts. In addition, even though posts maintained vetting files on 468 trainees, GAO estimates that 27 percent of these files did not have evidence of vetting. The lapses in vetting trainees resulted from unclear guidance on vetting procedures, undefined roles and responsibilities for vetting, and the lack of a systematic monitoring mechanism to ensure that procedures were followed. Although State has issued a guide to clarify procedures and has required posts to assign an official responsible for vetting, it does not monitor whether posts are following vetting procedures. Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia do not have any sensitive U.S.-origin defense articles subject to DOD's systematic monitoring requirements, such as physical inventory and inspection requirements.

For those  articles deemed sensitive by Golden Sentry such as man-portable air  defense systems and night vision devices, systematic monitoring, including  physical inventory and inspection procedures, is required. In addition,  other conditions or events can affect the level of monitoring that may  occur.

Although State has taken steps to ensure more  consistent human rights vetting of foreign security forces receiving U.S.- provided training, it still lacks a mechanism to monitor whether or not  posts are following its guidance, which is intended to ensure that trainees  do not have records of human rights abuses. State\u2019s guide, issued in  December 2005, assigned responsibility for monitoring the vetting process  to points of contact at U.S. posts but did not provide them with guidance  in carrying out this responsibility. Posts\u2019 points of contact in Morocco and  Tunisia were not monitoring posts\u2019 compliance with vetting procedures,  and State headquarters lacks assurance that posts are following its vetting  policy. This suggests that additional action is needed to strengthen the  monitoring element of internal controls. Although State OIG inspections of  posts once every 5 years may be a means of monitoring whether posts  follow vetting guidelines, internal control standards recommend ongoing  monitoring in the course of normal operations.

We obtained data on the nature and  extent of the activities funded by these programs in Algeria, Morocco, and  Tunisia from program officials and State and DOD documents. We  reviewed the reliability of funding data provided by State and DOD by  comparing it with similar data obtained from other sources to check for  completeness, consistency, and reasonableness.

We also reviewed program policy and procedures issued by State  and DOD officials in Washington, D.C., and at the posts in Rabat and  Tunis. To understand human rights vetting requirements and processes,  we interviewed relevant officials in Washington, D.C., the U.S. European  Command, and the two posts to discuss vetting requirements and  processes. We also reviewed the recommendations made in our July 2005  report on human rights vetting in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, we  communicated with a State Office of Inspector General (OIG) official to  determine the extent to which State OIG has oversight of human rights  vetting at posts. To obtain a general understanding of the human rights  situation in Morocco and Tunisia, we met with State human rights officers  and representatives of nongovernmental organizations involved with  human rights issues.", "To determine the extent to which the two posts complied with human  rights vetting policy in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, we asked the relevant  State and DOD officials in Washington, D.C., and at each post to determine  the number of foreign security force personnel receiving training  implemented at the posts in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. We further asked  post officials to identify the total number of vetting files maintained at the  post for trainees in this time frame. To identify the approximate number of  trainees for whom posts did not maintain vetting files and, therefore, who  may not have been vetted, we used training data provided by agency  reports as well as State and DOD officials. For vetting files that were  available at the posts, we drew a stratified random probability sample of  273 of 468 trainee vetting files available at the U.S. posts in Morocco and  Tunisia. With our probability sample, each member of the study  population had a nonzero probability of being included, and that  probability could be computed for any member. We stratified the  population by country and by agency implementing training into the  Morocco DOD, Morocco State, and Tunisia DOD case files. Each sample  case file was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically  for all the case files in the population, including those who were not  selected. We reviewed the files for compliance with State human rights  vetting policy. To conduct the file review, we used a data collection  instrument to systematically capture whether key steps in the post\u2019s  human rights vetting process occurred, such as whether the political  affairs office at each post was involved. We did not collect data on  whether any individual or unit trained by the United States, whether vetted  or not, had committed human rights violations.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as 95 percent confidence intervals (e.g., plus or minus 7 percentage  points). These are intervals that would contain the actual population  values for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn.
