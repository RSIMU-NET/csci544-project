In this report, GAO identifies (1) U.S. programs and activities that support the Act's objectives, (2) major challenges hindering the accomplishment of the objectives, and (3) U.S. efforts to assess progress toward the objectives.

In fiscal years 2006 and 2007, respectively, the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, State, and the Treasury and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $217.9 million and $181.5 million for the DRC. About 70 percent of the funds were allocated for programs that support the Act's humanitarian and social development objectives, while the remainder was allocated for programs and activities that support the Act's economic, governance, and security objectives. Although U.S. agencies have not acted on the Act's objective of bilaterally urging nations contributing peacekeeping troops to prosecute abusive peacekeepers, U.S. multilateral actions address this issue. The DRC's unstable security situation, weak governance, mismanagement of its vast natural resources, and lack of infrastructure are major interrelated challenges that impede efforts to achieve the Act's policy objectives. For example, the unstable security situation in the eastern DRC has worsened humanitarian and social problems and forced U.S. and NGO staff to curtail some efforts. The lack of roads has prevented deliveries of needed aid. DRC's weak governance structures prevent the country from meeting the requirements for debt relief and discourage private-sector investment, thus hindering economic growth. The U.S. government has not established a process for systematically assessing its progress toward achieving the Act's policy objectives. While some U.S. agencies collect information about their respective activities in the DRC, no mechanism exists for assessing overall progress. State and USAID are developing a joint planning and budgeting process that may eventually assess all U.S. foreign assistance. However, State's Director of Foreign Assistance has yet to complete the fiscal year 2007 DRC operations plan, which does not include a comprehensive assessment of the collective impact of State and USAID programs and does not address activities funded by other agencies. While a National Security Council-sponsored interagency group discusses DRC policies and helps coordinate some activities, it does not include several relevant agencies and, according to key officials, does not systematically assess progress in the DRC."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Because of its large size, central location in sub-Saharan Africa, and  Because of its large size, central location in sub-Saharan Africa, and  abundant natural resources, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)  abundant natural resources, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)  is important to the stability of central Africa and is of long-term interest to  is important to the stability of central Africa and is of long-term interest to  the United States.

To identify key challenges hindering the accomplishment of  the Act\u2019s policy objectives, we analyzed relevant policy and program  documents; interviewed U.S. agency officials; conducted a round-table  session with a nonprobability sample of 11 NGOs with a broad range of  experience and expertise implementing programs and projects in the DRC;  and interviewed representatives from other organizations with experience  in the DRC. To examine U.S. efforts to assess progress toward  accomplishing the Act\u2019s policy objectives and to make decisions regarding  additional actions, we reviewed U.S. agency assessments and  implementation documents.

With an area of more than  900,000 square miles, the DRC is roughly the size of the United States east  of the Mississippi River. Located in the center of Africa, the DRC borders  nine nations (see fig. 1). Its abundant natural resources, which constitute  its primary export products, include 34 percent of world cobalt reserves;  10 percent of world copper reserves; 64 percent of world coltan reserves;  and significant amounts of wood, oil, coffee, diamonds, gold, cassiterite,  and other minerals. In addition, rain forests in the DRC provide 8 percent  of world carbon reserves. The DRC has a population of 58 million to 65  million people, including members of more than 200 ethnic groups.", "The DRC has had a turbulent history. In 1965, fewer than 5 years after the  nation achieved its independence from Belgium, a military regime seized  control of the DRC and ruled, often brutally, for more than three decades.  It was toppled in 1997 by a coalition of internal groups and neighboring  countries to the east, including Rwanda and Uganda, after dissident  Rwandan groups began operating in the DRC. Subsequent efforts by a new  DRC government to secure the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan  troops prompted a second war in 1998 that eventually drew the armies of  three more African nations into the DRC. According to the International  Rescue Committee, this second war resulted in an estimated 3.9 million  deaths. Beginning in 1999, a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force was  deployed to the DRC. After a series of peace talks, the other nations  withdrew all or most of their troops and an interim government was  established. Elections held in 2006 with logistical support provided by UN  peacekeepers culminated in the December 6, 2006, inauguration of the  DRC\u2019s first democratically elected president in more than 40 years.", "Partially as a result of this turbulent history, the DRC suffers from a wide  range of problems, including acute poverty. The DRC is one of the poorest  and least developed countries in the world. It was ranked 167th of 177  nations surveyed by the UN Development Program in terms of life  expectancy, education, and standard of living, and its ranking on these  measures has declined more than 10 percent over the past decade. The  current life expectancy is 43 years, in part because the DRC suffers from  high rates of tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. According to USAID,  more than 2 of every 10 children born in the DRC die before their fifth  birthday (owing in part to chronic malnutrition and low vaccination rates),  and the maternal death rate is the world\u2019s highest. Congolese women also  suffer from the effects of rampant sexual attacks and other forms of  gender-based violence against women, particularly in the eastern regions  of the country. A UN expert reported in July 2007 that widespread  atrocities against women in one eastern DRC province constituted the  worst crisis of sexual violence that the expert had yet encountered. An  international group of donor nations recently concluded that the DRC\u2019s  educational system is failing and in a state of crisis. Most rural children do  not attend school at all, in part because their parents cannot afford to pay  school fees. As a result of such problems, the Fund for Peace ranked the  DRC second on its \u201cfailed states\u201d scale, after Sudan.", "The DRC\u2019s economic prospects are uncertain. It once derived about 75  percent of its export revenues and 25 percent of its gross domestic  product from its natural resources, but wars and turmoil have reduced its  economy to dependence on subsistence agriculture and informal activities.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that as of 2001, the  DRC\u2019s per capita gross domestic product had contracted to $100 from a  preindependence level of $400, in constant dollars. Although the DRC\u2019s  gross domestic product grew at an average rate of 5.5 percent from 2002  through 2005, growth has recently slowed. Also, the DRC\u2019s prospects are  encumbered by an external debt load of around $8 billion.

To receive the  estimated $6.3 billion in debt relief for which it may qualify under HIPC,  the DRC must meet various conditions that include satisfactory  macroeconomic performance under an IMF-supported program, improved  public sector management, and implementation of structural reforms.  Although donors had expected the DRC to qualify for full debt relief in  2006, the government instead has fallen back into arrears and has failed to  implement needed policies; as a result, IMF has suspended its program  assistance to the DRC.

NGO and U.S. officials  implementing emergency food aid and nonemergency food security  programs in the DRC have reported that excessive delays in delivering  assistance are common because of the lack of roads linking the DRC\u2019s  regions and several of its major cities and ports.
