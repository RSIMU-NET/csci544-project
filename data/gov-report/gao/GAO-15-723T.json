The large majority of delays occurred prior to entering into a lease agreement, in part due to VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA): 1) providing project requirements late or changing them or 2) using outdated guidance. Costs also increased for all 31 lease projects for which VA had complete cost data, primarily due to delays and changes to the scope of a project. For example, first-year rents increased a total of $34.5 million\u2014an annual cost which will extend for 20 years (the life of these leases).", "GAO's report also found that VA had taken some actions to address problems managing clinic-leased projects. First, it established the Construction Review Council in April 2012 to oversee the department's capital asset programs, including the leasing program. Second, consistent with the council's findings and previous GAO work, VA was planning the following improvements:", "Requiring detailed design requirements earlier in the facility-leasing process .

VA's 2014 budget submission did not clarify that its estimates for future lease projects included only one year's rent, which does not reflect the total costs over the life of the leases, costs that VA states cannot be accurately determined in early estimates. VA officials clarified this estimate beginning with VA's 2015 budget submission.", "However, these improvements were in the early stages, and their success will depend on how quickly and effectively VA implements them.", "Finally, GAO reported that VA was also taking steps to refine and update guidance on some aspects of the leasing process, for example the VA's design guides, but VHA has not updated the overall guidance for clinic leasing (used by staff involved with projects) since 2004. In October 2014, VA reported that it was in the process of revising its clinic leasing guidance in response to GAO's recommendation and that its leasing authority was now under the General Services Administration (GSA) and the handbook was undergoing further revisions to incorporate GSA leasing processes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its April 2014 report, GAO recommended that VA update VHA's guidance for the leasing of outpatient clinics.

VA operates one of the nation\u2019s largest  health-care delivery systems. To help meet the changing medical needs  of the veterans\u2019 population, including a greater need for outpatient  services, VA has increasingly leased the facilities from which it provides  its health care services. VA believes that leasing the Veterans Health  Administration\u2019s (VHA) medical facilities rather than owning them allows  VA to provide more veterans with accessible health-care services and  gives it the flexibility to respond to changing service demands,  demographic shifts, and improvements in medical technology.  Depending on the facility\u2019s size and scope of services, VA\u2019s outpatient  clinics can provide primary care; dental care; pharmacy, laboratory, and  radiology services; nutritional medicine; women\u2019s health care; mental  health and suicide prevention services; and other types of specialty care.  As of November 2013, VHA\u2019s leasing program had a long-term liability of  $5.5 billion and growing with a total of 1,889 leases.", "At the time of our work, VA was required to submit a prospectus to  Congress for all major medical-facility leases and construction projects.  VHA is responsible for developing the requirements for build-to-suit and  remodeled lease facilities. The Office of Construction and Facilities  Management\u2019s (CFM) Office of Real Property Service (RPS) is  responsible for acquiring land and leasing space for the construction of  medical and medically related facilities for VA, and provides guidance to  regional and local VA offices regarding real property.", "This testimony discusses VA\u2019s leasing management issues, specifically:  1.  the extent to which schedule and costs changed for selected VA  outpatient clinics since they were first submitted to Congress and the  factors that have contributed to any changes, and  2.  the actions, if any, VA has taken to improve its leasing practices for  outpatient clinics and any opportunities that may exist for VA to  improve its management of project schedules and costs.", "This testimony is based on our April 2014 report on VA\u2019s major leased  outpatient clinics along with selected updates conducted in August and  October 2014 to obtain information from VA on actions it has taken to  address GAO\u2019s prior recommendation. In that report, we discuss 41  current major medical leases that are outpatient clinic projects for which a  prospectus had been submitted to Congress, as required by law. The  total contract value of these 41 projects is $2.5 billion. The prospectuses  for these projects were submitted to Congress from 1997 to 2011. We  reviewed VA data as of January 2014 on each of these projects. We  reviewed and analyzed the original cost estimate and completion date  from when a project\u2019s prospectus was first submitted to Congress and the  project\u2019s current status. To examine specific outpatient projects in greater  detail, we selected 11 clinic projects in 8 locations: (1) Jacksonville,  Florida; (2) Baltimore, Maryland; (3) Las Vegas, Nevada (four facilities);  (4) Austin, Texas; (5) McAllen, Texas; (6) Corpus Christi, Texas; (7)  Parma, Ohio; and (8) Ft. Wayne, Indiana. We selected these projects and  locations based on the following criteria: (1) projects status; (2) project  costs; (3) scope and cost changes; and (4) schedule delays. We  reviewed VA\u2019s leasing guidance and directives, VA\u2019s Strategic Plan Fiscal  Year 2011 to 2015, and other relevant documents. In addition, we  reviewed relevant prior GAO reports, Office of Management and Budget  guidance on leasing practices, and relevant legislation pertaining to VA\u2019s  leasing authority and amounts appropriated for these projects. We  interviewed VA officials and representatives from private companies  involved in VA leasing projects. The work on which this statement is  based was conducted from May 2013 to April 2014 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

Specifically, we found that 39 of the 41 outpatient- clinic projects for which a prospectus was submitted experienced  schedule delays, ranging from 6 months to 13.3 years, with an average  delay of 3.3 years, while 2 projects experienced schedule time decreases.  Our data analysis showed that 94 percent of these delays occurred in the  planning stages prior to entering into the lease agreement. For all but one  of the projects that experienced a delay, the delay occurred during the  pre-lease agreement stage. We also compared the length of delays that  occurred during the pre-lease agreement stage to the length of delays  that occurred once a lease agreement was entered into with the  development firm. We found that the average delay during the pre-lease  agreement stages for all 41 projects totaled nearly 3.1 years. Conversely,  the average project delay once a lease agreement was finalized totaled  approximately 2.5 months, and 11 outpatient-clinic projects actually  experienced schedule decreases during this stage. VA officials at 6 of the  11 outpatient-clinic projects selected for detailed review mentioned that  the large majority of schedule delays occur during the planning stages  prior to entering into a lease agreement.", "For the 41 lease projects we reviewed, we found that several factors  contributed to delays:", "VHA\u2019s late or changing requirements: According to data we analyzed  and VA officials we interviewed, late or changing VHA requirements  were the most common reasons for delays. Requirements can pertain  to facility size, types of treatment rooms, types of medical equipment,  electrical voltage needs, and other details. We found in many  instances, either that CFM either did not receive VHA\u2019s requirements  on time or that VHA changed its requirements during the solicitation of  offers, necessitating a re-design that affected the schedule. In  evaluating VA data, we found that 23 of the 41 leasing projects (56  percent) experienced delays because VHA was late in submitting  space requirements to CFM, or VHA changed space requirements  and thus the scope of the project. For example, the size of the  Jacksonville outpatient clinic had increased by 29 percent, and the  Austin outpatient-clinic site we visited had increased by 36 percent  from the time the prospectuses for these projects were submitted to  Congress to the time they were completed.", "Site Selection Challenges: In analyzing VA data, we found that 20 of  the 41 outpatient-clinic projects we reviewed (49 percent) experienced  delays due to difficulties in locating or securing a suitable site. For  example, an increase in scope to the Jacksonville project resulted in a  larger building design that then required more land. To accommodate  these changes, the landowner worked to acquire additional properties  around the already selected site. Although the developer was  ultimately successful in obtaining additional land for the project, this  process led to delays. According to VA officials, prior to entering into  the lease agreement, there were delays associated with difficult  negotiations with the developer. However, the officials said that the  negotiations resulted in keeping project costs lower. In addition, there  were significant environmental clean-up requirements at the site,  requirements that needed to be satisfied before construction began.  The original site\u2019s location was obtained in December 2002, but the  larger site was not obtained until December 2009, a delay of 7 years.", "Outdated Guidance: At the sites we reviewed, we found that outdated  policy and guidelines resulted in challenges for VA staff to complete  leasing projects on time. For example, officials from the four Las  Vegas outpatient sites we visited stated that VA\u2019s policies for  managing leases seem to change for each project, creating  uncertainty regarding CFM job responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project Cost Increases", "paragraphs": ["In addition to substantial delays, our April 2014 report noted that VA also  experienced cost increases to its outpatient-clinic projects when  compared to the costs in the projects\u2019 prospectuses. VA provided cost  data for its outpatient-clinic lease projects in January 2014. For the 31  projects with complete cost data, we found that \u201ctotal first-year costs,\u201d  when compared to the prospectus costs, increased from $153.4 million to  $172.2 million, an increase of nearly $19 million (12 percent). However,  for the 31 projects, the total \u201cprospectus first-year rent\u201d was estimated at  $58.2 million, but the total awarded first-year rent for these projects  equaled $92.7 million as of January 2014, an increase of $34.5 million (59  percent).because the department must pay the higher rent over the lifetime of the  lease agreement. For example, all 31 VA lease projects included in this  cost analysis have lease terms of 20 years, and the increase in rent must  be paid for the duration of the contract. Although first year\u2019s rents  increased for the 31 projects\u2014increasing overall total costs\u2014VA\u2019s total  \u201cbuild-out\u201d costs were lower than reported in the projects\u2019 prospectuses.  Build-out costs are one-time, lump-sum payments VA makes to  developers for special purpose, medically related improvements to  buildings when VA accepts the projects as completed. VA officials said  the decrease in build-out costs from those originally estimated in the  prospectuses was due to the national downturn in the commercial real  estate market starting in 2008. The downturn created more competition  among developers and helped VA realize more competitive pricing on its  medical build-out requirements than was anticipated in the prospectuses.", "Such increases in rent have long- term implications for VA,  The causes of the total cost increase can be attributed primarily to  increases in the projects\u2019 awarded first-year rent due to the schedule  delays and changes to the design or scope of a project that we discussed  previously. Schedule delays can increase costs because of changes in  the local leasing market during the period of the delay. Therefore, when  VA estimates costs as part of the prospectuses submitted to Congress in  the annual budget request, an automatic annual escalation is applied to  each project to account for rising costs and market forces that make  construction and leased space more expensive over time. VA officials  said the escalation ensures that the authorized cost of the project is in  line with the realities of the real estate and construction markets. Because  VA annually adjusts a project\u2019s cost by an increase of 4 percent for each  year the project is delayed, project delays directly result in cost increases.  Additionally, we found that projects we reviewed increased in total size by  203,000 square feet. Changes in a project\u2019s size expand the scope of the  project, requiring design changes, which can result in schedule delays,  further adding to costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Has Taken Some Actions to Improve Its Leasing-Management Practices for Outpatient Clinics; However, Its Guidance Could Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["Our April 2014 report found that VA has made some progress in  addressing issues with its major medical-facilities leasing program.

We reviewed VHA\u2019s 2004 Handbook 1006.1, Planning and  Activating Community-Based Outpatient Clinics, VHA\u2019s overall guidance  for leasing outpatient clinics. This Planning Handbook is intended to  establish consistent planning criteria and standardized expectations. The  Planning Handbook is widely used by VA officials and provides important  guidance, in particular, clarifying the differing responsibilities of officials  and departments and the legal authorities of the leasing process.  However, this guidance is out of date and no longer adequately reflects  the roles and responsibilities of the various VA organizations involved in  major medical-facilities-leasing projects. According to VA officials, the  close collaboration of these organizations is necessary for a successful  lease project.", "As of November 2013, VHA\u2019s leasing program has a long-term liability of  $5.5 billion, but its guidance on outpatient clinics is a decade old and no  longer relevant. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  calls for federal agencies to develop and maintain internal control  activities, which include policies and procedures, to enforce  management\u2019s directives and help ensure that actions are taken to  address risks. Such activities are an integral part of an entity\u2019s planning, implementing, reviewing, and accountability for stewardship of  government resources and for achieving effective results. The lack of  updated guidance can affect coordination among stakeholders and could  contribute to schedule delays and cost increases. Using outdated  guidance can lead to miscommunications and errors in the planning and  implementing of veterans\u2019 leased clinics. Furthermore, the policy,  planning criteria, and business plan format in the Planning Handbook  were developed based on an old planning methodology that VA no  longer uses; thus, the guidance does not reflect VA\u2019s current process.", "In our April 2014 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs update VHA\u2019s guidance for leasing outpatient clinics to better  reflect the roles and responsibilities of all VA staff involved in leasing  projects.
