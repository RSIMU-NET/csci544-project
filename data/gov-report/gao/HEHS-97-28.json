This office hears appeals of denied benefit claims under both of these federal programs: Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In the last decade, the number of disability cases appealed to OHA has increased by about 140 percent. Although SSA has tried to manage this increased caseload, between 1985 and 1995 its inventory of appealed cases increased from about 107,000 to almost 548,000. The processing delays resulting from this increase have created hardships for disability claimants, who often wait more than a year for a final decision on their appeal. SSA initiated its Short-Term Disability Plan (STDP) in November 1994 to reduce the number of appealed cases awaiting a decision at OHA to a manageable level by December 1996.", "Given your interest in improving the disability claims process and reducing the number of appealed cases whose decisions are significantly delayed, you asked us to report on OHA\u2019s (1) progress in meeting STDP\u2019s backlog reduction and case processing goals and (2) current allowance rate for appealed cases compared with pre-STDP levels. You also asked us to report on the accuracy of decisions made under STDP, which, as discussed with your office, we cannot do at this time because SSA is just now evaluating STDP\u2019s decision accuracy. After SSA completes its evaluation, we will review the results.", "We developed information for this report by analyzing data on OHA workload, backlog, processing time, and allowance rate levels; examining SSA documents on STDP activities; and interviewing OHA headquarters officials responsible for developing and implementing STDP as well as officials of other SSA offices. Because of the focus of our review, we did not see the need to verify the accuracy of the data provided by SSA.

Claimants under either program file an application for disability benefits with one of SSA\u2019s more than 1,300 field offices. Applications, along with supporting medical evidence, are then forwarded to state disability determination service (DDS) offices, which make the initial medical determination of eligibility in accordance with SSA\u2019s policies and procedures. Claimants DDS examiners find ineligible have the right to appeal the decision to OHA, where cases are heard by administrative law judges (ALJ).", "A steadily increasing number of appeals has caused workload pressures and processing delays for OHA. Between 1985 and 1995, appeals increased more than 140 percent, and the number of appealed cases awaiting an OHA decision grew from about 107,000 to almost 548,000. During this period, average processing time for cases appealed to OHA\u2014measured from the date a claimant files a request for a hearing to when a decision is issued\u2014 increased 110 percent, from 167 days to 350 days. In addition, \u201caged\u201d appealed cases (those taking 270 days or more for a decision) increased from 5 percent of pending appealed cases to 39 percent during the same period.", "SSA has a long-term strategy\u2014its Plan for a New Disability Claim Process\u2014designed to address systemic problems contributing to inefficiencies in its disability programs and significantly reduce the time claimants must wait to receive a decision on their claim. STDP is SSA\u2019s ongoing effort to achieve some reduction in OHA\u2019s backlog of appealed cases.", "SSA began STDP in November 1994 to address the backlog crisis from an agencywide perspective and establish specific goals and time frames for reducing backlogs. STDP includes 19 temporary initiatives to expedite the disability determination process and reduce OHA\u2019s backlog from 488,000 appealed cases in October 1994 to 375,000 by December 1996. SSA set its backlog target to equal one and one-half times the number of appealed cases that, in OHA\u2019s opinion, constitutes an appropriate workload for its ALJs and staff\u2014about 250,000 appealed cases. According to OHA, the 375,000 target does not relate to any processing time or waiting time goal\u2014 it simply is a target that SSA believed was achievable at STDP\u2019s inception."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "STDP\u2019s Expanded Regional Screening and Prehearing Conferencing Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["To reach its aggressive backlog reduction goal, STDP relies heavily on a temporary reallocation of agency resources and process changes to reduce the number of appealed cases requiring an ALJ hearing. Although STDP has 19 temporary initiatives, OHA expects that its major effect will come primarily from expanding two pre-STDP initiatives to expedite the processing of appealed cases. These two initiatives\u2014regional screening unit and prehearing conferencing activities\u2014were designed to target for review specific kinds of appealed cases that are likely to result in ALJs\u2019 approving the claim for payment (referred to as \u201callowance\u201d). These reviews can result in possible allowance without the more costly and time-consuming process of an ALJ hearing.", "Before STDP\u2019s implementation, SSA had established screening units in each region to help alleviate OHA\u2019s backlog. Screening unit examiners, who were not OHA staff, reviewed certain appealed cases to determine if the evidence in the case file was sufficient to permit an allowance, eliminating the need for a hearing. SSA selected most cases for review by screening unit staff by using computer-generated case profiles to identify potentially incorrect claim denials by DDS staff. SSA officials believe that such profiling of appealed cases minimizes the risk of incorrect allowances.", "Under STDP, SSA expanded screening unit activities by assigning OHA attorneys to help examiners in all of SSA\u2019s regional screening units to identify more appealed cases that could be allowed earlier in the process. According to SSA, the opportunity for screening unit examiners to discuss issues with OHA attorneys gave the examiners more insight into the adjudication process and enabled the examiners and attorneys, where appropriate, to recommend allowance in more cases.", "SSA\u2019s pre-STDP efforts to reduce the backlog of appealed cases also included implementing a prehearing conferencing process. The purpose of prehearing conferencing was to shorten processing time for appealed cases by assigning experienced OHA attorneys to review and identify appealed cases that potentially could be allowed without a formal ALJ hearing. While screening unit activities focused on reviewing evidence already in the case file, prehearing conferencing enabled attorneys to review evidence in the case file, confer with claimant representatives, conduct limited case development, and draft decisions to be reviewed and approved by ALJs.", "Under STDP\u2019s expanded prehearing conferencing initiative, OHA\u2019s senior attorneys have been given quasi-judicial powers or the authority to issue allowance decisions without an ALJ\u2019s involvement or approval. Under the initiative, OHA attorneys are to extensively develop the case record, which includes obtaining medical and vocational evidence, conducting conferences with claimant representatives as well as medical and vocational experts, and issuing allowance decisions. If they cannot allow the claim on the basis of their review of the evidence, the case is scheduled for an ALJ hearing. As in the screening unit initiative, SSA relied on computer-generated case profiles to select cases to be processed under this effort. Cases were selected on the basis of their likelihood to be allowed on the record by an ALJ.", "STDP is scheduled to be phased out in December 1996. Although OHA has proposed that SSA extend expanded screening unit activities through December 1997, as of September 1996 SSA had made no final decision on this. Expanded prehearing conferencing, however, will remain active until June 30, 1997, when regulatory authority for senior attorneys to allow appealed cases expires. In fiscal year 1997, SSA expects to implement certain features from its ongoing efforts to redesign the disability claims process. One of the features being tested is a new decision-making position to help expedite appealed claims through the process. Like activities under STDP\u2019s expanded screening unit and prehearing conferencing initiatives, this position will enable someone other than an ALJ to review and allow some appealed cases, eliminating the need for an ALJ hearing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "STDP\u2019s Backlog Goal Will Not Be Reached", "paragraphs": ["SSA acknowledges that it will not reach STDP\u2019s goal of reducing the backlog of appealed cases to 375,000 by December 1996. In fact, OHA\u2019s backlog of about 515,000 appealed cases as of August 1996\u2014about 22 months into STDP\u2014was 3 percent higher than the backlog of about 500,000 that existed at the plan\u2019s inception.", "Although SSA will not reach STDP\u2019s backlog reduction goal, the agency believes that the plan has helped to reduce the growth in the backlog of appealed cases awaiting a decision. Since peaking at about 552,000 in December 1995, OHA\u2019s backlog decreased steadily by an average of about 4,600 appealed cases per month through August 1996 or by about 37,000 total appealed cases. As shown in figure 1, OHA\u2019s backlog decreased during each of the last two fiscal quarters of 1996. As of August 31, 1996, the backlog was 515,009 appealed cases.", "OHA\u2019s current projections indicate that its backlog of appealed cases will be approximately 498,000 at the end of calendar year 1996 or about 123,000 above STDP\u2019s target.

Figure 2 illustrates the disparity between the number of appealed cases OHA expected to allow under STDP through December 1996 and the actual number that have been allowed through August 1996\u201422 months since the plan was initiated.", "Start-up delays associated with prehearing conferencing\u2014the initiative expected to have the greatest impact on reducing OHA\u2019s backlog of appealed cases\u2014have hindered SSA\u2019s ability to reach STDP\u2019s goals. To implement this initiative, SSA had to seek a regulatory change to give about 600 OHA senior and supervisory staff attorneys the authority to decide certain appealed cases that were formerly limited to ALJ jurisdiction. However, the process of obtaining regulatory change and defining the specific duties and responsibilities these attorneys would have under STDP was lengthy, and implementation did not begin until July 1995\u2014or about 6 months after the projected start-up date.", "Overly optimistic allowance projections for STDP\u2019s expanded prehearing conferencing and screening unit initiatives also contributed to OHA\u2019s inability to reach the plan\u2019s backlog reduction goal. SSA initially projected that expanded prehearing conferencing would result in 224,000 allowances by senior attorneys through the 2-year period ending December 1996. However, as of August 31, 1996\u2014or about 22 months into STDP\u2014these attorneys had allowed only 55,363 appealed cases or about 25 percent of the projected total. The aggressive projections for this initiative were based on the results of the prehearing conferencing pilot, which OHA conducted before STDP\u2019s implementation, and the assumption that the use of profiling to select cases would result in a higher rate of cases that could be allowed without a hearing.", "On the basis of the prehearing conferencing pilot, which was conducted at 19 hearing offices that agreed to participate, OHA estimated that senior attorneys would be able to allow approximately 75 percent of the appealed cases selected for their review. However, data show that between August 1995 and August 1996 senior attorneys allowed only about 24 percent of the appealed cases reviewed under STDP. According to SSA, the lower allowance rate is primarily due to senior attorneys\u2019 not conducting prehearing conferences with claimants as frequently as anticipated as well as not sufficiently developing evidence necessary to complete a claimant\u2019s case record. To increase the number of allowances under this initiative, OHA has directed its hearing offices to ensure that all senior attorneys receive training to better familiarize themselves with OHA\u2019s case development process. In addition, through directives and a series of conference calls with all its hearing offices, OHA has provided its senior attorneys with specific guidance that includes the kind of evidence that would adequately support an allowance decision.", "Like STDP\u2019s prehearing conferencing initiative, expanded regional screening has not reached STDP\u2019s allowance goals. Before STDP, screening units were expected to allow about 20,000 appealed cases annually. With STDP\u2019s introduction of OHA attorneys to the process, SSA expected to allow 38,000 appealed cases annually or 76,000 over the 2 years the initiative was to be in place. In the 22 months since STDP was initiated, however, screening units had allowed a total of 26,022 appealed cases or about 34 percent of the projected total as of August 31, 1996.", "SSA expected that under STDP, regional screening units would allow 76,000 appealed cases or about 15 percent of those selected for review. To reach the initiative\u2019s target of 76,000 allowances, screening units would have had to review a total of about 507,000 cases. Since STDP\u2019s inception in November 1994, however, screening units had reviewed only about 258,000 cases as of August 31, 1996. According to SSA, the shortfall in the number of appealed cases processed by screening units is mainly due to SSA\u2019s reassignment of some screening unit staff to other duties.", "Finally, an unexpected increase in the number of appeals also hindered OHA\u2019s efforts to reduce its backlog to STDP\u2019s goal. During fiscal year 1995, OHA received approximately 37,500 more appealed cases than it had initially projected for the year. According to OHA\u2019s staff management officer, this unanticipated workload was due primarily to an increased number of cases processed by DDS staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Goals Have Not Been Reached, STDP Has Enhanced OHA\u2019s Ability to Process Its Workload", "paragraphs": ["STDP has enhanced OHA\u2019s ability to dispose of appealed cases, helped decrease the agency\u2019s decision-writing backlog, and reduced processing time for some appealed cases. OHA estimates that as of August 31, 1996, STDP had resulted in a net increase of about 66,500 dispositions. This estimate is based on time savings associated with appealed cases allowed under STDP\u2019s expanded screening unit and prehearing conferencing initiatives. To determine the net increase in dispositions attributable to STDP, OHA estimated the amount of ALJ time that could be saved through activities implemented under the plan\u2019s two key initiatives and converted these time savings into the number of additional cases that could be disposed of by ALJs in that amount of time.", "OHA\u2019s estimate that the number of dispositions through August 1996 increased by about 66,500 as a result of STDP is consistent with our estimate. On the basis of our analysis of ALJ productivity before STDP, had SSA not implemented the plan, OHA would have disposed of about 68,000 fewer cases between the beginning of fiscal year 1995 and August 1996.", "STDP has also helped to reduce the number of appealed cases awaiting a written decision.

On average, processing times for screening unit examiners\u2019 decisions have averaged 39 days; processing times for senior attorneys\u2019 prehearing conferencing decisions have averaged 121 days.
