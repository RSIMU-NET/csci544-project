HHS is the federal agency primarily responsible for identifying medical countermeasures needed to address the potential health effects from exposure to CBRN agents and emerging infectious diseases. HHS conducted a review to assess how to better address these concerns. Its August 2010 review concluded that the advanced development and manufacture of CBRN medical countermeasures needed greater support. The review recommended that HHS develop centers to provide such support, in part by using flexible manufacturing technologies, such as disposable equipment, to aid in the development and rapid manufacture of products.", "The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 requires GAO to examine HHS's flexible manufacturing initiatives and the activities these initiatives will support. This report addresses (1) how much funding HHS has awarded for flexible manufacturing activities for medical countermeasures, and (2) the extent to which these activities will support the development and production of CBRN medical countermeasures. To address these objectives, GAO examined HHS documents and interviewed HHS officials, contractors, and stakeholders. In comments on a draft of the report, HHS agreed with its findings and provided additional information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) awarded nearly $440 million in contracts to establish three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM) and a network of facilities to provide packaging support for medical countermeasure distribution, known as the Fill Finish Manufacturing Network (FFMN). The contracts require the CIADMs to develop three activities to support flexible manufacturing for medical countermeasure development and production: the manufacture of pandemic influenza vaccines during an emergency; core services to support the development and production of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) medical countermeasures; and workforce training. During the contract base periods, each CIADM is to retrofit existing or build new facilities able to produce 50 million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine within 4 months of receipt of the influenza virus strain and to establish the capacity to provide core services, such as assisting countermeasure developers by manufacturing products to be used for clinical trials. The CIADMs are also required to develop workforce training programs, which are intended to increase expertise in CBRN medical countermeasure development. The CIADM base contracts are intended to retrofit or build facilities to stand ready to provide these three activities and maintain this readiness through annual contract option periods. Once the facilities are prepared to provide these activities, BARDA may place task orders for provision of CIADM vaccine surge capacity, core services, or training, and BARDA, through the task orders, would provide additional payments to obtain these services. The FFMN is to supplement CIADMs' pandemic influenza surge capacity, packaging up to 117 million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine in 12 weeks, if needed, and can also provide core services as CIADM subcontractors.", "HHS's CIADM core services activities are designed to support the development and production of certain CBRN medical countermeasures, but it is too early to tell how effective this approach will be. BARDA's establishment of the CIADMs implements a recommendation from HHS's review of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE)\u2014a federal interagency body that advises HHS on medical countermeasure priorities. The CIADMs are to support the development of biologics-based countermeasures only, which are products like vaccines that are derived from living sources such as cells, because BARDA considers these countermeasures to need the greatest support. BARDA has identified some of its current biologics-based countermeasure development contracts that could use core services' support and are priorities for PHEMCE. However, the CIADMs are still completing activities associated with their contract base period. Thus, BARDA has not issued any task orders for core services to date, but has created a CIADM steering committee and completed guidance to govern the task order process once the CIADMs are operational. Until the CIADM core services are used, it will be unclear how effectively they will support the development and production of CBRN medical countermeasures. Stakeholders we interviewed were uncertain about the demand for and availability of funding for core services. BARDA officials said that they anticipate having sufficient demand for the services and funding for task orders in fiscal years 2014 and 2015."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Public health emergencies in the new millennium\u2014such as the 2001  anthrax attacks and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic\u2014continue to  raise concerns about our nation\u2019s vulnerability to threats from chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents and new or  reemerging infectious diseases. The Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) is the federal agency primarily responsible for identifying  needed medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate potential health  effects from exposure to such threats. As part of that task, HHS works  with other federal agencies to engage with industry to develop medical  countermeasures through its Public Health Emergency Medical  Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). PHEMCE is a federal  interagency body\u2014composed of certain HHS agencies and offices, the  Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, and others\u2014 established in 2006 and responsible for providing recommendations to  the Secretary of Health and Human Services on medical countermeasure  priorities and development and production needs.", "There are some medical countermeasures\u2014drugs, vaccines, and devices  to diagnose, treat, prevent, or mitigate potential health effects of  exposure\u2014available for these agents and diseases. However, as with  drugs and other pharmaceuticals in general, research and development  to create usable countermeasures for CBRN agents and emerging  infectious diseases is a lengthy, complex, and expensive process. The  general lack of a commercial market for some medical countermeasures  may reduce incentives for large pharmaceutical and medical device  manufacturers to invest millions of dollars to develop such products,  instead of others that may be more profitable. Hence, many medical  countermeasure developers are small biotechnology companies with less  experience than larger pharmaceutical companies in developing a  product and bringing it to market.", "In addition to the lack of incentives for larger pharmaceutical companies  and the limited experience of smaller biotechnology companies, the 2009  H1N1 influenza pandemic raised particular concerns about the United  States\u2019 ability to rapidly manufacture needed medical countermeasures  for CBRN threats and new or reemerging infectious diseases. As a  result, in August 2010, HHS conducted a review of PHEMCE\u2019s activities  to develop and produce needed medical countermeasures. In its review,  HHS concluded that the United States must have a nimble, flexible  capability to rapidly produce medical countermeasures for CBRN threats  or emerging infectious diseases in a public health emergency and that  this capacity was lacking. The review also highlighted the need for more  support for smaller biotechnology companies conducting advanced  research and development of countermeasures, including assistance in  moving countermeasures through clinical trials and developing and  producing them to the point at which HHS would be able to procure  them. In the PHEMCE review, HHS also recommended that the  department, either alone or in collaboration with the Department of  Defense, establish centers to provide advanced development and  manufacturing capability for medical countermeasures to address national  security and to augment public health needs on a cost-effective, reliable,  and sustainable basis. These centers are intended to support flexible  manufacturing\u2014that is, the use of disposable equipment and alternative  technologies for product development and rapid manufacturing\u2014to aid in  the development and production of medical countermeasures. In its  PHEMCE review, HHS stated that these centers would strengthen  countermeasure development by linking countermeasure developers with  needed expertise, using and improving flexible manufacturing  technologies, augmenting manufacturing surge capacity against emerging  infectious diseases or unknown threats, and helping train future  countermeasure developers. In June 2012, HHS awarded three contracts  to establish three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and  Manufacturing (CIADM).", "The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of  2013 (PAHPRA) requires that we examine HHS\u2019s flexible manufacturing  initiatives and the activities these initiatives are to support.

We also analyzed the three contracts HHS awarded to establish  the CIADMs to determine the amounts awarded under each contract and  the activities each center will carry out. We interviewed officials from  HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response  (ASPR), ASPR\u2019s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development  Authority (BARDA), and officials from each of the three CIADMs to  determine the activities these funds are intended to support and the  current status of the CIADMs. Finally, we interviewed two relevant  stakeholder groups for their perspectives on planned center activities. Of  these two stakeholder groups, we interviewed officials from one  association that represents more than 1,000 domestic and international  biotechnology companies and related organizations that develop medical  countermeasures and other pharmaceuticals. We also interviewed  officials from an academic research center that conducts research and  analysis and provides policy recommendations to protect people\u2019s health  from the consequences of public health emergencies.", "To answer the second objective, we examined HHS documents, such as  the 2010 PHEMCE review, to identify barriers to advanced research and  development.

Examples of biologics-based countermeasures for CBRN threats include  anthrax vaccine, recombinant protein chemical antidotes, and products to  diagnose or treat the effects of exposure to radiological or nuclear agents.  BARDA officials told us that the CIADMs are intended to assist in  developing biologics-based countermeasures because a 2008 study  commissioned by HHS and DOD examining vaccine manufacturing  facility alternatives found that there is a sufficient domestic supply of  contract manufacturing organizations that could be called upon in a public  health emergency to produce small molecule countermeasures.", "The CIADMs\u2019 services are intended to support countermeasure  developers who have existing contracts with BARDA and countermeasure  developers who have contracts with other PHEMCE partners, such as  DOD and NIH. based CBRN countermeasure contracts that are eligible, in whole or in  part, to receive core services from the CIADMs. BARDA officials indicated  that the CBRN medical countermeasures to be developed under these  contracts are consistent with the countermeasures identified as HHS  priorities in the 2012 PHEMCE implementation plan. For example, the  PHEMCE implementation plan identified the development of an anthrax  vaccine as a priority, and 4 of the 23 eligible CBRN medical  countermeasure projects focus on developing anthrax vaccine.", "DOD is also developing an advanced development and manufacturing center for  medical countermeasure developers. BARDA officials told us that once the DOD facility is  built and operational, the HHS and DOD centers\u2019 services will be available under a unified  umbrella to provide medical countermeasure development and manufacturing assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "As Core Services Have Not Yet Been Provided, It Is Too Early to Tell How Helpful They Will Be to Countermeasure Developers", "paragraphs": ["BARDA has not issued any task orders for core services to date, as the  CIADMs are still completing activities associated with the contract base  periods. Therefore, it is too early to tell the extent to which  countermeasure developers may use CIADM services and how helpful  the core services may be to support medical countermeasure  development. Under the CIADM contracts, amounts awarded during the  contract base period are to fund the construction of physical  infrastructure, either the building of new facilities or the retrofitting of  existing ones, and other preparations necessary to provide core services  to countermeasure developers. As such, the base period of the contract  provides a framework to help support countermeasure development, but  no direct provision of core services. After the CIADM contractor  establishes this framework, BARDA is to award task orders to CIADMs to  provide core services to countermeasure developers. Because the  CIADMs have not yet completed base period activities, BARDA has not  yet issued task orders to provide core services. BARDA officials told us  that two CIADMs may be able to provide core services as soon as 2014,  a year earlier than planned. According to BARDA officials, once each of  the CIADMs have completed construction or retrofitting, so that there is  sufficient space to conduct core service activities, BARDA will evaluate  and confirm the technical capabilities and capacity of each CIADM to  provide core services prior to issuing task orders for these services.", "Once the CIADMs are operational, BARDA and other agencies that  participate in PHEMCE are to select eligible countermeasure  development projects for those developers who want to access the  CIADMs and issue task orders for core services. In order to select eligible  contracts and issue task orders, HHS and PHEMCE have created a  CIADM steering committee consisting of senior level officials from  BARDA, CDC, FDA, NIH, and DOD. HHS has completed documents that  provide governance for this process: a signed charter for the steering  committee, preliminary criteria for selecting eligible contracts, and a  signed governance document describing how the process will operate.  Under the process, the steering committee issues a data call, and in  response, medical countermeasure project managers from BARDA, NIH,  and DOD are to submit proposals for current medical countermeasure  contracts that would benefit from core services provided by the CIADMs  to the CIADM steering committee.review the proposals and select the countermeasure projects and  developers to which it will offer access to the CIADMs\u2019 core services.  Next, HHS plans to issue task order requests for each selected project,  and the CIADMs will be required to submit proposals in response to the  task order requests. Finally, according to BARDA officials, BARDA plans  to issue a task order to the CIADM contractor whose proposal best  satisfies the selection factors for award under the task order. BARDA  officials told us that the CIADM steering committee met in January 2014  and plans to meet at least semiannually.", "The steering committee is to then  While it is too early to tell how effective HHS\u2019s approach to providing core  services to CBRN medical countermeasure developers through the  CIADMs will be, some industry stakeholders we interviewed expressed  concerns about demand, availability of funding, and communication with  BARDA. For example, some stakeholders questioned whether there  would be a sufficient number of countermeasure developers who need  advanced development support and who might choose to receive those  services from the CIADMs. BARDA officials told us that they have  conducted surveys of developers with current BARDA contracts about  their interest in receiving core services from the CIADMs. As a result,  according to officials, BARDA anticipates having a greater demand for  core services than the CIADMs will be able to supply. Additionally,  industry stakeholders we spoke to expressed concern that insufficient  funding for task orders may affect the success of the CIADMs. BARDA  officials told us that funding for task orders will either come from BARDA\u2019s  budget for specific medical countermeasures, or from other agencies,  such as NIH, through interagency agreements, but that the availability of  funds for specific development projects would play a role in deciding  which projects would receive core services. BARDA officials told us that  they expect to have sufficient funding for task orders in fiscal years 2014  and 2015.", "Some industry stakeholders that we talked to also indicated that BARDA  has not yet provided detailed information to industry partners about how  countermeasure developers will request and use core services from the  CIADMs. BARDA officials told us that BARDA featured the CIADMs and  explained CIADM operations at its November 2013 Industry Days. At  this time, the eligible countermeasure developers are only those who  have current development contracts with BARDA, NIH, and DOD."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS, and its comments are reprinted  in appendix III.
