Further, LCS 1 and LCS 2 have experienced major cost growth and schedule delays. In August 2010, GAO reported that the ships were incomplete at delivery and in November 2013, GAO reported on significant quality problems with Navy ships, including LCS 1 and LCS 2, noting that the Navy regularly accepts ships with numerous open deficiencies.", "Congress mandated that GAO review the Navy's compliance with federal regulations in accepting LCS 1 and LCS 2.

The Navy also met FAR requirements related to responsibility for and place of acceptance, among other provisions, by using an authorized Navy representative to accept each ship at its respective contractor's facility. Under the cost-reimbursement contracts, the LCS 1 and LCS 2 prime contractors were only required to give their best efforts to complete quality-related activities\u2014along with the other work specified in the contracts\u2014up to each contract's estimated cost. These efforts resulted in both ships not completing all required sea trials\u2014tests that evaluate ships' overall quality and performance against contractual requirements\u2014including acceptance and final contract trials, as shown in the table below.", "Not completing these trials increased knowledge gaps related to ship performance and deficiencies. In addition, LCS 1 and LCS 2 did not meet the quality standards outlined in the Navy's ship acceptance policy, although the policy also contains several notable flexibilities to these standards. In particular, the policy recognizes situations where the Navy may defer work until after delivery and final acceptances and affords the Chief of Naval Operations the authority to waive certain quality standards outlined in the policy. The Navy relied extensively on these waivers to facilitate its trials and acceptance processes for LCS 1 and LCS 2.", "Navy decisions to accept delivery of LCS 1 and LCS 2 in incomplete, deficient conditions were driven by a focus on near-term cost performance by shipbuilders, a desire to introduce the long-delayed ships to the fleet, and\u2014in the case of LCS 1\u2014environmental and treaty considerations associated with constructing that ship adjacent to the Great Lakes. The Navy prioritized these factors over its quality assurance processes for both ships, which has caused it to devote considerably more time and money to resolving deficiencies after delivery than anticipated. However, because the Navy did not establish clear deadlines for resolving ship deficiencies, corrections were allowed to lag, to the point that fleet operators inherited unresolved deficiencies on each ship. These deficiencies have constrained recent shipboard operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Because the opportunity to implement acquisition changes to these two ships has passed, GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report, but has made prior recommendations to improve LCS acquisition.

Unlike other Navy surface combatants, which generally have fixed  mission systems, LCS is intended to be reconfigurable to perform three  different primary missions: mine countermeasures, surface warfare, and  anti-submarine warfare. The LCS consists of two distinct parts: (1) a  seaframe, which is essentially the ship itself, and (2) a mission package,  which is an interchangeable set of sensors, weapons, aircraft, surface  craft, and subsurface vehicles carried on and deployed from the  seaframe.", "The LCS will represent a large portion of the Navy\u2019s future surface  combatant fleet. Currently, the Navy plans to spend over $25 billion (in  2010 dollars) to acquire 32 LCS seaframes\u2014in two variants from two  contractors\u2014and 64 mission packages. The Navy had planned to acquire  52 seaframes but in February 2014, the Secretary of Defense directed the  Navy to not contract for more than 32 ships, citing concerns about the  ships\u2019 capabilities\u2014including survivability and lethality. The Secretary  directed the Navy to revisit the designs of both seaframe variants; that  review is ongoing.

To evaluate the basis for and outcomes from the Navy\u2019s  acceptance decisions, we analyzed Navy and contractor documents  detailing LCS 1 and LCS 2 construction costs and schedules, testing  plans, and deficiency correction plans. In addition, we analyzed Navy  budget submissions and post-delivery work agreements to evaluate how  and whether the Navy achieved the post-delivery cost efficiencies it  anticipated when accepting LCS 1 and LCS 2. We obtained Navy data to  determine the number and type of deficiencies for each vessel. We  reviewed information about the data and the system that produced them,  and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report for the ships we reviewed. We also reviewed fleet reports on  equipment casualties to understand the extent to which persisting LCS 1  and LCS 2 deficiencies have affected recent operations.

Cost- reimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs,  to the extent prescribed in the contract, and establish an estimate of the  total cost of the contract\u2014referred to as the total estimated cost or ceiling  cost. This contract type places most of the risk on the government, which  may pay more than budgeted should incurred costs be more than  expected when the contract is signed, and can be appropriate for use on  complex research and development projects when performance  uncertainties or the likelihood of changes makes it difficult to estimate  performance costs in advance. Under this contracting arrangement, the  contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified  under the contract within the estimated cost. However, the government  must reimburse the contractor for its allowable costs regardless of  whether the contractor completes work on the particular item. The Navy  contracted for the remaining seaframes currently under contract using  fixed-price incentive contracts. Fixed-price incentive contracts place  increased risk on the contractor, which generally bears some  responsibility for increased costs of performance, including full  responsibility once the contract\u2019s price ceiling is exceeded.", "The Navy\u2019s acquisition strategy for LCS seaframes has changed several  times over the past decade. The original plan was to fund one or two  initial ships\u2014in what the Navy called a Flight 0 configuration\u2014based on  the designs it selected through a conceptual design competition, and then  spend time experimenting with the seaframes and overall LCS concept.", "Further, the significant differences between the two seaframe designs lent  even more importance to the experimentation concept to inform a  decision about which seaframe design was better suited to meet the  Navy\u2019s needs. After a down-select decision, the winning design was to be  procured in larger numbers, with any design changes incorporated into a  new Flight 1 configuration. The Navy abandoned this strategy, however,  after concluding it would be unrealistic to expect the two competing  shipyards to build only one or two ships and then wait for the Navy to  complete the period of experimentation before awarding additional  contracts.

According to LCS seaframe program officials,  the LCS shipbuilders did not have strong incentives to complete the ships  and deliver them to the Navy, in part because of the cost-reimbursement  contracts that were in place. Consequently, the Navy pushed the delivery  process forward for the ships\u2014despite incomplete work and  deficiencies\u2014once the ships met minimal safe-to-sail conditions.", "According to LCS seaframe program officials, the program was confident  that lower pricing for remaining work could be obtained after delivery by  using different shipyards than Marinette Marine and Austal USA, where  LCS construction took place. However, the Navy may not have achieved  these anticipated cost benefits. Most notably, the Navy did not assess  whether the eventual post-delivery shipyards\u2014including Colonna\u2019s  Shipyard (Norfolk, Virginia), BAE Systems Ship Repair (San Diego,  California and Norfolk, Virginia), and General Dynamics NASSCO (San  Diego, California)\u2014would provide better pricing than the original  construction yards. Instead, SUPSHIP officials reported that the Navy  only completed assessments as to whether the eventual post delivery  shipyards\u2019 pricing was fair and reasonable as compared to other  shipyards in their own respective geographic areas. These geographic  areas did not include Wisconsin or Alabama, where Marinette Marine and  Austal USA\u2014the original LCS construction yards\u2014are located,  respectively.", "The cost-reimbursement type contracts used to construct LCS 1 and LCS  2 included both incentive and award fees to incentivize contractor  performance. The incentive fee was designed to reward the contractor for  controlling contract costs by increasing the fee when the costs incurred  during contract performance were less than the contract\u2019s target cost.

These agreements  anticipated placement of orders on a cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award- fee, or fixed price basis. Most of the orders we reviewed were placed on a  cost-plus-fixed-fee basis, where the contractor is reimbursed for its  allowable incurred costs to the extent prescribed in the contract, and  receives a fee that is fixed at the outset. These new agreements allowed  Navy program officials to reprioritize work based on available funding and  the ships\u2019 testing schedules.

We also evaluated LCS 1 and LCS 2 trial plans and results and deficiency  correction plans, as outlined in program acquisition strategies, SUPSHIP  and program office briefings, Navy Board of Inspection and Survey  (INSURV) reports, and budget documentation. These steps enabled us to  identify the key factors responsible for the Navy\u2019s decision to accept  these ships.

To determine the number and type of  deficiencies for each vessel, we obtained and used data from the Navy\u2019s  Technical Support Management (TSM) system. TSM is the primary  database SUPSHIP uses to track the status of new ship construction  deficiencies. We analyzed these data to determine the total number of  open, starred deficiencies at key intervals including (1) when the Navy  accepted delivery of each ship (preliminary acceptance); (2) at the end of  each ship\u2019s guaranty period, approximately 8 months following  preliminary acceptance; and (3) when the ships were transferred to the  fleet, which the Navy indicated occurred in February 2013 for LCS 1 and  February 2014 for LCS 2. Total starred deficiencies are those identified  during acceptance trials. The data we collected represents the  deficiencies at a particular moment in time.
