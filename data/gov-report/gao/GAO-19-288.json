The 2017 breach of data at Equifax raised concerns about federal agencies' remote identity proofing processes.", "GAO was asked to review federal agencies' remote identity proofing practices in light of the recent Equifax breach and the potential for fraud. The objectives of this review were to (1) describe federal practices for remote identity proofing and the risks associated with those practices, (2) assess federal agencies' actions to ensure the effectiveness of agencies' remote identity proofing processes, and (3) assess the sufficiency of federal identity proofing guidance.", "To do so, GAO identified remote identity proofing practices used by six agencies (CMS, GSA, IRS, SSA, USPS, and VA) with major, public-facing web applications providing public access to benefits or services. GAO compared the agencies' practices to NIST's remote identity proofing guidance to assess their effectiveness, and compared NIST's and OMB's guidance to requirements in federal law and best practices in IT management to assess the sufficiency of the guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Remote identity proofing is the process federal agencies and other entities use to verify that the individuals who apply online for benefits and services are who they claim to be. To perform remote identity proofing, agencies that GAO reviewed rely on consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) to conduct a procedure known as knowledge-based verification. This type of verification involves asking applicants seeking federal benefits or services personal questions derived from information found in their credit files, with the assumption that only the true owner of the identity would know the answers. If the applicant responds correctly, their identity is considered to be verified. For example, the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses this technique to verify the identities of individuals seeking access to the \u201cMy Social Security\u201d service, which allows them to check the status of benefit applications, request a replacement Social Security or Medicare card, and request other services.", "However, data stolen in recent breaches, such as the 2017 Equifax breach, could be used fraudulently to respond to knowledge-based verification questions. The risk that an attacker could obtain and use an individual's personal information to answer knowledge-based verification questions and impersonate that individual led the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to issue guidance in 2017 that effectively prohibits agencies from using knowledge-based verification for sensitive applications. Alternative methods are available that provide stronger security, as shown in Figure 1. However, these methods may have limitations in cost, convenience, and technological maturity, and they may not be viable for all segments of the public.", "Two of the six agencies that GAO reviewed have eliminated knowledge-based verification. Specifically, the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently developed and began using alternative methods for remote identity proofing for their Login.gov and Get Transcript services that do not rely on knowledge-based verification. One agency\u2014the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\u2014has implemented alternative methods for part of its identity proofing process but still relies on knowledge-based verification for some individuals. SSA and the United States Postal Service (USPS) intend to reduce or eliminate their use of knowledge-based verification sometime in the future but do not yet have specific plans for doing so. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has no plans to reduce or eliminate knowledge-based verification for remote identity proofing.", "Several officials cited reasons for not adopting alternative methods, including high costs and implementation challenges for certain segments of the public. For example, mobile device verification may not always be viable because not all applicants possess mobile devices that can be used to verify their identities. Nevertheless, until these agencies take steps to eliminate their use of knowledge-based verification, the individuals they serve will remain at increased risk of identity fraud.", "NIST has issued guidance to agencies related to identity proofing and OMB has drafted identity management guidance, but their guidance is not sufficient to ensure agencies are adopting such methods. Sound practices in information technology (IT) management state that organizations should provide clear direction on how to implement IT objectives. However, NIST's guidance does not provide direction to agencies on how to successfully implement alternative identity-proofing methods with currently available technologies for all segments of the public. For example, the guidance does not discuss the advantages and limitations of currently available technologies or make recommendations to agencies on which technologies should be adopted. Further, most of the agencies that GAO reviewed reported that they were not able to implement the guidance because of limitations in available technologies for implementing alternative identify proofing methods. NIST officials stated that they believe their guidance is comprehensive, and at the time of our review they did not plan to issue supplemental implementation guidance to assist agencies.", "The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 ( FISMA) requires that OMB oversee federal agencies' information security practices. Although OMB has the authority under this statute to issue guidance, OMB has not issued guidance requiring agencies to report on their progress in implementing NIST's identity proofing guidance. OMB staff plan to issue guidance on identity management at federal agencies, but their proposed guidance does not require agencies to report on their progress in implementing NIST guidance. Until NIST provides additional guidance to help agencies move away from knowledge-based verification methods and OMB requires agencies to report on their progress, federal agencies will likely continue to struggle to strengthen their identify proofing processes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to six agencies to strengthen online identify verification processes:", "GAO recommends that CMS, SSA, USPS, and VA develop plans to strengthen their remote identity proofing processes by discontinuing knowledge-based verification.", "GAO recommends that NIST supplement its technical guidance with implementation guidance to assist agencies in adopting more secure remote identity proofing processes.", "GAO recommends that OMB issue guidance requiring federal agencies to report on their progress in adopting secure identity proofing practices.", "Four agencies\u2014Commerce (on behalf of NIST), SSA, USPS, and VA\u2014agreed with GAO's recommendations. These agencies outlined the additional steps they plan to take to improve the security of their remote identity proofing processes. One agency, HHS (on behalf of CMS), disagreed with GAO's recommendation because it did not believe that the available alternatives to knowledge-based verification were feasible for the individuals it serves. However, a variety of alternative methods exist, and GAO continues to believe CMS should develop a plan for discontinuing the use of knowledge-based verification.

However, securing such transactions is  a complex endeavor. A key part of this process is verifying that the  person who is attempting to interact for the first time with an organization,  such as a federal agency or a business, is the individual he or she claims  to be. This process, known as identity proofing, is essential to prevent  fraud, which could cause harm to both individuals and organizations.", "Identity proofing may occur in person or through a remote, online  process. In the case of in-person identity proofing, a trained professional  verifies an individual\u2019s identity by making a direct physical comparison of  the individual\u2019s physical features and other evidence (such as a driver\u2019s  license or other credential) with official records to verify the individual\u2019s  identity. Verification of these credentials can be performed by checking  electronic records in tandem with physical inspection. In-person identity  proofing is considered a strong method of identity proofing.", "However, it may not always be feasible to require that all applicants  appear in person. In such cases, remote identity proofing is performed.  Remote identity proofing is the process of conducting identity proofing  entirely through an online exchange of information. When remote identity  proofing is used, there is no way to confirm an individual\u2019s identity through  their physical presence. Instead, the individual provides the information  electronically, or performs other electronically verifiable actions that  demonstrate his or her identity. Because many federal benefits and  services are offered broadly to large numbers of geographically dispersed  applicants, agencies often rely on remote identity proofing to verify the  identities of applicants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of the Remote Identity Proofing Process", "paragraphs": ["Remote identity proofing involves two major steps: (1) resolution and (2)  validation and verification. During the resolution step, an organization  determines which specific identity an applicant is claiming when they first  attempt to initiate a transaction, such as enrolling for federal benefits or  services, remotely. The most common form of remote interaction is  through an organization\u2019s website. The organization starts the identity  resolution process by having the applicant provide identifying information,  typically through a web-based application form. Examples of information  that an organization may collect for identity resolution include name,  address, date of birth, and Social Security number.", "The organization then electronically compares the applicant\u2019s identifying  information with electronic records that it already has in its databases or  with records maintained by another entity, such as a CRA, to determine  (or \u201cresolve\u201d) which identity is being claimed. For example, if an individual  named John Smith were applying, the organization would obtain enough  identifying information about him to determine which \u201cJohn Smith\u201d he is  from among the thousands of John Smiths that it may have in its records  or that may be documented in the records of the CRA that it is using for  this process.", "Once the resolution process is complete, the process of validation and  verification occurs. In this process, steps are taken to verify whether the  applicant is really who they claim to be. For example, in the case of John  Smith, it is not enough simply to determine which John Smith is being  claimed, because the claimant may not really be John Smith at all.  Organizations need to obtain electronic evidence from the remote  applicant to verify their identity. Organizations can use a variety of  techniques to accomplish this goal. Knowledge-based verification is a  technique that commonly has been used for this purpose.", "With knowledge-based verification, organizations ask applicants detailed  and personal questions, under the presumption that only the real person  will know the answers to these questions. To do this, the organization  poses a series of multiple choice questions through an online web form,  and the applicant selects the appropriate responses and submits the  answers through the web form. If the applicant has chosen the correct  responses, through the remotely accessed web form, their identity is  considered to be verified, and the validation and verification step is  complete. Figure 1 depicts the typical process that organizations use for  remote identity proofing (including the use of knowledge-based  verification)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of CRAs in Knowledge-Based Verification", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, to perform knowledge-based verification for  remote identity-proofing, federal agencies and other organizations often  use services provided by CRAs. The CRAs assemble and evaluate  consumer credit and other information from a wide variety of sources.  Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion\u2014the three nationwide CRAs\u2014use the  personal information they obtain about individuals from organizations,  such as financial institutions, utilities, cell phone service providers, public  records, and government sources, to compile credit files containing  detailed records about individuals. They then use the information in these  files to offer a variety of services to federal agencies and other entities.  These services can include identity verification, as well as verification of  income and employment of a candidate for a job or an applicant for  benefits or services.", "To support organizations that rely on knowledge-based verification, CRAs  generate multiple choice questions that organizations can use to test  applicants\u2019 knowledge of information in their credit files. The organizations  using the CRA services do not generate the questions themselves,  because they do not have access to the credit history information  maintained by the CRAs. Rather, the CRAs\u2019 remote identity proofing  systems transmit the questions and multiple choice answers to the  organization through an automated electronic connection with the  organization\u2019s website. The organization\u2019s website then displays the  questions and multiple choice answers to the applicant through the web  application that the applicant is using to apply for access to benefits or  services.", "Typically, the questions generated by CRA identity proofing systems ask  about lenders, mortgage details, current and past home addresses, or  credit card accounts. Once the applicant has selected answers to the  questions and enters them in the online application, the organization\u2019s  automated system electronically relays the applicant\u2019s responses to the  CRA\u2019s remote identity proofing system; this system then compares the  responses with information in the applicant\u2019s credit file. If this comparison  determines that the applicant correctly responded to the questions, then  the applicant\u2019s identity is considered to be verified.

Specific examples of such techniques  include:", "Remote assessment of physical credentials. Recently developed  technology allows an agency to remotely examine a physical  credential, such as a driver\u2019s license or a passport, to verify an  individual\u2019s identity. For example, an agency may have the individual  use their mobile device, such as a cell phone, to capture and submit  an image of their driver\u2019s license to an agency or commercial provider  of identity proofing services. The agency or commercial provider can  then compare the image to documentation on file to confirm the  authenticity of the credential. Technological advances in how images  are captured and processed by mobile devices, such as cell phones,  can provide improved assurance that the photos transmitted by these  devices are genuine and that the credentials are authentic.", "Verification of mobile device possession. Many individuals use  their cell phones on a near-continuous basis and keep their phones  with them. These actions create a record of the owner\u2019s connection  with these mobile devices that is difficult for an imposter to falsify.", "Accordingly, an organization can query records maintained by cell  phone carriers to verify the identity of an individual who is in  possession of a specific mobile device and phone number. By doing  this, the organization can determine how long the individual has had  that particular device, compare unique identifiers, and determine if the  location matches the individual\u2019s billing information. The organization  can be confident that the individual legitimately possesses the device  if the device has been in use for some time and its current location  corresponds to one where the device has been known to be used by  its owner. Since an individual\u2019s location information is obtained  directly from the device and compared with cell phone carrier records,  data entry errors by the individual, such as mistyping a phone  number, are minimized and the risk of impersonation is reduced.", "Verification through mobile device confirmation codes. An  additional method that organizations use to help verify an individual\u2019s  identity is to verify that an individual possesses a telephone number  that they have supplied as part of the remote identity proofing  process. Organizations perform verification of an individual\u2019s  possession of a phone number by sending a code to that phone  number through the short message service (SMS) or another protocol,  and ask the individual to enter the code into the online identity  proofing application. This process can provide additional assurance  about the individual\u2019s identity because the verification code is  transmitted through a separate electronic channel (specifically, the  telephone system) from the online application where the remote  identity proofing process was initiated.", "However, unlike the process for verifying the possession of a mobile  device, the use of these codes may not prevent an imposter from  using a stolen phone or stolen phone number. An imposter may be  able to successfully complete the identity verification process if the  applicant\u2019s possession of the physical device has not been  independently verified. In its remote identity proofing guidance, NIST  requires federal agencies to use confirmation codes as a supplement  to other identity proofing measures.", "Verification through postal mail confirmation codes. Another  method that organizations use to help verify an individual\u2019s identity is  to send a confirmation code, such as a personal identification number  (PIN), through the mail system to the individual\u2019s address of record.  The individual then enters the PIN in the organization\u2019s online  application to confirm that they received the code in the mail. Like the  use of mobile device confirmation codes, the use of postal mail codes  can provide additional assurance about the individual\u2019s identity  because the code is sent through a separate medium from the online  application where the remote identity proofing process was initiated.", "Even with these alternatives to knowledge-based verification, however,  there are limitations to the security assurances that can be provided. One  way to overcome these security limitations is for a trained professional to  conduct identity proofing in person. This is generally considered to be a  strong approach because it allows for direct physical comparison of an  individual\u2019s documentation, including photographic evidence, to the  individual attempting to enroll. Verification of the credentials being  submitted can be performed by checking electronic records in tandem  with physical inspection.", "Figure 2 provides examples of alternative identity verification and  validation methods that federal agencies have reported using.", "Each of the alternatives to knowledge-based verification has other  limitations, including implementation challenges. For example, in-person  identity proofing is expensive to implement because it requires  organizations to staff and maintain offices or other physical access points  in multiple locations, and it can be inconvenient for applicants because it  requires travel to one of these locations. Mobile device verification may  not always be viable because not all applicants possess a mobile device  that can be used to verify their identity. In addition, fraudsters can  manipulate or \u201cspoof\u201d phone numbers that redirect phone calls and SMS  confirmation codes to an attacker.
