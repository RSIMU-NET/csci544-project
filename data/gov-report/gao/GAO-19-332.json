For example, while DOE conducted a risk assessment, that assessment had significant methodological limitations and did not fully analyze grid cybersecurity risks. One such key limitation was that the assessment used a model that covered only a portion of the grid and reflected how that portion existed around 1980. Until DOE has a complete grid cybersecurity plan, the guidance the plan provides decision makers in allocating resources to address those risks will likely be limited.", "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)\u2014the regulator for the interstate transmission of electricity\u2014has approved mandatory grid cybersecurity standards.

Without a full consideration of the framework, there is increased risk that grid entities will not fully implement leading cybersecurity practices.", "In addition, FERC's approved threshold for which entities must comply with the requirements in the full set of grid cybersecurity standards is based on an analysis that did not evaluate the potential risk of a coordinated cyberattack on geographically distributed targets. Such an attack could target, for example, a combination of geographically dispersed systems that each fall below the threshold for complying with the full set of standards. Responding to such an attack could be more difficult than to a localized event since resources may be geographically distributed rather than concentrated in the same area.

For  example, disaster-related events\u2014such as hurricanes\u2014may involve  significant lead time before the incident. This allows owners and  operators to take preemptive measures to protect their systems, develop  restoration plans, and activate personnel. In contrast, cyberattacks may  occur without warning, leaving owners and operators no time to prepare  for a response. In addition, cyberattacks could target and damage specific  types of components or facilities across a dispersed geographic area.

In particular, proprietary devices in these systems are  being replaced by cheaper and more widely available devices that use  traditional IT networking protocols\u2014including those that support remote  access. These newer devices can provide the system operator with more  detailed data on the conditions of the transmission and distribution  systems and with better tools to observe and manage the grid. Remote  access capabilities in the devices can also make them easier to maintain.  Further, industrial control systems are being designed and implemented  using traditional IT computers and operating systems, which allow  corporate business and industrial control system networks to be  connected more easily.", "Nonetheless, cyberattacks on industrial control systems supporting grid  operations may require a degree of sophistication and knowledge beyond  what is needed to conduct cyberattacks on IT systems.

In addition, malicious actors could scan for unsecured  wireless networks connected to industrial control system devices  while in close proximity to the devices (referred to as \u201cwar driving\u201d).", "If implemented effectively, modern cybersecurity practices often  protect against techniques used to remotely access industrial control  system devices, and only allow trusted connections. However, to  circumvent these practices, a malicious actor could, for example,  compromise a vendor\u2019s network\u2014which is often trusted by owners  and operators\u2014and use the trusted connection to remotely connect to  industrial control system devices.", "Connections to corporate business networks. Industrial control  systems, which were once largely isolated from the internet and  business IT systems, are increasingly connected in modern energy  systems, allowing cyberattacks to originate in business IT systems  and migrate to industrial control systems. For example, malicious  nation-state actors used spear phishing emails to deploy malware  on business IT networks in the 2015 attack on Ukrainian electricity  utilities. After gaining initial access to the business IT networks, the  attackers reportedly used a variety of techniques to migrate to the  industrial control system networks of the utilities.", "Moreover, even if industrial control systems are not physically  connected to business IT systems, malicious actors can exploit the  use of removable media between the two networks. For example, as  previously mentioned, contractors were reported to have unwittingly  introduced malware on uranium enrichment facility workstations in  Iran by using USB devices that were infected with the malware on the  contractors\u2019 business IT network to transfer information to the uranium  enrichment facility\u2019s workstations.", "Figure 3 illustrates how malicious actors could leverage this increasing  attack surface to compromise industrial control systems.", "Compounding the risk associated with the increased attack surface, many  legacy industrial control systems were not designed with cybersecurity  protections because they were not intended to be connected to networks,  such as the internet. For example, many legacy devices are not able to  authenticate commands to ensure that they have been sent from a valid  user and may not be capable of running modern encryption protocols. In  addition, some legacy devices do not have the capability to log  commands sent to the devices, making it more difficult to detect malicious  activity.", "Additionally, even in the case of more modern devices, the safety and  efficiency goals of the grid and the supporting industrial control systems  can conflict with the goal of security in the design and operation of  industrial control systems. According to an Idaho National Laboratory  analysis, grid owners and operators may not always be able to identify  industrial control system vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Vulnerability  scanning is often used in IT systems to validate proper system  configuration and to identify any vulnerabilities that may be present.  However, conventional IT vulnerability scanning can disable or shut down  energy delivery systems, and testing may not always detect vulnerabilities  deep within industrial control system software.", "Further, even if owners and operators are able to identify industrial control  system cybersecurity vulnerabilities, they may not be able to address  those vulnerabilities in a timely manner because certain industrial control  system devices may have high availability requirements to support grid  operations. These devices typically need to be taken offline to apply  patches to fix cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In addition, grid owners and  operators need to rigorously test the patches before applying them.  Security patches are typically tested by vendors, but they can degrade or  alter the functionality of industrial control systems, which can have  serious consequences for grid operations.", "Consequently, there is increased risk that malicious actors may be able to  exploit vulnerabilities in industrial control system devices before patches  can be applied. According to DHS, the number of vulnerability advisories  for industrial control systems devices has steadily increased, from 17  advisories in 2010 to 223 advisories in 2018 (see fig. 4).", "Moreover, supply chains for industrial control systems can introduce  vulnerabilities that could be exploited for a cyberattack. For example,  there is a potential for manufacturers and developers to\u2014wittingly or  unwittingly\u2014include unauthorized code or malware in industrial control  system devices and systems that provides a back door into the  equipment or that allows the program to \u201ccall home\u201d once installed.  Further, manufacturers and software developers create their products in  many different locations around the world, thus making them potentially  susceptible to foreign-based threats. For example, a capable nation-state  could gather useful information on the types of equipment used at a  particular utility with the intent to undermine security controls at a later  time.", "In addition, manufacturers and developers have made sensitive  information publicly available regarding the operation of their hardware  and software. For example, manufacturers and developers have  published vendor manuals, which include information such as default passwords and operating instructions. These manuals often appear on  the internet and can aid malicious actors in conducting cyberattacks on  industrial control systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consumer IoT Devices Connected to the Grid", "paragraphs": ["Researchers and federal agencies have recently identified concerns  about the potential introduction of cyber vulnerabilities to the grid through  the connection of consumer IoT devices to the grid\u2019s distribution network.  For example, university researchers in 2018 used large, real-world grid  models to simulate the feasibility and impact on the grid of a coordinated  cyberattack on smart home appliances. Specifically, the researchers  found that malicious threat actors could compromise a large number of  high-wattage IoT devices (e.g., air conditioners and heaters) and turn  them into a botnet\u2014a network of devices infected with malicious software  and controlled as a group without the owners\u2019 knowledge.", "The malicious actors could then use the botnet to launch a coordinated  attack aimed at manipulating the demand across distribution grids. For  example, according to the researchers, one such attack could involve  synchronously switching on all of the compromised devices. Such an  attack could disrupt the balance of power generation and consumption  and ultimately cause an outage.", "An official from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory explained that  the likelihood of attacks on the distribution network using IoT devices is  low but could increase in the future. In particular, the official explained  that the wattage needed to create a significant disruption in the balance of  supply and demand would require a botnet of tens of thousands of smart  appliances. Botnets of this size have been created, but the laboratory  official explained that it would be very difficult to manipulate all of those  devices to turn on at precisely the same time.

For example, in  December 2015, malicious actors linked by Ukrainian officials to the  Russian government conducted cyberattacks on three Ukrainian power  distribution operators, resulting in a loss of power for about 225,000  customers. GAO did not find evidence that these attacks physically  damaged grid components, but cyberattacks on industrial control systems  in other sectors demonstrates that this is possible. For example, in 2014,  malicious cyber actors compromised industrial control systems and  caused failures that led to massive damage to a blast furnace at a  German steel mill.", "Further, federal agencies have performed three assessments of the  potential impacts of cyberattacks on the industrial control systems  supporting the grid.

The two DOE assessments\u2014which according to DOE  officials are early drafts and have not gone through intra-agency review\u2014  focused on the impact of a cyberattack within a single interconnection and  produced varying reports of the potential scale of power outages that  could result from a cyberattack. The remaining assessment\u2014which  FERC conducted in 2013\u2014reviewed the impact of a cyber or physical  attack on all three interconnections and concluded that an attack could  result in a widespread blackout spanning the contiguous United States.

Specifically, at that time,  DOE officials reported that they found several of the scenario\u2019s  assumptions highly unlikely, including peak capabilities at all targeted  generation stations at the time of an attack and the loss of all safety  systems designed to prevent the consequences described in the  analysis. Further, DOE officials reported that they found the study\u2019s  scenarios even more unlikely to result in a total loss of power or any  other consequence that could be reasonably expected to result in  damage to national security.", "The 2017 assessment conducted by DOE\u2019s Argonne National  Laboratory was limited in scope to a six-state region. In addition, the  assessment focused on a single cyberattack scenario and noted that  many other grid cyberattack methods and outcomes were possible.", "The 2017, 2018, and 2019 editions of DOE\u2019s draft Electricity  Subsector Risk Characterization Study have significant  methodological limitations. Specifically, officials from Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory who were contracted to perform the  analyses cautioned that they used a reduced model of the Western  Interconnection as it existed around 1980 and emphasized that their  methodology should not be used to predict the behavior of the actual  bulk power system. For example, those researchers told us that their  selected model of the Western Interconnection had less than a  quarter of its actual capacity in 2018.", "The DOE official responsible for the studies said that the assumption  for the worst-case scenario was from that official\u2019s professional  judgement, not a documented analysis. Later, officials at Sandia  National Laboratories told us that the worst-case scenario in the DOE  draft study was a point solution used as a proof of concept, that the  study was not of a high level of rigor, and that the assumptions may  not represent a vulnerability in the actual bulk power system. Further,  the DOE methodology assumed that all assets removed from service  were treated equally; accordingly, the researchers did not distinguish  the loss of specific assets (such as a substation or transmission line)  in the calculation of attack difficulty and likelihood.", "Because of these limitations, some of the draft studies\u2019 conclusions  may not be realistic. For example, one of DOE\u2019s major conclusions in  the 2017 Risk Characterization Study\u2014that a cyberattack may result  in a relatively small loss of load in the United States about 8 times per  year\u2014may not be plausible because there have not been any  reported cyberattacks that have caused an outage in the United  States. In addition, the three draft DOE studies have widely varying  conclusions on the likelihood of cyberattacks across the selected  range of loss of load. For example, the 2018 draft study concluded  that a cyberattack resulting in a more substantial loss of load had an  average likelihood of occurring nearly once every 10 years, while the  2019 draft study concluded that such an attack would occur about  once every 100 years. According to a DOE official, there is no  documentation of the technical basis for the significant changes in the  assessment outcomes between the 2017 and 2018 draft studies and  between the 2018 and 2019 draft studies.

In addition, FERC officials stated that, while the Commission  uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as a resource and its approved  standards incorporate certain facets of the framework, there is not a one- on-one alignment because the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is not  industry specific. According to FERC officials, the framework addresses  certain issues outside FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, FERC officials  stated that the Commission does not have authority to directly impose  obligations on suppliers, vendors, or entities outside its jurisdiction that  provide products or services to electric industry stakeholders.", "However, full implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework does  not require regulatory agencies to impose obligations on entities over  which the regulatory agencies do not have authority.

FERC  approved the 1,500-megawatt threshold based on the results of a NERC  analysis. Specifically, NERC staff selected a threshold value based on  the loss of one large electric grid asset from a single disruptive event and  assumed a loss of power could be compensated, in part, by power from a  neighboring region.", "However, the analysis did not evaluate the potential risk of a coordinated  cyberattack on geographically distributed targets. A coordinated  cyberattack could cause multiple power plants, transmission lines, or  related grid components in different regions to disconnect from the grid.  Such a cyberattack could target, for example, a combination of low- impact systems, each affecting a generation capacity below 1,500  megawatts that, in aggregate, might present a significant risk to the grid.", "FERC officials told us that the agency considered but did not evaluate the  potential impact of a coordinated cyberattack on geographically  distributed targets at the time it approved the threshold because the  agency did not have the information it needed to develop a credible threat  scenario. FERC officials said they anticipate that a future update to the  approved cybersecurity standards may require the collection of relevant  data on suspicious cyber activity that could inform a threat scenario for  evaluating the potential impact of a coordinated cyberattack on  geographically distributed targets. Further, NERC officials told us that,  while NERC has not determined that a modification of the 1,500  megawatt threshold is warranted at this time, they continue to monitor the  risk of a coordinated cyberattack against multiple low-impact systems and  acknowledged that the FERC-approved standards must adapt with the  evolving understanding of cyber threats.", "In addition, NERC officials explained in a written response that the intent  of the 1,500-megawatt threshold is to ensure that industrial control  systems with vulnerabilities that are attributable to a common cause (e.g.,  cybersecurity vulnerabilities in common hardware or software) that could  result in the loss of 1,500 megawatts or more of generation capacity are  adequately protected. Those officials added that NERC encourages  entities to disaggregate their industrial control systems so that individual  systems operate and maintain less than 1,500 megawatts of generation  capacity. NERC officials noted that the systems associated with the  disaggregated generation capacity are very diverse and are therefore less  likely to provide any large single point of failure. NERC officials further  explained that this disaggregation minimizes the risk to the grid by  requiring a malicious actor to conduct a cyberattack on more facilities to  achieve a similar loss of power.", "However, encouraging grid entities to design industrial control systems so  that individual systems operate and maintain less than 1,500 megawatts  of generation capacity could still leave the grid vulnerable to a cyberattack  on those systems. For example, although a malicious actor may need to  attack more systems that fall under the threshold at multiple locations to  achieve the attacker\u2019s objective for loss of power (when compared with  systems that meet or exceed the threshold), the difficulty of carrying out  an attack on additional systems could be less significant if the attacker  identifies and exploits vulnerabilities common across the systems. In addition, as previously mentioned, systems that fall under the 1,500- megawatt threshold are not required to follow all of the requirements of  the FERC-approved cybersecurity standards; as such, there is increased  risk that important security controls have not been implemented for these  systems.", "According to federal standards for internal control, management should  identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving organizational  objectives.
