Without such processes, SBA cannot be reasonably assured that states are contributing per the law's requirements.", "GAO found that, while OIT has made changes to STEP in response to states' feedback, officials from states with low grant use described ongoing challenges with the program that affect their ability to fully use funds. These challenges include compressed application and award timelines, administrative burden, and poor communication. SBA has not adequately assessed risks to the program, including the risk to achieving program goals posed by some states' low grant fund use rates. Without such an assessment, OIT's ability to support U.S. exporters may be diminished. Further, SBA has not effectively facilitated sharing best practices among states.

Congress established STEP in 2010 and reauthorized the program in  2016 to provide funding for state programs that facilitate export  opportunities for small businesses. According to SBA officials, the goals  of the program are increasing (1) the number of small businesses  exporting, (2) the number of small businesses exploring significant new  trade opportunities, and (3) the value of exports for small businesses  already engaged in international trade. In the years since STEP was first  authorized, SBA has awarded about 300 STEP grants, and these grants  have provided about $139 million of support to almost every U.S. state as  well as several territories. Many states report that STEP is important to  their export promotion operations; however, concerns have been raised  related to the management of the program, including SBA\u2019s processes for  administering and monitoring grants and the effectiveness of the program  in reaching its goals.", "My testimony today is based on our report, which is also being released  today. Our report examines the extent to which (1) SBA\u2019s STEP grants  management process provides reasonable assurance of compliance with  selected requirements of applicable law, and (2) SBA has taken steps to  address challenges states report in using grant funds to achieve program  goals.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed relevant data on award and  matching fund amounts. We reviewed the Small Business Jobs Act of  2010 and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015  (TFTEA), the statutes that established and reauthorized STEP,  respectively. We also reviewed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) federal grant guidance, Uniform Administrative Requirements,  Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform  Guidance), and the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. In addition, we analyzed SBA program documents, and  standard operating procedures for managing SBA grants. We also  interviewed officials from SBA\u2019s Office of International Trade (OIT), which  is responsible for making the awards and administering the program; the  Office of Grants Management (OGM), which is responsible for managing  grants across SBA.", "To identify the states\u2019 challenges to fully using the grant funds, we spoke  with officials from 12 of the 40 states that received a grant in fiscal year  2015, the most recent year for which complete grant expenditure data  were available when we began this work. We selected these states  because they used 75 percent or less of their award in that year. This  group of 12 states constitutes a nongeneralizable sample, and as such,  the challenges that these states reported may not be common to all  states receiving a STEP grant. We conducted the work on which this  statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. More details on our methodology can be found in the  report being released today.", "SBA awards STEP funds annually to state governments through a  competitive application process. According to SBA, the annual STEP  cycle begins with the funding opportunity announcement that SBA posts  on www.grants.gov. This announcement indicates that the grant  application is open and includes objectives, deadlines, eligibility, and  requirements. When a state trade office applies for a STEP grant, its  application outlines any intended activities and establishes performance  targets within each of the activities for the fiscal year or period of the  grant. OIT selects grant recipients and notifies states of their award  status in September. If a state receives a STEP grant, its trade office  provides the funds to local small businesses through an application  process. Once small businesses receive STEP funding, they can use the  money for a variety of export-related purposes. These purposes are  outlined in TFTEA, and include participation in foreign trade missions;  subscriptions to Department of Commerce services; participation in trade  shows, and; training."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SBA\u2019s STEP Grants Management Process Does Not Provide Reasonable Assurance of Compliance with Some Requirements of Applicable Law", "paragraphs": ["Our report found that SBA\u2019s STEP grants management process does not  provide reasonable assurance that STEP grant recipients meet two of the  three TFTEA requirements we reviewed before the grant is closed out.

According to OIT officials,  they use the most recent data available, with an approximately 2- to 3- year lag. OIT officials told us that they planned to use available 2016  Census data to determine the top 10 states for the fiscal year 2018 award  cycle and then, after receiving applications, determine award amounts  that would comply with this requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA\u2019s Review Process Did Not Document that States Met TFTEA\u2019s Total Match Requirement before Grant Closeout", "paragraphs": ["Second, we found SBA\u2019s process did not document that states met  TFTEA\u2019s total match requirement before grant closeout. TFTEA requires  that states provide matching funds, and the total match is typically 25  percent of the combined state-federal amount. At least half of the total  match must be cash. Matching share requirements are often intended to  ensure local financial participation, and may serve to hold down federal  costs. If SBA determines that a state is not providing sufficient matching  funds, it can withhold reimbursement for expenses incurred under the  grant. Figure 1 illustrates the STEP funding proportions described above.", "In our report, we identified four instances where, according to OIT\u2019s  documentation, states reported insufficient total matches\u2014one in fiscal  year 2015 and three in fiscal year 2016. OIT\u2019s documentation showed  that these four states failed to meet the required total matching funds by  about $76,000 combined over these 2 years of the program. SBA told us  they nevertheless had closed these grants.", "OIT officials provided several explanations for their actions. First, OIT  officials told us that of these four states, two submitted additional  information after the grant had closed, indicating that the states had met  the matching requirement. OIT officials stated that they did not verify the  accuracy of the total match information before grant closure because of  OIT staff error. With respect to the other two states, OIT initially stated  that it was working with OGM to verify that the total match requirement  had not been met, and how best to recover the funds. Subsequently, OIT  reported OGM\u2019s determination that one state had in fact met the match  requirement, but that the other had not. In the case of the state that did  not meet the requirement, OGM determined that SBA had overpaid  federal funds to that state by about $19,600. However, after contacting  the state and looking into the matter further, OGM conducted a review of  quarterly reporting documentation for this state, and determined that the  state had in fact exceeded its required match by about $3,800.", "Though all four of the states initially identified were eventually determined  to have met the total match requirement, SBA did not have an adequate  process in place to ensure documentation of a full match before grant  closeout. Federal internal control standards state that management  should design control activities. By designing and executing appropriate  control activities, management helps fulfill its responsibilities and address  identified risks in the internal control system. Without a process for  effectively documenting that the total match requirement has been met  and reviewing this documentation before grant closeout, SBA does not  have reasonable assurance that states have complied with TFTEA\u2019s total  match requirement, and risks overpayment of federal funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Does Not Monitor States\u2019 Compliance with TFTEA\u2019s Cash Match Requirement", "paragraphs": ["Third, we found that OIT\u2019s process does not provide reasonable  assurance that states have complied with the TFTEA cash match  requirement. As previously noted, TFTEA requires that states provide at  least half of their total match in the form of cash. TFTEA allows for the  remaining half to be any mixture of cash, in-kind contributions, and  indirect costs. OIT collects information about the types of expended  matching funds, including the proportion provided in cash; however, OIT  does not have a process in place to use this information to monitor states\u2019  compliance with this requirement.", "OIT documents show that while proposed cash match amounts are  recorded, OIT does not track or analyze states\u2019 expended cash matching  funds during or at the close of the grant cycle. OIT officials told us that  this information is included in the states\u2019 quarterly detailed expenditure  worksheets, and therefore can be reviewed for compliance on a case-by- case basis. However, OIT program officials told us that they do not  regularly analyze this information to determine what proportion of the total  match the cash portion constitutes. The program\u2019s authorizing legislation  does not define \u201ccash,\u201d and neither does the Uniform Guidance. OIT  considers the salaries of state trade office staff who work on  administering the grant to be a form of cash and, according to OIT  officials, most states use state staff salaries as their total match, including  the required cash portion.", "In addition, we found that OIT does not have a process for ensuring that  states reporting staff salaries as their required cash match are not also  using grant funds from STEP to pay for portions of these same salaries.  As such, SBA cannot consistently determine whether states are meeting  the TFTEA cash match requirement, and risks closing out grants for  which states have not met the cash match requirement. Using part of the  grant to cover the cost of the state\u2019s matching requirement in this way  could have the effect of reducing the match below the thresholds  mandated by TFTEA. In our discussions with officials from 12 low-use  states that received STEP grants in fiscal year 2015, 2 states reported  using the grant to offset state staff salaries. When we asked OIT officials  what process they had in place to determine whether states were using  staff salaries paid for with STEP funds as part of their match amount, OIT  officials told us that they were not aware that STEP grantees had  engaged in this practice, and therefore did not monitor for it.", "SBA\u2019s grants management standard operating procedure states that the  agency should monitor grantees for compliance with the terms and  conditions of the awards, which includes compliance with applicable  federal law. Further, according to federal standards for internal control,  management should design and execute control activities, and use quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Management should  process reliable data into quality information to make informed decisions  and evaluate the entity\u2019s performance in achieving key objectives and  addressing risks. Without processes to review whether states are  meeting the cash match requirement, OIT is not implementing its  responsibilities under SBA\u2019s standard operating procedure because it  cannot consistently determine whether states are meeting this  requirement. Without making such a determination, SBA does not have  reasonable assurance that states are contributing to the program as  required by STEP\u2019s authorizing statute.", "In our report, we recommended that the SBA Administrator should  establish a process that ensures documentation of states\u2019 compliance  with the total match requirement before grant closeout, and develop a  process to determine states\u2019 compliance with the cash match  requirement.

TFTEA requires SBA to  publish an annual report regarding STEP, including the best practices of  those states that achieve the highest returns on investment and  significant progress in helping eligible small businesses. While 12 states  used 75 percent or less of their grant funds in the fiscal year 2015 cycle,  19 states used all or almost all of their funds. SBA publishes high-level  information on what it deems to be notable state activities in its annual  report to Congress. OIT officials told us that, when possible, they share  best practices with states that may have difficulty accessing external  markets. However, OIT officials told us that they do not formally facilitate  the sharing of best practices among the states, saying that best practices  for promoting exports in one state might not be transferable to another  state because each state is unique.", "According to the Uniform Guidance, grant recipients\u2019 performance should  be measured in a way that helps the federal awarding agency and other  nonfederal entities improve program outcomes, share lessons learned,  and spread the adoption of promising practices. We have also  previously reported on the importance of collecting and sharing best  practices, as well as the processes for doing so. By sharing detailed  information with all participating states about the approaches that some  grant recipients are using to successfully achieve STEP\u2019s goals, SBA  could encourage all grant recipients to improve the effectiveness of their state STEP programs, including increasing fund use rates in pursuit of  OIT\u2019s stated aim of 100 percent grant fund use.", "In our report, we recommended that the SBA Administrator assess the  risk to achieving program goals posed by some states\u2019 low grant fund use  rates, and that assessing this risk could include examining the challenges  that states reported related to the program\u2019s application and award  processes, administrative burden, and communication.
