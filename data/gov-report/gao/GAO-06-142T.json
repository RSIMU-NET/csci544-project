In addition, organizations need to build up their basic management capacity and must have adequate resources to properly design and effectively implement more market-based and performance-oriented systems. Before implementing dramatic human capital reforms, executive branch agencies should follow a phased approach that meets a \"show me\" test.

In order to respond to a daunting array of governance and  fiscal challenges in the 21st century, the federal government must have the  institutional capacity to plan more strategically, react more expeditiously,  and focus on achieving results.  Critical to the success of this  transformation are the federal government\u2019s people\u2014its human capital.   We have commended the progress that has been made in addressing human  capital challenges in the last few years.  Still, significant opportunities exist  to improve strategic human capital management to respond to current and  emerging 21st century challenges.  For example, the government has not  transformed, in many cases, how it classifies, compensates, develops, and  motivates its employees to achieve maximum results within available  resources and existing authorities.

GAO has also received human capital authorities that have given our  agency  the tools to more effectively support Congress in meeting its  constitutional responsibilities.  We strive to lead by example and  understand that effective implementation of any new policies and  procedures is of critical importance.", "Before discussing the Administration\u2019s draft proposal as we understand it, I  would like to emphasize the following three themes that I believe are  critical to considering any governmentwide approach to civil service  reform.", "First and foremost, we need to move forward with appropriate human  capital reforms, but how it is done, when it is done, and the basis on  which it is done can make all the difference in whether such efforts are  successful.  Human capital reforms to date recognize that the \u201cone-size- fits-all\u201d approach is not appropriate to all agencies\u2019 demands,  challenges, and missions.  However, we have reported that a reasonable  degree of consistency across the government is still desirable and that  broader reforms should be guided by a common framework consisting  of principles, criteria, and processes.", "Before implementing dramatic human capital reforms, executive branch  agencies should follow a phased approach that meets a \u201cshow me\u201d test.

In addition, any new flexibilities are to be exercised in accordance  with the merit system principles; related core values; and protections, such  as against discrimination, political influence, and personal favoritism, of  the civil service.

It also compensates employees living in various localities  without adequately considering the local labor market rates applicable to  the diverse types of occupations in the area.  Importantly, the draft  proposal, as we understand it, incorporates many of the key practices of  more market-based and performance-oriented pay systems and requires  that OPM certify that each agency\u2019s pay for performance system meet  prescribed criteria.

To begin to develop such a system,  organizations assess the skills and knowledge they need; compare  compensation against other public, private, or nonprofit entities competing  for the same talent in a given locality; and classify positions along various  levels of responsibility.  In addition, organizations generally structure their  competitive compensation systems to separate base salary from bonuses  and other incentives and awards.", "Under the draft proposal, OPM is to design a new core classification and  pay system and agencies, in coordination with OPM, are to establish  performance appraisal systems to promote high performance.  Specifically,  the General Schedule is to be repealed and to replace it, OPM is to establish  pay bands for occupational groups based on factors such as mission,  competencies, or relevant labor market features.  For each pay band, OPM  is to establish ranges of basic pay rates that apply in all locations. There are  to be market-oriented pay adjustments.  The governmentwide national  market adjustment is to vary by occupational group and band with the  flexibility to make additional local market adjustments.  Going forward,  more information is needed on what compensation studies are to be  conducted in setting these market-based pay rates.", "Effective performance management systems can be a vital tool for aligning  the organization with desired results and creating a \u201cline of sight\u201d showing  how team, unit, and individual performance can contribute to overall  organizational results. Such systems work to achieve three key objectives:  (1) they strive to provide candid and constructive feedback to help  individuals maximize their contribution and potential in understanding and  realizing the goals and objectives of the organization, (2) they seek to  provide management with the objective and fact-based information it needs  to reward top performers, and (3) they provide the necessary information  and documentation to deal with poor performers.", "The draft proposal incorporates many of the key practices that we have  reported have helped agencies implement effective performance  management systems.  These practices include: Linking Organizational Goals to Individual Performance. Under  the draft proposal, agencies are to set performance expectations that  support and align with the agencies\u2019 mission and strategic goals,  organizational program and policy objectives, annual performance plans,  results, and other measures of performance.  Further, agencies are to  communicate the performance expectations in writing at the beginning of  the appraisal period.", "Making Meaningful Distinctions in Performance. Supervisors and  managers are to be held accountable for making meaningful distinctions  among employees based on performance, fostering and rewarding  excellent performance, and addressing poor performance, among other  things.  Agencies are not to impose a forced distribution of performance  ratings in terms of fixed numeric or percentage limitations on any summary  rating levels.  Performance appraisal systems are to include at least two  summary rating levels, essentially a \u201cpass/fail\u201d system, for employees in an  \u201cEntry/Developmental\u201d band and at least three summary rating levels for  other employee groups.", "Pass/fail systems by definition will not provide meaningful distinctions in  performance ratings.  In addition, while a three-level system might be  workable, using four or five summary rating levels is preferable since it  naturally allows for greater performance rating and pay differentiation.   Moreover, this approach is consistent with the new governmentwide  performance-based pay system for the members of the Senior Executive  Service (SES), which requires agencies to use at least four summary rating  levels to provide a clear and direct link between SES performance and pay  as well as to make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance.   Cascading this approach to other levels of employees can help agencies  recognize and reward employee contributions and achieve the highest  levels of individual performance.", "Linking Pay to Performance. Employees must receive at least a \u201cfully  successful\u201d rating to receive any pay increase.  Those employees who  receive less than a fully successful rating are not to receive an increase,  including the national and local market adjustments discussed above.   Performance pay increases for employees are to be allocated by the  \u201cperformance shares\u201d of a pay pool.  Agencies are to determine the value of  one performance share, expressed as a percentage of the employee\u2019s basic  pay or as a fixed dollar amount. There are to be a set number of  performance shares for each pay pool so that the employees with higher  performance ratings are to receive a greater number of shares and thus, a  greater payout.  At the agency\u2019s discretion, any portion of the employee\u2019s  performance pay increase not converted to a basic pay increase may be  paid out as a lump-sum payment.", "Providing Adequate Safeguards to Ensure Fairness and Guard  Against Abuse. Agencies are to incorporate effective safeguards to  ensure that the management of systems is fair and equitable and based on  employee performance in order to receive certification of their pay for  performance systems.  We have found that a common concern that  employees express about any pay for performance system is whether their  supervisors have the ability and willingness to assess employees\u2019  performance fairly.  Using safeguards, such as having independent  reasonableness reviews of performance management decisions before  such decisions are final, can help to allay these concerns and build a fair  and credible system.  This has been our approach at GAO and we have  found it works extremely well.", "In addition, agencies need to assure reasonable transparency and provide  appropriate accountability mechanisms in connection with the results of  the performance management process. This can include publishing  internally the overall results of performance management and individual  pay decisions while protecting individual confidentiality.  For example, we  found that several of OPM\u2019s demonstration projects publish information for  employees on internal Web sites that include the overall results of  performance appraisal and pay decisions, such as the average performance  rating, the average pay increase, and the average award for the organization  and for each individual unit.  GAO is also publishing aggregate data for all  of our pay, promotion, and other important agency-wide human capital  actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Certification", "paragraphs": ["As I noted, before implementing any human capital reforms, executive  branch agencies should follow a phased approach that meets a \u201cshow me\u201d  test.  That is, each agency should be authorized to implement a reform only  after it has shown it has met certain requirements, including an assessment  of its institutional infrastructure and an independent certification by OPM  of the existence of this infrastructure. This institutional infrastructure  includes (1) a strategic human capital planning process linked to the  agency\u2019s overall strategic plan; (2) capabilities to design and implement a  new human capital system effectively; (3) a modern, effective, credible, and  validated performance management system that provides a clear linkage  between institutional, unit, and individual performance-oriented outcomes,  and results in meaningful distinctions in ratings; and (4) adequate internal  and external safeguards to ensure the fair, effective, and nondiscriminatory  implementation of the system.", "A positive feature of the draft proposal is that agencies are to show that  their pay for performance systems have met prescribed criteria in order to  receive certification from OPM to implement their new systems.  Among  these criteria are having the means for ensuring employee involvement in  the design and implementation of the pay for performance system;  adequate training and retraining for supervisors, managers, and employees  in the implementation and operation of the pay for performance system; a  process for ensuring periodic performance feedback and dialogue between  supervisors, managers, and employees throughout the appraisal period;  and the means for ensuring that adequate agency resources are allocated  for the design, implementation, and administration of the pay for  performance system.  Further, OPM may review an agency\u2019s pay for  performance systems periodically to assess whether they continue to meet  the certification criteria.  If they do not, OPM may rescind the agency\u2019s  certification and direct the agency to take actions to implement an  appropriate system, which the agency must follow.", "Going forward, I believe that OPM should define in regulation what it will  take in terms of fact-based and data-driven analyses for agencies to  demonstrate that they are ready to receive this certification.  Clearly, the  President\u2019s Management Agenda, and its standards for the strategic  management of human capital, can inform the certification process.  Also,  as an example of the analyses that have been required, OPM has outlined in  regulations for the SES performance-based pay system the necessary data  and information agencies need to provide in order to receive certification  and thus raise the pay cap and total compensation limit for their senior  executives.  Specifically, agencies must provide, among other things, the  data on senior executives\u2019 performance ratings, pay, and awards for the last  2 years to demonstrate that their systems, as designed and applied, make  meaningful distinctions based on relative performance.  Under the SES  regulations, agencies that cannot provide these data can request  provisional certification of their systems.  In our view such provisional  certifications should not be an option under any broad-based classification  and compensation reform proposal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OPM\u2019s Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["OPM should play a key leadership and oversight role in helping individual  agencies and the government as a whole work towards overcoming a broad  range of human capital challenges.  Our understanding of the  Administration\u2019s draft proposal is that OPM\u2019s leadership and oversight role  is to expand in several areas, such as establishing a more market-based and  performance-oriented pay system governmentwide and implementing a  new core classification system.  At the request of Chairman Collins and  Ranking Member Lieberman, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs, along with Chairman Voinovich and Ranking  Member Akaka, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management,  the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, and to assist Congress  as it considers OPM\u2019s additional responsibilities as outlined in this draft  proposal, we are assessing OPM\u2019s current capacity to lead a broad-based  governmentwide human capital reform effort, including providing  appropriate  assistance to federal agencies as they revise their human  capital systems and conducting effective  monitoring of any related reform  implementation efforts.", "OPM is in the process of its own transformation\u2014from being a rulemaker,  enforcer, and independent agent to being more of a consultant, toolmaker,  and strategic partner in leading and supporting executive agencies\u2019 human  capital reform efforts and management systems.  However, it is unclear  whether OPM has the current capacity to discharge its new responsibilities.   Specifically, OPM reported in its June 2001 workforce analysis that 4.2  percent of its employees (about 123 per year), on average, were projected  to retire each year over the next 10 years, and the largest percentage of  projected retirements, about 8 percent each year, would come from  members of its SES.  OPM\u2019s expected retirement rate for its workforce  overall is more than the annual retirement rate of 2 percent  governmentwide that we identified in a report issued in 2001.", "Our prior work has shown that when required to implement new  legislation, OPM could have done more to accomplish its leadership and  oversight mission in a decentralized human capital environment.  For  example, Congress passed a law in 1990 authorizing agencies to repay, at  their discretion, their employees\u2019 student loans as a means to recruit and  retain a talented workforce.  In 2001, OPM issued final regulations to  implement the program.  The regulations were subsequently changed in  2004 to reflect legislative amendments that increased the ceiling on annual  and total loan repayments.  In our review of the federal student loan  repayment program, we found that while human capital officials  recognized OPM\u2019s efforts, they felt they could use more assistance on the  technical aspects of operating the program, more coordination in sharing  lessons learned in implementing it, and help consolidating some of the  program processes.", "Similarly, we found that while OPM had several initiatives underway to  assist federal agencies in using personnel flexibilities currently available to  them in managing their workforces, OPM could more fully meet its  leadership role to assist agencies in identifying, developing, and applying  human capital flexibilities across the federal government.   In addition, we  reported that in its ongoing internal review of its existing regulations and  guidance, OPM could more directly focus on determining the continued  relevance and utility of its regulations and guidance by asking whether they  provide the flexibility that agencies need in managing their workforces  while also incorporating protections for employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Management Relations and Adverse Actions and Appeals", "paragraphs": ["The Administration\u2019s draft proposal would amend some provisions of Title  5 of the U.S. Code covering labor management relations and adverse  actions and appeals.

By broadly  defining \u201cemergency\u201d without time limits and adding to management\u2019s right  an explicit authority to take action to prepare for, practice for, or prevent  any emergency, the proposed change as we understand it, could serve to  significantly restrict the scope of issues subject to collective bargaining."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adverse Actions and Appeals", "paragraphs": ["Under Title 5, conduct-based adverse actions are reviewed by the Merit  Systems Protection Board (MSPB) under the preponderance of the  evidence standard (there is more evidence than not to support the action).

While there was  widespread recognition among the forum participants that a one-size-fits- all approach to human capital management is not appropriate for the  challenges and demands government faces, there was equally broad  agreement that there should be a governmentwide framework to guide  human capital reform.  Further, a governmentwide framework should  balance the need for consistency across the federal government with the  desire for flexibility so that individual agencies can tailor human capital  systems to best meet their needs.  Striking this balance would not be easy  to achieve, but is necessary to maintain a governmentwide system that is  responsive enough to adapt to agencies\u2019 diverse missions, cultures, and  workforces.", "While there were divergent views among the forum participants, there was  general agreement on a set of principles, criteria, and processes that would  serve as a starting point for further discussion in developing a  governmentwide framework in advancing human capital reform, as shown  in figure 1.

One option may be to  provide agencies one-time, targeted investments that are not built into  agencies\u2019 bases for future year budget requests.  For example, Congress  established the Human Capital Performance Fund to reward agencies\u2019  highest performing and most valuable employees. However, the draft  proposal proposes to repeal the Human Capital Performance Fund.   According to OPM, the provision was never implemented, due to lack of  sufficient funding.  We believe that a central fund has merit and can help  agencies build the infrastructure that is necessary in order to implement a  more market-based and performance-oriented pay system.  To be eligible,  agencies would submit plans for approval by OPM that incorporated  features such as a link between pay for performance and the agency\u2019s  strategic plan, employee involvement, ongoing performance feedback, and  effective safeguards to ensure fair management of the system.  In the first  year of implementation, up to 10 percent of the amount appropriated would  be available to train those involved in making meaningful distinctions in  performance.  These features are similar to those cited in the draft proposal  as the basis for OPM\u2019s certification for agencies to implement their new pay  and performance management systems.", "In addition, as agencies develop their pay for performance systems, they  will need to consider the appropriate mix between pay awarded as base  pay increases versus one-time cash increases, while still maintaining  fiscally sustainable compensation systems that reward performance.  A key  question to consider is how the government can make an increasing  percentage of federal compensation dependent on achieving individual and  organizational results by, for example, providing more compensation as  one-time cash bonuses rather than as permanent salary increases.   However, agencies\u2019 use of cash bonuses or other monetary incentives has  an impact on employees\u2019 retirement calculations since they are not  included in calculating retirement benefits.  Congress should consider  potential legislative changes to allow cash bonuses that would otherwise  be included as base pay increases to be calculated toward retirement and  thrift savings benefits by specifically factoring bonuses into the employee\u2019s  basic pay for purposes of calculating the employee\u2019s \u201chigh-3\u201d for retirement  benefits and making contributions to the thrift savings plan.", "As we continue to move forward with broader human capital reforms, they  should be guided by a framework consisting of principles, criteria, and  processes.
