The Army continues to face the risk that critical performance requirements may not be met--at least for the helicopters it will initially produce. The Department of Defense (DOD) recently provided $84 million in additional development funding to help reduce some of these high-risk areas. Additionally, the Army is not likely to have the knowledge it needs to begin production when scheduled.

In August 1999, we reported that the program faced significant risks related to cost overruns, scheduling delays, and degraded performance. The Army faced these risks primarily because it decided to (1) begin engineering and manufacturing development before key technologies had matured, (2) compress the flight-test schedule, which increases concurrency between developmental and operational testing, and (3) begin initial production before completing operational testing. We also reported that by proceeding to the next development phase with high levels of uncertainty, the program\u2019s actions were not in accordance with best practices followed by successful commercial firms.", "In response to the findings of our 1999 report, you requested that we (1) evaluate changes in the Comanche\u2019s status with regard to cost, schedule, and performance and (2) assess whether the Army will have the knowledge it needs on the helicopter\u2019s performance and costs to proceed with its current production plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Comanche helicopter program began in 1983 to provide a family of high technology, low-cost aircraft that would replace the Army\u2019s light helicopter fleet, which includes the AH-1 Cobra, OH-58 Kiowa, OH-6 Cayuse, and the UH-1 Iroquois (Huey).

These problems are due to a range of factors, such as understated acquisition program cost estimates; ambitious flight test schedules with substantial concurrency in test events; delays in another DOD program which had been counted on to develop a critical component of the aircraft; inadequate facilities to fully test and integrate system hardware and software; and considerable growth in aircraft weight.

Specifically, DOD directed the Army to add 10 percent to Comanche\u2019s production unit cost estimate in order to ensure that annual planned procurement funding would be sufficient to cover planned procurement quantities. To reduce the annual funding increase resulting from this directive, the Army reduced Comanche\u2019s peak annual production rate from 72 aircraft per year to 62 per year, which extended the planned delivery schedule by 3 years.", "The $67.5 million reduction in estimated military construction costs reflects changes in anticipated needs for operating and maintenance facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Funds Recently Provided by DOD", "paragraphs": ["In January 2001, DOD added about $504 million in funding to the Comanche program over the next few years.

These additional funds have not yet been reflected in the program\u2019s official cost estimates. The program office plans to use the additional development funding to at least partially address what had been unfunded requirements in three areas considered to be high risk: (1) developing and integrating the mission equipment package; (2) developing the technology to detect and isolate equipment problems (automatic fault isolation); and (3) developing and integrating satellite communication capabilities.

Also, production processes are often not able to consistently yield output of high quality when full-rate production begins. DOD\u2019s guidance also states that programs in which development work and low-rate initial production are done concurrently typically have a higher risk of production items having to be retrofitted to make them work properly and of system design not being thoroughly tested. We have also reported that the discovery of problems in testing conducted late in development is a fairly common occurrence on DOD programs, as is the attendant \u201clate cycle churn\u201d, that is, the unanticipated effort that must be invested to overcome such problems. Further, these problems could be exacerbated if the program plans to produce a significant number of systems during the low-rate initial production period, before design and testing are completed.", "In August 1999, we reported that the Army would experience a 19-month delay in testing because the first pre-production aircraft for testing were expected to be delivered 19 months later than planned. We noted that, by retaining the December 2006 initial operating capability date, the delay in acquiring test aircraft would compress the majority of Comanche\u2019s flight- test schedule into the last 3 years of development. The compressed flight- test schedule would, in turn, shorten the available time for completing all test events and taking necessary corrective actions before the full-rate production decision.", "Since our last report, the first pre-production aircraft to be used for development testing is now scheduled for delivery in January 2004, adding an additional 3-month delay to the 19-month delay we reported in August 1999. As shown in figure 1 below, the delivery of pre-production Comanche aircraft has been delayed and, because the Army has retained the December 2006 full-rate production decision, the time available for testing, assessing, and correcting problems has been reduced.", "Many critical test events are now scheduled late in the development stages\u2014during the low-rate initial production phase of the program\u2014and, as shown in figure 2, many developmental and operational test events are scheduled to be conducted concurrently.", "The combination of compressing the development schedule and undertaking developmental and operational testing activities concurrently leaves the Army with little room to accommodate any delays that may result from assessing, correcting, and retesting problems found during testing. In Comanche\u2019s case, several critical subsystems\u2014to be included in the mission equipment package\u2014may not be available until the development flight-testing is well underway. These subsystems are very complex, state-of-the-art systems that have not been demonstrated on a helicopter platform like Comanche. As testing proceeds, any problems found will need to be analyzed, fixed, and retested. However, with the ambitious test schedule, there may not be time available between test events to correct problems and prepare properly for the next event.", "Further, the Army\u2019s schedule for developing and testing software for the Comanche may not be completed prior to the full-rate production decision. The contractor is experiencing a shortage of software engineers available to work on the Comanche contract. In addition, only about 1.4 million of the projected 1.9 million lines of computer code for the Comanche\u2019s mission equipment package will be completed by the time the package is to be tested on the initial pre-production aircraft. Additional segments of computer code for the mission equipment package will be introduced as developmental testing is underway. At this point, it is uncertain if all of the computer code for the full mission equipment package will be completed by the time the Army is scheduled to make a full-rate production decision for Comanche in late 2006.", "Finally, the Army plans to use pre-production aircraft that it considers production-representative for operational flight-testing. Before this testing is complete, the Army plans to begin producing a total of 84 low-rate initial production aircraft. These aircraft are to be used to equip Army helicopter units and to ramp-up production. To produce that many aircraft during low-rate initial production, the Army will have to ramp-up its production capabilities rapidly and at a time when the aircraft design is still evolving as new subsystems are introduced and test results are evaluated. Specifically, the Army does not plan to freeze Comanche\u2019s design configuration until January 2006, or six months after the low-rate initial production decision point.

At the current projected design weight of 9,475 pounds, the Comanche program office has acknowledged that the helicopter cannot achieve the required vertical rate of climb of 500 feet per minute without increasing the horsepower of the current engine. Consequently, the program office has assessed its achievement of the weight requirement as high risk.", "The Army offered its prime contractor for Comanche\u2019s development, Boeing-Sirkosky, an award fee of $1.4 million to reduce its projected weight to 9,250 pounds.

The program office estimates that the increase in the engine\u2019s power can be obtained at a cost of about $13 million, and this approach will be less costly than other weight reduction efforts. However, an increase in engine performance could adversely affect the expected life of the engine since it will have to perform about 47 degrees hotter than is normally required.

Additionally, without the system, the time and cost of maintaining the aircraft will likely increase. According to the Army, this system needs to be 75 to 95 percent accurate\u201475 percent for mechanical and electrical equipment and 95 percent for avionics and electronics equipment. The Comanche program office has concluded that this requirement will be difficult to achieve within the current cost, weight, and packaging constraints, and does not expect to achieve a mature fault detection and fault isolation capability until 2 years after initial fielding. According to the program office, this system depends, in part, on a database built on flight data and equipment failure experience; therefore, the system becomes better with additional flight hours. The program office anticipates that after 2 years of flight testing, the system should meet the full level of predictability required.

To meet this need, the Army was planning to rely on satellite communication technology being developed and miniaturized as part of the Joint Strike Fighter program, which is being developed jointly by the Air Force, Navy, and Marines. However, in May 2000, Congress provided that the Joint Strike Fighter program could not enter into the engineering and manufacturing development phase until the Secretary of Defense certified the technological maturity of its critical technologies. This has delayed the Joint Strike Fighter program\u2019s schedule for beginning its engineering and manufacturing development phase.", "When assessing the risk of its dependency on the Joint Strike Fighter\u2019s program, the Comanche program office concluded that the helicopters in low-rate initial production would not have the beyond-line-of-sight communication capability if the Joint Strike Fighter program was delayed. The program office now believes that it must develop its own satellite communication capability. However, the development schedule remains high-risk for the timely inclusion of this capability on the initially fielded Comanche helicopters.

The firms demand\u2014and receive\u2014specific knowledge about a new product before production begins. And, they do not go forward unless a strong business case on which the program was originally justified continues to hold true. Such a knowledge-based process is essential to commercial firms getting better cost, schedule, and performance outcomes. It enables decision-makers to be reasonably certain about critical facets of the product under development when they need it.", "At the point of going into production, successful firms will already know that (1) technologies match customer requirements, that is, they can fit onto a product and function as expected, (2) the product\u2019s design meets performance requirements, and (3) the product can be produced within cost, schedule, and quality targets. The Comanche program does not yet have this knowledge and is not likely to have this knowledge when it plans to begin low-rate initial production in June 2005.", "First, the Army does not yet know and it will not know until well after its low-rate initial production decision whether certain technologies being developed will fit on the helicopter and function as expected. Our reporton incorporating new technologies into programs indicated that demonstrating a high level of maturity before new technologies are incorporated into product development programs puts those programs into a better position to succeed. Further, technologies that were included in a product development before they were mature later contributed to cost increases and schedule delays to those products. While the Comanche program has made progress in the technology readiness level of its critical components, integration of those components into subsystems, such as the mission equipment package, and the helicopter as a whole remains high-risk. In addition, the integration, development, and configuration of key satellite communication technology for inclusion in the integrated communication, navigation, and identification avionics has also been assessed as high risk. Finally, some of the technologies have not been developed to meet Comanche\u2019s specific configuration requirements. For instance, the Comanche\u2019s second generation forward-looking infrared sensor has been tested and proven on the Black Hawk helicopter by the Army\u2019s night vision laboratory but not on the Comanche itself. Such testing needs to be done to ensure that the system can work together with other unique systems being developed for the Comanche, including the piloting, target acquisition, and navigation systems, which work as one unit. Comanche\u2019s contractor has maintained that its mission equipment package technology is challenging because some key components have not been developed and configured in the required manner for the helicopter\u2019s intended mission.", "Second, as discussed earlier, the Army does not yet know and may not know until well after the start of low-rate initial production, whether performance requirements can be met\u2014including vertical rate of climb, on-board fault isolation, and beyond-line-of-sight communication requirements. The Army plans to conduct a limited user test before it begins low-rate initial production but it is a rudimentary test and not a complete operational test that fully demonstrates the aircraft\u2019s capabilities. By compressing many key events late in the development schedule and conducting developmental and operational testing activities concurrently, the Army is running the risk of not fully demonstrating many of its critical capabilities before its planned full-rate production decision. Under current plans, for example, the Army will not complete a full demonstration of its integrated mission equipment package until December 2006\u2014over a full year after its low-rate initial production decision and within the same month that the Army plans to make its decision on Comanche full-rate production.", "Third, as noted earlier, it is still uncertain whether the Comanche can be developed within cost and scheduling estimates. Although additional costs have been identified for the Comanche since it was last restructured, the full development cost will not be known until critical technology is fully developed, integrated, and tested. This will not occur until well after a low- rate initial production decision has been made in June 2005. The program office believes that it will know the cost of the initial production aircraft, which will have been negotiated prior to the low-rate initial production decision. However, at that time, the program office and the contractor will have limited experience and data relative to producing the fully developed Comanche helicopter. Until more experience and data is available, there is not a high level of confidence in the Army\u2019s production cost estimate.", "Further, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation in assessing the results of the Comanche milestone II test data indicated that it is highly unlikely that the Army can deliver the expected system performance within the current budget and schedule.  The Director's assessment revealed that, without an operational assessment of an integrated system, it is difficult to predict with any degree of confidence whether (1) the individual subsystems can be successfully integrated, (2) the subsystems will function properly in an operational environment, or (3) the subsystems, in concert, will provide the anticipated benefits in operational performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, we reported that the Army started the Comanche\u2019s program development too early in terms of technology readiness, which is contrary to best commercial practices.

Two years later, the program is confronted with rising development costs, a compressed development schedule, and several major areas of high technical risk. The Army plans to proceed to low-rate initial production in June 2005 and full-rate production in December 2006, both of which could be well in advance of attaining sufficient knowledge of the helicopter\u2019s technical maturity, demonstrated performance capabilities, and production costs. With such a scenario, the potential for adverse program outcomes is high\u2014higher than expected costs, longer than expected schedules, and uncertain performance. DOD and Army officials acknowledge that the current program cost and schedule objectives are not achievable and should be changed to reflect more realistic objectives, but they believe that the planned January 2003 review for the Comanche program is the appropriate time to address such changes.
