For example, the agency relies on information systems to  process tax returns, account for tax revenues collected, send bills for  taxes owed, issue refunds, assist in the selection of tax returns for audit,  and provide telecommunications services for all business activities,  including the public\u2019s toll-free access to tax information.", "IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2014 budget was $11.3 billion.

IRS  agreed with our recommendation at the time we made it. In March  2014, IRS reported that it had practices and processes in place that  addressed this recommendation, including quarterly reports to  Congress, and a baseline change request process. However, we did  not believe these practices addressed the recommendation, as  neither approach included a quantitative measure. For this reason, we  believed the recommendation was still warranted.", "We noted in April 2013 that the majority of IRS\u2019s major IT investments  were reportedly within 10 percent of cost and schedule estimates and  eight major IT investments reported significant cost and/or schedule  variances. We also reported that weaknesses existed, to varying  degrees, in the reliability of reported cost and schedule variances, and  key risks and mitigation strategies were identified. As result, we made recommendations for IRS to improve the reliability of reported  cost and schedule information by addressing the identified  weaknesses in future updates of estimates. We also recommended  that IRS ensure projects consistently follow guidance for updating  performance information 60 days after completion of an activity and  develop and implement guidance that specifies best practices to  consider when determining projected amounts. IRS agreed with three  of our four recommendations and partially disagreed with the fourth  recommendation related to guidance on projecting cost and schedule  amounts. The agency specifically disagreed with the use of earned  value management data as a best practice to determine projected  cost and schedule amounts, stating that the technique was not part of  IRS\u2019s current program management processes and the cost and  burden to use it outweigh the value added. While we disagreed with  IRS\u2019s view of earned value management because best practices have  found that the value generally outweighs the cost and burden of  implementing it, we provided it as one of several examples of  practices that could be used to determine projected amounts. We also  noted that implementing our recommendation would help improve the  reliability of reported cost and schedule variance information, and that  IRS had flexibility in determining which best practices to use to  calculate projected amounts. For those reasons, we believed our  recommendation was still warranted.  In September 2013, TIGTA reported on CADE 2 development  challenges and changes to the planned schedule for this investment.  TIGTA reported, among other things, that the CADE 2 database  cross-functional triage team had effectively managed and resolved  more than 1,000 data defects.that the downstream system interfaces had not been implemented  due to data quality issues and the implementation date of these  interfaces was revised to January 2014.", "However, TIGTA\u2019s review determined", "We reported in April 2014, that 6 of IRS\u2019s 19 major IT investments  were within 10 percent of cost and schedule estimates during fiscal  year 2013; however, the reported variances were for the fiscal year  only, and we therefore noted that IRS\u2019s reporting would be more  meaningful if supplemented with cumulative cost and schedule  variances for the investments or investment segments. In addition, the reported variances for selected investments were not always  reliable because the projected and actual cost and schedule amounts  on which they depend had not been consistently updated in  accordance with OMB and Treasury reporting requirements. Further,  IRS was not working on developing a quantitative measure of scope  (i.e., functionality) as we recommended in 2012, and we noted that  reporting qualitatively in congressional reporting until a quantitative  measure is developed would help provide Congress with a complete  picture of the agency\u2019s performance in managing its major  investments. Lastly, IRS continued to lack guidance that included best  practices for calculating projected cost and schedule amounts. We  made three recommendations for IRS to report more comprehensive  and reliable cost and schedule information and improve the  transparency of reported scope information for its major investments.  IRS agreed with our recommendations and stated it believed it had  addressed our recommendation to report cumulative investment and  investment segment cost and schedule information in the quarterly  reports to Congress, as well as our prior recommendation to develop  a quantitative measure of scope; we disagreed, however, and  maintained our recommendations.  In September 2014, TIGTA reported on challenges faced by IRS in  implementing the IRDM Case Management project. More specifically,  TIGTA noted that after a year of user acceptance testing, IRS officials  acknowledged that the IRDM Case Management project could not  effectively process business cases containing underreported income  and could not be deployed into the IRS production environment;  TIGTA identified insufficient project requirements as contributing to  these challenges.
