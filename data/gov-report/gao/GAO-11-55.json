Concerned with the timeliness of USERRA complaint processing and data reliability of agency reports, Congress imposed timeliness requirements for the Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Justice (DOJ), and Office of Special Counsel (OSC) under the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 (VBIA 2008) and required agencies to submit quarterly reports to Congress on the extent of their compliance with the requirements. As required by VBIA, this report assesses whether the agencies (1) met VBIA timeliness requirements for USERRA complaint processing, and (2) submitted reliable and timely quarterly reports. GAO analyzed data in each agency's USERRA database, and the extent to which those data were consistent with the quarterly reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOL, DOJ, and OSC generally were timely in meeting VBIA 2008 deadlines to process complaints, but issues remain regarding notification of rights. Under VBIA 2008, DOL must complete its investigation within 90 days of receiving a complaint. If the complaint is not resolved and the servicemember requests to have the complaint referred, DOL must send the case to DOJ (if against a nonfederal employer) or OSC (if against a federal employer) within 60 days of receiving the request for referral. Within 60 days of receiving the case from DOL, DOJ, and OSC must make a decision on whether to represent the servicemember. Any of the three agencies may seek consent to extend the applicable deadline. GAO's analysis showed that DOL, DOJ, and OSC generally met the original or extended deadlines to process complaints. Although DOL does not maintain data in its USERRA database on notifying servicemembers of their USERRA complaint processing rights within 5 days of receiving the complaint, GAO estimated that in about 7 percent of the cases, DOL did not document notification of rights. Because VBIA 2008 does not require DOL to report on this requirement and DOL does not maintain and monitor such data, Congress and DOL cannot be assured that all servicemembers are adequately being informed of their USERRA process rights in accordance with VBIA 2008. According to DOJ, the 60-day statutory deadline does not apply to state employer cases. GAO's analysis showed that 6 of 12 cases against state employers took more than 60 days to process. Comparatively, 23 of 189 cases against private or local government employers exceeded the 60-day deadline. Therefore, servicemembers who are employed by state governments may not be receiving the same treatment in terms of timeliness that other servicemembers are receiving under USERRA. In addition, GAO's analysis showed that in 6 of 13 cases where the servicemember was involved in settlement negotiations and DOJ declined representation, DOJ notified the servicemember of its decision but continued to aid the parties with facilitating a settlement. VBIA 2008 does not require agencies to report on their time spent after making a decision on representation. For DOL, DOJ, and OSC, the data contained in the quarterly reports during the time of our review were generally consistent with our analysis. However, the three agencies did not use the same criteria for including the number of cases that exceeded or met the statutory deadline in their quarterly reports. DOL and DOJ were consistently late in submitting quarterly reports to Congress, by as much as 46 days for DOL and by as much as 40 days for DOJ. DOL does not always correct errors in its USERRA database after preparing its quarterly reports and therefore cannot ensure it has accurate, readily available data to monitor its performance in meeting USERRA requirements. DOJ does not have a standard, repeatable process to input USERRA data and produce its quarterly reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the three agencies use consistent reporting criteria and that the Attorney General and Secretary of Labor improve maintenance of data.

Congress  enacted the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights  Act of 1994 (USERRA) to protect the employment and reemployment  rights of federal and nonfederal employees when they leave their  employment to perform military or other uniformed service. Among other  rights, servicemembers who meet the statutory requirements are entitled  to reinstatement to the positions they would have held if they had never  left their employment or to positions of like seniority, status, and pay.  USERRA was enacted as a means to encourage noncareer service in the  uniformed services by reducing the disruption that servicemembers often  face when returning to the civilian workforce and to prohibit  discrimination against individuals based upon their uniformed service.", "Under USERRA, an employee or applicant for employment who believes  that his or her USERRA rights have been violated may file a complaint  with the Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) Veterans\u2019 Employment and Training  Service (VETS), which is the entity that investigates and attempts to  resolve the complaint. If DOL\u2019s VETS cannot resolve the complaint, DOL is  to inform the complainant of the right to request to have his or her  complaint referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Office of  Special Counsel (OSC). A complaint is referred to DOJ if it involves state  or private employers or to OSC if it involves a federal executive branch  agency.

To address concerns about  timeliness and data reliability, Congress imposed timeliness requirements  for DOL, DOJ, and OSC USERRA complaint processing as part of the  Veterans\u2019 Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 (VBIA 2008). Under VBIA  2008, within 5 days of receiving a complaint, DOL must notify the  complainant of his or her USERRA process rights and, within 90 days of  receiving a complaint, complete its investigation.

In order to meet our mandated reporting deadline, we  established a cutoff date of February 28, 2010, and analyzed each agency\u2019s  data as of that date. We assessed the reliability of the agencies\u2019 USERRA  databases by comparing a random sample of DOL and DOJ case files and  all OSC case files during the period of our review against the data in the  databases. We found the data from each agency\u2019s USERRA databases to be  sufficiently reliable to use in this report. We then used each agency\u2019s data  to determine the extent that each agency met the timeliness requirements  and the average amount of time it took for each agency to meet the  respective deadlines. We also interviewed relevant agency officials. To  assess the reliability of the quarterly reports, we used each agency\u2019s data  and attempted to recreate each agency\u2019s quarterly reports covering the  periods of October 10, 2008, through December 31, 2009. We also  interviewed relevant agency officials and reviewed each agency\u2019s policies  and procedures for collecting, maintaining, and storing the data and for  producing the reports. To determine the timeliness of each agency\u2019s  submission of the quarterly reports to Congress, we reviewed the  transmittal letters and other evidence of submission to determine whether  the quarterly reports were submitted to Congress within 30 days after the  end of the quarter as required by VBIA 2008 and interviewed agency  officials concerning communication with Congress on their submissions.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 through October  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

DOJ relies on one  individual to enter the data and prepare its quarterly reports. A  supervisory equal opportunity specialist in the Employment Litigation  Section of the Civil Rights Division is responsible for inputting all the  USERRA data necessary for reporting on timeliness into a WordPerfect  log. DOJ does not have any written definition on each data element in the  log. When this employee takes leave, the deputy section chief serves as the  backup to collect the relevant documents, but does not enter data into the  log; the supervisory equal opportunity specialist enters the data upon  return from leave. DOJ officials said that no other DOJ employee is  knowledgeable about operating the WordPerfect log. Moreover, there is no  system to check and ensure that data are entered correctly. To prepare the  reports, the supervisory equal opportunity specialist manually counts the  number of reports to be included in each category of the report. Although  DOJ said that it uses a WordPerfect formula to calculate when the 60-day  deadline occurs, DOJ does not use standard formulas or queries to  generate the numbers for the reports. Such an approach that requires  manual counting may be susceptible to error. We have previously reported  on the importance of standard, repeatable procedures for producing  reports.

While all three agencies\u2019 quarterly reports to  Congress were generally accurate, the agencies did not use the same  criteria for including cases in their quarterly reports. Moreover, DOL and  DOJ were sometimes late in submitting quarterly reports to Congress and  could improve maintenance of data and reporting on the extent to which  they have met statutory deadlines. Specifically, DOL does not maintain  data to monitor the extent to which it met the requirement to notify  servicemembers of their complaint processing rights within 5 days.  Additionally, when DOL identifies errors in its USERRA database when it  prepares its quarterly reports to Congress, it does not always correct the  database. DOJ does not have a standard, repeatable process to input  USERRA data and process its quarterly reports and lacks data reliability  checks.

Specifically, DOL stated that actions it plans to take  to ensure that servicemembers are notified of their rights within 5 days  will be sufficient and DOL will notify Congress and GAO of its progress in  this regard. Therefore, DOL\u2019s view is that amending USERRA to require  reporting on notification of rights is not necessary.

While DOJ agreed with our recommendation to  improve its internal controls for producing its quarterly reports with  respect to checking reliability of data, DOJ stated that its procedures for  collecting, processing, and maintaining data for the quarterly reports are  adequate. We continue to believe that DOJ\u2019s practice of having one person  responsible for the collection and maintenance of the data and its process  for manually counting claims to be included in the quarterly reports do not  provide sufficient internal controls to ensure the continued accuracy of  the data reported to Congress.", "DOJ also expressed serious concern about our matter for congressional  consideration to amend USERRA to require DOJ to notify state employee  servicemembers of the status of their cases, stating that it is extremely  important to maintain its independence in determining whether to file suit  in the name of the United States against a state. We continue to believe  that it is important that state employees be made aware of the status of  their USERRA complaint and that an amendment requiring notification  would help ensure that this occurs. The suggested amendment would not  require DOJ to request approval from the servicemember to extend  deadlines and is consistent with DOJ\u2019s current practice. In our view, this  notification requirement would not compromise DOJ\u2019s independence and  would reinforce the important distinction between state employee cases,  where DOJ represents the interests of the United States, and private  employee cases, where DOJ represents the individual servicemember. For  cases involving state employees, DOJ would be required to notify  servicemembers of the status of their cases, whereas in cases involving  private employees, DOJ is required to request approval from the  servicemember to extend the deadline for DOJ\u2019s review.", "DOJ also said that it believed that it was unnecessary to amend USERRA  to require reporting on time spent on USERRA referrals after  representation has been declined because VBIA 2008 does not require DOJ  to engage in conciliation or settlement discussions.

To assess the reliability of each of the databases, we compared data from  the databases with data found in the official hard copy case files.

For DOL, our sample included a total of 60 unique cases where  the servicemember did not request a referral and 52 cases where the  servicemember requested a referral. For DOJ, our sample included 55  cases from a universe of 201 cases.

We did not evaluate the  accuracy of the source of the case files for the data elements reviewed.  For data elements pertaining to time (i.e., open date and closed date), we  considered the date a match if the date in the databases was the same or  within 1 day of the date reflected in the case file.", "To assess the reliability of the data elements pertaining to time, we  assessed (1) the number of times that the electronic data did not match  the hard copy, case file data, (2) the average number of days that the  electronic date differed from the hard copy date, and (3) the change in the  number of cases exceeding the deadline based on differences between the  dates contained in the electronic data and the hard copy data.

However, we were generally able to account for the  differences. For referrals, these differences were due to DOL\u2019s failure to  correct its database to include extensions that DOL identified while  reviewing the data extracts prior to submission of its quarterly reports.  Specifically, when DOL identifies cases where the latest deadline has been  exceeded, DOL reviews documentation for these cases to determine if an  extension had been recorded in the file but had not been entered in DOL\u2019s  USERRA database. If DOL identifies such a record, it makes a notation as  part of its analysis, but it does not always make a correction in its system  of record\u2014the USERRA database.
