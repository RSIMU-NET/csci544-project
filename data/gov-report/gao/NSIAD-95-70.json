They said that total environmental programs at closing and realigning bases go beyond those costs identified in the BRAC budgets. For example, some cleanup plans for Army installations needed DERA funds in addition to BRAC funds. Also, both the Army and Navy plans identified funding needed for environmental compliance and for the preservation of natural and cultural resources.", "Also, BRAC budget estimates cover only the 6-year period that bases are allowed to close. However, the average cleanup can take much longer. The cleanup plans include 14 installations from the 1988 round of closures that estimated they will need $536 million after the 6-year period. (See app. IV.) For example, the BRAC budget estimate for the Army\u2019s Jefferson Proving Ground, Indiana, was about $11 million. The cleanup plan estimated it would cost $233 million, including $789,000 prior to 1989, $16.1 million in BRAC and other funding between 1990 and 1995, and $216.1 million in DERA funding after the 6-year period. The cleanup plan shows that this $216.1-million figure assumed no change in how the base was being used, and if another reuse option was selected, the total estimated cost for this one base could be $2 billion per year for fiscal years 1996 to 1999.", "Although the cleanup plans provide a more complete view of environmental costs at closing bases, they did not generally capture complete costs. In some cases, long-term monitoring costs may go on for many years beyond the base cleanup plan estimates. For example, Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire, reported no costs beyond fiscal year 1999, but officials estimated it will cost $300,000 a year to monitor the groundwater for an indefinite period beyond 1999. Similarly, Norton Air Force Base, California, officials estimated long-term remedial operations will cost $38.9 million through 2010, but the Air Force\u2019s estimate only included monitoring costs through fiscal year 1999.", "Furthermore, the cleanup plan estimates did not include some sites that have yet to be investigated at the 84 installations.

Assessments are currently being performed of 118 of the potential areas. The remaining sites were recently identified during a site inspection, and the appropriate investigation approaches are being formulated. The Army Materials Technology Laboratory, Massachusetts, was recently added to the NPL, requiring the Army to address surface water contamination cleanup previously not planned or budgeted.

According to DOD officials, however, the services\u2019 perception is that funds should be obligated in the year appropriated, and high unobligated balances are seen by the services as a failure to execute their programs. For example, in October 1992, the Army increased the BRAC 1991 account for Fort Ord, California, by $11.8 million for environmental restoration, stating that the Army had to obligate its current funds to receive additional 1991 funds DOD had withheld. Between February and September 1993, $10.8 million was obligated for an existing contract with provisions that the work would be fully defined and priced later.", "In explaining the high levels of unobligated balances, DOD said that it (1) was probably overly optimistic in the funds requested, (2) did not have all the necessary expertise to better estimate requirements and timing, and (3) experienced slow obligation rates by the installations. DOD officials told us that the unobligated balances improved between June and September 1994 because the services entered into cost-reimbursable contracts for the total design and actual cleanup of installations, instead of contracting separately for design and cleanup.

BRAC installations are given a high priority to facilitate the transfer of property to nonfederal use as soon as possible. However, most BRAC property will stay under federal ownership. Also, until 1992, CERCLA required cleanup before property could be transferred to nonfederal owners, but a 1992 amendment allows for the transfer of property before cleanup is finished under certain stipulations. Furthermore, a 1994 law allows for long-term leases to nonfederal users before cleanup is complete.

In the same act, Congress directed that DOD restore any property excess to its needs as a result of closure or realignment as soon as possible. High priority funding was necessary for these installations because CERCLA requires environmental cleanup to be completed before nonfederal ownership transfer and reuse can occur.", "Giving all closing and realigning installations the same status as NPL installations has significantly increased the number of priority installations and accelerated the funding DOD needs for high priority cleanup. Of the 84 installations identified in the cleanup plans, 21 are for NPL installations and receive priority cleanup funding consideration regardless of whether they close or realign. (See app. III.) Cleanup estimates in these 21 installations\u2019 plans totaled $2.0 billion. However, the other 63 installations would not have been given high priority status if they were not closing or realigning. Estimated cleanup costs in plans for these installations amounted to $3.4 billion, or 63 percent of the nearly $5.4-billion total estimate. (See table 2.3.)

However, these installations add an estimated $221 million to DOD\u2019s priority requirements.", "Were these non-NPL bases not closing or realigning, they would likely receive funds only for essential cleanup and compliance activities. For example, non-NPL installations would likely receive funds to remove underground storage tanks to meet deadlines in the law, but asbestos and lead-based paint surveys not subject to a deadline might be deferred to later years. Army headquarters officials told us there had never been much DERA funding available to clean up non-NPL installations, but funds became available once an installation was identified for closure. Environmental officials at Fort Ord, California, said that before their installation was on the NPL, they had trouble competing for DERA cleanup funding.", "DOD officials told us that cleanup priority funding was needed for non-NPL installations because (1) BRAC funding is tied to the 6-year period allowed for bases to close, (2) legal mandates established by state law or the courts exist at some bases, and (3) communities are expecting their installations to be cleaned up as soon as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Property Can Be Transferred to Other Federal Agencies Before Cleanup Is Complete", "paragraphs": ["CERCLA allows DOD to transfer property to another service or federal agency before completing cleanup.

It is retaining about 156,700 acres, or 63 percent of the 250,100 acres on installations from the 1988 and 1991 rounds. Some of this property is being retained because of extensive unexploded ordnance contamination. For example, at the Army\u2019s Jefferson Proving Ground, Indiana, due to long-term hazardous waste contamination and the potential that unexploded ordnance could be found all over the installation, it is impossible to dispose of all the property. The Army was considering retaining all or part of it under a caretaker program.

Consequently, DOD is still held responsible for the cleanup, which ultimately could involve substantial costs. According to DOD officials, DOD is responsible for cleaning up past contamination, regardless of when it is identified, and meeting the requirements of any new federal or state cleanup standards and laws.

Remedies to contain contamination require significant long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring efforts as well as further cleanup actions if contamination recurs. A 1990 EPA study showed that containment remedies may initially be less expensive to construct, but the required operation and maintenance and the potential for failure increase their cost in the long run. Containment at BRAC installations for major groundwater, landfill, and unexploded ordnance sites will likely require cleanup efforts over many years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cleanup of Groundwater Is a Problem at Most BRAC Installations", "paragraphs": ["Decontaminating polluted groundwater, an issue identified in 51 of the 79 cleanup plans, is costly, difficult, and sometimes impossible. Once contamination is detected, the uneven flow of groundwater and the redistribution of the contaminants make cleanup difficult. According to EPA, the technical challenges of eliminating groundwater contamination are complex and efforts to speed up the process have been expensive and achieved limited success.", "For example, one of the most commonly used groundwater cleanup technologies is \u201cpump and treat,\u201d where contaminated water is pumped to the surface for treatment. However, this technology can cost millions of dollars, take decades, and still leave groundwater contaminated. Pump-and-treat systems were in place or planned for at least 24 of the installations identified in appendix III. Figure 3.1 shows an example of a pump-and-treat remediation project.", "Pump-and-treat systems may need to be tested over several years to determine their effectiveness. For example, at two installations we visited, Norton and George Air Force Bases in California, pilot systems were in place, but officials said they were operating at about one-half of the capacity because the groundwater did not flow as expected. They said the number of wells for these systems will need to be increased for sufficient water to flow, and even if successful the systems may need to operate for 30 years or more. At Norton Air Force Base, groundwater contamination extends from the central base area, toward the southwest in the direction of groundwater flow beneath the base, and continues beyond the base boundary. There are several community water wells near the base within the anticipated path of the contaminants.", "Furthermore, the pump-and-treat technology does not work on some contaminants, according to EPA. These contaminants include certain organic compounds, such as chlorinated solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), creosote, and some pesticides. They are difficult to locate and remove and may continue to contaminate groundwater for hundreds of years, despite best efforts to clean them up."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Landfills Must Be Cleaned up at Most BRAC Installations", "paragraphs": ["Contaminated landfills were identified in 67 of 79 cleanup plans for closing and realigning installations and may pose some major environmental threats, particularly for groundwater. (See app. III.) Although small landfills can be removed and eliminated, it is not practical to remove all waste and contamination from larger ones.", "National standards do not exist for cleaning up most contaminants in soil, so DOD, EPA, and state regulators negotiate standards for each site. Large landfills are often treated by placing a protective cap over the site to contain the waste and prevent further contamination of the soil, groundwater, and atmosphere. The groundwater conditions around the landfill must also be assessed to determine whether contamination exists, and, if necessary, identify the cleanup measures. Figure 3.2 shows a landfill excavation and a soil removal project.", "Landfills that close where waste has not been removed are also subject to EPA requirements for maintenance and groundwater monitoring 30 years after the landfill is closed. These requirements were established because of the potential for environmental problems after closure.

If not, the facilities must be brought into compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Cost-Effective Technology Needed to Clean up Unexploded Ordnance", "paragraphs": ["Unexploded ordnance is ordnance that has failed to function as designed, has been abandoned or discarded, and is still capable of exploding and causing injury. It results from operations conducted at weapons test and training ranges and contains explosive, petroleum, metal, and other compounds that may contribute to soil and water contamination. If unexploded ordnance is buried below 3 feet, current technology may not be able to detect it, and it can migrate to the surface over time. Consequently, surface cleanup may need to be repeated.", "Unexploded ordnance and related waste were identified at 25 closing installations, including some installations where the contaminated areas are so large that cleanup technology is not affordable. For example, unexploded ordnance is potentially present on about 51,000 acres of the Army\u2019s Jefferson Proving Ground, Indiana; 7,200 acres of the Army\u2019s Fort Ord, California; and an unspecified amount of property at the Navy\u2019s Mare Island Shipyard, California. Current removal technology is labor intensive, costly, and unreliable. Figure 3.3 shows a portion of a munitions firing range that contains unexploded ordnance.", "According to Army ordnance and other officials, new and more cost-effective technology needs to be developed for cleaning up the unexploded ordnance. A study at the Army\u2019s Jefferson Proving Ground, which has extensive quantities, types, and dispersion of unexploded ordnance, found that the cleanup effort would be labor intensive. For example, the work would require using metal detectors for the majority of land, mapping the unexploded ordnance, handling or removing it, and disposing of it. Because the installation potentially has 51,000 contaminated acres and is heavily forested, current cleanup technology is not practical or affordable. Although the cleanup plan included $216 million in estimated costs, the plan noted that costs could run to $2 billion a year for several years, and officials said other estimates for cleanup have ranged from $5 billion to $8 billion in total, depending on how the property is to be reused. Figure 3.4 shows an example of buried unexploded ordnance.", "The closure of military installations and extent of unexploded ordnance have intensified the need for DOD and EPA headquarters and states to address many unresolved issues related to unexploded ordnance. These issues concern costs and cleanup requirements, when unexploded ordnance becomes a hazardous material, when DOD turns over control to EPA and states, and which laws apply to cleanup. The 1992 Federal Facilities Compliance Act amending RCRA required EPA to propose, after consulting with the Secretary of Defense and appropriate state officials, regulations identifying when military munitions become hazardous waste and providing for its safe transportation and storage. The deadline for the proposed regulations was October 1994.

CERFA directs federal agencies to identify uncontaminated parcels based on the specific requirements set forth in CERFA. For parcels that are on a NPL installation, EPA must concur with the results. For parcels on non-NPL installations, appropriate state officials must concur. The deadline for identifying all parcels on BRAC 1988 and 1991 installations, including EPA or state concurrence, was April 19, 1994.", "DOD officials told us that CERFA did not work as expected. Although considerable resources have been spent, the anticipated numbers of uncontaminated parcels available for quick transfer and reuse have not been identified. Furthermore, they said that data was not readily available, but they believed little of the uncontaminated property that was identified had been transferred. They also said the developed land on the installations is often the most desirable for immediate reuse, but this property tends to be contaminated. However, DOD officials commented that one benefit of the CERFA process has been that DOD identified the condition of the property at these installations, and this information will be extremely useful in leasing and later transferring contaminated property.", "DOD records showed that of about 250,100 acres at 1988 and 1991 closing installations, the services identified about 121,200 acres as uncontaminated; however, the regulators only concurred that 34,499 acres were uncontaminated.

However, according to DOD, the uncontaminated property is usually undeveloped, remotely located, or linked to contaminated parcels and cannot be used separately. For example, about 7,000 of the uncontaminated acres at Fort Ord are considered unusable because, according to DOD officials, the acreage is in an undeveloped part of the installation that has no access to a usable water supply.
