GAO's recent report identified key causes of failures within several recurring themes including (1) disciplined processes, such as requirements management, testing, and project management; and (2) human capital management, such as workforce planning, human resources, and change management. Prior reports have identified costly systems implementation failures attributable to problems in these areas at agencies across the federal government. DHS faces unique challenges in attempting to develop integrated financial management systems across the breadth of such a large and diverse department. DHS inherited a myriad of redundant financial management systems from 22 diverse agencies and about 100 resource management systems. Among the weaknesses identified in prior component financial audits were insufficient internal controls or processes to reliably report financial information such as revenue, accounts receivable, and accounts payable; significant system security deficiencies; financial systems that required extensive manual processes to prepare financial statements; and incomplete policies and procedures necessary for conducting basic financial management activities. In August 2003, DHS began a program to consolidate and integrate DHS financial accounting and reporting systems. DHS officials said they recently decided to develop a new strategy for the planned financial management systems integration program, referred to as eMerge2, because the prior strategy was not meeting its performance goals and timeline. DHS's revised strategy will allow DHS components to choose from an array of existing financial management shared service providers. Based on industry best practices, GAO identified four key concepts that will be critical to DHS's ability to successfully complete its planned migration to shared service providers. Careful consideration of these four concepts, each one building upon the next, will be integral to the success of DHS's strategy. The four concepts are developing a concept of operations, defining standard business processes, developing a strategy for implementing DHS's shared services approach across the department, and defining and effectively implementing disciplined processes necessary to properly manage the specific projects. With DHS at an important crossroads in implementing financial management systems, it has an excellent opportunity to use these building blocks to form a solid foundation on which to base its efforts and avoid the problems that have plagued so many other federal agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It is a pleasure to be here today to participate in this joint oversight  hearing on the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) ongoing efforts  to effectively manage its information technology (IT) projects.

Ill-defined or incomplete requirements  have been identified by many system developers and program managers as  a root cause of system failure. It is critical that requirements\u2014functions  the system must be able to perform\u2014be carefully defined and flow from  the concept of operations (how the organization\u2019s day-to-day operations  are or will be carried out to meet mission needs). In our previous work, we  have found agencies with a lack of a concept of operations, vague and  ambiguous requirements, and requirements that are not traceable or  linked to business processes.", "Testing. Complete and thorough testing is essential to provide reasonable  assurance that new or modified systems will provide the capabilities in the  requirements. Testing is the process of executing a program with the  intent of finding errors. Because requirements provide the foundation for  system testing, they must be complete, clear, and well documented to  design and implement an effective testing program. Absent this, an  organization is taking a significant risk that substantial defects will not be  detected until after the system is implemented. Industry best practices  indicate that the sooner a defect is recognized and corrected, the cheaper  it is to fix. In our work, we have found flawed test plans, inadequate timing  of testing, and ineffective systems testing.", "Data conversion. In its white paper on financial system data conversion,  the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP)  identified data conversion as one of the critical tasks necessary to  successfully implement a new financial system. JFMIP also noted that if  data conversion is done right, the new system has a much greater  opportunity for success. On the other hand, converting data incorrectly or  entering unreliable data from a legacy system has lengthy and long-term  repercussions. The adage \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d best describes the  adverse impact. Examples of problems we have reported on include  agencies that have not properly developed and implemented good data  conversion plans, have planned the data conversion too late in the project,  and have not reconciled account balances.", "Risk management. According to leading systems acquisition  organizations, risk management is a process for identifying potential  problems before they occur and adjusting the acquisition to decrease the  chance of their occurrence. Risks should be identified as early as possible  and a risk management process should be developed and put in place.  Risks should be identified, analyzed, mitigated, and tracked to closure.  Effectively managing risks is one way to minimize the chances of project  cost, schedule, and performance problems from occurring. We have  reported that agencies have not fully implemented effective risk  management practices, including shortcomings in identifying and tracking  risks.", "Project management. Effective project management is the process for  planning and managing all project-related activities, such as defining how  components are interrelated, defining tasks, estimating and obtaining  resources, and scheduling activities. Project management allows the  performance, cost, and schedule of the overall program to be continually  measured, compared with planned objectives, and controlled. We have  reported on a number of project management problems including  inadequate project management structure, schedule-driven projects, and  lack of performance metrics and oversight.", "Quality assurance. Quality assurance provides independent assessments  of whether management process requirements are being followed and  whether product standards and requirements are being satisfied. This  process includes, among other things, the use of independent verification  and validation (IV&V). We and others have reported on problems related  to agencies\u2019 use of IV&V including specific functions not being performed  by the IV&V, the IV&V contractor not being independent, and IV&V  recommendations not being implemented.", "Inadequate implementation of disciplined processes can manifest itself in  many ways when implementing a financial management system. While full  deployment has been delayed at some agencies, specific functionality has  been delayed or flawed at other agencies. The following examples  illustrate some of the recurring problems related to the lack of disciplined  processes in implementing financial management systems.", "In May 2004, we reported significant flaws in requirements management  and testing that adversely affected the initial development and  implementation of the Army\u2019s Logistics Modernization Program (LMP), in  which the Army estimated that it would invest about $1 billion. These  flaws also hampered efforts to correct the operational difficulties  experienced at the Tobyhanna Army Depot. In June 2005, we reported  that the Army had not effectively addressed its requirements management  and testing problems, and data conversion weaknesses had hampered the  Army\u2019s ability to address the problems that needed to be corrected before  the system could be fielded to other locations. The Army lacked  reasonable assurance that (1) system problems experienced during the  initial deployment and causing the delay of future deployments had been  corrected and (2) LMP was capable of providing the promised system  functionality. Subsequent deployments of the system have been delayed.", "We reported in February 2005 that our experience with major systems  acquisitions, such as the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM)  Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) program, has shown that having  sound disciplined processes in place increases the likelihood of the  acquisitions meeting cost and schedule estimates as well as performance  requirements. However, we found that many of the processes in these  areas for RSM were not sufficiently developed, were still under  development, or were planned for future development. For example, OPM  lacked needed processes for developing and managing requirements,  planning and managing project activities, managing risks, and providing  sound information to investment decision makers. Without these  processes in place, RSM was at increased risk of not being developed and  delivered on time and within budget and falling short of promised  capabilities.", "In August 2004, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) IG reported that  the effect of transferring inaccurate data to VA\u2019s new core financial system  at a pilot location interrupted patient care and medical center operations.  This raised concerns that similar conversion problems would occur at  other VA facilities if the conditions identified were not addressed and  resolved nationwide prior to roll out. Some of the specific conditions the  IG noted were that contracting and monitoring of the project were not  adequate, and the deployment of the new system encountered multiple  problems, including those related to software testing, data conversion and  system interfaces, and project management. As a result of these problems,  patient care was interrupted by supply outages and other problems. The  inability to provide sterile equipment and needed supplies to the operating  room resulted in the cancelation of 81 elective surgeries for a week in both  November 2003 and February 2004. In addition, the operating room was  forced to operate at two-thirds of its prior capacity. Because of the serious  nature of the problems raised with the new system, VA management  decided to focus on transitioning back to the previous financial  management software at the pilot location and assembled a senior  leadership team to examine the results of the pilot and make  recommendations to the VA Secretary regarding the future of the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Capital Management Problems Impede Financial Systems Development and Deployment", "paragraphs": ["We are concerned that federal agencies\u2019 human capital problems are  eroding the ability of many agencies\u2014and threatening the ability of  others\u2014to perform their IT missions economically, efficiently, and  effectively. For example, we found that in the 1990s, the initial rounds of  downsizing were set in motion without considering the longer-term effects  on agencies\u2019 IT performance capacity. Additionally, a number of individual  agencies drastically reduced or froze their hiring efforts for extended  periods. Consequently, following a decade of downsizing and curtailed  investments in human capital, federal agencies currently face skills,  knowledge, and experience imbalances, especially in their IT workforces.  Without corrective action, these imbalances will worsen, especially in light  of the numbers of federal civilian workers becoming eligible to retire in  the coming years. In this regard, we are emphasizing the need for  additional focus on the following three key elements of human capital  management.", "Strategic workforce planning. Having staff with the appropriate skills is  key to achieving financial management improvements, and managing an  organization\u2019s employees is essential to achieving results. It is important  that agencies incorporate strategic workforce planning by (1) aligning an  organization\u2019s human capital program with its current and emerging  mission and programmatic goals and (2) developing long-term strategies  for acquiring, developing, and retaining an organization\u2019s total workforce  to meet the needs of the future. This incorporates a range of activities  from identifying and defining roles and responsibilities, to identifying team  members, to developing individual competencies that enhance  performance. We have reported on agencies without a sufficient human  capital strategy or plan, skills gap analysis, or training plans.", "Human resources. Having sufficient numbers of people on board with  the right mix of knowledge and skills can make the difference between  success and failure. This is especially true in the IT area, where  widespread shortfalls in human capital have contributed to demonstrable  shortfalls in agency and program performance. We have found agency  projects with significant human resource challenges, including addressing  personnel shortages, filling key positions, and developing and retaining  staff with the required competencies.", "Change management. According to leading IT organizations,  organizational change management is the process of preparing users for  the business process changes that will accompany implementation of a  new system. An effective organizational change management process  includes project plans and training that prepare users for impacts the new  system might have on their roles and responsibilities and a process to  manage those changes. We have reported on various problems with  agencies\u2019 change management, including transition plans not being  developed, business processes not being reengineered, and customization  not being limited.", "The following examples illustrate some of the recurring problems related  to human capital management in implementing financial management  systems.", "We first reported in February 2002 that the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) had not defined or implemented an IT human capital strategy for its  Business Systems Modernization (BSM) program and recommended that  IRS address this weakness. In June 2003, we reported that IRS had made  important progress in addressing our recommendation, but had yet to  develop a comprehensive multiyear workforce plan. IRS also had not  hired, developed, or retained sufficient human capital resources with the  required competencies, including technical skills, in specific mission  areas. In September 2003, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration reported that IRS\u2019s Modernization and IT Services  organization had made significant progress in developing its human capital  strategy but had not yet (1) identified and incorporated human capital  asset demands for the modernized organization, (2) developed detailed  hiring and retention plans, or (3) established a process for reviewing the  human capital strategy development and monitoring its implementation.  We most recently reported in July 2005 that IRS had taken some steps in  the right direction. However, until IRS fully implements its strategy, it will  not have all of the necessary IT knowledge and skills to effectively manage  the BSM program or to operate modernized systems. Consequently, the  risk of BSM program and project cost increases, schedule slippages, and  performance problems is increased.", "We reported, in September 2004, that staff shortages and limited strategic  workforce planning resulted in the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) not having the resources needed to effectively design and  operate its new financial management system. HHS had taken the first  steps in strategic workforce planning. For example, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where the first deployment was  scheduled, was the only operating division that had prepared a  competency report, but a skills gap analysis and training plan for CDC had  not been completed. In addition, many government and contractor  positions on the implementation project were not filled as planned. While  HHS and the systems integrator had taken measures to acquire additional  human resources for the implementation of the new financial management  system, we concluded that scarce resources could significantly jeopardize  the project\u2019s success and lead to several key deliverables being  significantly behind schedule. In September 2004, HHS decided to delay its  first scheduled deployment at CDC by 6 months in order to address these  and other issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Faces Serious Financial Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["DHS faces unique challenges in attempting to develop integrated financial  management systems across the breadth of such a large and diverse  department.

It  also describes the operations that must be performed, who must perform  them, and where and how the operations will be carried out.

However, risk can be  managed and reduced to acceptable levels through the use of disciplined  processes, which in short represent best practices that have proven their  value in the past. We view the application of disciplined processes to be  essential for DHS\u2019s systems modernization efforts. Based on industry best  practices, the following four concepts would help ensure a sound  foundation for developing and implementing a DHS-wide solution for the  complex financial management problems it currently faces: (1) developing  a concept of operations that expresses DHS\u2019s view of financial  management and how that vision will be realized, (2) defining standard  business processes, (3) developing an implementation strategy, and   (4) defining and effectively implementing applicable disciplined processes.  If properly implemented, the best practices discussed here today and in  our recently issued report will help reduce the risk associated with a  project of this magnitude and importance to an acceptable level. With DHS  at an important crossroads in the implementation of the eMergefoundation on which to base its efforts and avoid the problems that have  plagued so many other federal agencies faced with the same challenge.", "Mr. Chairmen, this concludes our prepared statement.
