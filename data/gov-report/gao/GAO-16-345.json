From school years 2000-01 to 2013-14 (the most recent data available), the percentage of all K-12 public schools that had high percentages of poor and Black or Hispanic students grew from 9 to 16 percent, according to GAO's analysis of data from the Department of Education (Education). These schools were the most racially and economically concentrated: 75 to 100 percent of the students were Black or Hispanic and eligible for free or reduced-price lunch\u2014a commonly used indicator of poverty. GAO's analysis of Education data also found that compared with other schools, these schools offered disproportionately fewer math, science, and college preparatory courses and had disproportionately higher rates of students who were held back in 9th grade, suspended, or expelled.", "In the three districts GAO reviewed as case studies, officials reported implementing various actions to increase economic and racial diversity to address racial or other demographic shifts in school composition. For example, in one predominantly low-income, Black and Hispanic school district, the state and district created state-of-the-art magnet schools to attract students from more economically and racially diverse groups. However, these three districts faced challenges. For example, one state devoted funding to magnet schools while the district's traditional schools declined in quality, according to local officials. Further, according to officials, some magnets with openings could not accept minority students because doing so would interfere with the ratio of minority to non-minority students that the district was trying to achieve.", "The Departments of Education and Justice have taken a range of actions to identify and address racial discrimination against students. Education has investigated schools, analyzed its data by student groups protected under federal civil rights laws, and found discrimination and disparities in some cases. GAO analyzed Education's data among types of schools (charters, magnets, and traditional public schools) by percentage of racial minorities and a proxy for poverty level and found multiple disparities, including in access to academic courses. Education does not routinely analyze its data in this way. Conducting this type of analysis would enhance Education's ability to target technical assistance and identify other disparities by school types and groups. The Department of Justice (Justice) has also investigated discrimination claims, and it monitors and enforces 178 open federal desegregation court cases to which it is a party, many of which originated 30 or 40 years ago to remedy segregation. However, GAO found that Justice does not track key summary case information, such as the last action taken in a case. As a result, some may unintentionally remain dormant for long periods. For example, in one case the court noted there had been a lack of activity and that if Justice had \u201cbeen keeping an eye\u201d on relevant information, such as test score disparities, the issue could have been addressed in a more timely way. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use information to help identify specific actions that need to be taken to allow for effective monitoring. Without tracking key information about open cases, Justice's ability toward effectively monitor such cases is hampered."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education more routinely analyze its civil rights data to identify disparities among types and groups of schools and that Justice systematically track key information on open federal school desegregation cases to which it is a party to better inform its monitoring.

Board of Education of Topeka, which found racial segregation in  public schools to violate the U.S. Constitution, many schools were  required to take action to desegregate. Subsequent federal legislation,  including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was enacted to prohibit racial  discrimination in public schools; the workplace; and in places that serve  the public, such as hotels, restaurants, and theaters. While much has  changed in public education in the decades following this landmark  decision and subsequent legislative action, research has shown that  some of the most vexing issues affecting children and their access to  educational excellence and opportunity today are inextricably linked to  race and poverty. At the backdrop of these issues, a history of  discriminatory practices has contributed to inequities in education for  some students. Further, efforts to increase the diversity of schools are  hampered sometimes because the composition of neighborhood schools  is often a microcosm of children\u2019s neighborhoods. Thus, children who live  in neighborhoods with a high minority population and with high levels of  poverty tend to go to schools mirroring these demographics.", "To shed light on this topic, you asked us to explore issues related to the  racial and socioeconomic composition of students in K-12 public schools.  This report examines (1) how the percentage of schools with high  percentages of poor and Black or Hispanic students has changed over  time and the characteristics of these schools, (2) why and how selected  school districts have implemented actions to increase student diversity,  and (3) the extent to which the Departments of Education and Justice  have taken actions to identify and address issues related to racial  discrimination in schools.", "To determine changes in the percentage of schools with specific  socioeconomic and racial characteristics over time, we analyzed the  Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Common Core of Data, a national  dataset on all K-12 public schools in the United States. Using this dataset,  we analyzed data on schools with different levels of poverty and different  levels of Black or Hispanic students from selected school years from  2000-01 to 2013-14, which were the most recent data available. In this  report, we used students\u2019 eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch as a  proxy commonly used to identify poverty levels among schools. We  focused on Black and Hispanic students because they are the two largest  minority groups in U.S. public schools, and literature shows that these  groups experience disparities across a range of areas critical to success  in school and the workforce. Further, to compare characteristics of  schools with high poverty and high concentrations of Black or Hispanic  students to other schools, we analyzed another national Education  dataset\u2014the Civil Rights Data Collection\u2014for school year 2011-12. This  dataset offered the most recent point-in-time data for all U.S. K-12 public  schools for certain data elements, including student characteristics,  course offerings, and disciplinary incidents. We determined that the data  from both datasets were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report  by reviewing documentation about the systems used to produce the data,  and interviewing Education officials. Our analyses of Education\u2019s data in  this report are intended to describe selected characteristics of these  schools; they should not be used to make conclusions about the  presence or absence of unlawful discrimination.", "To illustrate why and how selected school districts have taken actions to  increase the student diversity of their K-12 public schools, we interviewed  (and in two locations visited) officials from one school district in each of  three states (one in the Northeast, South, and West). We selected states  to include different regions of the country, and we selected school districts  within these states that had taken action to increase diversity. We relied  on recommendations from subject matter specialists and a review of  available information to select school districts. Within these districts, the  schools we visited were selected to include a mix of grade level  (elementary, middle, and high school), school type (traditional public and  magnet), and location (urban and suburban). We interviewed different  stakeholders in each district, such as school district superintendents,  school board members, state education officials, community leaders, and  school officials. While not generalizable to all schools, districts, or to all  actions schools could take to diversify, they illustrate a variety of actions  districts have taken to increase student diversity.", "To describe the actions taken by the Departments of Education and  Justice to address issues related to racial discrimination against students  in K-12 public schools, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations,  and agency documents, and interviewed agency officials. We assessed  agencies\u2019 actions using GAO standards for internal control in the federal  government as well as agency guidance and strategic plans.

Board of Education of Topeka decision,  the United States Supreme Court unanimously held that state laws  establishing \u201cseparate but equal\u201d public schools for Blacks and Whites  were unconstitutional. Ten years after this decision, a relatively small  percentage of Black children in the Deep South attended integrated  schools. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in schools,  employment, and places of public accommodation, and created a new  role for federal agencies. Both the Department of Education\u2019s (Education)  Office for Civil Rights and the Department of Justice\u2019s (Justice) Civil  Rights Division\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section have some  responsibility for enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which  prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in  programs or activities that receive federal funding, including educational  institutions. In addition, Title IV of the Act authorizes Education to  provide technical assistance to states or school districts in preparing,  adopting, and implementing desegregation plans, to arrange for training  for school personnel on dealing with educational problems caused by  desegregation, and to provide grants to school boards for staff training or  hiring specialists to address desegregation. Title IV of the Act also  authorizes Justice to file suit in federal court to enforce the civil rights of  students in public education, and Title IX of the Act authorizes Justice to  intervene\u2014that is, become a party\u2014in federal discrimination lawsuits  alleging constitutional violations. Further, Justice has responsibility for  enforcing the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, which among  other things, prohibits states from denying equal educational opportunity  to individuals, including deliberate segregation of students on the basis of  race, color, or national origin.", "To aid it in its enforcement and oversight of federal civil rights laws,  Education also collects data from school districts about student  characteristics and academic offerings, among other things, and compiles  these data into a dataset referred to as the Civil Rights Data Collection (or  Civil Rights Data). In school year 2011-12, for the first time in about a  decade, Education collected these data from all K-12 public schools in the  United States. It makes its Civil Rights Data available to the public so  that researchers, states, and districts can conduct their own analyses.  Beyond its enforcement of federal civil rights laws, Education funds  several programs to support diversity in schools. Through its Magnet  Schools Assistance Program, Education provides grants to local  educational agencies to establish and operate magnet schools that are  operated under an eligible desegregation plan. These grants are  intended to assist in the desegregation of public schools by supporting  the elimination, reduction, and prevention of minority group isolation in  elementary and secondary schools with substantial proportions of  minority group students. Additionally, through its Excellent Educators of  All Initiative, Education launched a 50-state strategy to enforce a statutory  provision that required states to take steps to ensure that poor and  minority students are not taught by inexperienced, unqualified, or out-of- field teachers at higher rates than other students.", "Justice also monitors and enforces the implementation of any open  school desegregation court order to which Justice is a party. In court  cases where school districts were found to have engaged in segregation  or discrimination, courts may issue orders requiring the districts to take  specific steps to desegregate their schools or otherwise comply with the  law. These \u201cdesegregation orders\u201d may include various requirements,  such as creating special schools and redrawing attendance zones in such  a way as to foster more racial diversity. A federal desegregation order  may be lifted when the court determines that the school district has  complied in good faith with the order since it was entered and has  eliminated all vestiges of past unlawful discrimination to the extent  practicable, which is commonly referred to as achieving unitary status.  According to Justice officials, the onus is on the school district, not  Justice, to seek unitary status because Justice cannot compel a district to  ask the court to lift its order. In general, if a district seeks to have a  desegregation order lifted, it must file a motion for unitary status with the  court. According to information we reviewed, some districts may choose  to keep their order in place, even though they have successfully  desegregated. Among other things, these orders, according to experts,  can help to ensure that schools will not resegregate. Some of the cases  that originally ordered districts to desegregate their schools back in the  1960s and 1970s are still open today.", "School districts that are not subject to a desegregation order may  voluntarily take actions to increase the racial diversity of their schools.  Court decisions have also shaped such efforts. For example, in 2007, in  Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1,  the U.S. Supreme Court struck down several school districts\u2019 student  assignment plans that relied on racial classification. The Court held that  the districts failed to show that the use of race in their student assignment  plans was necessary to achieve their goal of racial diversity, noting  among other things that the racial classifications used had minimal effect  on student assignments and that the districts had failed to consider race- neutral alternatives to increase diversity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Racial and Socioeconomic Demographics of Schools", "paragraphs": ["The composition of the student population in U.S. K-12 public schools has  changed significantly over time. In 1975, approximately a decade after  enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Black students were the largest  minority group in schools, comprising 14 percent of students and with a  poverty rate of about 40 percent. In school year 2013-14, Hispanic  students were the largest minority group in schools (25 percent Hispanic  students compared to 16 percent Black students), and both groups  continue to have poverty rates two to three times higher than the rates of  White students. The link between racial and ethnic minorities and poverty  is long-standing, as reflected in these data. According to several studies,  there is concern about this segment of the population that falls at the  intersection of poverty and minority status in schools and how this affects  their access to quality education. Of the approximately 93,400 K-12 public  schools in the United States, in school year 2013-2014 90 percent of  them were traditional schools (which are often located within a  neighborhood or community to serve students residing there), 7 percent  were charter schools, and 3 percent were magnet schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research on Student Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["An extensive body of research over the past 10 years shows a clear link  between schools\u2019 socioeconomic (or income) composition and student  academic outcomes.

For example, one study we reviewed  showed that as the average family income of a school increased, the  academic achievement and attainment of students of all racial  backgrounds increased. The converse was also true. For example,  another study found that students attending schools with lower average  family income learned at a slower pace than students attending schools  where income was higher.", "The studies, however, paint a more nuanced picture of the effects of  schools\u2019 racial composition on student academic outcomes. Specifically,  while some of the studies found that having higher percentages of Black  or Hispanic students resulted in weaker student outcomes, those effects  were often confounded by other factors, including family income, and  sometimes the racial composition of schools affected students differently.  For example, one study concluded that the average family income of a  school had a stronger and more negative effect on academic outcomes,  but it also found that, after controlling for other factors, as the percentage  of minority students increased in a school, Hispanic students were more  likely to graduate from high school, and Asian students were less likely to  graduate compared to White students. In another example, a 2010  study found that, after controlling for characteristics such as average  family income in the neighborhood, the percentage of Black students in a  school had no effect on the likelihood of high school graduation for  students of all racial groups and had a small positive effect for all  students\u2019 chances of earning a bachelor\u2019s degree.

For example, officials said maintaining a certain ratio of non- minority students posed challenges. According to the district  superintendent, even if there were openings, many minority students in  the district were unable to attend certain magnet schools because doing  so would interfere with the ratio of minorities to non-minorities the state  was attempting to achieve. In addition, because assignment to magnet  schools was done through a lottery, students were not guaranteed a slot  in a magnet school. Officials told us that in those cases where there was  not enough space in a magnet school or where admitting more minority  students would disrupt the ratio of minorities to non-minorities, these  students would attend their traditional neighborhood school. Because the  lottery did not guarantee all students in the urban district a magnet school  slot, a student also had to designate four other school options.  However, without a similar infusion of funds that was available for the  magnet schools, officials we spoke to said that the neighborhood schools  in the urban district declined. As a result, families that did not gain access  to well-supported magnet schools resented resources spent on these  schools, according to officials. Also, because the neighborhood schools  were not required to maintain a specified percentage of minority students  like the magnets, they, as well as the charter schools in the urban district,  continued not to be very diverse, according to officials.", "The state also enabled students from the urban district to enroll in  traditional schools (non-magnet) in the suburbs by drawing four  attendance zones around the urban district. Creation of these zones  reduced bus travel times for students and facilitated relationships  between parents in the community whose children were attending the  same suburban school, according to officials. Parents could apply for  these traditional, suburban schools through the lottery, selecting up to five  participating suburban school districts that are designated within their  zone. If a student was not placed in one of these schools, they would  attend a school in their urban district. In addition to providing  transportation so that students could attend suburban schools, the state  offered suburban schools grants of up to $8,000 per student, an  academic and social support grant of up to $115,000 per school district,  and a capital funds grant of up to $750,000 per school district. Despite  these incentives, according to officials we interviewed, some families  chose not to enroll their children in the suburban schools and instead  opted to stay in close-by neighborhood schools, dampening the effects of  the efforts to diversify.", "School District in the South. The district in the South had previously been  under a federal desegregation order and experienced major demographic  changes going from a district serving primarily Black and White students  to one serving many other races and ethnicities as well as immigrant  populations. Students in the district represented about 120 different  nationalities and languages, and according to officials, this included  students from Somalia and Coptic Christians and Kurds from Egypt. To  address the major demographic changes and help achieve diversity  across more schools in the district, the district did away with its previous  school attendance zones, which had generally assigned students to  schools located in their geographic area or neighborhood. In its place,  the district created new student assignment zones for its schools, and  also hired an outside expert to help implement a new diversity plan.  Specifically, under the new student assignment plan, the new zones were  intended to provide greater socioeconomic and racial diversity nearer to  where students lived, according to school district officials we interviewed.  Under the new plan, parents were allowed to choose among schools  within their attendance zones, which allow greater choice of schools for  children closer to their neighborhoods. The plan also supported students  who chose to attend schools outside of these zones by providing public  transit passes, while school bus transportation was provided to students  who attended schools within their attendance zones.", "According to documents we reviewed, this district experienced challenges  implementing its revised student assignment plan. Parents\u2019 choices of  schools resulted in resegregation of students, prompting a complaint  leading to a Department of Education investigation, as well as a federal  lawsuit. According to Education officials, their investigation of the  complaint found that after the school choice period was completed and  students were enrolled for the school year, there was a significant  increase in racial isolation in some of the schools in particular urban and  suburban areas. In addition, several families and a nonprofit  organization filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the implementation of the  school district\u2019s revised student assignment plan was causing  unconstitutional racial segregation in the district. The court upheld the  plan, finding that although the plan had caused a \u201csegregative effect\u201d in  the district, there was no discriminatory intent by the officials in adopting  and implementing the plan. To address the concerns raised in the  lawsuit, the district hired an expert to refine and develop a school diversity  plan. Under this diversity plan, student diversity was defined broadly, to  include language and disability, as well as race/ethnicity and income (see  text box). However, even after implementing the new diversity plan,  officials told us that some families in their district sent their children to  private schools, rather than attend the district\u2019s public schools. These  officials also said that, in their opinion, some White families in their district  were less eager to have their children attend diverse schools.", "Diversity Plan in a School District in the South  According to district documents, a school in the district is \u201cdiverse\u201d if it meets  at least one of the following measures:  enrolls multiple racial/ethnic groups, and no single group represents more than 50  percent of the school\u2019s total enrollment;  enrolls at least three racial/ethnic groups, and each represents at least 15 percent of  the school\u2019s total enrollment; or  enrolls at least two racial/ethnic groups, and each represents at least 30 percent of  the school\u2019s total enrollment; and   at least two of the following measures:  percentage of students eligible for free or reduced meals is at least two-thirds the  average of other schools,  percentage of English Learners is at least two-thirds the average of other schools, or  percentage of students with a disability is at least two-thirds the average of other  schools.", "The district measures schools within their grade tier level. The typical grade tier levels are  elementary school (Pre-K\u20134th grade), middle school (5th-8th grade), and high school (9th- 12th grade).", "As part of the new diversity plan, the district is also hiring staff that reflect,  to the extent possible, the diversity of the student body. Further, when  making decisions about a range of matters, such as drawing school  boundary lines, placement of new schools, providing student  transportation, and recruiting and training school staff, the plan calls for  them to consider the impact of those decisions on diversity. In addition,  the district is in the process of allocating school resources with a goal of  better reflecting the different needs of students in the schools (e.g.,  English Learners).", "School District in the West. The district we visited in the West is located in  a state with an \u201copen-enrollment\u201d law, which gives parents a significant  degree of choice in determining the schools their children attend,  including schools outside of their neighborhoods. District officials told us  that, in their opinion, as a result of the state law, White students often  choose not to attend certain schools in the district. District officials told us  that this left a largely Hispanic and low-income student population in  those schools, prompting the district to implement several actions in an  attempt to diversify. Specifically, the district, led by the school board,  converted some of its existing public schools into magnet schools.  Further, to meet diverse student needs, the state provided additional  funds for high-needs students, such as those eligible for free or reduced- price lunch, English Learners, or foster care youth.", "According to officials, this district struggled to diversify because parents  have a significant degree of choice in where to enroll their children,  magnet schools give priority to children in their neighborhood, and  funding was limited for some schools. After the district implemented its  diversity efforts, district officials told us that, in their opinion, some White  families continued to choose schools outside the district and many other  families chose to keep their children in neighborhood schools where  diversity was low. In addition, the magnet schools gave priority to  neighborhood children, which further hampered attempts at diversity.  Further, although the district converted some of its schools to magnet  schools to attract students, they provided no transportation for students,  and some of the schools were converted without any upgrades to the  facilities, as state funding for education declined due to an economic  recession. One principal we interviewed at a converted magnet school  expressed frustration that his school did not have the proper signage or  visual appeal to attract families. Further, principals and other school  district officials we interviewed said that they struggled to reach capacity  in some of their schools. In contrast, one of the magnet schools we visited  had a waiting list and was a state-of-the-art facility, with Wi-Fi, computers  for every student, and 3D printers. Unlike the other magnet schools, this  school has been operating as a magnet for nearly 20 years, and at the  time of our review, had a waiting list. In further contrast, this school  received most of its funding from private donations at a level significant  enough to fund the technology focus of this school."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education and Justice Have Taken a Range of Actions to Address Racial Discrimination against Students, although Better Use of Available Data May Enhance These Efforts Education Addresses Discrimination by Conducting Investigations, Issuing Guidance, and Providing Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Education has taken a range of actions to address racial discrimination in  schools. For example, Education has conducted investigations on its  own initiative as well as investigations in response to complaints or  reports of possible discrimination. Depending on the outcome of these  investigations, Education may enter into agreements, called resolution  agreements, which establish the actions a school or school district agrees  to take to address issues found during an investigation. Education also  may withhold federal funds if a recipient is in violation of the civil rights  laws and Education is unable to reach agreement with the parties,  although officials told us that this rarely happens.", "Education\u2019s agency-initiated investigations, which are called compliance  reviews, target problems that appear particularly acute. Education\u2019s Office  for Civil Rights launched 32 compliance reviews in fiscal years 2013 and  2014 across a range of issues related to racial discrimination. For  example, in 2014 Education completed a compliance review of an entire  district\u2019s disciplinary practices. As a result of that review, Education found  that Black students were disproportionately represented among students  subject to suspensions, other disciplinary actions, and referrals to law  enforcement and that Black students were disciplined differently from  White students for similar offenses. In one instance, Education cited an  example of an 8th-grade White student who was given detention for  leaving class without permission while an 8th-grade Black student was  suspended 3 days for skipping a class even though this student had no  such prior incidents. Education entered into a resolution agreement with  the district to resolve the issues it identified, which, among other things,  required the district to collect data to monitor its disciplinary practices for  potential discrimination. The agreement also required the district to assign  a staff person responsible for ensuring that disciplinary practices are  equitable and to provide training for teachers and staff. In 2013, another  compliance review initiated by Education of a district found that Black and  Hispanic students were under-represented in high school honors and AP  courses, as well as elementary and middle school advanced courses and  gifted and talented programs. To resolve these issues, Education entered  into a resolution agreement with the district which, among other things,  required the district to identify potential barriers to student participation in  these courses, such as eligibility and selection criteria, hire a consultant  to help address this issue, and provide training for district and school staff  on how to encourage and retain student participation in these courses.  The agreement also required the district to collect and evaluate data on  an ongoing annual basis of its enrollment policies, practices, and  procedures to determine whether they are being implemented in a non- discriminatory manner.", "Further, Education has also conducted more narrowly-focused  investigations in response to complaints of discrimination, which can be  filed by anyone who believes that an educational institution that receives  federal funds has discriminated against someone on the basis of race,  color, or national origin. According to Education, it received about 2,400  such complaints in fiscal year 2014. For example, in response to a 2011  complaint alleging that a high school\u2019s football coach subjected Black  players to racial harassment and that the district failed to address it,  Education launched an investigation of the district. Education found that  the football coach directed racial slurs at Black players, and players who  complained were harassed by their fellow students and staff, who  supported the coach. Education also found that the coach did not assist  Black players with obtaining athletic scholarships, even stating that  athletic scholarships are for White players and financial aid is for Black  players. To resolve these findings, Education negotiated a resolution  agreement with the district that required the district to review and revise  its harassment and discrimination policies and take appropriate steps to  remedy the harassment by the coach, including appointing a new coach  and offering counseling for the students.", "Education has also issued guidance to schools on their obligations under  the federal civil rights laws, and its decision to issue such guidance may  be prompted by factors such as its findings from investigations or  developments in case law. For example, Education issued guidance  jointly with Justice in 2014 on school discipline to assist states, districts,  and schools in developing practices and strategies to enhance the  atmosphere in the school and ensure those policies and practices comply  with federal law. The guidance included a letter on applicable federal  civil rights laws and discipline that describes how schools can meet their  obligations under federal law to administer student discipline without  discriminating against students on the basis of race, color, or national  origin. Also in that year, Education issued guidance addressing the issue  of equitable access to educational resources. Specifically, in its  guidance, Education states that chronic and widespread racial disparities  in access to rigorous courses, academic programs, and extracurricular  activities and in other areas \u201chinder the education of students of color  today\u201d and strongly recommends that school districts proactively assess  their policies and practices to ensure that students are receiving  educational resources without regard to their race, color, or national  origin. In addition, Education issued guidance jointly with Justice in 2011  following the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Parents Involved that  addressed districts\u2019 voluntary use of race to diversify their schools. This  guidance sets forth examples of the types of actions school districts could  take to diversify their schools or avoid racial isolation, consistent with this  decision and the federal civil rights laws. It states that districts should first  consider approaches that do not rely on the race of individual students,  for example, by using race-neutral criteria such as students\u2019  socioeconomic status, before adopting approaches that rely on individual  racial classifications. For approaches that do consider a students\u2019 race as  a factor, districts should ensure their approach closely fits their goals and  considers race only as one factor among other non-racial considerations.  Further, Education also offers technical assistance, through various  means, such as conducting webinars, sponsoring and presenting at  conferences, and disseminating resource guides to schools and school  districts. For example, at a 2015 magnet school workshop, Education  officials discussed the benefits to improving diversity in the schools and  the ramifications of relevant court decisions related to diversifying  schools. They also offered examples of actions schools can take  consistent with these court decisions to promote greater school diversity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Analyses of Civil Rights Data by School Groupings Could Help Education Discern Further Disparities", "paragraphs": ["Education uses its Civil Rights Data to identify patterns, trends,  disparities, and potential discrimination by performing analysis of  particular groups of students, such as by race and ethnicity, and could  further enhance its current efforts by also more routinely analyzing data  by school types and groupings. Analyzing data by schools may help  discern patterns and trends occurring in different types of schools, such  as the disparities our analysis revealed in high-poverty schools comprised  of mostly Black or Hispanic students. For example, through its analysis  of its Civil Rights Data, Education identified an issue nationwide with  disproportionately high suspension and expulsion rates of certain groups  of students by race, among other characteristics. Education uses these  analyses to inform its investigations and guidance. For example, its  analysis of its Civil Rights Data, which showed disparities across groups  of students by race and other factors in students\u2019 access to academic  courses (such as algebra and AP courses), helped inform an investigation  and resulted in guidance. According to Education, it typically analyzes  its data by student groups to help it identify disparities or potential  discrimination against students on the basis of race, color, or national  origin, consistent with the civil rights laws it enforces.", "While these analyses, by specific groups of students, are important to its  enforcement responsibilities, by also more routinely analyzing data by  different types and groupings of schools, other patterns might be  revealed, as our own analyses show. In addition, although socioeconomic  status is not a protected class under the U.S. Constitution or federal civil  rights laws, research has shown that poverty (socioeconomic status) and  race overlap (see app. III). By examining these two phenomena in  tandem, Education has another lens for examining any possible issues at  the school level. Education has used its Civil Rights Data to publish a  2014 \u201cdata snapshot\u201d on school discipline that highlighted disparities by  race, ethnicity, and English Learner status, among other characteristics.  To illustrate where Education might enhance such an analysis, our  analysis of the same data also found disparities and differences between  groups of schools\u2014with disparities most evident for H/PBH schools.  Further, Education\u2019s data snapshot on college and career readiness, also  based on its analysis of Civil Rights Data, showed disparities in access to  core subjects, such as algebra I and II, geometry, biology, chemistry, and  AP courses by various student groups. Again, analyzing the same data,  we also found these disparities, but we found them among schools  grouped by level of poverty and among Black and Hispanic students, with  disparities most acute among H/PBH schools. In addition, our analyses  showed further disparities when we grouped schools by types\u2014 traditional, charter, and magnet schools. For example, one of our  analyses of Education\u2019s school year 2011-12 data showed that, among  H/PBH schools, a higher percentage of magnet schools (83 percent)  offered AP courses than did the traditional schools (50 percent) or charter  schools (32 percent). While Education\u2019s analyses of its Civil Rights Data  provide critical information to aid its enforcement of civil rights laws, also  analyzing these data by different groupings and types of schools could  provide Education with an additional layer of information that, as we  found, further illuminates disparities and could enhance their efforts.  Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use  operational data to ensure effective and efficient use of agency  resources. By analyzing its data by groupings and types of schools,  Education has an opportunity to enhance its efforts and better inform  guidance and technical assistance to the groups and types of schools that  need it most."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Justice Addresses Discrimination by Conducting Investigations, Issuing Guidance, and Taking Legal Action", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Justice\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section of the  Civil Rights Division has taken several actions to address racial  discrimination against students. Similar to Education, Justice conducts  investigations in response to complaints or reports of possible violations.  Depending on the outcome of its investigation and the circumstances of  the case, Justice may take a number of actions, which could include  entering into a settlement agreement with the district or initiating litigation  to enforce the civil rights laws. For example, Justice investigated  complaints in 2011 alleging that a student had been subject to racial  harassment at a high school, which included receiving race-based death  threats and retaliation for reporting the harassment. The investigation  found that the district failed to adequately investigate, address, and  prevent recurrence of the harassment, which resulted in the student  leaving the district out of fear for her safety, and that other Black students  had experienced racial harassment and retaliation. Justice entered into a  settlement agreement with the district that included making revisions to  the policies and procedures for handling racial harassment complaints.  Justice has also intervened, that is joined in and became a party, in  discrimination lawsuits. For example, in 2000 Justice intervened in a civil  rights lawsuit against a district, alleging the district failed to appropriately  address harassment of a pair of students by other students. The alleged  harassment included racial slurs, including some within earshot of  teachers, and racial graffiti on walls and desks. Further, one of the  students was the victim of a racially motivated assault. The parties  negotiated an agreement, which was adopted by the court as an order,  that required the district to, among other things, maintain written records  of each harassment allegation received, investigation conducted, and  corrective action taken by the district to ensure a consistent and effective  review of allegations. Further, as previously mentioned, Justice has  issued guidance jointly with Education to ensure states and school  districts understand their responsibilities to prevent and address racial  discrimination in schools.", "Justice also monitors and enforces open federal school desegregation  cases where Justice is a party to the litigation. According to Justice  officials, as of November 2015 there were 178 of these cases. Justice  officials told us they routinely work with districts (and other parties to the  desegregation case) to close out those cases where the school district  has met its statutory and Constitutional duty to desegregate. For  example, in January 2015, Justice completed its compliance monitoring  visits for a school district that had been operating under a series of  consent orders since 1970, most recently one from 2012. Justice  determined that the district had complied with the terms of the  desegregation order. The parties agreed, and in May 2015 the court  declared the district unitary, thus allowing the desegregation order to be  lifted. Justice has also recently engaged in active litigation in several open  desegregation cases. For example, in 2011, as a party to another long- standing desegregation case, Justice filed a motion asking the court to  find that the district had violated its obligations under several prior  desegregation orders. In 2012, the court determined, among other things,  that although the district had made significant progress, two  predominantly Black schools had never been desegregated, and the court  ordered the district to draft a plan to improve integration at those  schools. Justice officials said that they initiate action on an open  desegregation case in response to various factors, including requirements  from the court, complaints or inquiries they receive, or issues raised in  media reports. According to Justice officials, the agency also conducts  agency-initiated \u201caffirmative reviews\u201d of districts under open  desegregation orders, which could include requests for additional  supplemental data, site visits, and initiation of negotiations if compliance  issues are identified, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Justice Does Not Systematically Track Key Data to Inform Actions on Open Desegregation Cases", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, Justice is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the  178 open federal desegregation orders to which it is a party\u2014many of  which originated 30 or 40 years ago.

As a consequence,  the potential exists that some cases could unintentionally languish for  long periods of time. For example, in a 2014 opinion in a long-standing  desegregation case, the court described a long period of dormancy in the  case and stated that lack of activity had taken its toll, noting, among other  things, that the district had not submitted the annual reports required  under the consent order to the court for the past 20 years. Although the  court found certain disparities in educational programs and student test  results, based on the record at the time it was unable to determine when  the disparities arose or whether they were a result of discrimination.

Research has shown a clear link between a school\u2019s  poverty level and student academic outcomes, with higher poverty  associated with worse educational outcomes. While the districts we  contacted in different areas across the nation have efforts under way to  help improve the quality of education for students, the Departments of  Education and Justice have roles that are critical because they are  responsible for enforcing federal laws that protect students from racial  discrimination and ensuring schools and districts provide all students with  equitable access. In doing so, both agencies can better leverage data  available to them to aid their guidance, enforcement, and oversight  efforts. Education has ongoing efforts to collect data that it uses to identify  potential discrimination and disparities across key groups of students, but  it has not routinely analyzed its data in a way that may reveal larger  patterns among different types and groups of schools.

Although our report does not make this  statement, we have added additional language to further clarify that data  on disparities alone are not sufficient to establish unlawful discrimination.", "With respect to the report\u2019s description of a selected desegregation case,  Justice stated it was concerned with the emphasis we placed on one  comment in the lengthy court opinion (\u201c\u2026if Justice had \u2018been keeping an  eye\u2019 on relevant information\u2026\u201d), which it said was based solely on the  absence of entries on the court\u2019s docket sheet. Justice said in this case  and in many others, it is engaged in a range of related activities, such as  site visits and settlement agreements, which are not recorded on the  courts\u2019 docket sheets. We appreciate that courts may not be aware of all  of Justice\u2019s activities in any one case; however, we believe this case  illustrates how important it is for Justice to have timely information about  its cases and how better information tracking could help the agency better  manage and oversee its caseload. Also, with respect to this case, Justice  commented that the existence of disparities in test scores alone is not  sufficient to trigger a remedy under Justice\u2019s legal authority, and Justice  must consider multiple factors before taking action in a case. We have  clarified in the report that data on disparities taken alone are insufficient to  establish unlawful discrimination. While we understand that tracking such  information may not necessarily trigger action by Justice in any particular  case, the case described was selected to serve as an example of the  potential benefits of more proactive tracking of information in these cases.", "Further, Justice said it was concerned the report could be read to suggest  that some cases have remained dormant or languished for long periods of  time as a result of Justice\u2019s tracking system, without sufficient  appreciation for the responsibilities of the school districts and courts in  advancing and resolving the cases (such as by achieving unitary status).  In the draft report on which Justice commented, we stated that the onus is  on the district, not Justice, to seek unitary status. We have amended the  final report to state this more prominently. However, while we  acknowledge the key roles of the districts and the courts in resolving and  advancing a desegregation case, the focus of our report is on the federal  role, and Justice, too, plays an important role in litigating these cases\u2014a  role we believe would be enhanced by improving its tracking of  information about the cases.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We measured poverty level at the  school level using the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced- price lunch. A student is generally eligible for free or reduced-price lunch  based on federal income eligibility guidelines that are tied to the federal  poverty level and the size of the family. We focused on Black and  Hispanic students because they are the two largest minority groups in  U.S. K-12 public schools, and existing research has suggested that these  groups experience disparities in school. The thresholds and measure of  poverty discussed here and below was commonly used in the literature  and also aligns with how Education analyzes its data.", "We categorized schools for our analysis based on both the percent of  students in a school eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and the  percent of Black or Hispanic students collectively in a school (see table  1). We divided our data into three school groups as follows:  1.  Schools whose student populations were comprised of 0 to 25 percent  students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (i.e., low-poverty) and  0 to 25 percent Black or Hispanic students (referred to as \u201cL/PBH  schools\u201d),  2.

Schools that fall outside of these two categories (referred to as \u201call  other schools\u201d).", "Because the literature also suggests that schools with even higher levels  of Blacks and Hispanics and poverty face disparities that are even more  acute, we also analyzed the group of schools in which 90 to 100 percent  of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and 90 to 100  percent of the students were Black or Hispanic. These schools represent  6 percent of all K-12 public schools and are included in appendix II for  further comparison.

We used Education\u2019s  Common Core of Data (CCD) from school years 2000-01, 2005-06, 2010- 11, and 2013-14, the most recent year of data available for these  analyses. CCD is administered by Education\u2019s National Center for  Education Statistics, which annually collects non-fiscal data about all  public schools, as well as fiscal and non-fiscal data on public school  districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are  supplied by state education agency officials describing their schools and  school districts. Data elements include name, address, and phone  number of the school or school district; demographic information about  students and staff; and fiscal data, such as revenues and current  expenditures. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed  technical documentation and interviewed relevant officials from  Education. Based on these efforts, we determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. The data in the CCD represent the  full universe of all U.S. K-12 public schools. To further understand the  trends underlying the growth or decline of these categories of schools, we  examined whether any variation in growth existed by region  (Northeastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western areas of the United  States) and school type (traditional neighborhood schools, charter  schools, and magnet schools). For our analysis of the CCD, we excluded  schools that did not report information on (1) free or reduced-price lunch,  which we used as a proxy to categorize the poverty level of the school or  (2) the number of Black or Hispanic students, which we used to  categorize the level of Black or Hispanic students in the school. For  school year 2000-01, we included 78,194 schools and excluded 16,520  schools; for school year 2005-06, we included 91,910 schools and  excluded 8,717 schools; for school year 2010-11, we included 94,612  schools and excluded 7,413 schools; and for school year 2013-14, we  included 93,458 schools and excluded 7,633 schools. Because CCD  collects information on the universe of schools, these exclusions would  not affect our overall findings.", "There are several sources of non-sampling error associated with the  CCD, which is self-reported and collected from the universe of schools  and school districts. Non-sampling errors can be introduced in many  ways. For example, they can result from data processing or data entry,  when respondents misinterpret survey questions, do not follow survey  instructions, or do not follow the item definitions correctly. Further, while  CCD\u2019s coverage of traditional public schools and school districts is very  complete, coverage of publicly funded education outside of traditional  school districts has varying levels of coverage within different states and  jurisdictions. Some states do not report schools that are administered by  state organizations other than state educational agencies. Examples  include charter schools authorized by an organization that is not a school  district, schools sponsored by health and human services agencies within  a state, and juvenile justice facilities. In recent years, Education has  increased efforts to identify schools that may be underreported by state  educational agencies. Further, because this information is self-reported,  there is also the potential for misreporting of information. Education  attempts to minimize these errors in several ways, including through  training, extensive quality reviews, and data editing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the Civil Rights Data Collection", "paragraphs": ["To examine additional characteristics about schools the students  attended, we analyzed data from the public use file of Education\u2019s Civil  Rights Data Collection (referred to as the Civil Rights Data in this report)  for school year 2011-12, which was the most recent year of data  available. The Civil Rights Data\u2014collected on a biennial basis\u2014consists  of data on the nation\u2019s public schools, including student characteristics  and enrollment; educational and course offerings; disciplinary actions;  and school environment, such as incidences of bullying. To assess the  reliability of these data, we reviewed technical documentation, and  interviewed relevant officials from Education. Based on these efforts, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. The  Civil Rights Data is part of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights\u2019 overall  strategy for administering and enforcing the federal civil rights statutes for  which it is responsible. While this information was collected from a  sample of schools in previous years, it was collected from the full  universe of all U.S. K-12 public schools in 2011-12. By analyzing these  data across the school categories in table 1, we were able to present data  on the differences in the availability of courses offered among schools  with different levels of poverty among students and Black or Hispanic  students. For example, we were able to analyze differences among  schools with respect to school offerings, such as advanced math and  science courses\u2014as well as advanced academic programs, Advanced  Placement courses, and Gifted and Talented Education programs. We  were also able to examine differences in the level of disciplinary  incidents\u2014such as more than one out-of-school suspension, arrests  related to school activity, and bullying\u2014and the percentage of English  Learners and students with disabilities. We also examined the numbers of  full-time teachers with more than one year of experience, licensed and  certified teachers, and teacher absences. The data also allowed us to  analyze differences by type of school\u2014traditional neighborhood schools,  charter schools, and magnet schools (see app. II). For this analysis we  matched schools in the Civil Rights Data for school year 2011-12 (the  most year recent for which Civil Rights Data are available) to schools in  the CCD for school year 2011-12 and excluded schools for which there  was not a match. Further, from the Civil Rights Data, we also excluded  schools that did not report (1) free or reduced-price school lunch, which  we used as a proxy to categorize the poverty level of the school or (2) the  number of Black or Hispanic students, which we used to categorize the  level of Black or Hispanic students in the school. As a result, our analysis  of the Civil Rights Data for school year 2011-12 included 95,635 schools  and excluded 5,675 schools. In the report, we present different years for  the Civil Rights Data and CCD and, as a result, the numbers and  percentages of schools and students derived from these two sets of data  will not match.", "As with the CCD, the school year 2011-12 Civil Rights Data collected the  full universe of schools and districts, with 99.2 and 98.4 percent response  rate, respectively. These data are also subject to non-sampling error, and  because these data are self-reported, there is also the potential for  misreporting of information. For these data, Education put in place quality  control and editing procedures to reduce errors. Further, for the school  year 2011-12 Civil Rights Data, respondents were to answer each  question on the Civil Rights Data survey prior to certification. Null or  missing data prevented a school district from completing their Civil Rights  Data submission to Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. Therefore, in cases  where a school district may not have complete data, some schools or  districts may have reported a zero value in place of a null value. It is not  possible to determine all possible situations where this may have  occurred. As such, it may be the case that the item response rates may  be positively biased. Further, within this dataset there are outliers that  likely represented misreported values. These outliers had the potential to  heavily influence state or national totals. To ensure the integrity of the  state and national totals, the Office for Civil Rights suppressed outliers  identified by data quality rules. These rules flagged inconsistent and  implausible values for suppression. To mitigate the potential for  suppressions that distort aggregate totals, suppressed data were  replaced with imputed data where possible.
