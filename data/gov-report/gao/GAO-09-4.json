The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) required that plan sponsors send an Annual Notice of Change (ANOC)--using either its model or a nonmodel format--before the 2008 AEP. Among other things, GAO examined: (1) stakeholders' views of the model ANOC and CMS's efforts to assure its effectiveness, and (2) how the scheduling of the AEP affects the enrollment process for beneficiaries switching PDPs. Among the largest PDP sponsors, we selected eight to interview along with other stakeholders involved in the AEP. We also obtained and analyzed data from CMS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Sponsors, pharmacists, beneficiary advocates, and counselors GAO interviewed expressed concern that CMS's model ANOC for the 2008 AEP did not effectively communicate drug plan changes to enrollees. They noted that it contained language at a reading level too high for some beneficiaries as well as too much, often irrelevant, information. To help ensure their enrollees understood how plan changes would affect them personally, two study sponsors mailed additional information detailing specific changes in coverage and costs for drugs the beneficiary took in the past year. Despite GAO's previous recommendation that CMS ensure that its Part D materials meet communications guidelines, CMS's process for developing its model ANOC did not include a systematic evaluation of its effectiveness. However, CMS officials reported that they recently initiated an evaluation of their annual Medicare beneficiary materials for the 2010 AEP that will examine reading levels, effectiveness, and length, among other factors. Such an evaluation is important in light of changes CMS has made for the 2009 AEP, which have raised further concerns among stakeholders. It is unclear whether alternative formats for communicating plan changes to beneficiaries will be considered. Although CMS and plan sponsors made improvements to the enrollment process, CMS data showed that about 15 percent of beneficiaries who chose to switch plans in the 2008 AEP were not fully enrolled in their new plan by January 1. Modifications to the enrollment process for the 2008 AEP reduced the time needed to enroll beneficiaries in a new plan to a median of 5 days. However, the volume of applications submitted late in the AEP contributed to beneficiaries being at risk of not having access to their new coverage by January 1. In fact, among the beneficiaries who submitted applications after December 15, 40 percent were not completely processed until after the effective date of their new coverage. As a result, stakeholders reported that beneficiaries, pharmacies, and sponsors faced various operational challenges, including the risk of inaccurate charges and additional administrative burden. Some stakeholders we interviewed for our study said that creating an interval for enrollment processing between the end of the AEP and the effective date of coverage would help ensure that beneficiaries switching plans would have their coverage in place on January 1."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) established an outpatient drug benefit, known as Medicare  Part D, that provides prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries who opt  to enroll in the program. Congress designed Medicare Part D to be a  market-driven program which promotes competition among private health  plans. Of the roughly 25 million beneficiaries enrolled in Part D as of  January 2008, about 17 million beneficiaries\u2014those in traditional  Medicare\u2014received coverage through stand-alone prescription drug plans  (PDPs). PDPs are offered by private entities, known as drug plan  sponsors, that contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency that administers the Medicare program within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In its administration of  Part D, CMS is responsible for implementing program requirements and  overseeing plan sponsors\u2019 compliance with these requirements.", "Generally, beneficiaries enrolled in PDPs are only allowed to change their  drug plan during the Part D annual coordinated election period (AEP). As  required under federal law, the AEP runs from November 15 to   December 31, with drug coverage under the elected new plan effective on  January 1 of the next year. In considering their options, beneficiaries may  have a choice of more than 50 PDPs in the state where they live. Plans  differ, for example, in the particular drugs covered, monthly premiums, or  copayments beneficiaries are responsible for paying.", "Beneficiaries may consider changing their PDP plan for a variety of  reasons, including changes in their health and prescription drug needs or  modifications by their plan. Generally, sponsors make changes to benefits  offered by their plans effective at the beginning of each benefit year. After  the opportunity to change plans during the AEP, most beneficiaries  enrolled in PDPs are locked into their plan for the benefit year. Thus,  beneficiaries should determine whether drugs they previously used will  continue to be covered, have increased copayments, or have any new  access requirements in the next benefit year. In light of these types of  changes, and without the opportunity to switch plans until the next AEP, it  is important that enrollees evaluate whether their drug plans will continue  to meet their needs. To this end, it is essential that CMS ensure that  information sent to enrollees by plan sponsors prior to the AEP clearly  and effectively communicates plan changes.", "To inform enrollees about their benefits for the coming year, CMS requires  that sponsors mail enrollees an Annual Notice of Change (ANOC) for  receipt by October 31. This document describes modifications to the plan\u2019s  premium, drug coverage, cost sharing, and other features for the next  benefit year. For the 2008 AEP that began November 15, 2007, sponsors  could either adopt the model ANOC provided by CMS or create a  nonmodel ANOC that included elements required by CMS that describe  plan modifications. Nonmodel ANOCs were subject to a longer review  period by CMS. The agency also required that sponsors mail enrollees an  Evidence of Coverage (EOC) document, which details enrollees\u2019 benefits,  rights, and responsibilities under a plan, for receipt by January 31, 2008.  For the 2009 AEP starting November 15, 2008, sponsors must use CMS\u2019s  standardized ANOC and EOC, mailed together, so that enrollees receive  them by October 31, 2008. Sponsors no longer have the option to use non- model materials.", "CMS\u2019s schedule provides beneficiaries with at least 2 weeks to review the  ANOC prior to November 15\u2014the first day plans can accept AEP  enrollments. In addition, for the 2008 AEP CMS advised beneficiaries  opting to change plans to do so by December 7\u20143 weeks prior to the  official December 31 end date for the AEP. CMS recommended that  beneficiaries apply to switch plans by early December to avoid potential  problems in January, such as late or missing membership cards or  inaccurate copayment charges that may result if their applications were  not fully processed prior to January 1, 2008, the effective date of coverage.", "Despite the potential for cost increases or changes in drug coverage from  year to year, the vast majority of enrollees do not switch their drug plans.  In the 2008 AEP, about 1 million beneficiaries initiated a change from one  PDP to another. You expressed concern about how beneficiaries are  notified of plan benefit changes for the AEP. In this report, we reviewed  the notices sent to enrollees as well as the enrollment process for those  opting to switch between drug plans. Specifically, we examined:   (1) sponsors\u2019 timeliness in mailing the ANOC for the 2008 AEP and the use  of CMS\u2019s model, (2) stakeholders\u2019 views of CMS\u2019s model ANOCs and the  extent to which the agency assures that they effectively communicate plan  changes to beneficiaries, and (3) how the scheduling of the AEP affects  the enrollment process for beneficiaries choosing to switch plans.", "To address these issues, we obtained information on the practices and  experiences of sponsors, pharmacies, beneficiary advocates, and Medicare  counselors during the 2008 AEP. We interviewed representatives from  eight sponsors, each with 100,000 or more non-dual-eligible PDP enrollees  as of November 2007, which together accounted for about 70 percent of all  non-dual-eligible PDP beneficiaries. Additionally, we spoke to  associations representing pharmacists, pharmacy benefit management  companies, and health plans. We also interviewed counselors who assist  Medicare beneficiaries through the State Health Insurance Assistance  Programs (SHIPs) in California, Texas, Florida, and New York, which were  among the states with the largest number of PDP enrollees.

In  addition, we asked sponsors and other stakeholders about their  perspectives on CMS\u2019s 2008 and proposed 2009 AEP requirements, and  reviewed their formal comments submitted to CMS. To learn about CMS\u2019s  process for developing and evaluating ANOCs, we interviewed CMS  officials responsible for beneficiary materials related to the AEP. We also  reviewed previous GAO work on CMS\u2019s Part D communications and  relevant literature on principles of effective communication with Medicare  beneficiaries. To examine the effect of the AEP schedule on the  enrollment process, we obtained CMS data on PDP beneficiaries who  initiated a switch to another PDP during the 2008 AEP, including  beneficiary application dates, as reported by PDP sponsors, and the CMS  processing dates for enrollees changing plans.

The complete  processing of an enrollment application requires data exchanges among  not only CMS, sponsors, and pharmacies, but also the Social Security  Administration (SSA), state Medicaid programs for certain beneficiaries,  and various CMS contractors. The multiple data exchanges among  partners that are necessary for processing a beneficiary\u2019s change in plans  occur sequentially over a period of time.", "A previous study by GAO on Part D complaints and grievances found that  63 percent of the complaints received by CMS over an 18-month period  cited problems related to processing beneficiary enrollments and  disenrollments. We noted that CMS received numerous complaints about  late or missing membership cards, incorrect enrollments and  disenrollments, inaccurate premiums, involuntary switching, and problems  regarding cost-sharing amounts. To address concerns, CMS continually  works with its partners through work groups, task forces, and coalitions to  improve program quality and improve Part D processes.", "The changes CMS implemented for the 2008 AEP reduced the time needed  for processing enrollments by at least 14 days, compared to the previous  year. CMS achieved this reduction by requiring sponsors to:  transmit new enrollment information to CMS \u201cas early as possible\u201d or, at  most, within 7 days instead of the 14 days permitted during the 2007 AEP;   contact beneficiaries regarding missing information within 10 days of  receipt versus 21 days as previously required; and   provide beneficiaries with information on their enrollment in a new plan  from CMS\u2019s earliest notification, which is likely to be the weekly report,  rather than waiting for CMS\u2019s monthly report as previously permitted.", "In addition, CMS improved the process by requiring sponsors to assign  billing codes to new enrollments earlier in the process. Pharmacies need  these codes in order to identify and charge the appropriate plan and  collect the correct copayment amounts from beneficiaries. Previously,  sponsors assigned this information at various times and in separate  transactions that sometimes followed CMS\u2019s confirmation of a  beneficiary\u2019s Part D eligibility by as much as 14 days, delaying availability  of billing codes at the pharmacy. In contrast, for the 2008 AEP, the agency  required sponsors to submit the billing codes for each beneficiary  simultaneously with the initial enrollment transaction. Since 2006, CMS  has required sponsors to include this information on the  acknowledgement and confirmation letters sent to beneficiaries informing  them of the effective date of their new coverage. These letters could be  used by pharmacists to verify coverage prior to the beneficiaries\u2019 receipt  of their new plan membership cards. Streamlining the assignment of the  billing codes significantly decreased the time to complete enrollment  processing and increased overall program efficiency.", "Four sponsors in our study also took steps to complete AEP enrollments  and transmit the billing codes to their claims systems prior to receiving the  weekly report from CMS confirming eligibility. Two sponsors went  further to expedite enrollments by establishing processes to independently  obtain information needed to complete an application or verify enrollees\u2019  eligibility for Part D. Because these sponsors did not wait for CMS to  confirm eligibility via their weekly or monthly reports, they were able to  provide pharmacies with information regarding a beneficiary\u2019s new  coverage more quickly.", "Additional time-saving modifications to the enrollment process identified  by CMS officials and sponsors in our study included:    use of customer service representatives to complete telephone  enrollments, conduct the preliminary eligibility check required by CMS,  and ask the caller pertinent questions;   more detailed beneficiary information provided by CMS to sponsors in the    more detailed information provided to pharmacies by CMS and sponsors  during the query used to obtain billing information for beneficiaries  without membership cards or other documentation of coverage; increased staffing during December to manage the volume of late-month  enrollments; and   automation of certain tasks to reduce processing time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Not All Beneficiaries Switching Plans Were Fully Enrolled Before Their New Coverage Began", "paragraphs": ["Despite these improvements, we found that 15 percent of the  approximately 1 million beneficiaries choosing to switch plans during the  2008 AEP were at risk of not having access to their new coverage on  January 1, 2008. Reasons for these delayed enrollments included the  volume of late-December applications combined with the processing time  required to fully enroll a beneficiary in a new plan, and the AEP schedule  that accepts enrollments through December 31 with coverage effective the  next day. To prevent problems in January resulting from these delays, in  2007 CMS sponsored a media campaign and distributed guidance to its  partners to encourage beneficiaries to submit their 2008 AEP applications  by December 7, 2007. Despite this effort, CMS weekly report data revealed  that 50 percent of the applications to change PDPs were received after  December 10. Furthermore, sponsors received 5 percent of enrollment  applications for beneficiaries during the last 2 days of the AEP. Figure 2  shows the distribution of enrollment applications received during the 2008  AEP.", "CMS data also show that the time needed to fully process an enrollment  application varied over the course of the AEP. Overall, the median  processing time was 5 days. However, in week 1 of the AEP the median  processing time was 20 days and in week 5 the median was 3 days.", "Of the applications received after December 15\u2014which accounted for  nearly one third of all 2008 AEP applications\u201440 percent were not  processed until after January 1. On average, applications received in late  December took 3 days longer to process than applications received earlier  in the month. Not until January 11\u20142 weeks into the new coverage year,  did CMS and its partners complete the processing of 97 percent of the  applications of beneficiaries choosing to switch PDPs during the 2008  AEP. Figure 3 shows when enrollment processing for the 2008 AEP was  completed.", "The capacity to process late December enrollments also varied across  sponsors. We found that larger sponsors were quicker in processing  enrollments received after December 15. Thus, sponsors with more than   3 million PDP beneficiaries were able to process 81 percent of late  December applications prior to the effective date of new coverage. In  contrast, sponsors with less than 100,000 PDP enrollees were able to  process 48 percent of applications before the new year. Regardless of  sponsor size, the AEP schedule provided insufficient time in which to fully  process all enrollment applications.", "The inability of CMS and sponsors to complete all the steps in the  enrollment process prior to the effective date of new coverage for  beneficiaries choosing to switch plans created a number of challenges.  One consequence is the heightened risk of inaccurate charges or payment  amounts for beneficiaries, pharmacies, and sponsors. Following the 2008  AEP, beneficiary advocates, SHIPS, and pharmacists reported that some  individuals were charged the wrong copayment or deductible, especially  those who had applied for a low-income subsidy\u2014which must be  authorized by SSA\u2014to reduce their cost-sharing levels. Two pharmacy  associations reported that if new coverage could not be verified, their  members risked filling a prescription for which they would not get  reimbursed or the beneficiary would need to pay for a temporary supply of  the medication while coverage issues were resolved. Pharmacy  association representatives also reported delayed receipt of payment from  sponsors related to prescriptions filled when a beneficiary\u2019s enrollment  status changed. In addition, stakeholders told us about significant payment  inaccuracies that took time to resolve.", "Additional administrative burden was another consequence of the  incomplete processing of all AEP enrollments prior to January 1,  according to several stakeholders we interviewed. Until beneficiaries  switching plans received documentation of their new coverage from the  sponsor on a membership card or letter, pharmacies had to use alternative  means to locate the updated enrollment and billing information in order to  fill a prescription and submit a claim correctly. CMS guidance requires  pharmacists to complete electronic inquiries and, if necessary, phone calls  to try to identify the beneficiary\u2019s correct enrollment status and billing  codes if that information is not in the claims system. Pharmacy  associations reported that this procedure was overly complex and  required extensive staff time. Sponsors and pharmacy associations said  that claims filed under a beneficiary\u2019s old plan had to be reversed  retroactively and charged to the correct plan, requiring additional time and  resources. Stakeholders we interviewed noted that beneficiaries lack a  single point of contact to resolve enrollment issues promptly and might  need to follow up with multiple sources including their plan, CMS, SSA,  and the prescribing physician."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Favor Changes to the AEP Schedule to Better Manage Plan Switching", "paragraphs": ["CMS, sponsors, pharmacy associations, SHIPS, and beneficiary advocates  recognize that the current AEP schedule\u2014November 15 through  December 31\u2014is problematic. Some stakeholders we interviewed in our  study said that creating an interval for enrollment processing between the  end of the AEP and the effective date of coverage would help ensure that  coverage for a beneficiary switching plans would be in place on January 1.  Additional time for enrollment processing would also help beneficiaries  receive their new membership information prior to the effective date of  coverage. In addition, we recently reported that such an interval may  address some challenges that result from premium withholdings from  Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 Social Security checks. Requiring a \u201cquiet period\u201d  is standard practice in private health insurance and other federal health  programs, allowing sponsors time to process applications and provide  enrollees appropriate information about their new coverage prior to its  effective date. For example, in Medicare Part B, open enrollment is  followed by a 3-month processing interval that extends from March 31 to  July 1. Similarly, in the FEHBP, enrollment is followed by approximately a  3-week processing interval that extends from the second Monday in  December to January 1.", "More than half the sponsors interviewed supported the creation of an  enrollment processing interval. CMS officials and two sponsors  recommended ending enrollment in mid December, while two other  sponsors suggested ending the AEP on November 30. Stakeholders also  noted that some of the difficulties associated with an AEP schedule that  includes the end-of-the-year holidays could be avoided with an earlier end  date.", "Several sponsors recommended an earlier start date to address concerns  they have regarding CMS\u2019s guidance prohibiting sponsors from processing  applications submitted between the receipt of the ANOC (October 31) and  the beginning of the AEP (November 15). Although CMS officials told us  they expected beneficiaries to use this time to become informed about  their choices, sponsors reported that this waiting period was inconvenient  for those beneficiaries who were prepared to make an enrollment change.  Similarly, SHIP counselors pointed out that they too must wait until  November 15 to forward beneficiaries\u2019 completed applications. SHIP  counselors in one state reported that the need to double check enrollment  applications completed prior to November 15 limited the number of Part D  beneficiaries they were able to assist during the AEP.

From a program  perspective, beneficiaries must be sufficiently aware of plan changes in  order to fully use their ability to switch plans to foster the competition that  Congress intended in designing the Part D program. To this end, CMS  designed a model ANOC to provide a consistent format for the information  sent to beneficiaries about upcoming plan changes. Sponsors as well as  advocates have voiced concerns that the model lacked the attributes\u2014 particularly simplicity and personalization\u2014that researchers say are  needed for beneficiaries to understand and act on the information  provided. Although CMS told us that they recently initiated an evaluation  of its annual notification materials, it is unclear whether alternative  formats for the ANOC-EOC will be considered. Based on our findings as  well as research on the need to make information relevant to the reader,  CMS\u2019s evaluation should consider alternative models that incorporate a  beneficiary\u2019s personal drug information. Such an alternative may be more  effective in highlighting key changes in drug costs and coverage for plan  enrollees. Two sponsors in our study supplemented the 2008 ANOC by  mailing additional information on specific drug coverage and cost changes  to nearly 3.6 million enrollees, thus demonstrating the feasibility of  providing such personalized information to their members.", "Although CMS and sponsors implemented improvements to better manage  the 2008 AEP enrollment process, their efforts are hampered by a schedule  that lacks a sufficient interval in which to complete processing beneficiary  enrollment changes prior to the effective date of new coverage. Under the  current mandated schedule, it is not possible to guarantee that  beneficiaries choosing to switch plans late in December are fully enrolled  in their new plans with pharmacists having sufficient evidence of the new  coverage by January 1. In addition, sponsors and pharmacies reported  excessive administrative complexity and diminished program efficiency as  a result of the nearly 15 percent of enrollments still in process in January.  Stakeholders agree that modifying the schedule and creating an interval  between the end of the AEP and the effective date of coverage would  minimize these challenges as well as mitigate issues related to low-income  subsidies and premium withholding from beneficiaries\u2019 Social Security  checks.

The  agency noted that its process for developing the model ANOC and the  EOC included a review of other programs\u2019 model materials such as those  used in the FEHBP, as well as restructuring the model to eliminate  duplication and increase readability. CMS pointed out that, in preparation  for the 2010 AEP, it has engaged a contractor to evaluate and improve the  required notification materials sent to beneficiaries.

While CMS\u2019s effort to evaluate the ANOC-EOC is an  important, worthwhile step, such a review would benefit by a focus on  streamlining as opposed to maximizing the amount of information that  beneficiaries receive. Beyond the current evaluation, CMS should continue  its efforts to improve the understandability of its AEP materials by testing  more concise formats with beneficiaries.
