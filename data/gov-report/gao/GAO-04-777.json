Since 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued various components of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA), which is intended to be, among other things, a framework for informing the content of agencies' enterprise architectures.

However, it is missing, either in part or in total, all of the key elements expected to be found in a well-defined architecture, such as descriptions of business processes, information flows among these processes, and security rules associated with these information flows, to name just a few. Moreover, the key elements that are at least partially present in the initial version were not derived in a manner consistent with best practices for architecture development. Instead, they are based on assumptions about a DHS or national corporate business strategy and, according to DHS, are largely the products of combining the existing architectures of several of the department's predecessor agencies, along with their respective portfolios of system investment projects. DHS officials agreed that their initial version is lacking key elements, and they stated that this version represents what could be done in the absence of a strategic plan, with limited resources, and in the 4 months that were available to meet an OMB deadline for submitting the department's fiscal year 2004 information technology budget request. In addition, they stated that the next version of the architecture, which is to be issued in September 2004, would have much more content. As a result, DHS does not yet have the necessary architectural blueprint to effectively guide and constrain its ongoing business transformation efforts and the hundreds of millions of dollars that it is investing in supporting information technology assets. Without this, DHS runs the risk that its efforts and investments will not be well integrated, will be duplicative, will be unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface, and will not optimize overall mission performance. The department's initial enterprise architecture can be traced semantically with the FEA, which means that similar terms and/or definitions of terms can be found in the respective architectures. However, traceability in terms of architecture structures and functions is not apparent. Because of this, it is not clear whether the substance and intent of the respective architectures are in fact aligned, meaning that, if both were implemented, they would produce similar outcomes. This is due at least in part to the fact that OMB has yet to clearly define what it expects the relationship between agencies' enterprise architectures and the FEA to be, including what it means by architectural alignment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following September 11, 2001, homeland security emerged as a more  prominent federal mission.

In January 2003, we cited numerous management and leadership  challenges facing DHS as it attempted to merge 22 separate federal  agencies, and we designated the department\u2019s transformation as high risk.  Shortly thereafter, the department stated that it faced significant  transformational challenges, such as (1) developing new business  processes, (2) unifying multiple organizational structures, (3) integrating  multiple border-security and interior-enforcement functions, (4) integrating  information technology (application systems and infrastructures), and  (5) improving information sharing. The magnitude of these challenges is  enormous. For example, DHS reports that it has redundancies in such  business processes as human resources management, financial  management, and procurement\u2014including about 300 application systems  that support inconsistent and duplicative processes.

Congress, OMB, and the federal CIO Council  have also recognized the importance of an architecture-centric approach to  modernization.

An enterprise architecture provides a clear and  comprehensive picture of an entity, whether it is an organization (e.g.,  federal department) or a functional or mission area that cuts across more  than one organization (e.g., homeland security). This picture consists of  snapshots of both the enterprise\u2019s current or \u201cAs Is\u201d operational and  technological environment and its target or \u201cTo Be\u201d environment, as well as  a capital investment road map for transitioning from the current to the  target environment.

Since the 1980s, various frameworks have emerged and been  applied. For example, John Zachman developed a structure or framework  for defining and capturing an architecture. This framework provides for  six windows from which to view the enterprise, which Zachman calls  \u201cperspectives\u201d on how a given entity operates: the perspectives of (1) the  strategic planner, (2) the system user, (3) the system designer, (4) the  system developer, (5) the subcontractor, and (6) the system itself. Zachman  also proposed six abstractions or models that are associated with each of  these perspectives: these models cover (1) how the entity operates,  (2) what the entity uses to operate, (3) where the entity operates, (4) who  operates the entity, (5) when entity operations occur, and (6) why the entity  operates.", "Other frameworks also exist.

The frameworks also provide for defining  these perspectives for both the enterprise\u2019s current or \u201cAs Is\u201d environment  and its target or \u201cTo Be\u201d environment, as well as a transition plan for  moving from the \u201cAs Is\u201d to the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment.", "Our research and experience show that for major program investments,  such as the development of an enterprise architecture, successful  organizations approach product development in an incremental fashion,  meaning that they initially develop a foundational product that is expanded  and extended through a series of follow-on products that add more  capability and value. In doing so, these organizations can effectively  mitigate the enormous risk associated with trying to deliver a large and  complex product that requires the execution of many activities over an  extended period of time as a single monolithic product. In effect, this  incremental approach permits a large undertaking to be broken into a  series of smaller projects, or incremental versions, that can be better  controlled to provide reasonable assurance that expectations are met.", "The importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining an  enterprise architecture is a basic tenet of both organizational  transformation and IT management. Managed properly, an enterprise  architecture can clarify and help to optimize the interdependencies and  relationships among an organization\u2019s business operations and the  underlying IT infrastructure and applications that support these  operations. Employed in concert with other important management  controls\u2014such as portfolio-based capital planning and investment control  practices\u2014architectures can greatly increase the chances that an  organization\u2019s operational and IT environments will be configured to  optimize mission performance.

In  November 2003, we reported on DHS\u2019s progress in establishing key  enterprise architecture management capabilities, as described in our  architecture management maturity framework. This framework  associates specific architecture management capabilities with five  hierarchical stages of management maturity, starting with creating  architecture awareness and followed by building the architecture  management foundation, developing the architecture, completing the  architecture, culminating in leveraging the architecture to manage change  (see table 3 for a more detailed description of the stages).", "Based on information provided by DHS, we reported that the department  had established an architecture management foundation and was  developing architecture products, and we rated the department to be at  stage 3 of our maturity framework. In particular, we reported that it had  (1) established a program office responsible for developing and  maintaining the architecture; (2) assigned a chief architect to oversee the  program; (3) established plans for developing metrics for measuring  progress, quality, compliance, and return on investment; and (4) placed the  architecture products under configuration management. According to our  framework, effective architecture management is generally not achieved  until an enterprise has a completed and approved architecture that is being  effectively maintained and is being used to leverage organizational change  and support investment decision making.

However, we also  recognized that development and use of the FEA is but the first step in a  multistep process to realize the promise of interagency solutions. In  addition, because the FEA is still maturing both in content and in use, we  raised a number of questions that we believed OMB needed to address in  order to maximize understanding about the tool and thus facilitate its  advancement. Specifically, we asked the following:  Should the FEA be described as an enterprise architecture? As we  discussed earlier, a true enterprise architecture is intended to provide a  blueprint for optimizing an organization\u2019s business operations and  implementing the IT that supports them. Accordingly, well-defined  enterprise architectures describe, in meaningful models, both the  enterprise\u2019s \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d environments, along with the plan for  transitioning from the current to the target environment. To be  meaningful, these models should be inherently consistent with one  another, in view of the many interrelationships and interdependencies  among, for example, business functions, the information flows among  the functions, the security needs of this information, and the services  and applications that support these functions.", "Our reading of the four available reference models does not  demonstrate to us that this kind of content exists in the FEA and thus  we believe that it is more akin to a point-in-time framework or  classification scheme for federal government operations. Accordingly,  if agencies use the FEA as a model for defining the depth and detail for  their own architectures, the agencies\u2019 enterprise architectures may not  provide sufficient content for driving the implementation of their  systems.", "Is the expected relationship between agencies\u2019 enterprise architectures  and the FEA clearly articulated? Among other things, the FEA is to  inform agencies\u2019 enterprise architectures. For example, OMB has stated  that although it is not mandating that the business reference model  serve as the foundation for every agency\u2019s business architecture,  agencies should invest time mapping their respective business  architectures to the FEA. Similarly, OMB has stated that agencies\u2019  alignment of their respective architectures to the services component  reference model and the technical reference model will enable each  agency to categorize its IT investments according to common  definitions.", "In our view, such descriptions of the agency enterprise  architecture/FEA relationship are not clear, in part because definitions  of such key terms as alignment, mapping, and consistency are not  apparent in the FEA. As with any endeavor, the more ambiguity and  uncertainty there is in requirements and expectations, the greater the  use of assumptions; the more assumptions that are made, the higher the  risk of deviation from the intended course of action. This is particularly  true in the area of enterprise architecture.", "How will the security aspects of the FEA be addressed? Our work has  found that a well-defined enterprise architecture should include explicit  discussion of security, including descriptions of security policies,  procedures, rules, standards, services, and tools. Moreover, security is  an element of the very fabric of architecture artifacts and models and  thus should be woven into them all. As our experience in reviewing  agency security practices and our research into leading practices shows,  security cannot be an afterthought when it comes to engineering  systems or enterprises.", "OMB has stated that it plans to address security through what it refers  to as a \u201csecurity profile\u201d to be added to the FEA.

More specifically, we found that DHS\u2019s  \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture products (Version 1.0) do not satisfy 14 of 34 (41  percent) key elements and only partially satisfy the remaining 20 (59  percent), and that its transition plan only partially satisfies 3 of 5 elements  (60 percent) and does not satisfy the remaining 2 (40 percent) (see fig. 2.).  This means that while Version 1.0 does provide some of the foundational  content that can be used to extend and expand the architecture, it does not  yet provide an adequately defined frame of reference to effectively inform  business transformation and system acquisition and implementation  decision making. Our specific analysis of the \u201cTo Be\u201d and transition plan  products follows. \u201cTo Be\u201d Architecture: According to relevant guidance, a \u201cTo Be\u201d  architecture should capture the vision of future business operations and  supporting technology. That is, it should describe the desired capabilities,  structures (e.g., entities, activities, and roles), and relationships among  these structures at a specified time frame in the future. It should also  describe, for example, future business processes, information needs, and  supporting infrastructure characteristics, and it should be fiscally and  technologically achievable. More specifically, a well-defined \u201cTo Be\u201d  architecture should provide, among other things, a description of  the enterprise\u2019s business strategy, including its desired future concept of  operations, its strategic goals and objectives, and the strategic direction  to be followed to achieve the desired future state;  future business processes, functions, and activities that will be  performed to support the organization\u2019s mission, including the entities  that will perform them and the locations where they will be performed;  a logical database model that identifies the primary data categories and  their relationships, which are needed to support business processes and  to guide the creation of the physical databases where information will  be stored;  the systems to be acquired or developed and their relative importance in  supporting the business operations;  the enterprise application systems and system components and their   the policies, procedures, processes, and tools for selecting, controlling,  and evaluating application systems;  the technical standards to be implemented and their anticipated life   the physical infrastructure (e.g., hardware and software) that will be  needed to support the business systems;  common policies and procedures for developing infrastructure systems  throughout their life cycles;  security and information assurance-related terms;  the organizations that will be accountable for implementing security and  the tools to be used to secure and protect systems and data;  a list of the protection mechanisms (e.g., firewalls and intrusion  detection software) that will be implemented to secure the department\u2019s  assets; and  the metrics that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of mission  operations and supporting system performance in achieving mission  goals and objectives.", "Architectures that include these elements can provide the necessary frame  of reference to enable the engineering of business solutions (processes and  systems) in a manner that optimally supports departmentwide goals and  objectives, such as information sharing.", "Version 1.0 of the department\u2019s \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture provides some of the  descriptive content mentioned above. For example, it contains (1) a high- level business strategy that includes a vision statement and a list of projects  that may become future technology solutions; (2) a list of systems to be  acquired or developed; (3) a description of the enterprise application  systems and system components; (4) the technical standards to be  implemented; (5) a description of the physical infrastructure (e.g.,  hardware and software) that will be needed to support the business  systems; (6) definitions of security and information assurance-related  terms; (7) a list of protection mechanisms, such as firewalls; and (8) high- level performance metrics.", "However, the business strategy does not define the desired future concept  of operations, the business-specific objectives to be achieved, and the  strategic direction to be followed. Such content is important because the  \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture must be based on and driven by business needs. In  contrast to this, the DHS \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture is primarily focused on how  to employ technology to improve current mission operations and services,  instead of on identifying and addressing needed business changes through  the use of technology. In addition, the systems listed are not described in  terms of their relative importance to achieving the department\u2019s vision  based on business value and technical performance, and the application  systems and system components are not linked to the specific business  processes they will support. Further, the technical standards are  incomplete (e.g., do not specify standards that support narrowband  wireless access) and do not include the anticipated life cycle of each  standard. The physical infrastructure description is too high level (e.g., it  does not define networks and their configurations or relate the technology  platforms to specific applications and business functions). The  architecture also does not define certain security and information  assurance-related terms (e.g., security services) and, in some instances, it  defines other terms (e.g., authentication and availability) differently than  do the department\u2019s homeland security partners. For example, DHS\u2019s  definitions of authentication, availability, confidentiality, and integrity  differ from DOD\u2019s definitions of these terms. In addition, the list of  protection mechanisms is neither complete, nor does it describe all of the  mechanisms shown and the interrelationships among them.", "Other key elements that are not included are (1) a description of future  business processes, functions, and activities that will be performed to  support the organization\u2019s mission, including the entities or people that will  perform them and the locations where they will be performed; (2) a logical  database model; (3) the policies, procedures, processes, and tools for  selecting, controlling, and evaluating application systems; (4) common  policies and procedures for developing infrastructure systems throughout  their life cycles; (5) the organizations that will be accountable for  implementing security and the tools to be used to secure and protect  systems and data; and (6) explicit metrics for the department\u2019s primary  (e.g., identifying threats and vulnerabilities and facilitating the flow of  people and goods) and mission-support (e.g., human resources and budget  and finance) business areas. Detailed results of our analysis are provided in  appendix II.", "Transition Plan: According to relevant guidance and best practices, the  transition plan should provide a temporal road map for moving from the  \u201cAs Is\u201d to the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment. An important step in the development  of a well-defined transition plan is a gap analysis\u2014a comparison of the \u201cAs  Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d architectures to identify differences. Other important steps  include analyses of technology opportunities and marketplace trends, as  well as assessments of fiscal and budgetary realities and institutional  acquisition and development capabilities. Using such analyses and  assessments, options are explored and decisions are made regarding which  legacy systems to retain, modify, or retire and which new systems to  introduce on a tactical (temporary) basis or to pursue as strategic  solutions. Accordingly, transition plans identify legacy, migration, and new  systems and sequence them to show, for example, the phasing out and  termination of systems and capabilities and the timing of the introduction  of new systems and capabilities, and they do so in light of resource  constraints such as budget, people, acquisition/development process  maturity, and associated time frames.", "Version 1.0 of DHS\u2019s transition plan generally does not possess any of these  attributes. Specifically, it does not (1) include a gap analysis identifying the  needed changes to current business processes and systems; (2) identify the  legacy systems that will not become part of the \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture or the  time frames for phasing them out; (3) show a time-based strategy for  replacing legacy systems, including identifying intermediate (i.e.,  migration) systems that may be temporarily needed; or (4) define the  resources (e.g., funding and staff) needed to transition to the target  environment. The result is that DHS does not have a meaningful and  reliable basis for managing the disposition of its legacy systems or for  sequencing the introduction of modernized business operations and  supporting systems. Detailed results of our analysis are in appendix III.", "A DHS contractor responsible for evaluating the quality of Version 1.0  reported weaknesses that are similar to ones that we identified. For  example, the contractor reported the following:  The \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture did not address the reality that the  department\u2019s systems would be a federated combination of legacy and  new systems for many years. Rather, it assumes that its systems will be  transformed into an ideal future state in the near term.", "The \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture did not consistently address topics at the same  level of detail, and it contained inconsistencies (i.e., some topics were  addressed in more detail than others).", "The architecture did not sufficiently address security (i.e., network,  data, physical, and information).", "DHS\u2019s senior enterprise architecture officials, including the chief architect,  agreed with the results of our analysis and stated that considerable work  remained to adequately address all of the key architectural elements.  According to the CIO and these officials, this initial version was prepared in  4 months, with limited resources (i.e., three DHS staff and minimal  contractor support), based on the information available at that time.  Further, it was prepared primarily to meet OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2004 IT budget  submission deadline and to help educate DHS\u2019s senior executives about the  importance of this architecture in the department\u2019s overall transformation  effort. Senior architecture officials also stated that a transition plan was  not intended to be part of the scope of Version 1.0, and that the  department\u2019s initial focus was on maturing its ability to execute an  approach and methodology for developing the next version of the  architecture.", "Notwithstanding these reasons, constraints, and intentions, the fact  remains that Version 1.0 is missing important content and, without this  content, the department\u2014as well as homeland security stakeholders in  other federal agencies, state and local governments, and the private  sector\u2014will not have the sufficiently detailed, authoritative frame of  reference that is needed to provide a common understanding of future  homeland security operational, business, and supporting technology needs.  Such a frame of reference is important to effectively guide and constrain  the transformation of mission operations, business functions, and  associated IT investments. Without it, DHS and other homeland security  stakeholders will be challenged in their ability to effectively leverage  technology to affect the kind of logical and systematic institutional change  needed to optimize enterprisewide mission performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Content of Initial Architecture Is Based on Strategic Business Assumptions and Existing Agencies\u2019 Architectures Rather Than Departmental Strategic Vision", "paragraphs": ["The various architecture frameworks and architecture management best  practices recognize the need to define the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment using a top- down, business-driven approach in which the content of the organization\u2019s  strategic plan (mission, goals, objectives, scope, and outcomes) drives  operational processes, functions, activities, and associated information  needs, which in turn drive system application and services and supporting  technology standards. The architecture development methodology being  employed by DHS also calls for this top-down, mission- and business- driven approach, which engages mission and business area subject matter  experts. It specifically states that an architecture should be based on a  functional business model that reflects the nature of the operational  mission, the business strategy, and the information to be used to  accomplish them.", "DHS did not follow this approach in developing Version 1.0 of its  architecture, primarily because the department did not issue a strategic  plan until February 2004. Specifically, the department released its initial  architecture in September 2003, approximately 5 months before it issued  its strategic plan. Without an explicit strategic direction to inform the  architecture, the architecture\u2019s business representation was derived from  the existing architectures and the ongoing and planned IT investments of  some of its component agencies (i.e., Immigration and Naturalization  Service, Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, and the Federal  Emergency Management Agency). As a result, Version 1.0 did not contain a  departmentwide and national corporate business strategy that described  such things as (1) the desired future state of its mission operations and  business activities, (2) the specific goals and objectives to be strategically  achieved, and (3) the strategic direction to be followed by the department  to realize the desired future state. Rather, the architecture\u2019s strategic  operational and business content is basically the sum of its component  agencies\u2019 business strategy parts. Moreover, although the department is  using generally accepted architecture development techniques, the  architecture artifacts that have been derived using these techniques (i.e.,  the value chain analysis, CURE matrix, conceptual data model, and  sequencing diagram) do not provide a consistent view of the scope of the  department\u2019s mission. In some instances, the vision focuses internally on  departmental activities only, while in other instances, it focuses on  homeland security at a national level (i.e., addresses other homeland  security stakeholders, such as other federal agencies and state and local  government). The architecture\u2019s business strategy also does not identify  corporate priorities and constraints to be considered when making  departmentwide and national decisions about future homeland security  activities. The DHS contractor responsible for evaluating the quality of  Version 1.0 made similar comments concerning the architecture\u2019s business  strategy. Specifically, the contractor reported that the scope of the  architecture was unclear, at times being internally focused on only the  department, while at other times being more broadly focused on national  homeland security. Further, the contractor reported that the business  strategy did not include all DHS mission activities.", "According to the chief architect, the fiscal year 2004 IT budget submission  deadline did not allow the department to delay development of the  architecture until the strategic plan had been completed. A senior  architecture official also stated that this time constraint (i.e., 4-month  development period) did not allow subject matter experts (i.e., both  internal and external DHS stakeholders) to be consulted and to participate  in developing Version 1.0. According to the CIO, subject matter experts are  now participating in the department\u2019s architecture development activities.", "As stated above, having a mission- and business-driven enterprise  architecture is a fundamental principle. Until the department uses an  enterprisewide understanding of its mission operations and business as the  basis for developing its architecture, its architecture\u2019s utility will be greatly  diminished, and it is unlikely that changes to existing operations and  systems that are based on this architecture will provide for optimization of  mission performance and satisfaction of stakeholder needs. Moreover,  because DHS did not base Version 1.0 on such an understanding, the  content of this version may prove to be invalid if future work shows that  the strategic business assumptions used to develop it were inaccurate. This  in turn would limit the value of Version 1.0 as a basis for building the next  version."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Initial Architecture Can Be Partially Traced to the Federal Enterprise Architecture, but the Extent of Alignment Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["OMB guidance does not explicitly require agency enterprise architectures  to align with the FEA. However, a requirement for alignment is implicit in  the OMB guidance. For example, this guidance states that agencies\u2019 major  IT investments must align with each of the FEA\u2019s published reference  models (business, performance, services, and technical), and that agencies\u2019  nonmajor IT investments must align with the business reference model.  Since an agency\u2019s enterprise architecture is to include a transition plan that  strategically sequences its planned IT investments in a way that moves the  agency from its current architectural environment to its target  environment, this means that the agency\u2019s investments would need to align  with both the FEA and the agency enterprise architecture, which in turn  would necessitate alignment between the FEA and the agency architecture.  Aligning agencies\u2019 architectures with the FEA is also an implied  requirement in recently released OMB guidance for its enterprise  architecture assessment tool. According to this guidance, agency  enterprise architectures are \u201ca basic building block to support the  population of the FEA.\u201d Further, OMB states that one of the purposes of the  FEA is to inform agency efforts to develop their agency-specific enterprise  architectures.", "We have previously reported that OMB\u2019s expected relationship between the  FEA and agency enterprise architectures has not been clearly articulated,  in part because OMB has not defined key terms, such as architectural  alignment. In the absence of clear definitions, we also reported that  assumptions must be made about what alignment means, and that the  greater the use of assumptions, the greater the chances of expectations  about these relationships not being met and intended outcomes not being  realized. For the purposes of this report, we have assumed that alignment  can be examined from three perspectives: functional, structural, and  semantic. Functional alignment means that the architecture and the  reference models have been decomposed to the same level of detail to  determine if the business operations, services, and technology components  are similar in nature and purpose. Structural alignment means that the  architecture and the reference models are both constructed similarly, for  example, they may share the same hierarchical construct whereby  information is grouped by common levels of detail. Semantic alignment  means that the department\u2019s architecture and the FEA reference models  use similar terms and/or definitions that can be mapped to one another.", "The FEA and Version 1.0 of DHS\u2019s enterprise architecture are not aligned  functionally or structurally. Specifically, we could not map Version 1.0 to  the FEA from either of these perspectives because the DHS architecture is  not decomposed to the same level of detail as the reference models and  thus does not permit association of the respective functional components  and because the DHS architecture is not structured in a hierarchical  fashion as the reference models are.", "However, the terms or definitions used in the business, services, and  technical components of Version 1.0 could be mapped to similar terms in  the FEA business, services, and technical reference models. The results of  this mapping are discussed below.", "We mapped all 79 of the high-level activities that we found in the  business view of the DHS architecture to similar terms in the FEA  business reference model. To achieve this degree of mapping, however,  we needed to trace the 79 high-level activities to multiple levels of the  reference models, including business areas, lines of business, and  subfunctions. For example, for the DHS high-level business activity  \u201cstockpile and deploy supplies\u201d (defined as including managing  immunizations, as well as identification, acquisition, development,  maintenance, and distribution of other pharmaceutical and medical  supplies) we needed to go to the reference model\u2019s subfunction level to  find \u201cimmunization management.\u201d In addition, we were not able to map  any terms in the DHS architecture to several areas in the business  reference model that would appear relevant to DHS, such as the  business area \u201cmode of delivery\u201d or the line of business \u201cdefense and  national security.\u201d", "We also mapped Version 1.0\u2019s applications/services view to the FEA  services reference model. In this case, the initial architecture contained  terms that could be associated with all of the FEA reference model\u2019s 7  service domains, 29 service types, and 168 service components.", "We also mapped terms used for technical services in the Version 1.0  technical view to the FEA technical reference model. However, this  mapping was again based on associating high-level descriptions in  Version 1.0 with lower-level descriptions in the FEA. Moreover, some  terms for technology elements in Version 1.0 could not be mapped to the  FEA technical reference model, such as \u201cnarrowband wireless and  broadband wireless.\u201d Conversely, some technical services and standards  in the reference model that should be applicable to DHS were not  evident in Version 1.0, such as software engineering (including test  management services) and database middleware standards,  respectively. In those instances where we could not semantically  associate Version 1.0 to the FEA reference models, we found no  associated explanations. As a result, we could not determine whether  future alignment is envisioned or not.", "According to the CIO and the chief architect, the steps that DHS took to  align the initial architecture with the FEA reference models represent the  most that could be done in the time available. The architect also stated that  changes would be made to the technical views of the architecture to more  closely reflect the content within the FEA\u2019s technical reference model.  However, given that what is meant by agency architectural alignment to the  FEA is not well defined, the degree to which DHS and other agencies can  establish the intended relationship between the two is both challenging and  uncertain.

DHS  recognizes this and has produced an initial architecture in a short time with  limited resources and is working on its next version. Nevertheless, the  department is in the midst of transforming itself and investing hundreds of  millions of dollars in supporting systems without a well-defined  architecture to effectively guide and constrain these activities. Following  this approach is a risky proposition, and the longer DHS goes without a  well-defined and enforced architecture the greater the risk. Therefore, it is  important that DHS ensure that the next version is based on a top-down,  strategic business-based approach that involves key stakeholders, as  advocated by best practices. It is also important for DHS to ensure that its  architecture includes the necessary content. Until this is done, it will be  prudent for the department to limit new system investments to those  meeting certain criteria, as we have previously recommended. To do less  puts the department at risk of investing hundreds of millions of dollars in  efforts that will not promote integration and interoperability and will not  optimize mission performance.", "Further, the relationships that OMB expects between the FEA and agency  architectures, including DHS\u2019s are not clear.

Notwithstanding these  statements, the department also stated that it took exception to several  aspects of our report, including our criteria and recommendations. In  particular, it stated that (1) the criteria were not realistic and assumed the  existence of a comprehensive enterprise architecture, the development of  which was inconceivable in the time available, (2) the criteria had not been  provided to the federal community and were not available when Version 1.0  of DHS\u2019s architecture was being developed, and (3) the recommendations  did not take into consideration the department\u2019s limited resources. DHS  stated that it had accomplished one of the most important goals of  Version 1.0, which was \u201cpositioning the department to more actively  engage with our business representatives, with a strategic plan in hand and  a greater awareness of the need for and value of an enterprise architecture  generally on the part of our senior and executive management.\u201d DHS also  provided specific comments on our findings relative to each criterion that  we assessed Version 1.0 against. These comments fell into two general  categories: agree that content is missing but content was not intended to be  part of Version 1.0, and do not agree that content is missing (i.e., factually  incorrect).", "We do not agree with the department\u2019s comments concerning the criteria  and our recommendations. In particular, our report does not state that DHS  should have ensured that Version 1.0 of its enterprise architecture satisfied  all of the criteria that we cite. We have long held and reported the position  that enterprise architecture development should be done incrementally,  with each version of an architecture providing greater depth and detail to  an enterprisewide, business-driven foundational layer. We provide in the  report an analytical assessment of where Version 1.0 stands against a  benchmark of where it will need to be in order to be an effective blueprint  to guide and constrain major investment decisions for organizational  transformation. In doing so, we have provided the department with a road  map, grounded in explicit criteria, for incrementally developing a mission- derived blueprint.", "In addition, the criteria that we used in our review and cite in our report  came from published literature on the content of enterprise architectures,  which we structured into categories consistent with federal enterprise  architecture guidance and have used in prior evaluations of other agencies\u2019  enterprise architectures, the results of the first of which we issued in  September 2003. We shared these criteria and categories with DHS at the  time that we began our review, and we shared the results of our review  relative to each criterion with DHS enterprise architecture program and  contractor officials over a 2-day period after we completed our review. At  that time, both the DHS and the contractor officials agreed with our results.  While we acknowledge that we had yet to publish our categorization of the  criteria at the time that Version 1.0 of DHS\u2019s architecture was being  developed, the criteria that we drew from and used were both well  established and publicly available.", "In addition, we recognize in both the report and its recommendations the  point made in DHS\u2019s comments about the initial architecture development  effort being constrained by resources. It is because of this that our  recommendations call for DHS\u2019s architecture executive steering  committee, which is composed of those department business and  technology executives who collectively control billions of dollars in  resources, to develop, approve, and fund a plan for completing the  architecture.

Rather,  the purpose and scope of our work was to determine the extent to which  the initial architecture version contained the building blocks of a well- defined blueprint and to thereby identify what, if anything, remained to be  accomplished. If more needed to be done, our objective was to determine  whether the initial version provided a foundation upon which to build any  missing content. As we previously stated, development of a well-defined  enterprise architecture is by necessity incremental, and our report is  intended to provide DHS with a criteria-based road map for incrementally  accomplishing this.

Specifically, we first segmented Version 1.0 of the  architecture into the three primary component parts of any architecture:  the \u201cAs Is,\u201d the \u201cTo Be,\u201d and the transition plan. We then further divided the  \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d architectures into five architectural components similar  to the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) architecture reference  models and defined in our enterprise architecture maturity framework:  business, information/data, services/applications, technical, and  performance; we added security as a sixth component because of its  recognized importance in the various architecture frameworks and its  relevance to the other five architectural components. Because the  department is currently investing about $4.1 billion in fiscal year 2004 for IT  systems and supporting infrastructure, we focused our evaluation on the  \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture and the transition plan and did not analyze whether  DHS\u2019s \u201cAs Is\u201d architecture satisfied relevant \u201cAs Is\u201d guidance. For each of  these six architectural components, we used the key architectural  requirements that we previously reported as necessary for a well-defined  \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture. We also used the key architectural requirements that  we previously reported as necessary for a well-defined transition plan. We  then compared the \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture and transition plan (Version 1.0)  against the key elements. In doing so, we used the following criteria to  determine whether the key element was fully, partially, or not satisfied.", "To assess the extent to which the architecture was aligned with the FEA,  we compared the \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture with the FEA business, services- and  technical reference models, Versions 2.0, 1.0, and 1.1, respectively. We did  not select the performance, information/data, and security models  because department officials told us that these models were not part of the  scope of their effort in developing Version 1.0. We, therefore, focused on  the business, services, and technical models and attempted to map the  architecture and FEA reference models at three levels: semantic,  functional, and structural. However, we were unable to do so from a  functional or structural standpoint because the DHS architecture was  neither decomposed to the same level of detail, nor constructed in a  hierarchical fashion like the reference models. We therefore mapped key  elements of the DHS architecture (e.g., business activities, target  applications, and services) to the reference models by identifying similar  terms and/or definitions. To augment our documentation reviews and  analyses of the architecture, we also interviewed various officials,  including the chief information officer and chief architect to determine,  among other things, these officials\u2019 comments on our detailed analysis.", "We also met with OMB officials to discuss its process for reviewing  agencies\u2019 enterprise architectures and the results of its review of DHS\u2019s  architecture.

See the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section of this report. 2. We agree that Version 1.0 included a high-level (or overview) business  model that offered some descriptive information on weaknesses, such  as potential areas of inefficiencies or overlaps in current departmental  business functions and technology. However, the underlying business  assessment that would form the basis for a clear statement of the  enterprise\u2019s purpose, scope, limitations, assumptions, and methods for  successful business transformation was not present, and DHS provided  no evidence that such an assessment had been performed. For  example, for the areas that the business model overview identified as  potential areas of inefficiency or overlap, the architecture did not  provide the supporting analysis. The architecture also did not provide a  time frame for completing such an assessment or state that one would  be performed. Further, when we concluded our analysis and shared our  findings with senior DHS architecture officials and supporting  contractor personnel, they agreed with our finding. 3. We acknowledge the department\u2019s comment that the business strategy  and vision statement were not within the scope of the initial  architecture description. However, we note that this comment is  inconsistent with DHS\u2019s intent to describe the top two rows of the  Zachman framework, because these rows include this information.  Moreover, as stated in our report, best practices require that the  architecture be based on the business strategy and states that to do  otherwise negatively affects the architecture\u2019s utility and makes it  unlikely that changes to existing operations and systems will provide  for optimum mission performance and satisfaction of stakeholders\u2019  needs. In addition, while we do not question that the business strategy  and vision statement are included in DHS\u2019s strategic plan, we did not  evaluate this plan because it was issued 5 months after the approval of  Version 1.0. Further, when we concluded our analysis and shared our  findings with senior DHS architecture officials and supporting  contractor personnel, they agreed with our findings. 4. As stated in the report, we do not question the department\u2019s intent for  Version 1.0 of the architecture or whether these goals have been  achieved. However, our analysis shows that important architecture  artifacts that would be expected to be included in this version and that  are associated with the top two rows of the Zachman framework were  not included in the architecture description. 5. We acknowledge the department\u2019s comment that Version 1.0 of the  architecture did not contain measurable strategic business objectives  or tactical business goals, as evidenced by our finding that this  information was missing. In addition, while we do not question that this  information is included in DHS\u2019s strategic plan, we would note that we  did not evaluate this plan because it was issued 5 months after the  approval of Version 1.0. With respect to the governance strategy and  plan, the former outlined the steps to be taken to develop such a  strategy, and the latter was not contained within Version 1.0, nor was it  provided separately. Further, as previously noted, we do not question  the intent of Version 1.0. Further, when we concluded our analysis and  shared our findings with senior DHS architecture officials and  supporting contractor personnel, they agreed with our findings. 6. We disagree. While we acknowledge that there are high-level business  functions and activities in the business model, the model did not define  business processes. Business process descriptions have a definitive  beginning and end and reflect the interrelationships among business  functions and activities. The functions and activities described in  Version 1.0 had not been decomposed to a sufficient level of  operational detail to describe routine tasks (e.g., develop mitigation  strategies to minimize the impact of the threat). Further, when we  concluded our analysis and shared our findings with architecture  officials and supporting contractor personnel, they agreed with the  criteria and with our findings. 7. Version 1.0 of the architecture did not include a communications plan,  nor was such a plan provided separately. However, we do agree that  effective management reporting will depend on DHS\u2019s ability to collect  the right information for the architecture program. 8. The organizational chart referred to in this comment was not provided  to GAO. 9. We disagree. While we acknowledge that the architecture contains a  high-level or abstract conceptual data model, we found that the model  lacked the information for the business owner\u2019s view of data and for the  creation of a conceptual data model that can be used to develop the  logical database model as required by the Zachman framework, which  DHS has acknowledged that it is following to develop its architecture.  Specifically, this would require that the conceptual data model  (1) include concrete business objects, (2) enable facts about the  business to be derived, and (3) facilitate the development and  validation of business rules. Further, when we concluded our analysis  and shared our findings with senior DHS architecture officials and  supporting contractor personnel, they agreed with the criteria and our  findings. 10. The focus of our review was the content of Version 1.0 of the  architecture. We did not evaluate the \u201cOneDHS\u201d initiative as part of this  effort because it was identified in the architecture as a conceptual  project. 11. We disagree. While we acknowledge that the architecture indicated the  need to perform project-specific gap analyses, these analyses were not  included in Version 1.0, and DHS did not provide any evidence that such  analyses had been performed. In addition, the department did not  provide a time frame for completing them. Further, when we concluded  our analysis and shared our findings with senior DHS architecture  officials and supporting contractor personnel, they agreed with our  findings. 12. We disagree. While we acknowledge that conceptual projects were  linked with proposed IT investments (i.e., exhibit 300s), the  architecture did not show the correlation among the projects and the  potential investments. To show this correlation, DHS would have  needed to reflect the extent to which the identified business need\u2014 which should be based on a gap analysis\u2014would be addressed by the  proposed investment, and this explanation would be documented  within the architecture. However, the architecture did not contain this  information or a time frame for when it would be provided. The  architecture also did not include information on the approval status of  these proposed investments. Further, when we concluded our analysis  and shared our findings with senior DHS architecture officials and  supporting contractor personnel, they agreed with our findings. 13. We disagree. Version 1.0 of the DHS architecture does not provide  sufficient information to differentiate between existing and new  systems. In addition, the architecture did not include an analysis that  identified existing systems that would be terminated. Further, when we  concluded our analysis and shared our findings with senior DHS  architecture officials and supporting contractor personnel, they agreed  with our findings. 14. We disagree. The architecture does not contain detailed training  approaches, strategies, or plans. Instead, the architecture contains  high-level briefings that refer to planned activities to determine the  needs for training based on anticipated changes. These needs, once  identified, may be used to develop a business-specific plan for change  management and training. Further, when we concluded our analysis  and shared our findings with senior DHS architecture officials and  supporting contractor personnel, they agreed with our findings. 15. We disagree. While we acknowledge that the architecture listed the  names of both existing systems and several systems under  development, it did not identify which of these systems would be  developed, modified, acquired, and/or used as intermediate systems  until the target system has been deployed to meet specific future  business needs. Further, when we concluded our analysis and shared  our findings with senior DHS architecture officials and supporting  contractor personnel, they agreed with our findings. 16. We disagree. We acknowledge that the architecture included a  sequencing diagram that graphically associated the components and  the conceptual projects. However, the architecture did not provide  either an explanation of the graphically depicted relationships or an  analysis of the interdependencies. DHS also did not provide evidence  that such an analysis had been performed. Further, when we concluded  our analysis and shared our findings with senior DHS architecture  officials and supporting contractor personnel, they agreed with our  findings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Staff who made key contributions to this report were Joseph Cruz, Joanne  Fiorino, Anh Le, Randolph Tekeley, and William Wadsworth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The Government Accountability Office, the audit, evaluation and  investigative arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its  constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and  accountability of the federal government for the American people.
