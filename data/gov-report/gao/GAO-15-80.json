Subsequently, FBI contractors developed and validated several genetic tests to analyze B. anthracis samples for the presence of certain genetic mutations. The FBI had previously collected and maintained these samples in a repository.", "GAO was asked to review the FBI's genetic test development process and statistical analyses. This report addresses (1) the extent to which these genetic tests were scientifically verified and validated; (2) the characteristics of an adequate statistical approach for analyzing samples, whether the approach used was adequate, and how it could be improved for future efforts; and (3) whether any remaining scientific concerns regarding the validation of genetic tests and statistical approaches need to be addressed for future analyses. GAO reviewed agency and contractor documentation, conducted literature reviews, and conducted statistical analyses of the repository data. GAO's review focused solely on two aspects of the FBI's scientific evidence: the validation of the genetic tests and the statistical approach for the analyses of the results. GAO did not review and is not taking a position on the conclusions the FBI reached when it closed its investigation in 2010."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["After the 2001 Anthrax attacks, the genetic tests that were conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) four contractors were generally scientifically verified and validated, and met the FBI's criteria. However, GAO found that the FBI lacked a comprehensive approach\u2014or framework\u2014that could have ensured standardization of the testing process. As a result, each of the contractors developed their tests differently, and one contractor did not conduct verification testing, a key step in determining whether a test will meet a user's requirements, such as for sensitivity or accuracy. Also, GAO found that the contractors did not develop the level of statistical confidence for interpreting the testing results for the validation tests they performed. Responses to future incidents could be improved by using a standardized framework for achieving minimum performance standards during verification and validation, and by incorporating statistical analyses when interpreting validation testing results.", "GAO identified six characteristics of a statistical framework that can be applied for analyzing scientific evidence. When GAO compared the approach the FBI used to this framework, it found that that the FBI's approach could have been improved in three of six areas. First, the FBI's research did not provide a full understanding of the methods and conditions that give rise to genetic mutations used to differentiate between samples of B. anthracis . Second, the FBI did not institute rigorous controls over the sampling procedures it used to build the repository of B. anthracis samples. Third, the FBI did not include measures of uncertainty to strengthen the interpretation of the scientific evidence. GAO found that since 2001 the FBI has taken some steps to build formal forensic statistical expertise. The FBI's approach to future incidents could benefit from including such expertise early in an investigation.", "The lack of an understanding of how bacteria change (mutate) in their natural environment and in a laboratory is a key scientific gap that remains and could affect testing conducted in future incidents. Specifically, the significance of using such mutations as genetic markers for analyzing evidentiary samples to determine their origins is not clear. This gap affects both the development of genetic tests targeting such mutations and statistical analyses of the results of their use on evidentiary samples. The Department of Homeland Security is currently funding some research on genetic changes in bacteria and genome sequencing methods, among others. Such research is a step in the right direction since the FBI is planning to use genome sequencing methods in future investigations. However, because this research may not be complete for several more years, the extent to which it will close this gap is not known."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the FBI develop a framework for validation and statistical approaches for future investigations.

We reviewed the NAS  findings and conclusions and determined that, since NAS did not report in  depth how the genetic assays (or tests) used to screen the repository  were scientifically verified and validated, additional evaluation of the  requirements and procedures used for doing so could be informative in  developing scientific methods for future investigations. The NAS report  stated that, \u201cAlthough the committee lauds and supports the effort  dedicated to the development of well-validated assays and procedures,  looking toward the future, these processes need to be more efficient.\u201d  Further, the NAS report included several findings related to the statistical  analyses of the repository data and identified challenges concerning the  identification and collection of the repository samples. Therefore, a review  of the comprehensive statistical approach could help further clarify and  expand on the impact of the NAS conclusions and provide useful insight  for applying statistical approaches to future investigations. Consequently,  this report addresses the following three questions:  1.  To what extent were the genetic assays used to screen the FBI  repository of Ames samples scientifically verified and validated?2.  What are the characteristics of an adequate statistical approach for  analyzing the repository samples and to what extent was the  statistical approach used adequate? If not adequate, how could this  approach be improved for future efforts?  3.

We also reviewed  scientific literature and agency and industry guidelines to determine the  essential phases in approaches to developing genetic tests. We reviewed  existing FBI standards and guidelines for verifying and validating  microbial forensics methods. To determine the extent to which the genetic  tests were verified and validated, we reviewed the results of the  contractors\u2019 validation tests, the FBI\u2019s requirements for the validation, and  the contractors\u2019 approaches for developing their genetic tests against an  approach, or framework, for validation, encompassing the essential  phases that we identified.

According to the FBI, the evidence supports the  conclusion that the mail attacks occurred on two separate occasions. The  two letters of the first attack were postmarked September 18, 2001, and  sent to NBC News and the New York Post, both in New York City. Three  weeks later, two letters postmarked October 9, 2001, were mailed to two  senators\u2014Thomas Daschle and Patrick Leahy\u2014at their Washington,  D.C., offices. Other letters were sent to ABC, CBS, and American Media,  Inc. Hard evidence of the attacks surfaced on October 3, 2001, when  Robert Stevens, an American Media Inc. employee who worked in Boca  Raton, Florida, was diagnosed as having contracted inhalational anthrax,  from which he later died. However, because a contaminated envelope or  package was not recovered in Florida, the agencies could not initially  establish how the B. anthracis spores were delivered. According to the  Postal Service, the combination of the Florida incident and the opening of  the letter to Senator Tom Daschle on October 15 established the link to  the U.S. mail system. At least 22 victims contracted anthrax as a result of  the mailings. Eleven individuals developed inhalational anthrax, and  another 11 developed cutaneous infections. Five of the inhalational  anthrax victims died from their infections.", "The attack highlighted the need for enhanced capabilities for full forensic  exploitation and interpretation of microbial evidence from acts of  bioterrorism. Ideally, forensic evidence obtained in an investigation is  sufficient to support conclusions about the culpability of a group, an  individual, or the source of material used in such an act. Forensic  evidence is used to support conclusions by classifying evidence into one  of several categories that distinguish possible sources from one another.  While classification does not unequivocally demonstrate a connection  with an individual or a single source, it can be used to reduce the number  of possible sources and thus can provide important leads in an  investigation.", "The development and application of microbial forensics was essential to  the FBI\u2019s scientific investigation, which relied heavily on genetics and  comparative genomics to classify the spore materials used in the attack,  reduce the number of possible sources and suspects, and provide  investigative leads. In fact, according to the NAS, this investigation  accelerated the development of the then nascent field of microbial  forensics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The FBI\u2019s Genetic Analyses of the Attack Spores", "paragraphs": ["The FBI\u2019s investigation, assisted by government, university, and  commercial laboratories, was an effort to develop the physical, chemical,  genetic, and forensic profiles of the anthrax spores in the letters and  envelopes used in the attacks. The investigation employed myriad  traditional and novel investigative and scientific methods. The scientific  methods involved efforts to develop the physical, chemical, genetic, and  forensic profiles of the anthrax spores and letters and envelopes used in  the attacks so as to identify the source of the spores. The FBI faced many  difficult and complex scientific challenges over the course of this  investigation, according to the NAS. New microbial forensic methods  were developed and implemented over several years, and some of them  provided valuable evidence and significant leads in the case. For  example, according to the FBI, new methods to determine the source of  the growth media for the mailed spores were inconclusive while the use of  the genetic mutations provided an investigative lead.", "By October 2001, CDC had identified the microorganism used in the  attack as Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis). This was a key step in the  classification of the microorganism used in the attack letters and was one  of the first scientific findings that allowed the FBI to begin to reduce the  number of possible sources of the spores. B. anthracis is a gram positive,  rod-shaped bacterium that causes the disease anthrax. It is a member of  the larger genus Bacillus that includes other commonly found species,  such as B. cereus, B. subtilis, and B. thuringiensis. B. anthracis, a  species of Bacillus that can be found on all continents except Antarctica,  typically shows little genetic variation among isolates. However, during  the investigation scientific methods were being developed that allowed  scientists to find some genetic differences among natural isolates of B.  anthracis.  Applying these methods allowed the FBI to refine the  classification of the spores used in the attack and further reduce the  number of possible sources of the spores.", "Even in the most homogeneous species, some differences are usual in genome  sequences among populations. Although few in number, these differences are sufficient to  characterize subgroups, or \u201cstrains.\u201d in the attack letters. In fact, this scientific evidence allowed the FBI to  focus its investigation on the limited number of laboratories that had had  access to the Ames strain before the attacks (see figure 1).", "While classifying the spore material as the Ames strain was instrumental  in reducing the number of possible sources, it was not sufficient by itself  to definitively identify the source of the material used in the attack as a  single laboratory, flask, or person. The FBI then sought to identify  additional characteristics of the spores used in the attack that could  further discriminate between possible sources of the Ames strain.", "Scientists from the Department of Defense (DOD) tested samples of the  spore materials found in the letters and identified several morphological  variants (or morphs).the spores from the letters over an extended period observed that a small  percentage of the colonies differed in texture, color, and growth patterns   A laboratory technician who had grown (cultured)  from those typical for the Ames strain of B. anthracis, referred to in figure  2 as the \u201cwild type.\u201d", "In an effort to identify the source of the letters, investigators and FBI  scientists began to evaluate whether they could first identify and  characterize these morphs genetically and then determine whether any of  them were present in the repository of Ames samples. This involved  genome sequencing to identify whether specific deoxyribonucleic acid  (DNA) sequences underlay the morphs. Eventually, as shown in figure 2,  the morphs were associated with several types of genetic mutations:  duplications, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), and deletions,  referred to as INDELS.", "Afterward, over several years, outside contractors\u2019 laboratories developed  and validated several genetic tests to analyze the B. anthracis samples  for the presence of certain genetic mutations.

A grand jury issued subpoenas to 16 domestic laboratories  and the FBI requested submissions from 3 foreign laboratories that  investigators had determined possessed the Ames strain. The subpoenas  required each laboratory to identify and submit two representative  samples from each distinct stock of the Ames strain it held. The  subpoena included instructions to the laboratories on how to identify,  select, and submit samples to the FBI. Laboratories were required to ship  sample submissions to DOD scientists at USAMRIID for preparation and  entry into the FBI repository of Ames samples.", "In addition to the samples submitted in response to the subpoena,  searches were conducted at three domestic laboratories to ensure that  samples were taken from each stock of Ames strain in those facilities.

According to the FBI, this information constituted a groundbreaking lead  in the development in the investigation. It allowed the investigators to  reduce drastically the number of possible suspects, because only very  few individuals had ever had access to this specific flask. Armed with this  new information obtained from the scientific evidence, the task force  focused its investigation on researchers who had had access to the  laboratory at USAMRIID where RMR-1029 was stored. In 2008, the FBI  sought to conduct statistical analyses in order to determine (1) the  probative value of genetic markers found in a sample, and (2) possible  inferences regarding the relationships of similar samples. A contractor  submitted the Final Statistical Analyses Report in October 2008.", "In February 2010, the FBI closed the case concluding that a scientist at  USAMRIID had perpetrated the attack alone. Neither the case nor the  totality of the evidence, including the scientific evidence that provided the  FBI with valuable leads, was brought to trial in a court of law.

CBI\u2019s  qualification study involved multiple experiments using internally blinded  samples following an SOP to determine whether (1) the A1 and A3  genetic tests could correctly identify the targeted genetic mutations and  (2) the staff involved could be considered qualified to perform the genetic  tests. The first appeared to be equivalent to verification testing and the  second to proficiency testing. Similarly, both MRI and ITRI conducted  internal verification testing and followed it with a qualification test of  laboratory personnel. While the distinction between, interpretation of, and  expectations for the verification and any qualification testing were not  always explicit in the documentation we were provided, we found that  they were both intended to precede the validation testing. However,  TIGR\u2014the last contractor to develop its genetic test\u2014did not conduct the  equivalent of either a verification or a qualification study.", "The FBI indicated that it believed that the contractors had conducted  verification testing but acknowledged that it was possible that one had not  been conducted for the last genetic test that was developed.

Each contractor independently developed interpretation  criteria for positive, negative and inconclusive results through laboratory  experimentation, which when defined became part of its SOP. Initially, for  the A1 and A3 tests interpretation criteria were for a positive or negative  result only.

As shown in table 2, the A3 genetic test had the lowest LOD, at  0.001 percent, while the others ranged from 0.005 percent to 0.01  percent. The validation results led the FBI to determine that there were  no false positives for any of the genetic tests, and that the inconclusive  rates were 0.12 percent and 0.02 percent for the D-1 and D-2 tests,  respectively. During validation, inconclusive rates could not all be  computed for all the genetic tests.", "Since the FBI\u2019s requirements stated that the LOD was to be used as a  measure of sensitivity, it was an important measure of the performance of  a given genetic test. LOD provides interpretations of results generated by  a genetic test with the known limitations of such data, but it is a difficult  quantity to estimate reliably. Our review of existing and current  guidelines for validation suggests that using an appropriate estimate of  LOD does provide a reliable measurement of sensitivity, but LOD  estimates, like any performance statistic, should be reported with some  measure of confidence. For example, the Environmental Protection  Agency defines the method detection limit as the \u201cminimum concentration  of substance that can be measured and reported with 99-percent  confidence that the analyte  concentration is  greater than zero.\u201d If test sensitivity is an important performance  criterion, then both verification and validation procedures for a genetic  test should report LOD, along with a measure of confidence.

Calculating uncertainties of measurement is also an important task. All  steps in validation testing, such as sample collection, sample preparation,  transport, storage and analysis can introduce stochasticity and increase  uncertainty in the test results. Most such stochasticities (and others) will  also affect the testing of repository samples. These additional  uncertainties can be measured and understood using repeated (replicate)  experiments including all relevant steps (from collection to analysis) of  samples with known concentration levels. By designing a validation study  with a sufficient number of replicate samples, the FBI could have  quantified the level of statistical confidence in the sensitivity and  specificity of the tests.", "While the SWGMGF guidelines did not require them, tests as part of  validation that examined stochastic (random) effects of the process would  have made it possible to draw more rigorous conclusions, with measures  of confidence, regarding the test results for the repository samples. addition, we found that additional information on the sensitivity and  specificity of the PCR-based genetic tests was characterized during  postvalidation testing that the FBI\u2019s expert advisers recommended. Our  analysis of these post-validation test results suggests that the negative  rates of the genetic tests were high for samples that could be expected to  contain the genetic mutations when using the sample collection and  processing methods as required for the repository samples and that there  were stochastic (random) effects in the repository screening process.", "The SWGDAM guidelines do suggest such tests for PCR-based methods, which is  important when samples contain low concentrations of the target to be detected.

However, according to  the FBI, the purpose of the additional testing was to determine whether  stochastic sampling error had been introduced into the repository  preparation process as instructed in the subpoena. Therefore, the  postvalidation tests were to determine whether the procedures by which  the repository samples were processed could affect the accuracy of the  interpretation of the data. The postvalidation tests were conducted in  August and September 2007 under conditions that closely mimicked the  intended use for each of the genetic tests. According to the FBI, the  screening of the repository samples with the genetic tests was about  three-fourths complete when this testing took place.", "Specifically, in the postvalidation tests, the contractors applied their  genetic tests to replicate samples derived directly from some of the  evidentiary material\u2014including flask RMR-1029.

Regarding sensitivity, under the assumption that undiluted  samples from flask RMR-1029 are positive for all four genetic mutations  (supported by the preponderance of genetic and non-genetic data), we  can estimate the negative rate as the frequency of negative results in  replicate tests of undiluted samples from RMR-1029.", "Validation testing showed that for those results expected to be positive,  no negative results were observed at or above the LOD for any of the  genetic tests.

Statistically meaningful  comparative analyses can allow the use of statistical inferences relating  to the process to produce the sample, the provenance of a sample, or the  relatedness of samples. The significance of such statistical inference  relies on the analyst\u2019s ability to quantify both the confidence in test results  and the frequency with which results match. Confidence, in this context,  refers to the level of reliability and accuracy investigators assign to the  test results obtained from the measurement tools used to identify the  properties of interest in the samples. The frequency of the sample  properties\u2019 presence, or generation in a relevant population of possible  sources, is a measure of how common or rare the properties are and  provides context to the probative value of the evidence. According to a  2009 NRC report, a statistical framework is needed to quantify the  probative value of forensic evidence in terms of the frequency of that  evidence in a population.", "Formulating an appropriate statistical framework that is adequate for all  microbial forensic investigations is not feasible because the diversity of  many potential pathogens is unknown or, at best, difficult to describe. For  this reason, frameworks must be adapted to the specific circumstances of  each case. As shown in table 5, our review of scientific literature in  forensic science, statistics, epidemiology, and population genetics  identified the six general characteristics that a framework needs for  statistically meaningful comparative analyses of the attack material to  repository samples for the specific set of circumstances of the FBI\u2019s  investigation.", "First, a definition of what constitutes a matching type should be clearly  established. A genetic signature, or a set of genetic markers, can be  chosen to establish a genetic type (or genotype) that is used to  differentiate the samples. The genetic signature should be sufficient to  identify the target of interest at the resolution needed for an investigation.  In this case, the target of interest was the B. anthracis Ames strain,  capable of producing spores with a set of specific genetic markers linked  to morphs observed after a prolonged period of growth. The requisite  resolution was the ability to differentiate among the individual stocks (or  collections of organisms) of B. anthracis. Determining that two or more  samples have a matching type must take into account the source of the  organisms (for example, nature or the laboratory), the stability of genetic  markers, storage conditions, and conditions giving rise to the markers.  Specific growth or environmental conditions may selectively advantage or  disadvantage mutations and affect the stability of genetic markers.  Therefore, if the significance of a matching genetic signature is to be  understood, the genetic markers should be well characterized, and the  conditions giving rise to the presence of markers in a sample should be  understood.", "Second, once the genetic signature has been established and a match  has been clearly defined, it is then necessary to identify and define the  population of relevant sources that may have the genetic signature in  order to understand how common or rare the genetic signature is. This  relevant source population is critical in identifying the probative value of  any match or nonmatch between samples. In a criminal investigation, a  relevant source population may be considered the population of suspects,  and it should be defined as specifically as possible to identify the smallest  population related to the evidentiary material. The definition of the  relevant source population should be based on the population related to  characteristics of the evidence and not on characteristics of a suspected  source. The relevant source population in this case is all stocks of B.  anthracis that could have been used to grow the material used in the  attack letters.", "In defining the source population, the structure of the relevant source  population of bacteria should be understood. When a population is  divided into subgroups that do not mix freely, that population is said to  have structure. In this case, the relevant reference population of stocks of  B. anthracis was highly structured among the laboratories included in the  investigation. The lack of independence between stocks in a structured  population affects inferences about the evidentiary material and its most  and least likely sources.", "Third, in order to quantify or estimate how common or rare a genetic  signature is in the relevant source population, a database that accurately  represents the relevant source population\u2019s genetics should be created.  The extent to which the database reflects the population will affect the  accuracy of the match probability. The size and quality of the data in the  database will affect the power of match probability, determining the  potential probative power of the signature for distinguishing one source  from another. A large and comprehensive database is the theoretical goal  but in most cases may not be possible. However, in this case, the FBI  determined that it was possible to identify all sources of the B. anthracis  Ames strain, and it set out to create a comprehensive database. For  completeness the genetic information in the database should have  included samples from all sources of the B. anthracis Ames strain. In  such cases, the database should be complete\u2014excluding sources results  in underrepresentation\u2014and should avoid duplication (although  replication can be beneficial)\u2014unknowingly including sources more than  once results in overrepresentation. Methods used to select samples from  each stock should be adequate to ensure representation of the organisms  within each stock. In an ideal situation, the database of genetic  information should be constructed to the same quality standards as the  actual evidentiary analysis. These quality standards should apply to the  selection of samples from stocks to the results of the genetic tests.", "Fourth, the limitations of the measurement tools used to generate the  genetic information in the database should be identified. When  quantitative inference is attempted, care must be taken not to  overemphasize data; the limits of the methods used to generate the data  should be considered. The power and limitations of microbial forensics  methods need to be understood through validation. Validation frequently  connotes confidence, but it may be thought of as defining the limitations  of the method. This does not mean that a method must be 100 percent  accurate to be useful. Studies should allow the estimation of the limits of  the measurements. The limits of the methods must be demonstrated and  documented for all steps in the process, including sample collection,  preservation, extraction, analytical characterization, and data  interpretation.", "Fifth, the choice of statistical methods should be appropriate for the data  and should properly account for the mode of inheritance of the genetic  markers and any structure in the populations. An important aspect of  computing association statistics and probability estimates is properly  accounting for the mode of inheritance. Methods appropriate for  computing probability estimates and statistical tests of significance differ  by the mode of inheritance of the genetic markers. In organisms that  reproduce asexually, such as B. anthracis, genetic diversity is driven by  mutation processes, not by random mixing. Computing match  probabilities using methods that assume independence and random  mixing within populations is not appropriate because the genetic variation  in such organisms is highly correlated. In organisms that reproduce  asexually, the frequency of a particular genetic type in the population  must be determined by direct observation. The frequency of the  evidentiary genotype in a relevant source population can be based on  counting the number of times the genotype is observed in a reference  database. The strength of this approach is affected greatly by the genetic  database and whether it has sufficiently sampled relevant populations.", "Sixth and finally, the interpretation of results should include  quantifications of uncertainty. It is crucial to clarify the type of question the  analysis is addressing when evaluating the accuracy of a forensic  analysis. Although some techniques may be too imprecise to permit the  accurate identification of a specific individual, they may still provide useful  and accurate information about questions and classification. The  interpretation of results will be stronger with the proper use of statistical  and probabilistic analyses, but the strengths and weakness of any result  should be communicated. Results should indicate the uncertainty in the  measurements, and studies must be conducted that enable the  estimation of those values."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The FBI\u2019s Statistical Approach Could Have Been Improved for Three of the Six Characteristics of a Statistical Framework", "paragraphs": ["We believe that the six general characteristics described above make up  a comprehensive statistical framework that could have allowed the FBI to  quantify significance and probative value of the scientific evidence  collected in a statistically meaningful way and could have strengthened  the evidence it collected.

Finding no shortfalls or  deficiencies in the basic methodologies they reviewed, they determined  that the usefulness of the genetic markers was sufficient. The team also  stated that the extent of research and development of the genetic tests at  the date of their review was insufficient to determine whether the  presence or absence of one or several of the genetic markers was  associated with the evidence, was merely characteristic of normal culture  practices, or possibly was affected by the sensitivity of detections of the  genetic tests.

If so, the presence of the genetic markers would be a function of  the growth conditions rather than direct derivation from parent material,  such as RMR-1029.

For  example, the NAS report stated that because the repository samples  were not independent, the proportion of samples testing positive for all  four genetic markers was not a meaningful estimate of the probability of  occurrence. The FBI did not use the results of the statistical analyses and  did not quantify the confidence it had in, or the probative value of, the  repository results in its conclusions included in its final investigative  summary.

As we previously indicated in our  assessment of the validation of the genetic tests, the additional  postvalidation tests conducted in 2007 demonstrated variability in the  results of the genetic tests when they were applied to samples under  conditions intended to mimic their use on repository samples.", "Additionally, the two genetic tests for the D marker did not always give the  same result for the same sample. An analysis included in the FBI  contractor\u2019s Statistical Analysis Report identified 24 repository samples  for which the two genetic tests yielded opposite results from the same  sample. The NAS report stated that this lack of agreement between the  two genetic tests for the D mutation illustrated the differing sensitivities  and specificities of the tests. This lack of agreement was also evident in  the eight samples that tested positive for all four genetic markers. As  shown in figure 4, our analysis of the repository data demonstrated that  one of these eight samples also tested negative using the other genetic  test for the D marker.", "Further, our analysis of duplicate samples in the repository showed  differences in the results of genetic tests on samples selected from the  same stock. As shown in figure 5, only 3 of the 14 duplicate samples we  identified showed the same results across the five genetic tests. For  example, FBI repository sample number 049-004 tested positive for all  five genetic tests while a duplicate sample selected from the same stock  (066-044) tested positive for only four of the five genetic tests. In another  example, FBI repository sample number 049-016 tested positive for all  five genetic tests while the duplicate sample (047-002) tested negative for  all five genetic tests.", "FBI officials stated that these results may have differed for a number of  reasons, including uncertainty from the sampling process (sampling error)  and uncertainty from the genetic test itself (stochastic error). Each step in  the process the FBI used to collect, prepare, and test repository samples  could have added uncertainty to the results of the genetic test.", "As noted previously, before its searches, the FBI relied on laboratory  officials to identify and select subsamples of distinct Ames strains for  submission to the repository. The NAS report stated that the subpoena\u2019s  instructions to laboratories for preparing samples were not precise  enough to ensure consistent procedures for producing samples that  would be most suitable for later comparisons. For example, the subpoena  instructed laboratories to select a representative sample from each stock  but did not provide guidance on how many cells or colonies to select.  Although steps were taken in the genetic tests to standardize the number  of cells being tested, the number of initial cells or colonies selected from  each stock would have affected the probability of selecting material  capable of producing the genetic markers.", "This is particularly important because the mutations chosen as genetic  markers were infrequent in the evidentiary material. For example, we  interviewed the scientist who submitted the duplicate samples we  identified above as having opposite results (all five negative versus all five  positive). He told us that, in the presence of an FBI investigator, he had  not followed the subpoena instructions when he selected the sample  (047-002) that tested negative for all five genetic markers.", "In addition to the selection methods we have discussed in this report, the  methods used to prepare and test the repository samples could have  introduced uncertainty to the results of the genetic tests. The NAS report  stated that replication could have been used in the design of the FBI  repository to provide measures of the uncertainty of the genetic tests.  Although laboratories were required to submit to the repository two  samples from each stock, only one of those samples was tested for the  genetic signature. Without replication, the FBI was unable to assess  uncertainty in the results of the genetic tests in the context of testing  actual repository samples.", "Because the FBI did not include measures of uncertainty when presenting  the results of the genetic testing, questions have been raised about  samples that tested positive for three or fewer genetic markers. For  example, NAS stated that the FBI did not address false negative results  and raised concern regarding the restriction of the statistical analyses to  the repository samples that contained no inconclusive or variant results.  NAS further highlighted 21 samples that contained an inconclusive or  variant result and tested positive for 1, 2, or 3 genetic markers.", "To illustrate the potential effect this uncertainty could have had on the  interpretation of the results, we conducted an analysis using the  estimates of false negative rates obtained from the additional replicate  testing, combined with a sensitivity analysis accounting for the decision to  restrict the statistical analyses to the 947 samples that contained no  inconclusive or variant results. We computed a range of probabilities,  given the observed results of the genetic testing, that each repository  sample was selected from a stock that could have produced all four  genetic markers. We found an additional 16 repository samples with  probabilities that exceeded a 1 percent chance of being selected from a  stock that contained all four genetic markers. We determined that 15 of  these 16 additional samples were selected from stocks held at the same  two laboratories that were the source of one or more of the 8 samples  that tested positive for all four genetic markers.", "The remaining sample identified in our analysis was a sample that we had  determined was independent from RMR-1029 and tested positive for the  D marker. In addition, this sample was inconclusive for both the A1 and  A3 markers and negative for the E marker. We computed a 0 to 19  percent range of probabilities for this sample, the maximum occurring  when the model made the assumption that both inconclusive results for  A1 and A3 markers were positive.", "Additionally, the results of the genetic tests for this sample further  highlight the importance of including measures of uncertainty. According  to the transfer inventory records we reviewed and the laboratory official  we interviewed, this sample was selected from a stock that was one of  four copies of the same material. As shown in figure 6, the repository  samples selected from the remaining three copies tested negative for all  five genetic markers. This demonstrates that the genetic tests could have  yielded different results for samples selected from the same material and,  as the NAS stated, replication could have been used to provide measures  of the uncertainty induced by these varying results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The FBI Is Addressing the Need for Formal Statistical Expertise In Future Investigations", "paragraphs": ["The FBI has taken steps to include statistical expertise in future  investigations.

Further, the results of the postvalidation testing raise questions about  whether additional information could have been obtained during  verification and validation and, thus, whether the validation testing could  have been more rigorous. The use of a standardized approach to  verification and validation from the beginning could have more definitively  established the performance of all the genetic tests. It could have helped  in communicating expectations clearly, ensuring confidence in results  generated by any genetic tests developed.", "DHS could be instrumental in developing a validation framework and  future efforts using a framework could help achieve minimum  performance standards during verification and validation, particularly  under multiple contracts. Also, incorporating statistical analyses in the  framework would allow the calculation of statistical confidence for  interpreting the validation testing results.", "The FBI\u2019s statistical approach to its study design and plan, sample  collection and analysis, and interpretation of data and scientific evidence  lacked several important characteristics that could have strengthened the  significance of that evidence. Although the complexity and novelty of the  scientific methods at the time of the FBI\u2019s investigation made it  challenging for the FBI to adequately address all these problems, the  agency could have improved its approach by including formal statistical  expertise early in the investigation and establishing a statistical  framework that could identify and account for many of the problems. In  future investigations, statistical expertise early in the investigation will  help identify the importance and role of fully understanding the (1)  evolution of the genetic markers, (2) sources of dependence between  samples, and (3) uncertainty in the measurement tools used to identify a  genetic signature. This expertise could influence an investigation\u2019s  methods and strengthen the significance of scientific evidence.", "A key scientific gap\u2014how stable genetic mutations are in a microbial  genome and thus their suitability as genetic markers\u2014remains an issue.  Lack of this knowledge has implications for both the development of  genetic tests, or other investigative approaches and technologies, and the  analysis of the results they generate. For example, how likely it is that the  same genetic mutations will arise independently in separate cultures is  currently unknown, and so is whether different culture conditions can  change the ratio of the mutations significantly enough to provide a  negative rather than a positive result. DHS-funded research into the  evolutionary behavior of variants in the genome of B. anthracis and other  microbial agents and the use of genome sequencing is a step in the right  direction because the FBI is planning to use sequencing in future  investigations to analyze all the material in evidence samples.

We conducted a sensitivity  analysis to examine the effect of data trimming assumptions in the FBI\u2019s  statistical analysis by varying the assumptions to remove all inconclusive,  no-growth, and variant results. We computed the conditional probabilities  that a repository sample was selected from a stock containing all four  genetic markers, given the observed combinations of results. We  combined the probability analysis with the data trimming sensitivity  analysis to compute a range of conditional probabilities for each  repository sample. We then identified the samples that had a maximum  conditional probability of greater than 1 percent (nontrivial).", "To build a model to compute this probability, we defined the sample  space of possible outcomes. There are 16 combinations for a binary  measure of the presence (+) or absence (-) of each of the four genetic  markers. Therefore we defined the possible outcomes for the four genetic  markers (A1, A3, D, and E) as S1 through S16, as shown in figure 7.", "The observed assay results have the 16 possible outcomes listed in  figure 7.

The D marker was typed by two assay procedures (D-1 and D-2),  only one of which (D-2) the FBI used in its analysis. The Statistical  Analysis Report was restricted to the analysis of 947 samples that  contained no inconclusive or variant results and, therefore, excluded 112  samples. To explore the potential effect of the inconclusive exclusion on  the probabilities of observing all four morphs, we explored three possible  outcomes for inconclusive results. We treated all inconclusive results as  first positive and then negative, and then we excluded the inconclusive  results from the analysis. The sensitivity analysis examined the six  different combinations of outcomes, the two D assay possibilities, and the  three potential outcomes of the inconclusive data.", "The computation included all 1,059 repository samples and varied the  assumptions made around data trimming from most to least conservative.  The results for each set of estimated false negative rates show that 7 of  the 16 possible outcomes of the genetic testing had a range of  probabilities that included values exceeding a 1 percent chance of being  selected from a stock that contained all four genetic markers (table 8).", "Further, when we computed the probabilities for the repository samples,  we found that only a small subset of the 1,059 repository samples had a  range of probabilities that included values that exceeded a 1 percent  chance of being selected from a stock that contained all four genetic  markers. Specifically, we identified 24 repository samples, including the 8  that tested positive for all four genetic markers, which had a nontrivial  chance of being selected from a stock that contained all four genetic  markers.", "By using estimates of false negative rates from the results of the  postvalidation replicate tests on RMR-1029 and the letter material, we  have made an assumption that the genetic variants in all samples in the  FBI repository were at least as concentrated as in RMR-1029 or the letter  material. Additionally, since these replicate samples were selected in a  controlled environment, false negative rates may have been  underestimated because they are not affected by variation in test results  caused by the sampling procedures used to submit samples to the  repository.
