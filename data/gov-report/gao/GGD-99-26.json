At the end of fiscal year 1997, EAS positions totaled 80,238, or about 10 percent of total Service career-level employees. PCES, established in 1979, includes Service senior-level officers and executives in positions such as area vice presidents.

The head of the Department reports directly to the Deputy Postmaster General. The Department is responsible for, among other things, actively supporting the recruitment, retention, and upward mobility of women and minorities.

The study addressed Service personnel and supplier diversity and was issued in October 1997. The report stated that the Service was a leader in meeting affirmative action goals as well as striving for parity between its workforce and the CLF. It also stated, among other things, that women and minorities appeared to be experiencing problems advancing to management jobs at EAS 17 and above positions. The Board of Governors subsequently directed the Service to develop an action plan for dealing with the diversity issues raised by Aguirre. The Service developed an action plan and briefed the Board on the plan in April 1998.", "In our previous letter, we reviewed promotions to EAS 16 and above positions at four selected performance clusters.

Such an approach allowed the issues presented in the report to be discussed from several perspectives, which in our opinion and based on our standards for performing studies and evaluations, was an acceptable methodological approach. For example, Aguirre made what we believe were appropriate adjustments to the 1990 Census CLF data to arrive at compatible postal districts for comparisons. Aguirre staff developed models and adjusted the models to allow for Service hiring requirements and restrictions, such as English language proficiency and veteran\u2019s preference. Using these data, they made numerous comparisons of the Postal workforce to the CLF.", "In addition, the report indicated that Aguirre staff gathered data from various organizational levels in the Service. It indicated that the staff spoke with Service officials at headquarters and selected sites, a number of Service employees, potential Service employees, and contractors to obtain their perspectives on diversity-related issues in the Service. Aguirre staff also visited selected Service sites and conducted employee surveys and interviews. They arranged focus group discussions with community residents who were viewed as potential employees to gather information about, among other things, their views on barriers to diversity at the Service. They also held focus groups with and interviewed potential contractors to explore the extent to which any known barriers might impede contractors, especially minority-owned contractors, from obtaining Service business.

She said Aguirre wanted to further analyze the data but ran out of time. She also said that interviews and discussions with Service employees, potential employees, and potential contractors were limited in that Aguirre staff spoke only with individuals located near the sites they visited. Thus, the views of these individuals may not represent the views of similar individuals at other Service sites.", "Finally, the Aguirre report recognizes the information obtained from Aguirre\u2019s visits to postal sites may not be typical of Service sites throughout the country. The Board selected the first 5 of the 10 sites visited because these sites had known diversity problems or were of special interest to particular Board members. This resulted in a highly urban sample of sites. Aguirre attempted to balance these sites by selecting five others based on demographics that were more rural and, according to Aguirre and Service officials, that had achieved some success in the area of diversity. However, even this larger sample of 10 sites had African-American representation that was twice that of the other 75 performance clusters that were not selected for review.

Aguirre did not explicitly define the term glass ceiling. Further, Aguirre officials told us that Aguirre based its finding of the glass ceiling primarily on its analyses of fiscal year 1996 data and comparisons of that data with the CLF and secondarily on discussions it had with Service employees. Specifically, Aguirre compared the level of women and minority representation at the various levels or positions within the EAS with their representation in the CLF. Because the representation of women and minorities in positions beginning at EAS 17 was less than their representation in the CLF, Aguirre stated that it appeared that a glass ceiling began at EAS 17 positions.", "In addition, the Project Leader for the Aguirre study told us that although Aguirre\u2019s finding of a glass ceiling was supported primarily by its analyses and comparisons of data, the finding was also supported by the views of postal workers, many of whom perceived that barriers existed to the promotion of women and minorities to higher EAS and PCES positions. She said that the views of the Service employees Aguirre interviewed were consistent\u2014that is, barriers, such as a perceived \u201cold boy network,\u201d prevented women and minorities from progressing to EAS 17 and above positions. However, she acknowledged, as did the Aguirre report, that the views expressed by these individuals at these sites could not be generalized to the entire Service workforce.", "We do not believe that it is appropriate to compare the EEO group representation in specific EAS positions or levels in the Service with the CLF because CLF data are not, nor were they intended to be, broken down into an appropriate pool of employees for such a comparison (i.e., similar positions or levels, as well as individuals with appropriate qualifications for those positions). Both the Aguirre Project Director and Project Leader for the study told us that Aguirre used the comparison with the CLF because the Service asked them to. Nevertheless, the Service also disagreed with Aguirre\u2019s glass-ceiling finding on the basis of its comparison of women and minorities in specific EAS positions with the general CLF.", "Further, we believe that the use of the term glass ceiling in the Aguirre report could be misleading, particularly if the term were to be interpreted by readers in a general sense\u2014that is, an upper limit beyond which few or no women and minorities could pass. Under this definition, and according to our review of workforce and promotion data for EAS 17 and above cluster-level employees in fiscal year 1997, no glass ceiling existed. For example, as shown in table 3, we found that for the cluster level, women and minorities were present in all positions and had been promoted to most of those positions. In addition, the percentage of women and minorities being promoted into these higher EAS positions was generally greater than was their representation in the same positions in fiscal year 1997 (before the promotions). For example, for EAS 17 positions, women and minorities comprised about 54 percent of the positions and received about 58 percent of the promotions. However, both our analyses and Aguirre\u2019s suggest that opportunity may exist for the Service to increase the diversity of its workforce in the higher EAS positions, even though a glass ceiling does not appear to exist.

She noted that such information was critical to Service efforts to examine the promotion process for continuous improvement. Although recognizing that managers were facing various priorities, she asked that managers develop a plan for collecting and entering past applicant data into the Promotion Report System. She also noted that this automated system was the source of data for the Applicant Flow Tracking System (AFTS), a system vital to the Diversity Development Department\u2019s responsibility for reporting promotion demographics.", "According to a manager in the Service\u2019s Human Resources Department, the Service has had a centralized, computer-based tracking system in place for the last 10 years\u2014the AFTS\u2014which is to track diversity data related to promotions within the Service. He acknowledged, however, that participation in this system varies across Service units. Some units have consistently entered the data into the AFTS as required, while others have never entered the data. Another manager in Human Resources said that this inconsistent use of the AFTS and subsequent incomplete data in the system have occurred because unit managers have few incentives to see that the data are entered into the system because the system is not tied to any essential information system, such as accounting and payroll or the employee master file. In addition, he said that there have been few or no consequences to these managers for not doing so.", "Because of the unreliability of the AFTS database, the Service has to use the Employee Master File and a separate personnel action database to obtain race, ethnicity, and gender data for those applicants who are promoted; the Service cannot readily compile and use this information on applicants seeking promotion. A reliable and complete database on all applicants would (1) provide an essential baseline against which to assess the promotion progress of specific EEO groups and (2) help the Service identify and remove or reduce the impact of barriers to the promotion of women and minorities. For example, during our initial review in response to your request, we noted that there were no Hispanic women applicants for promotion to EAS levels 17 and above in the Service\u2019s Atlanta performance cluster in fiscal year 1997.

Also, in fiscal year 1997, women and minorities were generally promoted to EAS 17 and above positions in percentages higher than or close to their workforce representation in the three workforce levels\u2014cluster, headquarters, and area offices. As of September 1997, women and minorities were present in all EAS 17 and above positions and generally had been promoted to EAS 17 and above positions during 1997 in the three workforce levels. Nonetheless, as of September 1997, women and minority representation was generally lower in EAS 17 and above positions than it was in EAS 11 through 16 positions.", "Overall, given the short time frame and preselection of sites that resulted in certain study limitations, we believe that the multiple methodologies Aguirre used for its study were reasonable, relevant, and appropriate. However, Aguirre\u2019s finding that a glass ceiling appeared to exist at positions beginning at EAS 17 could be misleading. Evidence that Aguirre cited to support this finding was not convincing, and according to our analysis, women and minorities were generally represented in and were being promoted to EAS 17 and above positions, albeit at varying percentages, for the period we reviewed.", "Neither the Service nor we could determine the exact number of recommendations made by Aguirre. Nevertheless, the Service is making progress in implementing the 23 initiatives it developed in response to the Aguirre report, which are aimed at strengthening its diversity program. We believe that the Service\u2019s ongoing plan to continue monitoring the implementation of policies, processes, procedures, and plans covered by its 23 initiatives is especially important given the Service\u2019s designation of some initiatives as being completed when such policies, processes, procedures, and plans have been developed and approved although specific actions required by some of these initiatives may still be ongoing.", "Service initiatives to better capture and use data in response to the Aguirre study appear reasonable. However, the Service has not yet (1) established and implemented targets and measures for tracking the Service\u2019s progress in meeting its diversity goals and objectives or (2) fully captured or used EEO data on applicants as they progress, or do not progress, through the Service\u2019s promotion process.

Aguirre noted the conditions under which its study was done, such as a charged atmosphere at the Service and the short time frame for the study. Aguirre also noted differences between the scope of its study and ours, such as its (1) use of fiscal year 1996 data compared to our use of fiscal year 1997 data and (2) inclusion of PCES data while our review did not. Aguirre also pointed out that it found clear distinctions in perceptions about the types of positions within the EAS levels, and that to do a thorough analysis, one should look at these differences. For example, Aguirre said it found that women were overrepresented in the attorney area and in rural postmaster jobs and underrepresented in more \u201cpower and influence\u201d positions. We believe that Aguirre was suggesting that these differences in scope could account for differences between the results of its study and ours.", "We used fiscal year 1997 data in our analysis because it was the latest period for which complete data were available. We did not include PCES positions in our analysis because we were asked to analyze the Service\u2019s EAS workforce. An analysis of any perceived or actual differences in representation of women and minorities among types of EAS positions was beyond the scope of our review. Nevertheless, even with these differences in scope, we do not believe that there were significant differences between the results of our work and Aguirre\u2019s study results in those areas that we both addressed. Both reports point out that women and minorities were less represented in higher EAS positions than they were in lower EAS positions. In addition, our report does not take issue with Aguirre\u2019s view that barriers may exist to the promotion of women and minorities to high-level EAS positions.", "Aguirre further stated that it stood behind its conclusion that there seemed to be a drop in the numbers of women and minorities somewhere around the EAS 17 through 22 level based on data presented in its report. Aguirre said that these data were coupled with the views of Service employees it interviewed who believed that a barrier, or \u201cin their terms, a glass ceiling\u201d existed near or around this EAS level. However, our concern is that Aguirre\u2019s use of the term glass ceiling in its report could be misleading because (1) Aguirre did not define the term glass ceiling in its report; (2) the data in its report did not, in our view, support the existence of a glass ceiling as defined in the general sense, that is, an upper limit beyond which few or no women and minorities could advance; and (3) data in both Aguirre\u2019s report and in our report showed that women and minorities were represented in and were promoted to levels above EAS 17, showing the advancement of women and minorities. The Postal Service raised a similar concern about Aguirre\u2019s use of the term glass ceiling. Nevertheless, we agree with Aguirre that opportunity may exist for the Service to increase diversity at higher EAS levels, and our report recommends that the Service ensure that appropriate EEO group data are captured and used so that any barriers impeding the promotion of women and minorities to high-level EAS positions can be identified.", "Aguirre said that our report lacked a discussion of the \u201cfeeder flow\u201d from which Postal employees move into higher level EAS positions. We believe, however, that our report addressed this issue, at least in part, through our analysis of the diversity of the Service\u2019s EAS 11 through 16 workforce, which forms the pool from which promotions to EAS 17 and above positions would likely come.", "Finally, Aguirre provided several technical comments, which we considered and included in our report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on the Postal Service, House Committee on Government Reform; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs; the Postmaster General; and Aguirre International.

The Diversity Development Department, in conjunction with the Service\u2019s Minneapolis Data Center, provided us with data tapes containing information related to the equal employment opportunity (EEO) composition of the Service career-level workforce for Service fiscal years 1993 through 1997. We chose to focus our analysis on these years since major downsizing and other changes occurred in the Service in 1992 because of an extensive reorganization. Data from fiscal year 1998 were not available at the time of our analysis. The data we used included EAS level; race, national origin, and gender; location of employee; number of employees by EEO group; and civilian labor force (CLF) statistics for each EEO group. We did not verify these data by comparing them to original source documents.", "We obtained information on promotions from the Service\u2019s Human Resource Information Office; this information was compiled from the Employee Master and Payroll Accounting files. Using the \u201cnature of action\u201d code from Forms 50, Notice of Personnel Action, we identified career-level employees who had been promoted, by EAS level, throughout the Service. We used this information to assess the extent of promotions to specific EAS positions by EEO groups in the Service. Our limited verification of this promotion data against the promotions reviewed at the three areasreported on in our previous letter showed it to be accurate.", "We used this information to construct a workforce profile by EEO group at three workforce levels\u2014headquarters, area offices, and performance clusters. In our analysis, we included all career-level employees from each performance cluster; employees reporting to area offices, whether they were located in an area office or a cluster facility; and headquarters\u2019 employees, including employees physically housed at L\u2019Enfant Plaza in Washington, D.C., as well as those reporting to headquarters but located elsewhere. We analyzed data provided by the Service for the three groups of employees: (1) cluster-level employees, who represented 732,112 (or 95.7 percent) of the about 765,000 career-level employees at the Service at the end of fiscal year 1997; (2) area office employees, who represented 21,864 (2.9 percent) of the career-level employees; and (3) headquarters\u2019 employees, who represented 10,707 (1.4 percent) of the career-level employees. We looked at employees in the three workforce levels because responsibility and authority for diversity is separated into these three levels.", "To provide some context for the results of our analysis, we first compared the 1997 Service data with CLF data from the 1990 decennial census separately for the three workforce levels of employees. We used figures from the 1990 census because this was the comparative baseline used by the Service and by Aguirre International in its study. We recognize there are more recent estimates that would have accounted for the changes in the population, especially in the Hispanic and Asian subpopulations in certain areas. However, these estimates are not broken down into a geographic level that is comparable to Service performance clusters.", "Regarding promotions to women and minorities as well as the Aguirre report\u2019s finding of a glass ceiling at EAS 17 and above positions, we did several analyses: First, we considered how the representation of each of the 10 EEO groups in EAS 17 and above positions had changed between fiscal years 1993 and 1997. Second, we considered whether the percentage of employees in each of the 10 EEO groups (i.e., white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American men and women) that were promoted to EAS 17 and above positions during fiscal year 1997 were greater or less than the percentages of employees in each of the 10 EEO groups that were employed in those positions at the beginning of fiscal year 1997 (before the promotions). We computed a ratio statistic to express the percentage of employees in each of the 10 EEO groups that were promoted to EAS 17 and above positions during fiscal year 1997 compared with the percentage of employees in each group already employed in EAS 17 and above positions before the promotions. The positive ratio of 1.23 for black men, for example, was the percentage of all promotions going to black men (10.85 percent) divided by the percentage of the cluster-level workforce, which was black men at EAS 17 and above (8.81 percent) at the beginning of fiscal year 1997. These same comparisons and ratios were done separately for cluster, headquarters, and area office employees. Finally, we considered how the representation of the various groups of women and minorities in higher level EAS positions (17 through 30) compared with their representation in the lower level EAS positions (11 through 16).", "To provide observations on the methodology used by Aguirre International in its study of workforce diversity at the Service, we reviewed the Aguirre report and the methodologies used in relation to the study\u2019s objectives, limitations, and findings.
