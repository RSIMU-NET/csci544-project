Using the A/F-X cost model to predict the effect of total buy and annual production rate changes on recurring flyaway cost, we calculated that the F/A-18E/F unit recurring flyaway cost would be $53.2 million (fiscal year 1996 dollars) rather than the $43.6 million (fiscal year 1996 dollars) estimated by DOD. The $53.2 million unit recurring flyaway cost for the F/A-18E/F indicates that the E/F would have a unit recurring flyaway cost that is 189 percent of the F/A-18C/D\u2019s unit recurring flyaway cost ($53 million compared to $28 million). As shown in appendix I, this cost difference in unit recurring flyaway would result in a savings of almost $17 billion (fiscal year 1996 dollars) or savings of over $24 billion when expressed in then-year dollars, if the Navy were to procure 660 F/A-18C/Ds rather than 660 F/A-18E/Fs. Our estimated savings do not include the cost of C/D upgrades, such as the larger 480-gallon external fuel tanks for improved range nor the strengthened landing gear to increase carrier recovery payload. However, our estimated savings are conservative because they also do not include planned E/F upgrades and are based on recurring flyaway costs that do not include the other items that make up total procurement costs.

Additionally, our estimated savings do not include savings that would accrue from having fewer type model F/A-18 aircraft in the inventory. The cost benefits would result from having common aircraft spare parts, simplified technical specifications, and reduced support equipment variations, as well as reductions in aircrew and maintenance training requirements.", "Also, there are other indications that F/A-18E/F procurement costs could increase further. According to contractor estimates, the cost of LRIP for the E/F is currently projected to be 8.5-percent greater than estimates provided to the Congress."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["DOD faces funding challenges as it attempts to modernize its tactical aircraft fleet through the Air Force\u2019s F-22 program, the Navy\u2019s F/A-18E/F program, and the tri-service JSF program. Various DOD officials have recognized that funding for each of these programs may not be forthcoming. In that event, DOD will be forced to make some funding trade-offs among these three competing aircraft programs.", "In prior reports, we offered alternative procurement strategies for the Air Force\u2019s F-22 program. Regarding the Navy\u2019s F/A-18E/F program, DOD\u2019s next major decision is whether to proceed into production. The Navy has spent about $3.75 billion (then-year dollars) on the E/F engineering and manufacturing development effort and plans to spend $57.31 billion (fiscal year 1996 dollars)/ $83.35 billion (then-year dollars) to procure  1,000 aircraft. This report demonstrates that the justification for the E/F is not as evident as perhaps it was when the program was approved in 1992 because the E/F was justified, in large part, on projected operational deficiencies in the C/D aircraft that have not materialized. This report also demonstrates that proceeding with the E/F program is not the most cost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy\u2019s tactical aircraft fleet. Therefore, the information provided in this report should be fully considered before a production decision is made on the E/F. Such consideration should take into account the following.", "Operational deficiencies in the F/A-18C/D cited by the Navy in justifying the need for the F/A-18E/F\u2014range, carrier recovery payload, survivability, and system growth\u2014either have not materialized as projected or can be corrected with nonstructural changes to the F/A-18C/D. Furthermore, E/F operational capabilities will only be marginally improved over the C/D model. The E/F\u2019s increased range is achieved at the expense of combat effectiveness and increased F/A-18E/F payload capability has created weapons release problems that, if not resolved, will reduce the F/A-18E/F\u2019s payload capability compared to the F/A-18C/D.", "A more cost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy\u2019s tactical aircraft fleet exists. In the short term, the Navy could continue to procure the F/A-18C/D aircraft. In the mid-term, upgrades could be made to the C/Ds to further improve the C/D\u2019s operational capabilities. These upgrades could include such things as: using the larger 480-gallon external fuel tanks to achieve more range; modifying landing gear to increase carrier recovery payload; using advanced avionics that require less space, cooling and power; and incorporating add-on survivability features.", "For the long term, the Navy is considering JSF as a complement to the F/A-18E/F. DOD is predicting that the next generation strike fighter will provide more operational capability at less cost than the E/F. Therefore, the next generation fighter should be considered as an alternative to the F/A-18E/F.", "The F/A-18E/F will cost more to procure than DOD currently projects. The $43.6 million (fiscal year 1996 dollars) unit recurring flyaway cost estimate is based on a total buy of 1,000 aircraft\u2014660 for the Navy and 340 for the Marine Corps\u2014at a high annual production rate of 72 aircraft per year. However, the Marine Corps does not plan to buy the F/A-18E/F aircraft and the Congress has stated that an annual production rate of 72 aircraft is not realistic. Reducing the number of aircraft to be procured and the annual production rate to more realistic levels would reduce the total program cost but would increase the unit recurring flyaway cost of the aircraft to about $53 million (fiscal year 1996 dollars). In a related report on the F/A-18E/F, we stated that the Navy\u2019s plan to procure the E/F appears to contradict the national military strategy, which cautions against making major new investments unless there is \u201csubstantial payoff.\u201d We pointed out that Navy data show both the C/D and E/F are expected to hit the same ground targets with the same weapons.", "Pursuing other alternatives, rather than proceeding with the F/A-18E/F program, would save billions of dollars. Continued procurement of the Navy\u2019s less expensive F/A-18C/D aircraft (the fiscal year 1996 unit recurring flyaway cost of F/A-18C/Ds is $28 million compared to $53 million for the F/A-18E/F) could be done only to the level needed to sustain inventories until the next generation strike fighter becomes available. Furthermore, reliance on the more affordable next generation strike fighter as the Navy\u2019s primary tactical aircraft would help keep that aircraft affordable by increasing the total buy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["Given the cost and the marginal improvements in operational capabilities that the F/A-18E/F would provide, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense reconsider the decision to produce the F/A-18E/F aircraft and, instead, consider procuring additional F/A-18C/Ds. The number of F/A-18C/Ds that the Navy would ultimately need to procure would depend upon when the next generation strike fighter achieves operational capability and the number of those aircraft the Navy decides to buy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In its comments on a draft of this report, DOD said that it is convinced that the fundamental reasons for developing the F/A-18E/F remain valid. Since DOD provided no data or information that we had not acquired and analyzed during our review, we have not changed our position that procuring the E/F is not the most cost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy\u2019s tactical aircraft fleet. We recognize that the E/F will provide some improvements over the C/D. However, the C/D\u2019s current capabilities are adequate to accomplish its assigned missions. Based on the marginal nature of the improvements and the E/F\u2019s projected cost compared to the alternatives discussed in this report, we believe that our recommendation that DOD reconsider its decision to produce the F/A-18E/F aircraft and, instead, consider procuring additional C/D aircraft until the next generation strike fighter becomes operationally available represents sound fiscal planning. We formulated our position within the context of current budget constraints, the decreased military threat environment, and statements by DOD officials, such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that DOD\u2019s current plans to upgrade its tactical aircraft fleet will not be affordable. Additionally, as we pointed out in our report, the national military strategy directs that major new investments should have substantial payoff. We do not believe that procuring the F/A-18E/F would meet this test.", "DOD\u2019s entire comments and our evaluation are included in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["DOD requested funding in its fiscal year 1997 budget request to begin procurement of the F/A-18E/F. The Congress may wish to direct that no funds may be obligated for procurement of the F/A-18E/F until it has fully examined the alternatives to the E/F program. In that regard, the House National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (H.R. 3230,  sec. 220) directed such an examination, and a DOD deep strike study is expected to be completed by the end of 1996. Delaying the authority to begin procuring the E/F would allow DOD to complete its study and time for the Congress to asses the results of the DOD study and the information in this report as it decides whether DOD should be provided funding to proceed with the F/A-18E/F program."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
