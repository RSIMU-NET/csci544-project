The average annual number of probationary and permanent federal employees from fiscal years 2014 to 2018 was approximately 1.9 million employees. Over this time frame, an average of approximately 2,800 employees\u2014about 0.15 percent\u2014filed complaints each year. Existing data were not sufficient to determine probationary status of employees for over 18 percent of each year's complaints. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether probationary employees file at lower, comparable, or higher rates than their prevalence in the overall employee population. Specifically, probationary employees represented about 13.5 percent, on average, of the federal workforce, and GAO estimates that they filed from 6.6 percent to 18.2 percent of complaints.", "GAO estimates suggest that both permanent and probationary employees who filed complaints were consistently terminated at higher rates than federal employees government-wide. For example, in fiscal year 2018, the termination rate for probationary employees government-wide was 1.1 percent, while the lowest estimated rate of termination among probationary employees who filed a complaint was 10.1 percent. For permanent employees, the overall termination rate was 0.3 percent, while the lowest estimated rate for filers was 2.9 percent.", "GAO estimates also suggest that probationary employees who filed complaints were terminated at higher rates than permanent employees who did the same. For example, in fiscal year 2018:", "The lowest estimated termination rate for probationary employees who filed whistleblower disclosures (10.1 percent) exceeded the maximum estimated rate for permanent employees who did the same (5.2 percent).", "The lowest estimated termination rate for probationary employees who filed retaliation complaints (17.4 percent) exceeded the maximum estimated rate for permanent employees who did the same (9.9 percent).", "The lowest estimated termination rate for probationary employees who filed both types (14.1 percent) exceeded the maximum estimated rate for permanent employees who did the same (13.2 percent).", "The Office of Special Counsel's (OSC) complaint form allows but does not require complainants to identify whether they are probationary or permanent employees when filing a whistleblower disclosure or retaliation complaint. OSC officials said they try to limit mandatory data fields to the information that is necessary for processing a case, and that they have no plans to do any analysis of employees in their probationary period who file claims. However, the higher rates of termination GAO found for filers generally, and probationary employees specifically, suggests that there could be a risk of unequal treatment. Without first identifying probationary employees who file whistleblower claims, OSC would lack complete data should it decide at some point to analyze the effect of probationary status on filers. Collecting and maintaining such data on every claimant would provide OSC or other entities the ability to analyze termination rates or other issues related to a whistleblower's probationary status."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OSC require claimants to identify their status as permanent or probationary employees.

Their willingness to come forward may also help  improve government operations. However, whistleblowers risk reprisals  from their agencies for their disclosures, including possible demotion,  reassignment, or termination. Federal laws are in place to help protect  federal employees from workplace retaliation for whistleblowing. The Civil  Service Reform Act of 1978 provided the first protections for  whistleblower disclosures and created the Office of Special Counsel  (OSC) to help protect federal whistleblowers.", "More recently, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of  2017 provided additional protections, applicable to most federal  employees who experience retaliation for disclosing waste, fraud, or  abuse in the federal government. The act is named in honor of Dr. Chris  Kirkpatrick, a whistleblower who questioned excessive prescription  practices at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Tomah,  Wisconsin. Dr. Kirkpatrick took his own life after being terminated from  that medical center. The act included a provision for us to examine  retaliation against whistleblowers who are in the probationary period of  their employment with the federal government.

We also used data from the Office of Special  Counsel\u2019s OSC 2000 database and data from the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI)  database to create a matching key to identify the probationary status of  employees who filed certain complaints with OSC.

We refer to that group as matched  employees. We refer to the 18 percent group we could not match as  unmatched employees. Because it is not possible to determine the  probationary status for unmatched complaints, the rates of filing among  matched complaints may not precisely reflect the overall rates for all  probationary employees. To account for this uncertainty, we estimated  minimum and maximum rates of filing for permanent and probationary  employees. Further, we calculated the number of instances in which  matched employees who filed either a whistleblower disclosure or a  retaliation complaint were terminated from federal employment. As we did  with filing rates, we also estimated minimum and maximum termination  rates to account for the uncertainty introduced by unmatched complaints.  While other indicators, such as transfers could represent a potential  retaliatory action, we focus on terminations because this is the most serious adverse action for which probationary employees have little  protection and because OSC officials indicated that cases with  terminations are prioritized.", "Importantly, we did not determine (1) whether the disclosures and  complaints filed had merit, (2) whether the termination actions were  justified, or (3) whether the termination actions were before or after the  filing of the whistleblower disclosure or retaliation complaint. Further, we  did not assess OSC\u2019s review of the filed disclosures and complaints.  Because our estimates do not consider these factors, they do not  represent proof of a causal relationship between filing and terminations,  but rather one indicator of potential risk.

We  assessed the reliability of the EHRI data by reviewing our past analyses  that used EHRI data, coordinating with OPM officials knowledgeable  about the data, and conducting electronic testing of EHRI to assess the  accuracy and completeness of the data used in our analyses. We  determined that OSC\u2019s data were sufficiently reliable to present the  number of complaints filed by type. With regard to probationary status,  the data were not available in OSC 2000. As a result, probationary status  and termination rates were drawn from EHRI, which we found to be  sufficiently reliable for this purpose.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to May 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Its  primary mission is to safeguard the merit system in federal employment  by protecting employees and applicants for federal employment from  prohibited personnel practices, especially reprisal for whistleblowing.  OSC reviews disclosures of wrongdoing within the federal government  from current federal employees, former employees, and applicants for  federal employment. These individuals, known as whistleblowers, make  disclosures of alleged wrongdoing to OSC that the employee reasonably  believes evidences either (1) a violation of law, rule, or regulation; (2)  gross mismanagement; (3) gross waste of funds; (4) abuse of authority;  (5) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; or (6)  censorship related to research, analysis, or technical information. If a  whistleblower believes his or her agency took, threatened to take, or did  not take a personnel action because of a protected disclosure, the  whistleblower may file a retaliation complaint with OSC. An employee  may file a retaliation complaint with OSC even if the protected disclosure  was made to another body such as an Inspector General\u2019s office rather  than OSC.", "Various statutory provisions have established protections for federal  employee whistleblowers over the years. The Civil Service Reform Act of  1978 provided the first statutory whistleblower protections for disclosures  of violations of laws, mismanagement, or gross waste of funds for federal  employees, former employees, and applicants for employment. The  1978 act established both the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)  and OSC and placed OSC within MSPB. Under the act, OSC was  authorized to review allegations of wrongdoing within federal agencies, to  investigate and obtain corrective action over allegations of prohibited  personnel practices, including whistleblower retaliation, and to initiate  disciplinary actions against employees who commit prohibited personnel  practices, among other things.", "Later, to strengthen protections for those who claim whistleblower  retaliation, Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.  The 1989 act separated OSC from MSPB, making OSC an independent  agency. The act also created the individual right of action, allowing  whistleblowers to bring their appeals to MSPB after exhausting remedies  at OSC. In 2012, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act clarified  the scope of protected whistleblowing under the Whistleblower Protection  Act and mandated broader outreach to inform federal employees of their  whistleblower rights, among other things. Further, the Dr. Chris  Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, among other items,  enhanced disciplinary penalties for supervisors who retaliate against  whistleblowers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Probationary Status Employees", "paragraphs": ["Federal employees in the civil service are required to serve a period of  probation when they begin serving initial appointments. These periods are  typically for 1 to 2 years, and they allow an agency to evaluate the  employee before the appointment becomes final. Our prior work notes  that the probationary period provides a way for agencies to dismiss poorly  performing employees or those engaging in misconduct before the  process to do so becomes more complex and lengthy. In particular, we  concluded that the probationary period could be more effectively used by  agencies, which in turn could help agencies deal with poor performers  more effectively. According to MSPB, the probationary period, if used  fully, is one of the most helpful assessment tools available for supervisors  to determine an individual\u2019s potential to fulfill the requirements of the  specific position.", "During the probationary period, the employee is still technically  considered an applicant for employment. As such, probationary  employees do not have the same protections against adverse personnel  actions as other employees. Prior to firing a probationary employee for  poor job performance or misconduct, an agency does not need to afford  the same procedural protections required before removing a non- probationary employee. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that  probationary employees will be terminated at higher rates than permanent  employees. Probationary employees also lack the same rights to appeal  adverse actions, such as demotions or removals, to the MSPB that other  federal employees have.", "However, probationary employees do have some legal protections. For  example, probationary employees may file a complaint with OSC if they  believe a personnel action such as reassignment, demotion, or removal  was retaliation for whistleblowing. If OSC determines there are  reasonable grounds to believe that retaliation has occurred, it may seek  corrective action, including filing a petition with the MSPB. Additionally, a  probationary employee who has filed a complaint with OSC may  subsequently file an individual right of action with MSPB.", "Probationary employees also may appeal to MSPB if they believe they  have been fired for partisan political reasons or because of discrimination  based on their marital status. Probationary employees also have the  right to file a complaint of discrimination with their agencies and  subsequently file an appeal of a final agency decision with the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission or a civil action in federal district  court if they believe that they have been discriminated against based on  their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic  information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Existing Data are Insufficient to Determine if the Rate of Filing Whistleblower Disclosures or Retaliation Complaints Varies by Probationary Status", "paragraphs": ["The average annual total of probationary and permanent federal  employees from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 was approximately 1.9  million.

If that was not sufficient, we attempted to match using  variables such as state, job series, and employee work email address.  We matched OSC 2000 data to EHRI data using case data from OSC  2000 and federal probationary status as of the end of the fiscal year date  from EHRI. We acknowledge that matching using these dates may not be  precise, but because we present our results in ranges, we do not believe  a more precise matching of dates would have resulted in substantive  differences in the results overall.", "We matched 82 percent of the complaints in OSC 2000 to employees in  EHRI. . Because it is not possible to determine the probationary status for  unmatched cases, the rates of filing among matched cases may not  precisely reflect the overall rates for all probationary employees. To  account for this uncertainty, we estimated minimum and maximum rates  of filing for permanent and probationary employees, and present these  ranges in addition to the specific matched rates. Further, we calculated  the number of instances in which matched employees who filed either a  whistleblower disclosure or a retaliation complaint were terminated from  federal employment. As we did with filing rates, we also estimated  minimum and maximum termination rates to account for the uncertainty  introduced by unmatched cases. Terminations were used because they  represent adverse consequences for employees which could indicate  retaliation. While other indicators, such as transfers could represent a  potential retaliatory action, we focus on terminations because this is the  most serious adverse action for which probationary employees have the  little protection, and because OSC officials indicated that complaints with  termination are prioritized. We did not determine (1) whether the  disclosures or complaints had merit, (2) whether the termination actions  were justified, or (3) whether the termination actions were before or after  the filing of the whistleblower disclosure or retaliation complaint. Because  these estimates do not consider the timing or merit of terminations, or  other factors potentially associated with terminations, they do not  represent proof of a causal relationship between filing and terminations,  but rather one indicator of potential risk.", "To produce reasonably conservative estimates, we made certain  assumptions in estimating the minimum and maximum rates in our  ranges. Specifically, for unmatched cases we assumed that unknown  characteristics, including probationary status and termination rate could  be as much as 3.5 times their observed rate in known data. We believe  these assumptions are reasonably conservative. While it is not impossible  for this small group of unmatched complaints to be even more skewed,  there is no evidence to suggest such an extreme assumption would be  warranted.", "We assessed the reliability of the OSC 2000 and EHRI databases for the  purposes of using limited data from these databases for our own analysis.", "We reviewed agency documents, electronically tested data for missing  data and outliers, and submitted questions to agency officials about these  databases. These two databases are the only sources of data that can be  compared to determine the probationary status of individuals filing  complaints with OSC. We determined that OSC\u2019s data were sufficiently  reliable to present the number of complaints filed by type. With regard to  probationary status, the data were not available in OSC 2000. As a result,  probationary status and termination rates were drawn from EHRI, which  we found to be sufficiently reliable for this purpose.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to May 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
