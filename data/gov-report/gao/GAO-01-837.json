FEMA uses established criteria to determine whether to (1) recommend that the President declare a disaster and (2) once a disaster has been declared, approve and fund Public Assistance projects. In 1999, FEMA published formal criteria for recommending the presidential approval of disaster declarations. These criteria include both minimum financial thresholds and other qualitative measures that FEMA applies in deciding whether to recommend presidential approval. These criteria do not necessarily indicate a state's ability to pay for the damage because they do not consider the substantial differences in states' financial capacities to respond when disasters occur. As a result, federal funds may be provided for some disasters when they are not needed. Problems with applying FEMA's criteria remain. In part, these problems may persist because many of the staff assigned to disaster field offices who make eligibility decisions are temporary and may not have the skills and training needed to make appropriate decisions. FEMA has developed a credentialing program to establish qualifications and training requirements for these staff but has not implemented this program. FEMA officials said that budgetary and programmatic factors have delayed implementation. In addition, FEMA's review process does not ensure that all projects are reviewed by the most knowledgeable officials. FEMA also lacks centralized, quantified information that would be helpful for managing the Public Assistance program. Its information system--essentially an electronic filing cabinet--stores information project by project and does not provide effectively for programwide analysis. Furthermore, the system is unreliable and difficult to use, according to FEMA officials. As a result, data are lost or never entered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1990, FEMA has expended over $27 billion in disaster assistance, over half of which was spent for Public Assistance projects such as repairs of roads, government buildings, utilities, and hospitals damaged in declared disasters.

However, over the past decade, the President, the Congress, FEMA\u2019s Inspector General, and GAO have expressed concerns over the adequacy and application of these criteria. As the President noted in his fiscal year 2002 budget proposal, the lack of clear and meaningful criteria for recommending disaster declarations puts FEMA at risk of providing federal funds to some states that do not need assistance, while ignoring the legitimate needs of others.", "This Committee asked us to review FEMA\u2019s processes for recommending a disaster declaration and for ensuring that only eligible Public Assistance projects are funded.", "As agreed with your offices, this report assesses (1) the adequacy of the current criteria used to determine whether a disaster exceeds state or local capability to respond effectively and a presidential disaster declaration should therefore be recommended and (2) the progress FEMA has made in ensuring that only eligible projects within a declared disaster area are funded. FEMA provides disaster assistance grants through its Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Individual Assistance programs. This report focuses on the Public Assistance program because it provides the most funding for disaster assistance. To assess the adequacy of the criteria FEMA uses to recommend a presidential disaster declaration, we analyzed available data on damage estimates to determine whether disasters met the statewide financial criteria for recommending a disaster declaration and estimated how the use of other financial measures of state fiscal capacity would affect declaration recommendations. We also examined applicable laws, regulations, and past reports by GAO, FEMA\u2019s Inspector General, and others. To determine whether FEMA\u2019s procedures ensure that projects meet eligibility requirements, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed relevant documentation and data from the agency\u2019s National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). Our scope and methodology are described further starting on page 23 of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the last several years, the Congress has expressed concern over the number and costs of disaster declarations. GAO has also identified the cost of disaster assistance as one of FEMA\u2019s major management challenges.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act), as amended, establishes the process for states to request a presidential disaster declaration. The Stafford Act requires that \u201crequests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster or emergency exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected state.\u201d As part of the request to the President, a governor must affirm that the state\u2019s emergency plan has been implemented and the situation is of \u201csuch severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and the affected local governments and that Federal assistance is necessary.\u201d", "Before a governor asks for disaster assistance, federal, state, and local officials normally conduct a joint preliminary damage assessment. FEMA is responsible for recommending to the President whether to declare a disaster and trigger the availability of funds as provided for in the Stafford Act. FEMA uses the damage assessment data in preparing its recommendation to the President. When an obviously severe or catastrophic event occurs, a disaster may be declared before the preliminary damage assessment is completed.", "In response to a governor\u2019s request, the President may declare that a major disaster or emergency exists. This declaration activates numerous assistance programs from FEMA and may also trigger programs operated by other federal agencies, such as the Departments of Agriculture and Labor, the Federal Highway Administration, the Small Business Administration, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to assist a state in its response and recovery efforts. The federal disaster assistance provided under a major disaster declaration has no dollar limit. FEMA provides assistance through one or more of the following grant programs:   Public Assistance provides aid to state government agencies; local governments; Indian tribes, authorized tribal organizations, and Alaskan Native villages; and private nonprofit organizations or institutions that provide certain services otherwise performed by a government agency. Assistance is provided for projects such as debris removal, emergency protective measures to preserve life and property, and repair and replacement of damaged structures, such as buildings, utilities, roads and bridges, recreational facilities, and water-control facilities (e.g., dikes and levees). Individual Assistance provides for the necessary expenses and serious needs of disaster victims that cannot be met through insurance or low- interest Small Business Administration loans. FEMA provides temporary housing assistance to individuals whose homes are unlivable because of a disaster. Other available services include crisis counseling to help relieve any grieving, stress, or mental health problems caused or aggravated by the disaster or its aftermath. FEMA provides unemployment compensation and can cover a percentage of the medical, dental, and funeral expenses that are incurred as a result of a disaster.", "The Hazard Mitigation Program provides additional funding (currently up to 15 percent of total federal aid for recovery from the disaster) to states to assist communities in implementing long-term measures to help reduce the potential risk of future damages to facilities.", "Figure 2 shows the obligations for each of these three general programs for fiscal years 1991 through 2000. As this figure indicates, the Public Assistance program is the largest of the three grant categories, in terms of dollars expended.", "Not all programs are activated for every disaster. The determination to activate a program is based on the needs identified during the joint preliminary damage assessment. For instance, some declarations may provide only Individual Assistance grants and others only Public Assistance grants. Hazard Mitigation grants, on the other hand, are available for most declarations.", "In addition to its central role in recommending to the President whether to declare a disaster, FEMA has primary responsibility for coordinating the federal response when a disaster is declared. Typically, this response consists of providing grants to assist state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations to alleviate the damage resulting from such disasters. Once a federal disaster is declared, FEMA usually establishes a field office at or near the disaster site. This office is generally staffed with a crew of permanent, full-time FEMA employees; a cadre of temporary reserve staff, also referred to as disaster assistance employees; and the state\u2019s emergency management personnel. Damage estimates for each project, known as project worksheets, can be prepared either by FEMA staff or by personnel from applicants, such as state agencies, communities and certain nonprofit organizations. Full-time FEMA staff then review these project worksheets for final approval.", "To facilitate their review, approval, and funding, projects are divided into two groups. Projects are considered small if their estimated cost does not exceed $50,600. If a FEMA employee or state representative prepares a worksheet for a small project and it passes all appropriate reviews, it is funded according to its estimated costs. However, if an applicant prepares a project worksheet, FEMA or state officials may verify the accuracy of the claims by validating the project\u2019s cost and eligibility. Typically, officials validate a sample of an applicant\u2019s small projects before approving the funding for them. Large disaster projects, whose estimated costs exceed $50,600, are funded incrementally as work on each phase is completed. In all cases, the states, as the grantees, are responsible for disbursing FEMA funds to the applicants and for certifying that all costs were appropriate and that work on the project was completed in accordance with the approved project estimates.", "The Stafford Act sets the federal share for the Public Assistance program at no less than 75 percent of eligible costs of a disaster. The President can increase the federal share for the Public Assistance program if it is determined that the disaster costs greatly exceed a state\u2019s financial capabilities. The federal share can sometimes reach 100 percent for emergency work, for limited periods, if it is deemed necessary to prevent further damage, protect human lives, or both. FEMA officials indicated they are reluctant to recommend a 100-percent federal share for projects because this percentage provides no incentives for the states to control costs.", "To better use disaster resources and devolve major management responsibility for the Public Assistance program to the states, the Director of FEMA implemented a pilot project in 2000 to allow those states that have the capability to do so to manage the Public Assistance segment of their own small disasters. Under this Public Assistance pilot project, the states and affected communities make all project eligibility determinations and ensure that all disaster projects comply with current codes and standards, as well as with federal laws, regulations, and FEMA policies. To participate in this pilot project, a state must, in FEMA\u2019s view, be capable of managing its own disaster recovery program, have a sound financial accounting system to track disaster projects, and enter into an operational agreement with FEMA that defines its roles and responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criteria for Assessing State and Local Response Capability Do Not Adequately Reflect Capacity", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, FEMA published its criteria for evaluating a governor\u2019s request for a disaster declaration.

Any or all of these, as well as \u201cother relevant information,\u201d can be used to determine whether a disaster declaration should be recommended under the Public Assistance program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Financial Thresholds Are Poor Proxies for a State\u2019s Fiscal Capacity", "paragraphs": ["FEMA\u2019s explicit financial thresholds are less accurate measures of a state\u2019s true ability to respond effectively to a disaster than other available financial measures. In responding to congressional interest in more objective disaster declaration criteria, FEMA set two financial thresholds to be considered in evaluating when a disaster has exceeded a state\u2019s capacity to respond without federal assistance. First, it estimates the per- capita impact of the disaster damages in the state through the preliminary damage assessment process. In 1999, FEMA set a figure of $1.00 per capita as a critical threshold that might warrant federal assistance. This figure, which is currently $1.04, is adjusted annually for inflation. Secondly, it set a $1 million threshold for statewide Public Assistance damages. This threshold, however, is not adjusted for inflation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Development of the Per-Capita Criterion", "paragraphs": ["In 1986, FEMA proposed the $1.00-per-capita threshold as a means of gauging state fiscal capacity. The measure was based on the 1983 per- capita personal income nationwide, then estimated at $11,667. FEMA thought it reasonable \u201cthat a State would be capable of providing $1.00 for each resident of that State to cover the costs of State efforts to alleviate the damage which results from a disaster situation,\u201d inasmuch as this amount was roughly equivalent to 0.1 percent of estimated General Fund expenditures by states. FEMA proposed to adjust this figure each year by the ratio of each state\u2019s personal income to the nationwide average, thus making it more sensitive to interstate differences over time. This proposal met with opposition from state and local officials and resulted in a provision in the Stafford Act that prohibited denying federal disaster assistance \u201csolely by virtue of an arithmetic formula or sliding scale based on income or population.\u201d Nevertheless, the unadjusted $1.00-per-capita threshold continued to be used informally as part of FEMA\u2019s preliminary damage assessment efforts.", "In 1998, FEMA submitted a concept paper for consideration by state emergency managers. In the paper, the agency recommended that the per- capita threshold be set at $1.51. This figure accounted for inflation since 1986, but was no longer linked to average state tax expenditures as the 1986 threshold had been. In response to comments from state emergency management officials, FEMA used the $1.00-per-capita threshold when it published its formal criteria in 1999. It further provided that adjustments based on annual inflation be made and applied uniformly to states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measures of State Capability", "paragraphs": ["A state\u2019s capacity to respond to a disaster using state resources depends on several factors, the most important of which is perhaps the underlying strength of the state\u2019s tax base and whether that base is expanding or in decline. A state\u2019s tax base represents the resource base against which it can draw to fund its public services needs, including the necessary repairs that arise in the wake of a disaster. An expanding economy also provides more potential revenues than one that is flat or in decline.", "A readily available indicator of states\u2019 funding capacities and one commonly used in many formula grant programs is state per-capita personal income. Per-capita income provides a quantitative measure of income received by state residents. As such it provides a reasonable starting point for gauging a state\u2019s capacity to bear the burden of making the necessary repairs in the aftermath of a major disaster. Per-capita personal income is commonly used in federal grant programs as a basis for sharing program costs between states and the federal government.", "Better measures of a state\u2019s fiscal capacity, however, exist. Per-capita personal income, while providing a reasonable indication of state funding capacity, has a number of defects as well. In the past, we have found per- capita income to be a relatively poor indicator of a state\u2019s fiscal capacity because it does not comprehensively measure income potentially subject to state taxation. For example, it does not include income produced in a state unless it is received as income by a state resident. Thus, profits retained by corporations for business investment, though potentially subject to state taxation, are not included in a state per-capita income measure because they do not represent income received by state residents. We have previously reported that Total Taxable Resources (TTR), a measure developed by the U. S. Department of the Treasury, is a better measure of state funding capacity in that it provides a more comprehensive measure of the resources that are potentially subject to state taxation. For example, TTR includes much of the business income that does not become part of the income flow to state residents, undistributed corporate profits, and rents and interest payments made by businesses to out-of-state stock owners. This more comprehensive indicator of state funding capacity is currently used to target federal aid to low-capacity states under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration\u2019s block grant programs. In the case of FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program, adjustments for TTR in setting the threshold for a disaster declaration would result in a more realistic estimate of a state\u2019s ability to respond to a disaster. If, instead of setting a uniform $1.00-per- capita threshold, FEMA had set the average threshold at $1.00 but allowed it to vary according to state TTR estimates, the Tennessee threshold, for example, would have been $0.88 in 1998, while Washington State\u2019s would have been $1.05 per capita.", "TTR also has the advantage of providing a more sensitive adjustment for growth over time in a state\u2019s fiscal capacity than does adjustment for inflation based on personal income. For example, TTR in the United States is estimated to have grown from $4.4 trillion in 1986 to $9.9 trillion in 1998. If the $1.00-per-capita threshold proposed in 1986 had been adjusted at this rate in 1998, the financial threshold would have been $2.24 per capita (rather than the $1.51 inflation-adjusted figure proposed by FEMA and the $1.04 threshold currently in effect). Furthermore, since TTR provides estimates of each state\u2019s fiscal capacity, adjustments for TTR growth would vary by state. For example, if adjusted for the TTR growth rates from 1986 to 1998, the financial threshold for disaster declarations in Tennessee would be $2.35 per capita, and in Washington State would be $2.65 per capita.", "We believe that implementing TTR would not be a violation of the statutory prohibition against basing aid solely on an arithmetic formula or sliding scale based on income or population. Rather, TTR provides a more refined measure of a state\u2019s capacity to respond to a disaster than FEMA\u2019s existing $1.04-per-capita measure. It is our expectation that FEMA would continue to take into account several criteria in deciding, for any given incident, whether to recommend a disaster declaration to the President. When FEMA published its declaration criteria in 1999, it maintained that the $1.00-per-capita measure was not a violation of the statutory prohibition because the agency examines all the other listed criteria when it decides whether to recommend a disaster declaration. We agree and believe that the use of TTR or some other more sensitive measure in place of the per-capita measure, together with other criteria such as those identified in the regulations, would be consistent with the statute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statewide Damage Criterion", "paragraphs": ["In its 1999 regulations, FEMA established a second quantitative measure of a state\u2019s ability to respond to disasters. The agency set a $1 million statewide damage criterion as an indicator that disaster damages might require federal assistance. As a rationale for setting this threshold, FEMA cited its \u201cbelief that we can reasonably expect even the lowest population states to cover this level of public assistance damage.\u201d In effect, this criterion set the per-capita threshold at greater than $1.00 for those seven states with populations under 1 million. FEMA also made no provisions to adjust this threshold for future inflation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Other Qualitative Criteria and Their Impact on Decisions", "paragraphs": ["In its 1999 regulations, FEMA identified five other factors that it considers in evaluating a governor\u2019s request for a Public Assistance disaster declaration:   Localized impacts. FEMA considers the extent to which damages are concentrated heavily at the county or local government level even if the statewide per-capita criterion is not met. According to FEMA, this consideration is particularly relevant where critical facilities are involved or where localized per-capita damages might be \u201cextremely high.\u201d FEMA offers no specific threshold for localized per-capita impact but remarks that the agency has seen damages \u201cin the tens or even hundreds of dollars per capita\u201d in situations where the statewide per-capita threshold was not met.", "Insurance coverage in force. FEMA reduces the grant by the amount of insurance coverage that \u201cis in force or should have been in force as required by law or regulation\u201d when the disaster occurred. As discussed in appendix I, insurance coverage for Public Assistance grants is currently only a postdisaster condition of receiving a grant; that is, if grant recipients do not currently have insurance, they must agree to procure it as a condition of receiving federal assistance. FEMA is now attempting to define a minimum level of insurance coverage that would be reasonable to require public entities to maintain in order to be eligible for public assistance. The issue is still under review.", "Hazard mitigation. FEMA attempts to encourage mitigation efforts to avert or reduce damages from future disasters by explicitly considering previous mitigation efforts that may have reduced the damages from the current disaster. FEMA suggests that a state that has made such efforts in the past is more likely to receive disaster assistance when the estimated Public Assistance damages fall below the per-capita criterion.", "Recent multiple disasters. In evaluating a governor\u2019s request for assistance, FEMA also considers the cumulative impact that disasters in the previous 12 months may have had on the state\u2019s or locality\u2019s ability to respond effectively. FEMA includes both Stafford Act and state-declared disasters and the extent to which the state has spent its own funds.", "Other federal assistance programs. FEMA also considers other federal sources of disaster relief that might more appropriately meet the needs created by the disaster. Disaster relief in various forms is also available under the programs of a number of federal agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Small Business Administration.", "A disaster declaration can be recommended on the basis of any of these criteria, as well as of \u201cother relevant,\u201d but unspecified, information.", "We analyzed the 79 major presidential disaster declarations that were issued in the 2 years since FEMA published its revised regulations and in which Public Assistance grants were made available. Sixty of those disaster declarations\u2014about 76 percent\u2014met the statewide per-capita dollar thresholds for a presidential disaster declaration; in all but four cases the damages were estimated to be greater than $1 million.However, some disasters were declared when the per-capita damage was substantially less than $1. In one case, FEMA cited significant localized impact as the reason for recommending a disaster declaration when the preliminary estimates indicated a statewide per-capita cost of $0.17. In another case, the state had incurred damages amounting to $0.12 per capita, but the declaration was based on the occurrence of several earlier disasters. These declarations may well have been justified in the circumstances peculiar to these disasters and consistent with existing regulations. However, they illustrate the latitude afforded FEMA by its subjective and nonspecific criteria for determining whether an effective response to a disaster is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments.", "Our finding that 76 percent of disasters declared in 1999 and 2000 met the $1.00 per-capita criterion may reflect some improvement over the earlier findings of FEMA\u2019s Inspector General. (See app. I.) In 1999 the Inspector General reported that only 60 percent of disasters from 1988 through 1998 met this criterion. This change may be attributable to FEMA\u2019s 1999 publication of formal declaration criteria. However, because disasters are extremely variable in their occurrence and severity and our available sample was restricted to a 2-year period, such attribution may be premature."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Developed Criteria to Better Ensure Project Eligibility, but Some Implementation Problems Remain", "paragraphs": ["Our May 1996 report on FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program identified many weaknesses and made several recommendations to strengthen the program, especially its processes for determining project eligibility. In addition, FEMA\u2019s Office of Inspector General noted weaknesses in FEMA\u2019s ability to establish project eligibility. Those reports also noted that, in addition to having accurate, useful, and readily available policies and procedures, FEMA employees\u2014especially temporary employees\u2014should receive training in the appropriate application of the latest policies and information systems. To address these problems, FEMA redesigned the Public Assistance program and implemented the changes in October 1998. As part of this redesign, FEMA developed and disseminated numerous regulations, policies, procedures, user manuals, and guides. FEMA also developed a new training curriculum for its permanent and temporary staff.", "While there is evidence that staff regularly use the new policies and procedures, some eligibility problems persist. These may in part be due to the lack of a formal credentialing mechanism to ensure that staff authorized to review and approve Public Assistance projects or obligate federal funds have received adequate training.

Our report also stated that the criteria had not been systematically updated and disseminated and that some decisions were unofficial and unwritten. We concluded that clearer criteria were essential because FEMA relies on temporary personnel with limited training to prepare its project worksheets. Furthermore, as the magnitude of disaster damage increased, it was more likely that FEMA would have to call on additional, possibly less thoroughly trained, temporary employees, who were likely to be less familiar with the eligibility rules and regulations.", "When FEMA redesigned its Public Assistance program, it addressed the identified shortcomings by revising or developing its program guidance, which included policies, standard operating procedures, handbooks, guides, digests, and fact sheets. FEMA has developed or revised Public Assistance policies in 35 areas or topics since the program\u2019s redesign in 1998. The new and revised publications were distributed to FEMA\u2019s regional offices to make them available to the personnel staffing disaster field offices.

For example, some of the costs for disaster projects were found to be already covered by a private or government insurance policy or the costs were covered under programs managed by other federal agencies, such as the Federal Highway Administration.

Agency officials told us that this measure does not capture the informal training that disaster staff receive in briefings, refresher courses, and condensed courses while at the disaster field office.

According to staff at 9 of FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices, about 50 percent of the state emergency management offices do not regularly submit their required quarterly reports on the certification of large projects. Most of them report that their heavy workload and/or lack of resources preclude them from certifying the completion of large projects promptly.

To help FEMA management achieve its program performance goals, NEMIS should have sound internal management controls. However, we found instances in which the system\u2019s activity, application and quality controls are limited. Although NEMIS collects and can provide information project by project, it provides only limited data for effective programwide analyses. In addition, the system does not automatically verify certain information that has been entered, and it can be unreliable, time-consuming, and difficult to use in a remote disaster environment, according to FEMA officials. Project data may be lost or not entered as a result. Finally, FEMA\u2019s reliance on temporary staff who may lack experience with the system or training in its use threatens the quality of the information it contains.", "NEMIS is an agencywide system of hardware, software, telecommunications, and applications. It is designed to provide a new technology base to FEMA and its partners to carry out emergency management efforts. Its purpose is to support disaster staff in the field and to maximize the distribution of project worksheet information to Public Assistance grant applicants and regional office staff. According to FEMA officials, NEMIS allows concurrent and remote reviews of project worksheets that are developed in the field, thus improving their timeliness and quality. It also provides a single source of all project information that is useful for any necessary subsequent review.", "However, while NEMIS can provide information on a project-by-project basis, it is severely limited in its ability to provide higher-level information that will help FEMA management to review the agency\u2019s performance against measures and indicators for the Public Assistance program. FEMA officials informed us that field staff must enter all modifications to project worksheets-\u2013including changes to project cost estimates\u2014by entering them into a narrative field. As a result, it would be difficult for FEMA management to perform automated analyses of summary information in order to track the programwide costs of project modifications or assess the impact of revised Public Assistance policies.", "In addition, while the Public Assistance function of NEMIS has been upgraded since the system was implemented in August 1998, system problems still cause delays and inaccuracies in entering project information. Our review of FEMA\u2019s internal evaluations of disaster field office operations found many complaints from federal and state disaster personnel that the system is difficult to use or often is not working at all. As a result, data are not entered promptly or may not be entered at all. The Public Assistance portion of NEMIS also lacks common verification processes. For example, dates of key activities and reviews can be entered incorrectly because the system lacks automated error-checking processes to validate entries. Finally, because many field office staff are not trained to use NEMIS, information for the same disaster could be inconsistently entered from site to site and person to person. The potential for inconsistency impedes FEMA\u2019s ability to have an accurate overview of its Public Assistance processes, performance, and field staff\u2019s efforts.

However, they are not necessarily indicative of state or local capability to respond effectively to a disaster without federal assistance. For this reason, we recommend that the Director of FEMA develop more objective and specific criteria to assess the capabilities of state and local governments to respond to a disaster. Specifically, the Director should consider replacing the per-capita measure of state capability with a more sensitive measure, such as a state\u2019s total taxable resources. The Director should further consider whether a more sensitive measure would eliminate the need for a statewide $1 million threshold. At a minimum, the Director should consider adjusting the threshold for inflation and providing a more detailed rationale for whatever threshold is chosen.", "While FEMA has clarified its criteria for individual project eligibility, it still experiences problems with the application of the criteria. Given the magnitude of the funds involved, we recommend that the Director of FEMA do the following:   Develop internal control processes for ensuring appropriate reviews of disaster project worksheets\u2014especially when specialists\u2019 reviews are required\u2014to ensure that proposed projects meet eligibility requirements before receiving final approval and funding.", "Reconsider budgetary priorities to determine if a higher priority should be assigned to implementing a credentialing and training program for federal disaster staff that focuses on the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for each of the various roles involved in disaster management.", "Establish a plan to identify recurring problems identified by internal and external audits and take appropriate actions to minimize their recurrence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided FEMA with a draft of this report for its review and comment.

We believe, however, that FEMA should consider giving higher priority to implementing a credentialing program such as the one the agency has designed. The program would establish both training and experience requirements appropriate for federal disaster staff in all job positions.", "Finally, FEMA responded to our assessment of the availability of FEMA eligibility review processes and procedures, stating that formal approval procedures exist for projects with special considerations.

In addition, we analyzed available data on damage estimates to identify any minimum criteria that might have been used to recommend a disaster declaration. We also analyzed available data on damage estimates to determine whether disasters met statewide financial criteria for recommending a disaster declaration. We did not, however, perform independent assessments of the degree to which individual disasters met other qualitative criteria, such as significant localized impact or a recent history of multiple disasters.", "To determine whether FEMA ensures that proposed Public Assistance projects meet eligibility criteria, we (1) reviewed FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program policies, procedures, and guidance; (2) assessed the extent to which the program\u2019s policies and procedures were disseminated and made available to staff that make eligibility determinations; (3) analyzed the availability of the training provided to staff; and (4) reviewed files on selected projects and interviewed managers and staff to assess how effectively the program\u2019s policies and procedures were used to determine eligibility. We also reviewed FEMA\u2019s internal controls and oversight processes to determine whether they provided adequate assurance that disaster funds were consistently used in an effective and efficient manner. For instance, we (1) looked for any oversight or reviews to verify that project worksheets prepared for proposed projects complied with policy; (2) reviewed the timeliness and adequacy of efforts to validate and certify completed projects and (3) assessed FEMA\u2019s efforts to identify recurring systemic problems and take corrective actions to minimize them in future disasters.

FEMA responded, in September 1993, that a reliable cost/benefit analysis of the disaster declaration process would not be possible. In addition, the Vice President\u2019s National Performance Review noted that FEMA needed to develop objective indicators of what constituted a major disaster. The National Performance Review further noted that those indicators should account for both the costs of the disaster and a state\u2019s ability to meet those costs.", "The Senate Bipartisan Task Force on Funding Disaster Relief, established by Public Law 103-211, noted in its report that one approach to modifying federal disaster assistance and possibly reducing federal disaster assistance costs would be to establish \u201cmore explicit and/or stringent criteria for providing Federal disaster assistance.\u201d That report also cited a 1994 FEMA Office of Inspector General report stating that (1) neither a governor\u2019s findings nor FEMA\u2019s analysis of capability were supported by standard factual data or related to published criteria and (2) FEMA\u2019s process did not ensure equity in disaster decisions because the agency did not always review requests for declarations in the context of previous declarations.", "In September 1995, we reported that although the Stafford Act did not specify criteria for evaluating a governor\u2019s request for a declaration, FEMA used an informal process that generally considered various factors in making a recommendation to the President. Some of the factors FEMA considered were the number of homes that were destroyed or sustained major damage, the extent to which the damage was concentrated or dispersed, the total estimated cost to repair the damage, the extent to which the damage was covered by insurance, the level of assistance available from other federal agencies, the state and local governments\u2019 abilities to deal with disasters, the level of assistance available from voluntary organizations, the extent of health and safety problems, and the extent of damage to facilities providing essential services (e.g., medical and police services and utilities).", "The Senate Appropriations Committee remarked on the lack of specific disaster declaration criteria in its report on FEMA\u2019s appropriations for fiscal year 1999. In that report, the Committee directed FEMA to make several administrative changes to reduce disaster relief costs, including the development of specific disaster declaration criteria.", "To develop specific declaration criteria, FEMA formed a working group with the National Emergency Management Association. However, FEMA faced a legislative restriction precluding any geographic area from receiving assistance \u201csolely by virtue of an arithmetic formula or sliding scale based on income or population.\u201d This working group developed several indicators for evaluating governors\u2019 requests for disaster declarations and issued these indicators as a concept paper in September 1998. On January 26, 1999, FEMA published the proposed declaration criteria in the Federal Register. Those proposed rules were similar to the indicators FEMA had used informally.", "At the request of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, FEMA\u2019s Office of Inspector General reviewed the proposed regulations and issued a report in March 1999. The report questioned FEMA\u2019s use of a fixed per- capita figure as a means to determine a state\u2019s capability and noted that, without the means to measure this capability, FEMA\u2019s ability to determine whether disaster assistance was warranted was \u201champered if not negated altogether.\u201d The report recommended that FEMA use total taxable resources in place of its per-capita cost measure to better reflect the state\u2019s economic health and ability to raise public revenues to cover the costs of a disaster. Additionally, the report identified numerous ways to improve the proposed declaration regulations, including   publishing a county-level per-capita measure that could be used as an indicator to better establish the disaster\u2019s localized impact;   specifying how FEMA intended to determine the amount of insurance coverage and the source(s) of its information, as well as clarifying how insurance deductibles would be measured;   citing the criteria that would be used when considering state and local mitigation measures to evaluate the need for assistance, including record- keeping requirements to support states\u2019 claims; and   prescribing a limit on the impact of multiple past disasters, including further defining what other events and emergencies could be included or excluded from FEMA\u2019s declaration evaluation, as well as establishing state record-keeping requirements.", "The Inspector General\u2019s report further noted that a significant number of disasters were declared, even though the estimated costs of disaster damage fell below the statewide financial thresholds historically used by FEMA. Specifically, the report stated it examined 192 declarations for the 10-year period from October 1988 through September 1998 and found that 40 percent were declared even though the state per-capita damage figure had not met FEMA\u2019s statewide financial threshold of $1 per capita of damages. The report also identified the following as most common factors for recommending a declaration when the disaster cost estimates were below the minimum financial criteria. These included   Special populations (e.g., poor, elderly) lived in affected areas.   Preliminary damage assessments were ongoing, and the cost estimates were not yet complete.", "The disaster had a heavy localized impact.", "The state had no assistance program.", "Despite the Inspector General\u2019s report and other criticisms, FEMA published its final rule on September 1, 1999.

In July 1999, FEMA submitted draft regulations to the Office of Management and Budget proposing that, under the Public Assistance program, grant funding for buildings damaged in a disaster be made available only to state and local agencies and other public entities that maintain specified minimum levels of insurance coverage. Currently, the Public Assistance program requires insurance coverage only as a postdisaster condition. If a public facility is not insured when a disaster strikes, the responsible agency must agree to procure insurance against future disasters as a condition for receiving FEMA assistance.
