For example, the Department of Energy (DOE) has conducted two criticality assessments on materials important to clean energy applications and manages the Critical Materials Institute\u2014a 5-year, $120 million investment aimed at mitigating risks by diversifying supply, providing alternatives to existing materials, and improving recycling and reuse. In addition, agencies conduct a range of other critical materials related activities, including stockpiling or producing materials, and reviewing and approving resource extraction projects, among other efforts.", "The federal approach to addressing critical materials supply has areas of strength but is not consistent with selected key practices for interagency collaboration and faces other limitations, as shown below.", "According to its charter, the Subcommittee on Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chains (Subcommittee)\u2014co-chaired by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), DOE, and the Department of the Interior\u2014is to facilitate a strong, coordinated effort across its member agencies on critical materials activities. However, the Subcommittee's efforts have not been consistent with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, including agreeing on roles and responsibilities; establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies; and developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results. For example, some member agencies do not have a clear role in the Subcommittee's efforts and have had limited or no involvement in its work. By taking steps to actively engage all member agencies in its efforts and clearly define roles and responsibilities, the Subcommittee would have more reasonable assurance that it can effectively marshal the potential contributions of all member agencies to help identify and mitigate critical materials supply risks.", "Other limitations to the federal approach to addressing critical materials supply include limited engagement with industry and a limited focus on domestic production. For example, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) is required by law to identify and assess cases of materials needs. However, Commerce does not solicit information from stakeholders across a range of industrial sectors. As a result, Commerce may not have comprehensive, current information across a range of industrial sectors to help it identify and assess materials needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that OSTP take steps to improve interagency collaboration by, for example, defining Subcommittee member roles and responsibilities and that Commerce engage with stakeholders to continually identify and assess critical materials needs across industrial sectors.

In some cases, specific  materials are important to advanced technologies because of their unique  chemical and physical properties. For example, the rare earth materials  neodymium and dysprosium are used in the manufacture of permanent  magnets, which are used in automotive motors, wind turbines, and a  variety of other applications because of their unique properties, such as  magnetism at high temperatures. For some critical materials, a majority  of the global supply is produced by a few suppliers, in a single country, or  comes from a region that is vulnerable to geopolitical unrest. For  example, as we previously reported, China produces most of the world\u2019s  supply of rare earth materials, which are used in cell phones, computer  hard drives, precision-guided munitions, and a variety of other  commercial and military applications. In 2010, China tightened its export  restrictions on rare earth materials and a rapid price increase followed.  According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report, from April  2010 to July 2011, the prices of dysprosium and neodymium rose from  $250 per kilogram to $2,840 per kilogram and from $42 per kilogram to  $334 per kilogram, respectively. This price volatility highlighted U.S.  dependence on China for these materials and the potential supply risks  for U.S. defense and economic interests. Moreover, limitations on the  availability of critical materials to U.S. companies at acceptable prices  have the potential to affect the development of emerging advanced  technologies and the industrial sectors that produce them.", "A stable supply of critical materials has long been recognized as an  important U.S. issue. In 1980, Congress passed the National Materials  and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act (1980 Act), citing  the lack of a coherent national materials policy and a need for a  coordinated program to ensure the availability of materials critical for  national economic well-being, defense, and industrial production. In  recent years, the concentration of the supply of some critical materials  under foreign control has renewed questions about the U.S. government\u2019s  and industry\u2019s ability to address potential critical materials supply  disruptions. In 2010, the National Science and Technology Council\u2019s  (NSTC) Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and  Sustainability chartered the Subcommittee on Critical and Strategic  Mineral Supply Chains (Subcommittee) to provide advice and assistance  on policies, plans, and procedures for mitigating mineral risks. In  addition, a number of bills have been introduced in the 113th and 114th  Congresses that seek to address critical material supply issues through a  variety of proposals, such as streamlining mine permitting in the United  States, increasing critical materials data collection, and conducting  research on material substitution and recycling.", "You asked us to examine the status and comparative strength of U.S.  efforts to identify and strategically plan to address critical materials supply  issues. This report (1) describes federal agencies\u2019 activities related to the  supply of critical materials; (2) describes the approaches of selected  countries and regions to address critical materials supply issues; and (3)  evaluates the federal government\u2019s approach, such as coordination of  activities, to addressing critical materials supply issues.", "For our first and third objectives, we reviewed critical materials-related  laws, such as the 1980 Act and a law related to the Department of  Defense\u2019s stockpiling of materials, regulations, industry reports, and  academic studies. To describe federal agencies\u2019 activities related to the  supply of critical materials, we contacted the 20 federal departments and  agencies (referred to collectively as agencies) and Executive Office of the  President organizations that are designated as members of the  Subcommittee. These agencies and organizations are the Departments of  Agriculture (USDA), Commerce (Commerce), Defense (DOD), Education  (Education), Energy (DOE), Homeland Security (DHS), the Interior  (Interior), Justice (Justice), Labor (Labor), State (State), and the Treasury  (Treasury) as well as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Science  Foundation (NSF), Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), National  Economic Council (NEC), National Security Council (NSC), Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Science and Technology  Policy (OSTP), and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).

We selected the EU, Japan, and Canada based on  the efforts they have under way to address critical materials supply risks  and our ability to collect information about those efforts.", "To evaluate the federal government\u2019s approach to addressing critical  materials supply issues, we developed and disseminated a two-stage,  web-based survey to a nongeneralizable sample of 46 critical materials  experts. We selected these experts to ensure coverage of a variety of  types of organizations, including industry, industry associations,  academia, and government. We also selected these experts with  expertise across a range of critical materials-related subject matter areas,  including materials science, industrial ecology, mining and raw materials,  markets and trade policy, supply chain management, and workforce  issues. We conducted the survey in two rounds. The first round of the  survey asked the experts to respond to five open-ended questions about  the primary strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. federal government\u2019s  policies and activities related to critical materials and challenges and  options for improving these efforts. We conducted the first round of the  survey in September and October 2015 and received responses from 33  of the 46 experts. We analyzed the responses provided by the experts in  the first round and developed closed-ended questions for the second  round of the survey, in which we asked each expert to rate the ideas and  other information that came from the first round of the survey. We  conducted the second round in February and March 2016 and received  responses from 36 of the 46 experts. In addition, we interviewed officials  in OSTP and other agencies that are members of the Subcommittee to  obtain additional information on the federal approach, including efforts to  coordinate federal activities across agencies. To evaluate the federal  approach, including coordination, we compared federal efforts against the  national policy outlined in the 1980 Act and selected key practices for  interagency collaboration. We selected the key practices based on which  of the practices were most relevant to the operations of the  Subcommittee. Additional information on our methodology and the  experts who participated in our survey is found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2015 to September  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In a 2008 study on critical  minerals, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine\u2019s Committee on Critical Mineral Impacts on the U.S. Economy  developed a matrix to assess the criticality of a given mineral (see fig. 1).  The horizontal axis represents the availability and reliability of the mineral  supply (supply risk), and the vertical axis represents the importance of the  mineral (impact of supply restriction). The degree of criticality increases  from the lower-left to the upper-right corner of the figure, such that  mineral A is considered more critical than mineral B.", "A determination that a mineral or other type of material is critical is  generally based on some measure of the material\u2019s importance,  combined with a measure of the supply risk for the material. Supply risks  include potential physical interruptions in the supply chain, market  imbalances, and government interventions. For example, see the  following:", "Physical disruptions in the supply chain may include war or natural  disasters.", "Market imbalances may include oligopoly market power or inability to  adjust supply quickly in response to changes in demand.", "Government interventions may include export bans or restrictions on  mining for environmental considerations.", "Vulnerability to potential supply disruption varies depending on the  importance of the material in question and other factors, such as the  extent to which acceptable substitute materials are available and the  extent to which supply of a critical material can be adjusted quickly in  response to changes in demand. For materials that are extracted as  coproducts or by-products of other mining operations, increased demand  may not cause mining companies to produce more of them without  additional sustained demand for their primary products. For example,  according to a journal article, ruthenium is obtained almost entirely as a  by-product of platinum production. In late 2006, demand for ruthenium  expanded rapidly, in part, because of its increased use in hard disk  drives. However, the supply of ruthenium did not respond to this  increased demand, and the price of ruthenium rose rapidly to $870 per  troy ounce by mid-February 2007, a ninefold increase from the previous  year and a 29-fold increase from a low point in 2003.", "The materials supply chain in figure 2 shows the steps by which materials  are extracted from mines, processed, transformed into semifinished  components, and incorporated into end-use applications. The supply  chain also shows the potential for recycling and reusing materials from  finished applications, although materials can be reclaimed at any stage of  the supply chain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies\u2019 Critical Materials Roles", "paragraphs": ["There are a variety of ways in which federal agencies\u2019 activities intersect  with critical materials supply issues.

In addition, DOE, in support of its mission  of ensuring the United States\u2019 security and prosperity by addressing its  energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative  science and technology solutions, is focused on the supply of critical  materials given the importance of such materials to certain energy and  nuclear security technologies. The federal government may also affect  the development of critical materials resources through its land  management and regulatory activities. For example, the Department of  the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages approximately  950 million acres of the nation\u2019s land, including subsurface acres, and has  a role in reviewing and approving resource extraction projects on this  land.", "The 1980 Act establishes a national policy of promoting an adequate and  stable supply of materials necessary to maintain national security,  economic well-being, and industrial production with appropriate attention  to a long-term balance among resource production, energy use, a healthy  environment, natural resources conservation, and social needs. The 1980  Act generally does not ascribe desired outcomes and responsibility for  critical materials activities to individual agencies. However, the act does  require the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other agencies,  to continually identify and assess material needs cases to ensure an  adequate and stable supply of materials to meet national security,  economic well-being, and industrial production needs. The act also  charges the President, through the Executive Office of the President, with  coordinating federal departments and agencies to undertake a variety of  activities to implement this policy, including establishing early warning systems for materials supply problems; promoting a vigorous, comprehensive, and coordinated program of  materials research and development; encouraging federal agencies to facilitate availability and development  of domestic resources to meet critical materials needs; providing for improved collection, analysis, and dissemination of  scientific, technical, and economic materials information and data  from federal, state, and local governments and other sources as  appropriate; and assessing federal policies that adversely or positively affect all stages  of the materials cycle, from exploration to final product recycling and  disposal.", "The Subcommittee was organized as an interagency working group to  help understand the issues that surround the production and use of  critical materials, and to focus the government\u2019s resources on mitigation  of critical materials supply risks.

Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s (USGS) National Minerals  Information Center develops and provides statistics and information  on the worldwide production, consumption, and flow of minerals and  materials essential to the United States economy and national  security. The center, established in 1996 under USGS upon the  dissolution of the U.S. Bureau of Mines, produces a number of  reports, including the annual Minerals Yearbook and the Mineral  Commodity Summaries. The Minerals Yearbook is an annual  publication that provides statistical data on approximately 90  commodities. It also includes data from over 175 countries on mineral  production and trade, among other things. The Mineral Commodity  Summaries is based on the data reported in the yearbook and  includes data over a 5-year period. The annual summary includes  similar historical data as reported in the Minerals Yearbook, as well as  production estimates from the current reporting year. Interior\u2019s BLM  also collects information related to mineral resources. Although BLM  generally relies on data provided by USGS, it periodically issues  mineral potential reports to assess the mineral resource occurrence  and development potential on land related to particular mining  applications or projects. For example, in 2012 BLM issued an  assessment of the mineral potential of public lands located within a  proposed solar energy zone in New Mexico. As part of the  assessment, BLM evaluated whether certain minerals produced in  New Mexico and that are classified as strategic and critical minerals  for national defense purposes, including bismuth, copper, fluorspar,  manganese, tungsten, vanadium, and zinc, were found within the  proposed solar energy zone.", "DOE. As part of its efforts to advance a clean energy economy, DOE  conducted two criticality assessments on materials important to clean  energy applications, such as wind turbines, electric vehicles,  photovoltaic cells, and fluorescent lighting. DOE\u2019s first assessment,  published in a 2010 Critical Materials Strategy, evaluated 14 materials  and identified 10, including 7 rare earth materials, as critical or near  critical over the short or medium terms. DOE\u2019s second assessment,  published in a 2011 Critical Materials Strategy, assessed 16 materials  and identified 10 of them as critical or near critical over the short or  medium terms. As part of its 2015 Quadrennial Technology Review,  DOE also published a critical materials technology assessment that  reported on major trends driving future material criticality for selected  clean energy applications. Additionally, DOE manages the Isotope  Development and Production for Research and Applications program  (Isotope Program) through which it produces and distributes  radioactive and stable isotopes that are in short supply but are critical  for either federal government or U.S. commercial use.

In addition to USTR\u2019s efforts,  the Subcommittee has also played a role in addressing trade issues.  For example, in 2013 the Subcommittee requested changes to the  Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States that according to  OSTP officials, provided more granular data on U.S. imports of rare  earth materials, among other changes. Similarly, in 2014 the  Subcommittee submitted a request for additional changes to the  Harmonized Tariff Schedule to provide more granular data on U.S.  imports of permanent magnets, among other changes.", "Coordinating internationally. Federal agencies have coordinated  with international partners on critical materials issues through different  forums. For example, the EU-US-Japan Trilateral Conference on  Critical Materials\u2014which is jointly organized by the European  Commission; DOE; and the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade,  and Industry (METI)\u2014has taken place for 5 consecutive years to  exchange information on recent developments in critical materials  research and development. According to a DOE official, the first few  conferences began with high-level policy discussions, but they have  become focused more on researcher-to-researcher exchanges about  technology efforts. Another example is the Transatlantic Economic  Council, which, in 2011, agreed to launch a cooperative platform on  raw materials focusing on five areas: (1) trade cooperation; (2) raw  materials data, flows, and information sharing; (3) resource efficiency  and recycling; (4) research and development on raw material  substitution and reduction; and (5) waste shipment. According to a  State Department official, individual federal agencies have led U.S.  efforts in each focus area based on their individual missions. For  example, USTR led efforts in trade cooperation; USGS led efforts in  raw materials data; and DOE led efforts in research and development  and recycling, with EPA\u2019s assistance on recycling. Other examples of  international coordination that were described to us by federal agency  officials include annual reviews of strategic stockpile issues between  the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and U.S.  participation in the G7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency.", "Reviewing and approving mining projects.

Based on the biennial analyses  described previously, DLA-Strategic Materials makes  recommendations to acquire specific forms and amounts of materials  and then maintains these materials in the stockpile. Additionally, in  2005, DOD invested in a public-private partnership with the leading  U.S. beryllium producer to build a new $90.4 million primary beryllium  facility in Ohio to ensure current and future availability of high-quality  domestic beryllium to meet critical defense needs. The federal  government has also been extensively involved in the production,  storage, and use of helium since the early part of the 20th century.  BLM is responsible for managing the federal helium program,  including an underground reservoir for the storage of federally and  privately owned helium. The reserve provides a supply of federal  helium to such agencies as DOD, DOE, and NASA that rely on the  rare gas for research and medical and national defense  applications. Further, under DOE\u2019s Isotope Program, DOE produces  and distributes radioactive and stable isotopes in short supply for  commercial or federal needs. According to DOE officials, the federal  government is uniquely suited to produce certain isotopes as  production may require recycled or reused national security-related  source materials, big accelerators, and research facilities that are only  available within the federal government, or it is not profitable for  industry to provide the small amounts of isotopes needed for research  applications.", "Promoting technical education and workforce development.", "DOE\u2019s CMI offers a variety of educational opportunities through  several partners, including the Colorado School of Mines, Iowa State  University, and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

The Raw Materials Initiative is implemented, in part,  through the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials  (Partnership)\u2014a stakeholder platform that brings together EU countries,  companies, researchers, and nongovernmental organizations to promote  innovation in the raw materials sector. According to EU officials, the  Partnership has defined 95 actions to be carried out both within the EU  and internationally, in order to secure the EU supply of raw materials via  innovation. In 2014, an independent expert group studied the Partnership  model and found that it has been a useful vehicle in bringing partners  together with a view to align priorities, leverage investments, and form  future partnerships.

Horizon 2020 has several broad  pillars, one of which is climate action, environment, resource efficiency,  and raw materials. According to a European industry association we  interviewed, an example of efforts in this area involves trying to find ways  to provide more supply for raw materials from the EU. Association officials  told us that mining ventures tend to raise significant social opposition,  which can diminish potential for getting projects under way. According to  the officials, this aspect of the Horizon 2020 program tries to take a social  approach to mining by using advanced technology to help address social  opposition. This focus on public awareness is also an action area outlined  in the Partnership\u2019s 2013 Strategic Implementation Plan. The action area  is mostly industry led but is also supported by concerned stakeholders\u2014 communities, institutions, and regulatory bodies\u2014at all levels.

This  illustrates the connection within EU policy between the criticality of certain  raw materials and the goal of shifting towards a more resource-efficient  economy and sustainable development. This connection is also evident in  the second and third pillars of the Raw Materials Initiative, listed above,  which focus on sustainability and recycling. As stated in the European  Commission\u2019s 2008 communication on the raw materials initiative, the EU  views boosting overall resource efficiency as a key part of a path toward a  secure supply of raw materials.", "The Raw Materials Initiative also called for the EU to identify a common  list of critical raw materials for the EU\u2019s economy. To develop this list of  critical raw materials, the EU set up the Ad-Hoc Working Group on  Defining Critical Raw Materials, which comprises experts across  government, industry, and academia, as described in the Working  Group\u2019s 2010 report. The European Commission, with the Ad-Hoc  Working Group, published its first criticality analysis for raw materials in  2010. In that analysis, 14 critical raw materials were identified from a  candidate list of 41 nonenergy, nonagricultural materials. In 2013, the  commission and the working group, in cooperation with a group of  researchers, updated this work and analyzed 54 nonenergy,  nonagricultural materials, identifying 20 of them as critical raw materials.  EU officials we interviewed stated that they believe that the list of critical  materials is useful for prioritizing and identifying relevant research, raising  awareness, fostering trade negotiations, and communicating with  stakeholders, such as trade and industry groups.

According to  officials from Natural Resources Canada, junior mining companies have  no regular source of income and often have difficulty raising capital to  finance their exploration and development activities. According to officials  from Natural Resources Canada, Canada\u2019s flow-through share (FTS)  mechanism allows principal business corporations, particularly junior  mining companies, to obtain equity financing for mineral exploration and  development in Canada, whereby a mineral exploration or mining  company can transfer or flow-through the tax deductions arising from its  eligible exploration expenses to the FTS investors, giving them the  benefit. In addition, investors can receive an additional 15 percent Mineral  Exploration Tax Credit (METC) for qualifying surface or above-surface  exploration expenditures. According to information from the Natural  Resources Canada website, for the individual investors, the advantages  of investing in an FTS can be that they (1) receive a 100 percent tax  deduction for the amount of money they invested in the shares, plus the  15 percent METC in the case of an eligible expense, and (2) may see the  value of their investment appreciate in the event of successful  exploration.

Furthermore, experts we contacted for our  2012 report on key considerations for implementing interagency  collaborative mechanisms said, among other things, that it is helpful when  the participants in a collaborative mechanism have full knowledge of the  relevant resources in their agency and the ability to commit these  resources and make decisions on behalf of the agency.", "We noted earlier that the EU has created a mechanism to bring together  relevant stakeholders in the area of critical materials to align priorities,  leverage investments, and form future partnerships.

However, OSTP, as part of the  Subcommittee\u2019s leadership, did not point to efforts made to engage  member agencies in more active participation in the Subcommittee. By  taking steps to actively engage all member agencies in its efforts and  clearly define roles and responsibilities, the Subcommittee will have more  reasonable assurance that it can effectively marshal the potential  contributions of all member agencies to take full advantage of their  expertise and resources to help identify and mitigate critical materials  supply risks. Moreover, the 1980 Act outlines a range of policies to  promote an adequate and stable supply of materials, including assessing  the availability of technically trained personnel, as well as supporting  research related to recovery and recycling of materials, among others.

In the  early 1980s after the legislation was enacted, Commerce conducted two  such assessments on critical materials related to the aerospace and steel  industries. Both assessments were conducted by Commerce\u2019s Minerals  and Materials Task Force, which was chaired by the Director of ITA\u2019s  Office of Strategic Resources. However, Commerce officials could not  identify any recent assessments on critical materials by the department.

As shown in table 2, a majority of experts who  responded to the survey thought that the availability of data was  inadequate in a number of areas, including data to identify and assess  risks on (1) actual foreign production; (2) the resource potential of critical  materials in other parts of the world, including in and below the oceans;  and (3) the quantity of material recycled.", "In addition, the Subcommittee\u2019s March 2016 criticality assessment  reporting on the development and initial application of a screening  methodology represents an important step toward developing an early  warning system. However, the report focuses on a subset of potential  critical minerals, which it defined as nonfuel resources\u2014elements or  compounds\u2014that are obtained by mining or refined from mined products,  and in some cases includes such substances at various stages of  processing. According to the Subcommittee\u2019s report, the subset of  minerals assessed in this initial screening was determined by the  availability of suitable and consistent data. The report noted that, in  addition to limitations of scope, a significant weakness common among all  known criticality assessments is that they are not updated regularly, likely  because of the complexity of the models employed, lack of necessary  data, or lack of resources needed to perform such updates. Relatedly, the  Subcommittee\u2019s 2010 charter established that one of the functions of the  Subcommittee would be to develop and periodically update methods for  assessing the criteria for material designations as critical or strategic in  the short, medium, and long terms, including an early warning mechanism  for emerging critical or strategic materials. However, the Subcommittee\u2019s  2016 charter narrowed this function to implement and, as necessary,  update the methodology developed cooperatively by its member agencies  for dynamically assessing mineral criticality and for signaling emerging  critical or strategic minerals\u2014notably replacing the word material with  mineral.", "The Subcommittee\u2019s focus on minerals excludes other materials that are  important to industry and federal scientific research, such as rare gases  like neon and argon. For instance, we learned from industry officials we  interviewed that beginning in 2014 during the conflict between the  Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatist groups, there was  a decrease in the global supply of neon gas that led to a 20-fold price  increase. Neon is generally produced as a by-product of steelmaking, and  most of the global supply of neon comes from Ukraine and Russia.  Neon is used for many industrial and research applications, including in  the medical field and in the semiconductor industry to design computer  chips. For instance, an NIH official stated that the agency found out  about the decreased global supply of neon through one of its grantees  that needed the gas for medical research. According to the NIH official,  the decreased supply of neon gas has resulted in researchers rationing  the gas, which restricts research activities. The official stated that in one  case the agency provided supplemental funds to assist a researcher in  conducting experiments using alternative laser systems that did not  depend on neon gas, but the experiments were unsuccessful using those  lasers. According to the NIH official, federal intervention to ensure the  availability of neon and other rare gases would improve the agency\u2019s  ability to advance its mission.", "The Subcommittee\u2019s criticality assessment report notes that the  development of the screening methodology and the regular publication of  its results address aspects of the 1980 Act. As noted above, the 1980 Act  calls for the creation of early warning systems for materials supply  problems, and defines \u201cmaterials\u201d as substances, including but not limited  to minerals, needed to supply the industrial, military, and essential civilian  needs of the United States. The Subcommittee\u2019s report indicated that  additional minerals could be included in the early warning screening in the  future as additional data become available. However, the Subcommittee  has not developed a plan or strategy to prioritize additional materials  needed by industry and federal research and to determine how to obtain  data that would allow them to be included in the early warning screening  in the future.", "One potential mechanism for obtaining data on additional materials is the  North American Industry Classification System, which is the standard  used by federal statistical agencies\u2014several of which are part of  Subcommittee member agencies (e.g., Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics  and DOE\u2019s Energy Information Administration)\u2014in classifying business  establishments to collect, analyze, and publish statistical data related to  the North American economy. The system is reviewed through an  international process every 5 years and uses a production-oriented  conceptual framework to group establishments into industries based on  the activity in which they are primarily engaged. Establishments using  similar raw material inputs, similar capital equipment, and similar labor  are classified in the same industry, so that establishments that do similar  things in similar ways are classified together. The current 2012 industry  classifications in use under this system were issued in 2011. The U.S  Economic Classification Policy Committee is reviewing comments on its  recommendations for the 2017 revisions to the system, after which it will  begin the process of soliciting proposed revisions for implementation in  2022. During the revision process, the Economic Classification Policy  Committee solicits and evaluates requests for revisions to the North  American Industry Classification System. A Labor official said that if there  is a need to classify segments of industries at a more granular level, it  would be important to communicate these needs for the next revision  cycle. For example, there is one North American Industry Classification  System code that covers all industrial gases. If the Subcommittee found  that there was the need for additional information on a specific industrial  gas, such as neon, it could use the upcoming revision process to request  a change to incorporate additional granularity into the system to  differentiate between different industrial gases. This would be similar to  the changes the Subcommittee worked with the United States  International Trade Commission to incorporate in the Harmonized Tariff  Schedule to provide more visibility into the imports of specific rare earth  materials and permanent magnets.", "Since the publication of the Subcommittee\u2019s criticality report, the  Subcommittee narrowed its charter to focus on minerals. In narrowing the  charter, the Subcommittee is missing the opportunity to fulfill in its early  warning screening methodology one of the policies of the 1980 Act, which  applies to all critical materials. By taking the steps necessary to broaden  future applications of the early warning screening methodology to include  potentially critical materials beyond minerals, such as a plan or strategy  for prioritizing the materials, the Subcommittee could better work with  member agencies to address existing data limitations and broaden the  scope of the early warning system to better achieve the policy outlined in  the 1980 Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Approach to Addressing Critical Materials Supply Issues Has a Limited Focus on Domestic Production", "paragraphs": ["Experts we surveyed noted the importance of domestic production in  addressing the supply of critical materials but also indicated that the  federal government\u2019s approach to date has included a limited focus on  domestic production.

A  majority of experts who responded to the survey, 24 out of 36, indicated  that the federal government should play a major role in encouraging the  domestic production of critical materials, and 19 out of 36 indicated that  federal efforts to encourage domestic production of critical materials to  address supply issues are somewhat or very inadequate. As shown in  table 3, experts we surveyed identified several factors with the potential to  limit domestic production of critical materials.", "As described above, one aspect of domestic production of critical  materials is the review and approval by federal agencies of mining  projects on federal land. As shown in table 3, most experts we surveyed  indicated that the length of the permitting process for new mines has the  potential to limit the domestic production of critical materials. In January  2016, we reported on the permitting process involving BLM and the  Forest Service and found, among other things, that agency officials felt  that there was limited or ineffective interagency coordination and  collaboration during the mine plan review process. We reported that  officials in nine BLM and two Forest Service locations said that  coordination and collaboration had been limited in both quantity and  quality and had resulted in adding from 2 months to 3 years to the review  process. As part of the review process, BLM and the Forest Service need  to coordinate and collaborate with other federal agencies, state agencies,  and Native American tribes on issues such as assessing impacts to water  quality, wildlife, and cultural resources. However, BLM and Forest  Service officials said it can be difficult to do. For example, Forest Service  officials said that a federal agency delayed the review process for one  mine plan because the agency did not provide the necessary data in a  timely fashion. As a result, Forest Service officials had to redo some  analyses needed for the mine plan\u2019s environmental impact statement,  which added time to the review process. To help address this key  challenge, some officials said that they have developed memorandums of  agreement with state agencies, are holding regular meetings with these  state agencies, and the mine operators, and are communicating and  consulting with tribes.", "As noted above, other countries\u2019 or regions\u2019 approaches to addressing  critical materials supply issues have incorporated taking steps to facilitate  domestic production of materials. For example, Canada\u2019s MPMO Initiative  was established to improve the accountability, transparency, timeliness,  and predictability of Canada\u2019s federal regulatory review process for major  resource projects, and internal and external stakeholders believe that  federal project review timelines have improved because of better  coordination. The Canadian government has also taken steps to provide  tax incentives for domestic production. Similarly, as described above,  fostering communication with stakeholders related to new mining projects  has been a facet of the EU approach to facilitating domestic production of  critical materials. Although its charter calls for the Subcommittee to review  and analyze global and domestic policies that affect the supply of critical  and strategic minerals, the Subcommittee has addressed these issues  only to a limited degree. As noted above, the Subcommittee has done  some work to look at trade issues to critical materials through its work  with USTR and other member agencies to address China\u2019s export  restrictions through dispute settlement at the WTO. However, the  Subcommittee has not focused on increasing the supply of critical  materials through facilitating domestic production. Until recently, the  Forest Service was not an active participant on the Subcommittee, and  according to BLM officials we interviewed, BLM has not participated on  the Subcommittee. There are a number of global and domestic policies  related to the supply of critical materials that the Subcommittee could  review and analyze, including examining the approaches taken by other  countries or regions to facilitate domestic production by, for example,  improving coordination and streamlining the mine-permitting process.

In its comments, OSTP stated that  the roles and responsibilities of member agencies are defined by their  existing missions and that further specification of roles and  responsibilities within the context of the Subcommittee is either  redundant, if aligned with agency missions, or may raise confusion if not.  However, as we state in the report, there are a number of Subcommittee  member agencies that do not have clear roles within the Subcommittee\u2019s  efforts and have had limited or no involvement in the Subcommittee\u2019s  work on critical materials. By clearly defining roles and responsibilities  within the context of the Subcommittee, member agencies could organize  their joint and individual efforts, and facilitate decision making. Moreover,  more actively engaging all member agencies by clearly defining roles and  responsibilities and identifying contributing activities could help the  Subcommittee more fully incorporate the range of policies of the 1980 Act  into the federal approach for addressing critical materials supply issues.  OSTP further stated that agencies have in place mechanisms to monitor,  evaluate, and report on the progress of their efforts in support of their  missions, and the Subcommittee reports directly to its parent committee  and in other ways (public documents) on its collective actions. However,  as we state in the report, the Subcommittee has not reported periodically  on the progress of all of its efforts to address critical materials supply  issues, and there is no member agency that is responsible for reporting  on all of the Subcommittee\u2019s efforts. We continue to believe that OSTP  should fully implement our three recommendations to enhance  interagency collaboration on critical materials supply issues.", "OSTP neither agreed nor disagreed with our fourth recommendation that  the Subcommittee should take the steps necessary to include potentially  critical materials beyond minerals, such as developing a plan or strategy  for prioritizing additional materials. In its comments, OSTP stated that  plans to address additional materials are under discussion as the  Subcommittee evaluates feedback on the published assessment  methodology and that other approaches may be considered to add  potentially critical materials that cannot be screened using the  methodology because of data limitations or other factors. DOE, which co- chairs the Subcommittee along with OSTP and Interior, stated in its  general comments that the report would more accurately present the  issue of the federal focus on only a subset of materials by including a  more comprehensive discussion of the data availability issues that limit  the Subcommittee\u2019s early warning screening methodology. We  acknowledge that existing data limitations present a challenge for the  Subcommittee. As we state in the report, our recommendation that the  Subcommittee take steps such as developing a plan or strategy for  prioritizing additional materials to be included in the early warning  screening methodology is intended to help the Subcommittee better work  with member agencies to address existing data limitations. In its general  comments, DOE also suggested that we clarify that the plan or strategy  for prioritizing additional materials should focus on those that require  augmented data collection activities. As we state in our report, addressing  data limitations is a key factor in the Subcommittee\u2019s ability to apply its  early warning screening methodology to additional materials. Therefore,  we clarified in the recommendation the role of data limitations. Without  taking steps to include potentially critical materials beyond minerals, such  as developing a plan for prioritizing additional materials, the  Subcommittee may miss opportunities to obtain the data it needs, such as  by proposing a revision to the North American Industry Classification  System.

OSTP stated that it  looks forward to exploring the experiences and approaches of other  countries and regions.", "In its general comments, DOE expressed concerns that our evaluation of  the federal government\u2019s approach to addressing critical materials supply  issues is based largely on a nongeneralizable sample of critical materials  experts and that it is not clear in the report that we considered how the  composition of survey respondents could present significant bias in the  results. DOE stated that a majority of the survey respondents fall under  the \u2018Industry/Association\u2019 category and that representatives from industry  could be expected to say that there is more the government can do to  support domestic industries. As we state in the report, our survey results  are not generalizable and only represent the views of those who  responded. However, both the total number of experts from industry  sampled (24) and the number of experts from industry that responded in  the second round of the survey (19) represent about half of the experts  we included in the survey. The remaining represent government experts  (6 sampled and 5 who responded in the second round of the survey) and  academic/nonprofit experts (16 sampled and 12 who responded in the  second round of the survey). DOE\u2019s statement assumes that all of the  industry respondents think government should do more\u2014which may or  may not be true. There could also be bias if the respondents\u2019 views  differed from the views of nonrespondents. However, we do not know  whether this is the case, and this type of bias can occur in any survey.  Our findings are supported not only by our survey results, but also  through our review of relevant documents and interviews with officials  from government and industry in the United States and in other countries  and regions. Therefore, we did not make any changes to the report as a  result of DOE\u2019s comment.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate  congressional committees, the Director of the Office of Science and  Technology Policy, the Secretary of Commerce, and other interested  parties.

We also collected and reviewed prior GAO reports on issues  related to the federal effort to address the supply of critical materials, as  well as congressional hearings, industry reports, and academic studies on  the U.S. supply of critical materials. We also reviewed the charters of the  Subcommittee on Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chains  (Subcommittee), which is under the National Science and Technology  Council\u2019s Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and  Sustainability.", "To describe federal agencies\u2019 activities related to the supply of critical  materials, we contacted the 20 federal agencies and Executive Office of  the President organizations that are designated as members of the  Subcommittee. These agencies and organizations are the Departments of  Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security,  the Interior, Justice, Labor, State, and the Treasury, as well as the  Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, National Science Foundation, Council on Environmental  Quality, National Economic Council, National Security Council, Office of  Management and Budget, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (OSTP). We interviewed and  obtained reports and analyses from officials from those agencies as  appropriate. We also interviewed officials from a federal agency that was  not designated as a member of the Subcommittee\u2014the Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 National Institutes of Health\u2014about its role  in activities related to the supply of critical materials, as it relies on rare  gases, for example, for research and medical applications.", "To describe the approaches of selected countries and regions to address  critical materials supply issues, we interviewed officials across  government, academia, and industry from the European Union (EU),  Japan, and Canada and obtained relevant documentation from officials.  We also met onsite with EU officials in Brussels, Belgium, and Japanese  officials in Tokyo. While in the EU, we also met with German officials in  Berlin and Bonn, to understand the impact of multinational planning on  national laws and policies related to critical materials. We selected these  countries and regions based on the efforts they have under way to  address critical materials supply risks and our ability to collect information  about those efforts.", "To evaluate the federal government\u2019s approach to addressing critical  materials supply issues, we developed and disseminated a two-stage,  web-based survey to a nongeneralizable sample of 46 critical materials  experts. The sample was selected with the goal of obtaining a balance of  perspectives across the industrial, academic, and government sectors on  the critical materials supply chain. We also identified subject matter areas  relevant to the critical materials supply chain. Based on background  research and interviews with experts, we identified the following relevant  subject matter areas:", "Materials science\u2014basic or applied research or experience related to  materials that could be used in the production of advanced  technologies, including methods for recycling materials.", "Industrial ecology\u2014research or experience related to the flow of  energy and materials through an industrial system, including, but not  limited to, resource constraints and life cycle analysis.", "Mining and raw materials\u2014research or experience related to  extraction or processing of minerals or materials, including exploration  and permitting for such activities.", "Markets and trade policy\u2014research or experience related to  commodity markets, supply and demand for materials, or trade  policies that affect the flow of materials.", "Supply chain management\u2014research or experience related to the  management of an industry or government supply chain or the  collection, dissemination, or analysis of information on material supply  chains and the risk associated with them.", "Workforce issues\u2014research or experience related to the adequacy of  technically trained personnel in the fields of mining or material  science.", "To identify experts from the industrial, academic, and government sectors  who are knowledgeable about matters involving the critical materials  supply chain, the team used resources that included professional and  government publications; participant lists of knowledge-sharing events,  such as workshops, symposia, and conferences; recent congressional  testimonies related to critical materials issues; members of a federal  advisory committee; and outreach to research and academic programs,  trade associations, companies, and other industry groups. In addition, the  team identified a number of potential experts based on interviews with  federal agencies and other knowledgeable stakeholders conducted as  part of the audit work for the engagement. We identified and reached out  to more than 100 experts based on their expertise across the range of  subject matter areas and sectors. Out of those experts we contacted, 49  expressed an interest in participating in the survey. In total, 47 experts (of  49 considered) were selected for participation in the survey. After the first  round of the survey was sent out to all participants, one participant  declined to participate and was removed from the list of participants  resulting 46 experts. The makeup of the 46 experts consisted of 6 in  government, 16 in academia and nonprofit organizations, and 24 in  industry and trade group associations. Table 4 shows the breakdown of  experts\u2019 expertise across sectors.", "The first round of the survey was conducted from September 22, 2015, to  October 30, 2015, and asked the experts to respond to five open-ended  questions about the primary strengths and weaknesses of the U.S.  federal government\u2019s policies and activities related to critical materials  and options for improving these efforts. Out of the 46 experts sampled for  the survey, 33 responded to the survey, resulting in a response rate of 72  percent. The 33 who responded were experts who successfully submitted  their conflict-of-interest forms and completed the electronic survey. After  the experts completed the open-ended questions, we analyzed the  responses to identify key issues raised by the experts. Based on those  key issues raised by the experts, we identified topic categories related to  the supply of critical materials. We then developed closed-ended  questions for the second round of the survey in which we asked each  expert to rate the ideas and other information that came from the first  round of the survey. Two of the 33 respondents from the first round of the  survey did not participate in the second round of the survey.", "The second round of the survey was conducted from February 3, 2016, to  March 4, 2016, and contained 30 questions. The first 29 questions were  closed-ended questions, with many containing follow-up questions to  further explore experts\u2019 responses. The last question was open-ended to  capture experts\u2019 views on issues that had not been previously covered in  the survey. Out of the 46 experts sampled for the second round of the  survey, 36 responded, resulting in a response rate of 78 percent. We  conducted follow-up phone calls around mid-February 2016 to  participants who had not completed the survey, had not turned in their  conflict-of-interest forms, or both. The 36 who responded to the survey  were those experts who successfully submitted their conflict-of-interest  forms and completed the electronic survey. Five of the 36 respondents  who participated in the second round of the survey had not participated in  the first round of the survey.", "Because we selected a nongeneralizable sample of experts, their views  are not generalizable to other experts in these subject matter areas, but  their views can provide illustrative examples of critical materials supply  issues. The quality of survey data can be affected by nonsampling error.  Nonsampling error includes variations in how respondents interpret  questions, respondents\u2019 willingness to offer accurate responses, and data  collection and processing errors. In developing the web survey, we  pretested draft versions of the instrument in December 2015 with 5  experts who later participated in the second round of the survey. On the  basis of the pretests, we made revisions to the survey. We included steps  in developing the survey and collecting, editing, and analyzing survey  data, to minimize such nonsampling error. Furthermore, using a web- based survey also helped remove errors in our data collection effort.  Allowing experts to enter their responses directly into an electronic  instrument automatically created a record for each expert in a data file  and eliminated the errors associated with a manual data entry process.", "To determine the extent of collaboration among agencies that are  members of the Subcommittee, we collected documents and interviewed  officials in OSTP and other agencies that are Subcommittee members to  obtain additional information on the federal approach, including efforts to  coordinate federal activities. To evaluate the federal approach, including  coordination, we compared federal efforts against the national policy  outlined in the 1980 Act and key practices for interagency collaboration.  We reviewed the eight key practices for interagency collaboration based  on which of the practices were most relevant to the operations of the  Subcommittee. The key practices for interagency collaboration are among  the options for reducing or better managing fragmentation to improve the  efficiency of federal programs and more effectively achieve their  objectives. We identified all but one of the key practices (reinforce  individual accountability for collaborative efforts through performance  management systems) as relevant to the Subcommittee\u2019s functions.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2015 to September  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
