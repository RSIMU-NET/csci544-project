These 7,000 Medicaid providers with unpaid federal taxes received a total of about $6.6 billion in Medicaid reimbursements during 2009 (including American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 [Recovery Act] funds). The amount of unpaid federal taxes GAO identified is likely understated because Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxpayer data reflect only the amount of unpaid taxes either reported on a tax return or assessed by IRS through enforcement; it does not include entities that did not file tax returns or underreported their income.", "The 40 Medicaid providers GAO reviewed received a total of $235 million in Medicaid reimbursements (including Recovery Act funds) in 2009 and had unpaid federal taxes of about $26 million through 2010. The amount of unpaid federal taxes ranged from approximately $100,000 to over $6 million. In addition, IRS records indicate that providers in two of GAO\u0092s cases are currently, or have previously been, under criminal investigation. For example, in one case a provider was caught participating in a medical billing fraud.", "IRS may levy, or seize, a taxpayer\u0092s property to satisfy a tax debt and, in some instances, is authorized to use an automated process to continuously levy federal payments made to delinquent taxpayers. Medicaid reimbursements have never been continuously levied using this provision of the law because the IRS determined that these reimbursements do not qualify as federal payments. However, if such a process could be used, GAO estimates that IRS could have collected between $22 million and $330 million in the selected states in 2009. States we spoke to expressed concerns about implementing continuous levies, given the challenges they encounter with processing onetime IRS levies. For example, states have had difficulty reaching IRS revenue officers and problems with IRS sending levies to the wrong address."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS explore opportunities to enhance collection of unpaid taxes from Medicaid providers, including the use of continuous levies.

Because of this and other issues, we have designated  IRS enforcement of the nation\u2019s tax laws as a high-risk issue. In addition,  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)  initially provided states with an estimated $87 billion in federal funds for  Medicaid, a federal-state health financing program for certain low-income  individuals, from October 2008 through December 2010, by increasing  federal reimbursement rates for the Medicaid program. Recovery Act  funds were made available to states and the District of Columbia through  an increase to the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), the  rate at which the federal government matches state expenditures for most  Medicaid services. Thus, any provider that received Medicaid  reimbursements during calendar year 2009, by definition, received some  Recovery Act funds. Federal law does not prohibit providers with unpaid  federal taxes from enrolling in or receiving payments from Medicaid.  Further, although IRS can levy, or seize, Medicaid reimbursements to  satisfy a provider\u2019s tax debt, it does not have the authority to do so  continuously using an automated process. Because of the potential that  some Medicaid providers that received Recovery Act funds have unpaid  federal taxes, you asked us to examine this issue.", "This report is the third in a series of three reports in response to your  request regarding recipients of federal Recovery Act funds who have  unpaid federal taxes. benefitted from Recovery Act provisions that increased FMAP for  Medicaid.

We attempted to obtain data  from the state of California, but determined that the data we received were  unreliable for the purposes of this report. We selected these states  because they received the largest portion of the Recovery Act Medicaid  funding. We also obtained federal tax-debt data from IRS as of September  30, 2011. Using the taxpayer identification number (TIN) as a unique  identifier, we electronically matched IRS\u2019s tax debt data to the population of  Medicaid providers. We included only agreed-upon tax debts over $100  from tax year 2009 and earlier to ensure that the provider owed or was  accruing tax debt at the time that the provider received Medicaid funds. Our  analysis determined the magnitude of known unpaid federal taxes owed by  2009 Medicaid providers in only New York, Texas, and Florida and cannot  be generalized to other states or periods.", "To provide examples of Medicaid providers who have sizeable unpaid  federal taxes, we selected 20 Medicaid providers with unpaid business taxes  and 20 Medicaid providers with unpaid individual taxes in the three selected  states for detailed examination.

In addition, you asked  us to determine whether the owners and principals of Medicaid providers had  unpaid federal taxes. To do so, we used open-source information to identify  the owners and other principals for 600 randomly selected known Medicaid  providers in Florida, New York, and Texas. We electronically matched these  individuals with IRS\u2019s tax debt data to identify their known unpaid federal  taxes and to confirm their professional relationship with a nondebtor  Medicaid provider. For example, a hospital that served as a Medicaid  provider did not have unpaid federal taxes, but one of its owners or other key  principals did have unpaid federal taxes. For all examples, we reviewed IRS  and public records to develop case studies. These case studies are intended  to illustrate the sizeable amounts of unpaid federal taxes owed by some  Medicaid providers, are among the most egregious examples of Medicaid  providers with unpaid federal taxes we identified, and cannot be generalized  beyond the cases presented.", "To evaluate opportunities and challenges related to collecting unpaid  federal taxes through a levy process designed to recapture unpaid taxes  by offsetting subsequent Medicaid reimbursements, we interviewed  officials from relevant federal agencies and from selected states (chosen  on the basis of size of their Medicaid programs or their participation in  federal debt collection programs, or both).

More than 64 million persons were enrolled in the Medicaid  program for fiscal year 2009. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) reported combined fiscal year 2009 and 2010 Medicaid  program spending of $744 billion, $499 billion of which was funded by the  federal government. The federal government matches most state  Medicaid expenditures for covered services according to the FMAP,  which is based on a statutory formula drawing on each state\u2019s annual per  capita income. Because of the mechanism through which the Recovery  Act increased the federal share of funding for Medicaid through an  increased FMAP, any provider that received Medicaid reimbursements  during 2009 received Recovery Act funds. Within broad federal  requirements, each state operates and administers its Medicaid program  in accordance with a CMS-approved state Medicaid plan. These plans  detail the populations served, the services covered, and the methods  used to calculate payments to providers.", "Title XIX of the Social Security Act allows considerable flexibility within  the states\u2019 Medicaid plans. Within broad national guidelines established  by federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each state (1) establishes its  own eligibility standards; (2) determines the type, amount, duration, and  scope of services; administers its own program\u2014including enrollment of providers. Medicaid  policies for eligibility, services, and payment are complex and vary  considerably, even among states of similar size or geographic proximity.  Thus, a person who is eligible for Medicaid in one state may not be  eligible in another state, and the services provided by one state may differ  considerably in amount, duration, or scope from services provided in a  similar or neighboring state.   (3) sets the rate of payment for services; and (4)", "All states must provide certain services, such as inpatient and outpatient hospital  services, nursing facility services, and physician services, and may provide additional,  optional services, such as prescription drugs, dental care, and certain home- and  community-based services. covered under the state\u2019s Medicaid plan. After the claim is approved by  the state, it pays the claim.", "Federal reimbursement for Medicaid generally begins after a Medicaid  beneficiary receives care from a health care provider such as a hospital,  physician, or nursing home. The state pays the provider from a  combination of state funds and federal funds, the latter of which have  been advanced by CMS each quarter. The state then files a quarterly  expenditure report, in which it claims the federal share of the Medicaid  expenditure as reimbursement for its payment to providers and reconciles  its total expenditures with the federal advance. In addition to  reimbursement for medical services, the state may claim federal  reimbursement for functions it performs to administer its Medicaid  program, such as enrolling new beneficiaries; reviewing the  appropriateness of providers\u2019 claims; and collecting payments from third  parties, which are payers other than Medicaid, such as Medicare, that  may be liable for some or all of a particular health claim.", "Federal law does not prohibit providers with unpaid federal taxes from  enrolling in or receiving payments from Medicaid. Federal regulations and  policies require the states, as part of their responsibilities for determining  whether the providers meet Medicaid requirements for enrollment, to verify  basic information on potential providers, including whether the providers  meet state licensure requirements and whether the providers are prohibited  from participating in federal health care programs. However, federal  regulations and policies do not require the states to screen these providers  for federal tax delinquency nor do they explicitly authorize the states to  reject the providers that have delinquent tax debt from participation in  Medicaid. Further, federal law generally does not permit IRS to disclose  taxpayer information, including tax debts, unless the taxpayer consents.", "IRS may levy a taxpayer\u2019s property to satisfy a tax debt. For instance, IRS  could seize and sell property that a taxpayer holds (such as the  taxpayer\u2019s car, boat, or house), or IRS could seize property that belongs  to the taxpayer but is held by someone else (such as the taxpayer\u2019s  wages, retirement accounts, dividends, bank accounts, licenses, rental  income, accounts receivable, or commissions). Currently, IRS may issue  a onetime notice of levy to a state Medicaid agency to collect the  receivable balance immediately due to a given provider. IRS may then  issue additional successive, onetime levies if the proceeds received from  the initial levy are not sufficient to satisfy the government\u2019s claim. A  provision of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 authorizes IRS to  continuously levy (typically using an automated process) certain federal  payments made to delinquent taxpayers in order to collect tax debt, but  Medicaid reimbursements have never been collected using this provision  of the law. This is because IRS determined that Medicaid disbursements  do not qualify as federal payments and thus may not be subjected to the  continuous levy. This decision was based on the nature of the Medicaid  reimbursement as a state entitlement, and the considerable operational  discretion vested in state agencies in the administration of the Medicaid  program, including discretion to create unique eligibility standards for  enrollment of providers and to establish criteria for disbursement of funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "About 7,000 Medicaid Providers in the Selected States Owed Approximately $791 Million in Federal Tax Debt", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis found that, as of September 30, 2011, about 7,000 Medicaid  providers in the three selected states had approximately $791 million in  unpaid federal taxes from 2009 or earlier.

The  amount of unpaid federal taxes reported above does not include all tax  debts owed by Medicaid providers due to statutory provisions that give  IRS a finite period under which it can seek to collect on unpaid taxes.  There is a 10-year statute of limitations beyond which IRS is prohibited  from attempting to collect tax debt. Consequently, if the Medicaid  providers have unpaid federal taxes from beyond the 10-year statutory  collection period, the older tax debt may have been removed from IRS\u2019s  records.

Two of the states also mentioned that they levy  Medicaid reimbursements for the collection of state debts without seeing  a broad effect on provider participation.", "Several of the states we spoke with described a trend towards using  Managed Care Organizations (MCO) to administer Medicaid benefits.Since states pay the MCO instead of the provider that performs the  services, the only entity that the state could enforce an IRS levy against  would be the MCO. This would limit the population of Medicaid providers  eligible for a levy to MCOs and to providers who are paid directly by the  state. The states expressed concern over the idea of levying Medicaid  reimbursements to pay an MCO\u2019s debt when the reimbursement is truly  meant for services provided by treating providers that have no association  with the MCO\u2019s tax debt.", "The states also expressed concerns related to the existing process for the  enforcement of IRS onetime levies. For example, several states  experienced customer service\u2013related challenges when working with IRS  including difficulty using the IRS customer service hotline, difficulty  reaching the IRS revenue officer, or problems with IRS sending levies to  the wrong address. Another state commented that IRS does a poor job of  releasing levies in a timely manner, especially for uncollectible levies. One  state noted that it had concerns with applying a levy when the provider  name or TIN in the state\u2019s Medicaid provider database doesn\u2019t exactly  match what is provided by IRS. For example, the state explained that  associating a Medicaid reimbursement with an appropriate tax debtor can  be a challenge since the state\u2019s system may include more than one TIN for  a given provider. Should IRS expand levy collection efforts for Medicaid,  increased centralized coordination with states could ease the process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Available data indicate that the vast majority of Medicaid providers appear  to fully pay their federal taxes. However, our work has shown that in 2009  about 7,000 Medicaid providers in three states had delinquent federal taxes  while receiving billions of dollars in Medicaid reimbursements, including  Recovery Act funds. Even though Medicaid providers are relied on to  deliver significant medical services to those most in need, payment of  billions of federal dollars to those who do not pay their fair share of federal  taxes raises questions about the integrity and fairness of the tax system.  Our cases provide illustrative examples where IRS was able to, in some  instances, collect delinquent taxes by using onetime levies on Medicaid  reimbursements, but the process is highly inefficient. While current federal  law does not permit the continuous levy of Medicaid payments, our  estimates suggest that expanded use of levies against Medicaid providers,  specifically an aggressive automated program, has the potential to help  IRS collect millions of dollars of unpaid federal taxes, though the effect on  provider participation is largely unknown. Enhanced onetime or manual  continuous levy programs targeted at high-reimbursement, high-debt  Medicaid providers could also potentially yield increased tax collections.  Given that we found over $6 billion of payments made to tax delinquent  Medicaid providers in just three states, a more rigorous review of the  potential costs and financial benefits of implementing enhanced continuous  and other levies of Medicaid payments is warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue do the  folllowing:", "Explore further opportunities to enhance collection of unpaid federal  taxes from Medicaid providers.

Similarly, in its written  comments (see app. IV), CMS noted that the structure of the Medicaid  program (wherein the federal government does not have a direct  relationship with providers or pay them directly) provides a programmatic  basis for excluding Medicaid from the levy program, and may result in  significant challenges to the implementation of an FPLP-style levy  expansion. CMS further noted that any potential legislation related to the  collection of outstanding tax debts from Medicaid providers may impact  the basic structure of the Medicaid program. FMS provided technical  comments by e-mail, which were incorporated into this report. Both CMS  and FMS noted that they are prepared to coordinate with IRS in exploring  opportunities to enhance levy collections from Medicaid providers.

We attempted to obtain data  from the state of California, but the data we received were determined to  be unreliable for the purposes of this report. We selected these states  because they received the most American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)\u2013related Medicaid money.", "For the purposes of this report, the term \u201cprovider\u201d refers to any individual, business, or  other entity that received at least one Medicaid reimbursement (e.g., doctors, hospitals,  home care providers) from at least one of the three selected states. unpaid federal taxes IRS classified as compliance assessments or  memo accounts for financial reporting, unpaid federal taxes from 2010 and 2011 tax periods, and  recipients with total unpaid federal taxes of $100 or less.", "The criteria above were used to exclude unpaid federal taxes that might be  under dispute or generally duplicative or invalid, and unpaid federal taxes  that are recently incurred. Specifically, compliance assessments or memo  accounts were excluded because these taxes have neither been agreed to  by the taxpayers nor affirmed by the court, or these taxes could be invalid  or duplicative of other taxes already reported. We excluded known unpaid  federal taxes from 2010 and 2011 tax periods to both eliminate tax debt  that may involve matters that are routinely resolved between the taxpayers  and IRS with the taxes paid or abated within a short time, and tax debts  accrued after the Medicaid reimbursement period under review. We  excluded tax debts of $100 or less because they are insignificant for the  purpose of determining the extent of known taxes owed by Medicaid  providers. Using these criteria, we identified about 7,000 Medicaid  providers with known unpaid federal taxes. Our final estimate of tax debt  may include some debt that is covered under an active IRS installment plan  or beyond normal statutory limits for debt collection. Our analysis  determined the magnitude of known unpaid federal taxes owed by 2009  Medicaid providers in only New York, Texas, and Florida and cannot be  generalized to other states or periods.", "To provide examples of Medicaid providers who have significant unpaid  federal taxes, we selected 20 Medicaid providers with unpaid federal  taxes in the IRS Business Master File (BMF) and 20 Medicaid providers  with unpaid federal taxes listed in the IRS Individual Master File (IMF) for  a detailed review. These nonrepresentative selections of providers were  chosen by using a random sample of the 113 entities in the BMF and 26  individuals in the IMF with at least $100,000 in Medicaid reimbursements  during 2009, $100,000 in outstanding unpaid federal taxes, and 5 years of  accumulated unpaid federal taxes (noncontinuous) in or before 2010. In  addition, we also used open-source information to identify the Social  Security Number (SSN) for owners and other principals for 600 randomly  selected known Medicaid providers in the selected states (a random  selection of 200 per state for New York, Texas, and Florida). We  electronically matched these individuals with IRS\u2019s tax debt data to  identify their outstanding tax debts and to confirm their professional  relationship with a nondebtor Medicaid provider. For these providers, we  reviewed IRS and public records to develop 10 additional case studies.
