State attempts to ensure compliance with program regulations through its processes of approving and annually reviewing the organizations that sponsor exchange visitors. These processes, however, are not sufficient to ensure that visitors participate only in authorized activities because the procedures consist primarily of document reviews, and State rarely visits the sponsors or host employers of the exchange visitors to make sure they are following the rules to investigate complaints. Moreover, some sponsors have asserted that the program regulations need updating. Further, State officials believe that the sanctions provided in the regulations are difficult to enforce. State acknowledged that it has been slow to address identified deficiencies and update the regulations, but had indicated that it is beginning to revise the regulations and is establishing a unit to monitor exchange activities. However funding of the unit has not been secured. A number of potential risks are associated with the programs, including that exchange visitors might use it to remain in the United States beyond their authorized time. There is also the potential for the Trainee Program to be misused as an employment program. Further, negative experiences for exchange participants could undermine the purpose of the programs. However, State has little data to measure whether such risks to the program are significant.

More than 280,000 foreign nationals travel to  the United States annually using a J-1 visa to participate in the Exchange  Visitor Program. This program encompasses 13 categories of educational  and cultural exchanges designed to enhance understanding between the  people of the United States and those of other countries. Among the largest  exchange programs are the Summer Work Travel Program, which allows  bona fide foreign college and university students to learn about life in the  United States through temporary work and travel, and the Trainee  Program, which, through a structured training program, allows participants  to enhance their skills in their chosen career field. State\u2019s Bureau of  Educational and Cultural Affairs administers the Exchange Visitor Program  through the Office of Exchange Coordination and Designation. Past GAO  and State Office of Inspector General (OIG) reviews cited a few specific  cases where J-1 visa holders participated in unauthorized activities and  cited problems in program management.

We selected these posts because they  are among the top sending countries for the Summer Work Travel Program.  We focused on the Summer Work Travel and the Trainee programs because  they bring in nearly one-half of the Exchange Visitor Program participants.

Sponsors sometimes contract with overseas organizations\u2014such as  student travel agencies\u2014as local partners to help identify and screen  exchange program applicants. Some sponsors serve as intermediaries  between the exchange visitor and a third party, which engages the  exchange visitor in the program activity for the category in which they are  being sponsored. For example, for trainees, the third parties are the  organizations where the exchange visitors will receive training. Third  parties consist of a variety of organizations, which include\u2014but are not  limited to\u2014hotels, law firms, restaurants, Internet companies, and other  private and public sector businesses and organizations.

For  example, the regulations state that the maximum period of the  participation in the Exchange Visitor Program for a trainee, with the  exception of flight training, shall not exceed 18 months. Some sponsors  said they interpreted this provision to mean that an individual could come  to the United States one or more times as a trainee as long as the combined  duration of the visits did not exceed 18 months. In 2002, however, some  sponsors said they were told that the Trainee Program was restricted to a  one-time training session not to exceed 18 months. This clarification in  regulations has surprised some sponsors, according to one of the sponsors  who was notified about this change through a fax from State. A State  official explained that all Trainee sponsors were sent a message through  SEVIS in October 2003, explaining State\u2019s policy on this matter. According  to the documentation, the message was to be addressed to all sponsors that  conduct Trainee programs and all responsible officers and their alternates.", "Moreover, a few sponsors said guidance or interpretations of various  provisions of the regulations have been communicated inconsistently.

State  officials, including the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Bureau  of Educational and Cultural Affairs, said the current sanction/revocation  process that State may use to limit the activities of sponsors that do not  comply with the regulations\u2014or remove a sponsor from the program  altogether\u2014is difficult to enforce. The sanctions range in severity from a  letter of reprimand to an action to revoke a sponsor\u2019s designation. One  sanction that State uses is to deny the sponsor\u2019s request for certification  forms until the compliance issue has been resolved. For example, State  officials described a recent case in which State\u2019s attempt to revoke a  sponsor\u2019s designation was challenged by the sponsor in district court. In  this case, State received complaints from two trainees who alleged they  were not receiving the training that they had expected and were displeased  with their training assignments and compensation. The sponsor in this case  had placed individuals in positions in the hospitality industry.  State  investigated the sponsor\u2019s operation, interviewed a number of program  participants, and concluded that the sponsor was not placing participants  in management training positions but was operating a work program, in  violation of the regulations. State\u2019s in-house revocation board agreed and  supported the sanction of revocation. However, in remanding the matter to  the board for further proceedings, the district court concluded that State's  investigation had been too limited and had not produced evidence adequate  to support the severe punishment of revocation. After a second hearing, the  board overturned the revocation, thereby enabling the sponsor to resume  its program. State concluded that the sanctions\u2019 provisions needed  streamlining and tightening for more effective and assured application.", "State Slow to Revise Regulations \t State has acknowledged that the regulations need revising; however, more  than 3 years after revisions were suggested by the exchange industry they  are still in draft form. According to the Acting Director of the Office of  Exchange Coordination and Designation revisions are in process. For  example, State is revising the Trainee regulations to create a separate  Intern category to accommodate younger, less experienced applicants,  such as students or recent university graduates seeking to gain practical  work experience. The exchange community generally supports the  creation of a new Intern category and, in November 2001, an association of  organizations that sponsor exchange students submitted its proposals for  revising the regulations to State. The Acting Director of the Office of  Exchange Coordination and Designation said that the sections of the  regulations on interns and trainees are still being reviewed at State and  attributed the delay in completing the regulations to the review process. He  also stated that State\u2019s Office of Legal Advisor was given the responsibility  to develop new sanctions for the program 2 years ago. According to the  Assistant Legal Advisor for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, revised  sanctions regulations were drafted and shared with the Bureau of  Educational and Cultural Affairs for review and comment. The Assistant  Legal Advisor stated that recent guidance from the Bureau\u2019s Principal  Deputy Assistant Secretary suggested that further revisions were  warranted to best suit evolving program needs. Once State has completed  its review, the Department of Justice will be consulted prior to publication  of the revised regulations. She stated that while this process could take an  additional 2 to 6 months to complete, the timing should fall well within the  time lines and milestones set forth in a 24-month corrective action plan  proposed by the Bureau in March 2005.", "According to GAO guidance on internal controls, managers should ensure  that effective external communications occur with groups that impact its  program, projects, operations, and other activities. According to seven of  the sponsors we met with and the organization representing sponsors,  communication with State is a problem. For example, one sponsor  described State as reactive rather than proactive in its communication  practices. Representatives of four of the sponsoring organizations  complained that program officers were not always responsive to their  inquiries or were difficult to reach. Some sponsors attributed the  difficulties to an insufficient number of State staff.", "Some sponsors also complained about a lack of feedback from a study  commissioned by State on SEVIS compliance and other issues, which was  completed in December 2003. The report concluded that in some cases the  sponsors\u2019 staff was not adequately trained, that the sponsors did not  maintain required records, and did not fully provide oversight of their  foreign partners, employers, third-party organizations, or the exchange  participants. The report made a number of recommendations on how State  should further clarify the program regulations and help train the sponsors  on both State regulations and their role in maintaining SEVIS data. We met  with six sponsors that participated in the study, and none had received  feedback from State on the results of the study. One said the Acting  Director of the Office of Exchange Coordination and Designation made  some general comments about the study at a meeting of an industry  association.", "Communication between the Office of Exchange Coordination and  Designation and the overseas posts has also been cited as a concern. For  example, one sponsor said there is no mechanism to ensure consistent  interpretation of the regulations by the overseas posts, while another said  the posts are the last to know about program changes. For example, a  sponsor said that even though the office has told them that applicants can  have only one trainee placement, one post was still telling applicants in  2004 that they can participate more than once. Further, a representative of  an exchange industry organization stated that the Office of Exchange  Coordination and Designation knows too little about what is really going on  in the field. This situation may have been the reason ineligible students  from at least one country, Ireland, were allowed to participate in the  Summer Work Travel Program for over 30 years before an apparent  misinterpretation of the regulations was discovered. In 2002, a consular  officer in Dublin asked for clarification on the eligibility of students who  had completed their course work but had not formally graduated,  according to an embassy official. In response, State instructed the posts not  to change their selection procedures for the 2003 season. However,  according to the Acting Director of Office of Exchange Coordination and  Designation, State ultimately confirmed that such students were not  eligible for the program, unless they could demonstrate enrollment in  another degree program, and sent a cable to the posts with its decision in  2004.

They said State will utilize the system currently in place at  DHS, which uses contractors for on-site reviews of schools to verify their  eligibility to register foreign students into the SEVIS system. The  contractors will verify the information that the sponsors submit as part of  the redesignation process and may check the names of the responsible and  alternate responsible officers\u2014and possibly board members\u2014through law  enforcement databases, according to the State officials. They said that as  part of the new compliance effort, sponsors for all nonacademic exchanges  will be required to contract for and submit annual audits of their activities.  The compliance unit will develop a management template to guide the  audits. Currently only sponsors of the Au Pair Program are required to  submit such audits.", "It is too early to determine whether implementation of the planned  compliance unit will resolve all of the issues identified by GAO and OIG.  For example, using contractors to visit the sponsors will address OIG\u2019s  criticism that State does not visit the sponsors. However, State has not  determined what information the contractors need to review to assess how  well the sponsors monitor employers and third parties. Moreover, State has  not provided a written plan describing in detail how the compliance unit  will operate. Funding also remains an issue. State initially plans to cover  the cost of the new compliance unit by redirecting current appropriations  and obtaining\u2014as agreed upon by OMB\u2014about $450,000 of the SEVIS fees  collected from exchange program sponsors by DHS.

Information on overstays is available from DHS\u2019s arrival  and departure database and the results of returnee validation studies  conducted by overseas posts. For example, we asked DHS to check the  total number of J-1 visa recipients in all exchange categories who had  completed their program since January 2003 against its arrival and  departure database to determine which visa holders had departed the  country. The results showed that about 362,000 exchange participants had  concluded their program during this period. The data showed that about 36  percent of the participants had departed the United States by the end of  their program and about 24 percent were potential overstays. However,  the full extent of overstays is uncertain because DHS could not find  information on an additional 40 percent of the J-1 visa holders because they  may have entered the United States before the current entry system was  operational. DHS\u2019 primary method for estimating overstays is to match the  arrival portion of a form collected by DHS when the visitor enters the  United States to the departure portion of the form generally collected by  the airlines when the visitor departs. One of the weaknesses in this system  is that the departure portion of the form is not always submitted to airline  staff. Further, data entry errors by DHS contractors also make it difficult to  match the forms. The U.S. government is phasing in a more comprehensive  entry-exit system, US-VISIT, to correct the weaknesses in its current  system.", "Some overseas posts periodically conduct validation studies to determine if  visa applicants who received J-1 visas at their post have returned to that  country. These studies generally consist of telephone inquiries to the visa  recipient, while some posts have required J-1 visa recipients to report to  the post upon their return. The results vary. For example, one post in the  former Soviet Union conducted a study of its 2004 Summer Work Travel  season that showed that, as of January 20, 2005, 26 percent of the 2004  participants from that country remained in the United States. This post  reported overstay rates of 29 percent for 2003, 25.6 percent for 2002, and 27  percent for 2001. Other posts have reported lower overstay rates. For  example, a post in a Western European country conducted a validation  study of its 2004 Summer Work Travel Program that showed that all of the  visa applicants in the sample who were issued J-1 visas returned home, as  required. The posts can use the results of such studies to guide their  decision making when they adjudicate visas. For example, the post with a  26 percent overstay rate in 2004 developed additional selection factors for  the 2005 Summer Work Travel season to assess the potential for individuals  to return to their country after their programs are completed. However,  these studies are not always statistically valid. Moreover, the Acting  Director of Exchange Coordination and Designation said the post  validation studies are not useful to program officials because the posts do  not follow a standardized methodology.", "J-1 visitors who remain in the United States beyond their program do not  necessarily stay for long periods of time, and not all of them remain in the  United States illegally. According to consular officials we talked with at one  post, some participants in the Summer Work Travel Program from their  country who remain in the United States beyond their program date might  typically overstay anywhere from a few days to no more than a few months.  The consular officials said the participants sometimes remain in the United  States longer if they have not earned sufficient money to cover their  expenses. Others change their visa status to another nonimmigrant  category. For example, the 2004 validation study by one post in the former  Soviet Union country showed that 39 percent of those who had remained in  the United States beyond the completion of the program had either  changed their visa status, got married, or were seeking asylum. Changing  status from a J-1 visa to another visa category is permitted under U.S.  immigration laws in certain circumstances, but Bureau of Consular Affairs  and other officials have stated that it is not the intent of the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Exists for Fraudulent Immigration Claims", "paragraphs": ["DHS data show that a growing number of J-1 visa holders had applied for  political asylum between 1995 and 2004, about 6,300 individuals who  entered the United States with J-1 visas applied for asylum. According to  DHS, the numbers of asylum applications from J-1 visa holders from former  Soviet Union countries have more than doubled since 2000. These  countries include Russia, Belarus, Armenia, and Ukraine. The officials are  concerned that some of these claims are fraudulent, as they doubt that J-1  visa holders\u2014who have to be students in good standing in their  countries\u2014are being persecuted. The recent increase in numbers of such  claims and the similarities of the stories\u2014which indicate coaching, are also  indicators of fraud, according to DHS officials. DHS\u2019 Fraud Detection and  National Security Unit and State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs Office of  Consular Fraud Prevention are monitoring this issue. These units would  turn over any suspected fraud to U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement for investigation. According to a DHS official, U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement is conducting asylum fraud  investigations in Los Angeles and Cleveland. Among the targets of those  investigations are individuals who were admitted with J-1 visas, as well as  several other classes of  nonimmigrants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trainee Category Is Vulnerable to Misuse as Employment Program", "paragraphs": ["The potential exists for the Trainee Program to be misused as an  employment program. Regulations strictly prohibit the use of the trainee  category for ordinary employment purposes, stating in particular that  sponsors may not place trainee participants in positions that are filled or  would be filled by full-time or part-time employees. State and the overseas  posts provided some information describing Trainee Program abuses, but  they did not have information on the extent of the problem.", "In one example, a sponsor learned that an organization it had contracted  with to help select and place trainees had placed the participants with  employers that had contracts to provide H-2B temporary workers. The  organization had participated in the Trainee Program because the H-2B  visa category was at its limit and it was looking for an alternative way to  receive foreign workers.", "In another example, a staffing agency recruited about 650 electrical  engineers, primarily from Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania, to come to  the United States as trainees. Ostensibly, the plan was to train the  engineers in the United States because they would be working on  projects in Europe that required knowledge of U.S. standards. However,  the organization served as an electrical contractor, placing the trainees  on U.S. construction projects as electricians. Because it was not  designated to sponsor trainees, the staffing agency approached a few  designated sponsors to issue the DS-2019 forms. State received  complaints from the trainees and the electrician\u2019s union and  investigated this case. To correct the situation, the sponsors and the  union eventually found appropriate placements for some of the  engineers. Others returned to their countries. According to a State  official, the staffing agency went out of business, and the principal party  was indicted on criminal charges.", "The Acting Director of the Office of Exchange Coordination and  Designation described agricultural training programs as problematic  because of the potential for fraud. He said the abuses are not hidden and  that there is not even an attempt to represent jobs as training, and that  employers refer to the participants as employees rather than trainees. For  example, a 2004 DHS investigation involved four Chinese nationals brought  to the United States by an individual to participate in an agricultural  program sponsored by a Florida university. The trainees were placed with a  dairy farm that had an agreement with the university. DHS found that only  one trainee had a firm grasp of English, which called into question the  trainees\u2019 eligibility for a J-1 visa as well as whether the trainees were  receiving training or simply employed at the farm. Upon further  investigation DHS found that the individual had brought 17 trainees to the  United States to participate in the university\u2019s training program. The  trainees were placed at four participating dairies. DHS also found that only  one of the dairies reported having a structured training plan. According to  DHS, the university violated regulations concerning sponsoring  organizations for exchange trainees by failing to ensure that the J-1 trainees  were properly compensated and possessed the required language ability to  participate in an English language-based training program. DHS further  stated that the dairies were exploiting the J-1 trainees for cheap labor and  in most cases were not concerned with actually training them beyond what  was necessary to perform their work. The OIG\u2019s 2000 report also described  abuse of the Trainee Program. In two of the cases that the OIG investigated,  U.S. workers complained that they were replaced by trainees.", "Despite such misuses, Labor officials stated that it is not likely that the  exchange programs will have any effect on the U.S labor market because of  the small number of J-1 exchange visitors (about 283,000 in fiscal year  2004) relative to the U.S. workforce. However, the U.S. government does  not collect data to assess any potential effect of exchange programs on the  U.S. labor market. Labor officials said that a monthly household survey, the  Current Population Survey, reviews a sample of households to compile  labor statistics on foreign-born workers. However, the numbers of  exchange program participants is so small that even if they were captured  by these surveys there is no way to separate out the effect of their labor  participation from that of the other foreign-born workers. Also, it is  possible that exchange participants would not be captured in the survey  because of their housing arrangements. For instance, if they do not reside  in traditional housing units and live in dormitories or resort-provided  housing, they may not be included in the survey sample."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Exchange Participants Could Be Exploited or Have Otherwise Negative Experiences", "paragraphs": ["The Summer Work Travel and Trainee participants generally have positive  experiences in the United States, according to the sponsors and  participants we met with. Some sponsors and overseas representatives  survey their participants on their experiences. One of the sponsors said its  research showed that about 85 percent of its participants were satisfied  with their placement. All of the Summer Work Travel and Trainee  participants whom we met with described their overall experiences as  positive.", "When the participants do complain, the complaints are generally minor,  usually involving disappointments with their placement, housing, or  location. The Office of Exchange Coordination and Designation  investigates all complaints that are brought to its attention, according to  State officials. In addition, the regulations require the sponsors to inform  State of any serious problems or controversy that could be expected to  bring State or the sponsors\u2019 exchange programs into disrepute. However,  we found that although State may follow up on such reports, it does not  systematically document or analyze them. Such an analysis could be used  to identify program weaknesses.  State acknowledged that is does not have  procedures for recording and maintaining all complaints in all categories  and stated such procedures are currently being prepared and will be  incorporated into the Foreign Affairs Manual.", "Occasionally, the exchange participants have negative experiences as a  result of exploitation by a third party. A State official described an incident  in which about 45 current Summer Work Travel participants were placed in  substandard housing. Apparently, the housing was leased by an employee  of the sponsoring organization. The sponsor subsequently placed the  students in better housing, and the OIG is investigating the incident at the  Exchange Visitor Program office\u2019s request. State officials described another  situation in which they fear a third party might have exploited the exchange  participants. In this case, Bulgarian Summer Work Travel participants were  approached by an employee of the local program representative while they  were still in Bulgaria and told that the jobs arranged for them in New Jersey  by the U.S. sponsor were no longer viable and that they were instead to  report to jobs in Florida. As a result, when the Bulgarians arrived in the  United States, they refused to continue on to New Jersey with the sponsor\u2019s  representative, who met them at the airport. Instead, they had tickets to  Florida and went there to work for a third-party organization that provided  cleaning services to hotels. State and DHS are currently investigating this  case.", "When such situations receive negative media attention, it can further  undermine the purpose of the program. For example, a July 13, 2005, article  in a New Hampshire newspaper reported on the plight of three students  from Romania who arrived in the United States on July 5, 2005, to find that  the jobs they were promised no longer existed. News of these situations  may even reach the foreign media. For example, a June 2004 United Press  International article concerning an incident affecting Russian students  stated the incident was also reported by the Moscow Times. As a result of  such situations at least one foreign government has discussed its concerns  with U.S. embassy officials in their country, according to a Bureau of  Consular Affairs official."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Summer Worker Travel and Trainee Exchange Visitor Program  categories are important components of U.S. public diplomacy efforts.

Also, State  has been slow in establishing a compliance unit, which would bolster  oversight efforts, despite recommendations from State\u2019s OIG to do so. GAO  guidance on internal control standards instructs agencies to identify risks  that could impede the efficient and effective achievement of program goals.  Once these risks are identified, they should be analyzed for possible effect.  For example, an analysis of complaints and problems that participants and  sponsors report could uncover program weaknesses, and these results  could be used to guide the efforts of the compliance unit. Assessing such  risks is a necessary step to mitigating the risks.

We  selected Poland because it was the number one sending country for  Summer Work Travel participants and within the top-10 sending posts for  trainees in 2004.
