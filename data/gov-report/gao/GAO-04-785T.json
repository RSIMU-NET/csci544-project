Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, laws have been passed that require a more extensive use of biometric technologies in the federal government.

Biometric technologies vary in complexity, capabilities, and performance, and can be used to verify or establish a person's identity. Leading biometric technologies include facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, hand geometry, and iris recognition. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and subsequently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), has been examining the use of biometrics for aviation security for several years. TSA has three current pilot projects that will study the use of biometrics to enhance aviation security: the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), registered traveler, and an access control pilot program designed to secure sensitive areas of an airport. It is important to bear in mind that effective security cannot be achieved by relying on technology alone. Technology and people must work together as part of an overall security process. Weaknesses in any of these areas diminish the effectiveness of the security process. The security process needs to account for limitations in biometric technology. For example, some people cannot enroll in a biometrics system because they lack the appropriate body part. Similarly, errors sometimes occur during matching operations. Exception processing that is not as good as biometric-based primary processing could be exploited as a security hole. Further, non-technological processes for enrollment are critical to the success of a biometrics-based identity management system. Before a person is granted a biometric credential, the issuing authority needs to assure itself that the person is eligible to receive such a credential. We have found that three key considerations need to be addressed before a decision is made to design, develop, and implement biometrics into a security system: (1) decisions must be made on how the technology will be used; (2) a detailed cost-benefit analysis must be conducted to determine that the benefits gained from a system outweigh the costs; and (3) a trade-off analysis must be conducted between the increased security, which the use of biometrics would provide, and the effect on areas such as privacy and convenience. Security concerns need to be balanced with practical cost and operational considerations as well as political and economic interests. A risk management approach can help federal agencies identify and address security concerns. To develop security systems with biometrics, the high-level goals of these systems need to be defined, and the concept of operations that will embody the people, process, and technologies required to achieve these goals needs to be developed. With these answers, the proper role of biometric technologies in aviation security can be determined."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the use of  biometrics for aviation security.

For example, members of a community  routinely recognize one another by how they look or how their voices  sound\u2014by something they are. Automated teller machines (ATM)  recognize customers from their presentation of a bank card\u2014something  they have\u2014and their entering a personal identification number (PIN)\u2014 something they know.

The distinctive features are located and one or more  samples are extracted, encoded, and stored as a reference template for  future comparisons.

Consequently, each time an  individual\u2019s biometric data are captured, the new template is likely to be  unique. Depending on the biometric system, a person may need to present  biometric data several times in order to enroll. Either the reference  template may then represent an amalgam of the captured data or several  enrollment templates may be stored. The quality of the template or  templates is critical in the overall success of the biometric application.  Because biometric features can change over time, people may have to  reenroll to update their reference template. Some technologies can update  the reference template during matching operations.", "The enrollment process also depends on the quality of the identifier the  enrollee presents.

Obviously, neither extreme is reasonable, and biometric systems  must operate somewhere between the two.", "For most applications, how much risk one is willing to tolerate is the  overriding factor, which translates into determining the acceptable FMR.  The greater the risk entailed by a false match, the lower the tolerable FMR.  For example, an application that controlled access to a secure area would  require that the FMR be set low, which would result in a high FNMR.  However, an application that controlled access to a bank\u2019s ATM might  have to sacrifice some degree of security and set a higher FMR (and hence  a lower FNMR) to avoid the risk of irritating legitimate customers by  wrongly rejecting them. As figure 1 shows, selecting a lower FMR  increases the FNMR. Perfect security would require setting the FMR to 0,  in which case the FNMR would be 1. At the other extreme, setting the  FNMR to 0 would result in an FMR of 1.", "Vendors often use equal error rate (EER), an additional metric derived  from FMR and FNMR, to describe the accuracy of their biometric systems.  EER refers to the point at which FMR equals FNMR. Setting a system\u2019s  threshold at its EER will result in the probability that a person is falsely  matched equaling the probability that a person is falsely not matched.

Reaction,  which requires human involvement, responds to detected breaches to  thwart attacks before damage can be done. Because absolute protection is  impossible to achieve, a security program that does not incorporate  detection and reaction is incomplete.", "Biometrics can support the protection component of a security program. It  is important to realize that deploying them will not automatically eliminate  all security risks. Technology is not a solution in isolation. Effective  security also entails having a well-trained staff to follow and enforce  policies and procedures. Weaknesses in the security process or failures by  people to operate the technology or implement the security process can  diminish the effectiveness of technology.", "Accordingly, there is a need for the security process to account for  limitations in technology. For example, procedures for exception  processing would also need to be carefully planned. As we described, not  all people can enroll in a biometrics system. Similarly, false matches and  false nonmatches will also sometimes occur. Procedures need to be  developed to handle these situations. Exception processing that is not as  good as biometric-based primary processing could be exploited as a  security hole. The effect on the process is directly related to the  performance of the technology. In our study of biometrics for border  security, we found that fingerprint recognition appears to be the most  mature of the biometric technologies. Fingerprint recognition has been  used the longest and has been used with databases containing up to 40  million entries.

Biometrics can help  ensure that people can only enroll into a security system once and to  ensure that a person presenting himself before the security system is the  same person that enrolled into the system. However, biometrics cannot  necessarily link a person to his or her true identity. While biometrics  would make it more difficult for people to establish multiple identities, if  the one identity a person claimed were not his or her true identity, then  the person would be linked to the false identity in the biometric system.  The use of biometrics does not relieve the credential-issuing authority of  the responsibility of ensuring the identity of the person requesting the  credential or of conducting a security check, commensurate with the level  of access being granted, to assure itself that the person is entitled to  receive the credential.

We have found that  three key considerations need to be addressed before a decision is made  to design, develop, and implement biometrics into a security system:  1.  Decisions must be made on how the technology will be used.  2.  A detailed cost-benefit analysis must be conducted to determine  that the benefits gained from a system outweigh the costs.  3.  A trade-off analysis must be conducted between the increased  security, which the use of biometrics would provide, and the effect  on areas such as privacy and convenience.", "Security concerns need to be balanced with practical cost and operational  considerations as well as political and economic interests. A risk  management approach can help federal agencies identify and address  security concerns. To develop security systems with biometrics, the high- level goals of these systems need to be defined, and the concept of  operations that will embody the people, process, and technologies  required to achieve these goals needs to be developed.
