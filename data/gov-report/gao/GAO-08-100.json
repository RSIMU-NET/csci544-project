The act also required GAO to study the feasibility of matching bankruptcy records with child support records to assure that filers with child support obligations are identified. GAO therefore (1) identified the percent of bankruptcy filers with obligations nationwide, (2) examined the potential for routine data matching to facilitate the identification of filers with child support obligations, and (3) studied the feasibility and cost of doing so. GAO interviewed child support enforcement and bankruptcy officials at the federal level and in six states. GAO also conducted a nationwide test data match and reviewed national bankruptcy filings for people with support obligations in Texas for an indication of whether filers are failing to provide this information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, about 7 percent of individuals who filed for bankruptcy between October 17, 2005, and October 17, 2006--the first year of the bankruptcy act implementation--were noncustodial parents with child support orders. They, in turn, represented about one-half of 1 percent of the 9.9 million noncustodial parents with orders to pay child support. While these proportions are small, they represented 45,346 adults and at least as many children. Routine data matching might identify individuals who have not reported their child support obligations. However, GAO estimated from a random sample file review that 98 percent of noncustodial parents nationwide with orders in Texas had volunteered this information when they filed. (The results could be higher or lower in other states.) Another potential benefit would be to reduce the workload for state child support agencies by providing positive identification of bankruptcy filers with orders under the states' purview by comparing the full social security numbers (SSNs) of individuals in both bankruptcy and child support databases. This would help address the current situation state agency officials described, in which significant numbers of the notices they receive from bankruptcy trustees included only partial SSNs of the named person, imposing additional work on staff to make a positive identification in their databases. For bankruptcy case trustees participating in the U.S. Trustee Program, we found this to be the case, even though program guidance--covering 84 of the 90 bankruptcy districts--calls for case trustees to provide full SSNs in notices sent to state agencies. These notices are not part of any public record and trustee program officials said this use of the full SSNs is consistent with executive branch policies designed to guard privacy. For the remaining six districts, administered under a separate program, no guidance has been developed. A data matching system is technically feasible, but it would be a complex and costly undertaking, and would involve addressing some statutory and policy considerations. Regarding notifying state agencies of the match results, federal child support enforcement officials said that their national automated system could disseminate this data after modifications to federal and state systems. However, a data matching system would not offer a comprehensive alternative to the trustee notification system, because it would not transmit information to custodial parents. Regarding cost, bankruptcy and child support enforcement officials said that the development and implementation of an automated interface between two separate databases is a complex and costly undertaking, requiring modifications to each, with many steps required to assure that the matching system is developed and deployed without critical flaws and allowing for the secure exchange of data. Also, bankruptcy officials cited some statutory and policy considerations to releasing their own data or to performing a data match. It would also duplicate a portion of the current trustee notification process. In view of these findings, instituting a data matching system may not be warranted, especially if the case trustees can provide full SSNs of bankruptcy filers when notifying state agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Millions of parents nationwide do not live with one or more of their minor  Millions of parents nationwide do not live with one or more of their minor  children.

We chose these  six states for their diverse geography, caseload sizes, and administrative  structures.

Typically, OCSE conducts matches with entities that have  information common among many individuals in its target population or  that are expected to yield significant results. See figure 3.", "With regard to using the results of a data match, current technical  capability differs among agencies. OCSE and some state agency officials  we spoke with said that OCSE\u2019s Federal Case Registry could disseminate  this information to the 54 state agencies after modifications to this system  and state systems. Upon receiving an electronic notification that a  noncustodial parent in their caseload has filed for bankruptcy, state  agencies would also be able to identify custodial parents in their caseloads  who are associated with these noncustodial parent filers. However,  notifying the custodial parent about the bankruptcy is not currently part of  the state agencies\u2019 or OCSE\u2019s duties. Also, these agencies do not have  much information on custodial parents who are not part of their state CSE  programs. Alternatively, case trustees could use the match results to  continue carrying out their statutorily required duty to notify these  parents. However, EOUST officials told us they would need to build the  capacity to transmit the match results from EOUST to case trustees who  participate in the U.S. Trustee Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Data Match Would Likely Involve Substantial Start- up Costs and Would also Duplicate a Part of the Current Notification System", "paragraphs": ["Although electronic data sharing across government agencies is not  uncommon, it can be a complex and costly undertaking. Data matching  would need to be done frequently (e.g., weekly) to be useful, according to  some state agency officials, and would likely involve developing  automated interfaces to exchange data effectively on a recurring basis. In  developing such systems, to reduce the risks to acceptable levels,  following and effectively implementing accepted best practices in systems  development and implementation (commonly referred to as disciplined  processes) is important. It would include at a minimum    defining the detailed requirements for the new or modified systems and  interfaces, and  thorough and complete testing to determine that new or modified  systems will work as intended.", "Even when the agencies have effectively implemented the disciplined  processes necessary to reduce risks to acceptable levels, a framework is  needed to guide a data sharing project such as this. Specifically, agencies  generally enter into written agreements when they share information for  conducting data matches. Based on their experience, OCSE officials  estimate that developing such agreements generally requires many  months.", "Officials from OCSE and EOUST believe that system modifications that  would precede data sharing would involve significant costs. They said, for  example, they would need to build an exchange method that would allow  for the secure exchange of data. Overall, OCSE officials estimate that their  development costs would be between $2 million and $2.5 million and  would take between 15 and 18 months to implement.", "Once a matching process is established, disseminating match results  would not be a cost-free proposition. EOUST officials said that it would  take a considerable effort to establish an internal process, either manual  or automated, for disseminating the match results to the case trustees.  While state agencies could accept match results from OCSE using an  existing system, OCSE officials said that this would require building this  capability into the state agencies\u2019 respective automated systems. States  would incur some of these up-front costs, according to these officials.  Additional costs may be incurred at the county level, with officials at one  state agency saying that counties, and not just the state, might need to  modify their systems to receive matched data.", "Once the necessary interfaces and system changes have been developed  and effectively implemented, there are ongoing operation and  maintenance costs to consider. OCSE estimates annual costs of between  $35,000 and $50,000, depending on which entity conducts the match. These  costs would include computer processing time and staff resources for  managing data transactions. For example, EOUST currently employs two  full-time staffers to extract bankruptcy data weekly from the  Administrative Office\u2019s bankruptcy case database, and a data match  between the bankruptcy system and CSE program would likely involve  staffing.", "Some Administrative Office, EOUST, and CSE officials expressed concern  about implementing an automated system providing notification of  noncustodial parent filers to state agencies because of potential  duplication between any new automated system and the existing paper  system, which was implemented as a result of the Bankruptcy Reform Act.  If a new system duplicates the notices that state agencies now receive  from bankruptcy case trustees, it could add to their workload. That is,  state agencies would be receiving information about bankruptcy filers  with child support obligations from both trustees and OCSE unless the  Bankruptcy Code is amended.", "Overall, officials from several of the state agencies we talked with said  that while conducting electronic matching and sending the results to their  agencies could be useful to them, the costs might not warrant such a  match. Moreover, according to OCSE officials, state agency directors they  have communicated with about a potential data match have similarly  noted this trade-off."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials of the Administrative Office Say That Their Current Policy Does Not Allow for a Data Match while Officials from Other Programs Say It Could Be Acceptable", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the Administrative Office said that their current policy does  not allow a data match while officials from EOUST and OCSE said that a  data match would be acceptable if the match met specific privacy  guidelines. Officials at the Administrative Office cited a policy against  releasing and disseminating their bankruptcy data to OCSE. This federal  judiciary policy specifically bars release of the names and SSNs of  bankruptcy filers to HHS on the grounds that the judicial branch must  remain an independent and objective adjudicator of creditor claims.  Administrative Office officials also noted that data on bankruptcy filers is  available at EOUST, which is responsible for managing bankruptcy cases  and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and procedures.", "For their part, officials at EOUST stated that their policy on data sharing is  guided by the Privacy Act\u2014the federal law governing federal agencies\u2019 use  and disclosure of records containing individuals\u2019 personal information.  The officials said that EOUST\u2019s current policy implementing the routine  use exception of the Privacy Act does not support a match with the system  of records in which the bankruptcy data are kept, because identifying  bankruptcy filers with child support obligations is not part of its mission.  However, if OCSE requested the bankruptcy data from EOUST and  EOUST determined that this request falls within the law enforcement  agency exception of the Privacy Act, then EOUST officials said that it  could share its data with OCSE.", "According to OCSE officials, it would be acceptable for OCSE data to be  matched with bankruptcy data and for OCSE to disseminate the results to  state agencies on a recurring basis. However, OCSE officials noted that the  match results could only be used for CSE program purposes. That is,  EOUST or the Administrative Office could perform a match using CSE  data and bankruptcy data and return the results to OCSE, but these  entities could not use the CSE data or match results for their own  purposes, such as sending match results to case trustees. With respect to  sending match results to custodial parents outside the CSE program,  OCSE officials said that OCSE would not be the appropriate entity to do  this because it is neither authorized nor funded to interact with these  parents in this way."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["While matching federal bankruptcy data with child support records might  facilitate the identification of some additional bankruptcy filers with child  support obligations and improve the current system for notifying state  agencies, these potential improvements seem modest in comparison to the  costs, efforts, and statutory and policy considerations involved in  implementing and maintaining a data matching system. As a result, it  appears that instituting a routine data matching system may not be  warranted. A relatively small percentage of bankruptcy filers have orders  to pay child support. In addition, a process is currently in place to identify  and notify custodial parents and state agencies of bankruptcy proceedings,  as called for under the Bankruptcy Reform Act. Moreover, a data matching  system with results transmitting electronically to state agencies would not  offer a comprehensive alternative to the trustee notification system insofar  as it would not transmit information to custodial parents and would  partially duplicate the trustee notification process. Finally, legal and policy  considerations would need to be addressed to institute data matching  between these two systems.", "Although these challenges are not insurmountable and data matching can  be a useful tool, in this case, there is an alternative that should improve  information sharing between case trustees and state child support  agencies within the current system of trustee notices. Notwithstanding  EOUST guidance calling for case trustees to provide the full SSNs, some  case trustees only provide partial SSNs. Although EOUST cannot require  case trustees to provide the full SSN, its examination of the trustee  notification process might identify reasons for case trustees not providing  the full SSNs as well as measures to help encourage the provision of full  SSNs in notices to state agencies. Without EOUST more actively  encouraging case trustees to provide full SSNs, state agencies may  continue to experience more difficulties than necessary in accomplishing  the child support goals of the Bankruptcy Reform Act. While neither the  Judicial Conference nor the Administrative Office has developed similar  guidance for bankruptcy administrators, the same reasons exist for state  agencies having full SSNs, regardless of which program supervises case  trustees. These reasons warrant some examination of the trustee  notification process in the bankruptcy administrator districts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive and Judicial Branch Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve the bankruptcy trustee notification process for state child  support enforcement agencies called for under the Bankruptcy Reform  Act, we are making two recommendations.", "First, we recommend that the Attorney General direct the Director of the  Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to more actively encourage case  trustees to provide state agencies the full SSNs of bankruptcy filers. This  could be accomplished, for example, by working with case trustees to  identify and address any issues related to implementation of the current  guidance, such as lack of clarity in the guidance or concerns about  preserving the security of SSNs.", "Second, we recommend that the Judicial Conference of the United States  work with bankruptcy administrators in the six bankruptcy court districts  in Alabama and North Carolina not subject to EOUST guidance to examine  whether case trustees should provide state agencies with the full SSN of  bankruptcy filers. This might be done in the following ways:  Inform bankruptcy administrators and the bankruptcy court judges in  those six districts about the importance of including the full SSN, how  this information would be used by state agencies if provided, and to do  so in a way that preserves the security of the information.", "Work with the bankruptcy administrators and bankruptcy court judges  in those six districts to identify and if possible, address any issues or  concerns, including the security of the information, related to the use  of full SSNs in the notices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided Justice, the Administrative Office, and HHS with a draft of  this report for their review and comments.

We also interviewed bankruptcy and CSE  program officials. This information was also used to review the national  court, bankruptcy, and the CSE data systems that might be used for a  potential recurring, national data match.", "To identify the proportion of parents with orders to pay child support who  filed for bankruptcy nationwide, we worked with the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE)  to develop an analysis plan. This plan outlined how they would match their  national CSE data with a national extract of personal bankruptcy filers  that we obtained from the Administrative Office of United States Courts  (the Administrative Office). The national CSE data from the Federal Case  Registry, as of June 2007, contained information about individuals who are  participants of the CSE program and individuals who are not participants  of the CSE program but had orders established after 1998 to pay child  support. The national CSE data also included data from the Federal Offset  Program file, which contains only current information about noncustodial  parents that participate in the CSE program who owe past due child  support. The bankruptcy data from the U.S. Party/Case Index included  names and Social Security numbers (SSNs) of all individuals that filed for  Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy between October 17, 2005, and  October 17, 2006, the first year of implementation under the Bankruptcy  Reform Act.", "We recognize that the difference in time frames for the bankruptcy and  CSE data could mean that we over-or under-counted individuals in this  population. For example, we may have under-counted if a noncustodial  parent\u2019s order ended in May 2007, but this noncustodial parent filed for  bankruptcy on August 1, 2006. However, we determined that this was not a  significant methodological limitation for the purposes of testing this data  match and our analysis.", "From the Administrative Office we received 839,597 records of bankruptcy  case data. After cleaning the data, 642,709 records were left for our work.  Records were removed for the following reasons: missing SSN, bad SSN  (more or less than nine digits), text strings instead of SSN, duplicates, and  bankruptcy chapters other than 7 and 13. We had several communications  with the system administrators to clarify our reasoning before dropping  any records. We were told that although the system has data checks there  is no automatic cleaning performed. Rather, notices are sent to the district  courts and it is left to them to correct the data.", "We assessed the reliability of the respective bankruptcy and CSE data by  reviewing existing information about these data and the systems that  produced them, interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about these  data, and performing electronic testing. Because of OCSE\u2019s legal concerns,  we agreed that they would not provide us with child support case data.  Instead, they performed the test match of the bankruptcy data and  national CSE data themselves to meet certain specifications we provided,  and included some information to allow us to assess the work performed.  If we are not provided with underlying data, the ability to conduct  electronic testing as a part of the data reliability assessment is limited. For  analyses such as these, electronic testing of the data is generally a routine  part of the reliability assessment. However, based on interviews of  knowledgeable officials and reviews of relevant documentation, and  because OCSE routinely performs SSN checks with the Social Security  Administration, we have sufficient reason to believe that the OCSE data  are reliable for the purpose of this report. In preparation for matching, we  eliminated duplicate SSNs from the data within each bankruptcy chapter,  which brought our total to 630,075 individuals who filed for bankruptcy.  This total double-counts the 1,538 individuals who filed for both Chapter 7  and Chapter 13 bankruptcy.", "To help determine the potential benefits of data matching on a routine  basis, we conducted a match ourselves of national bankruptcy filings with  CSE data in Texas to ascertain whether bankruptcy filers volunteered  their child support obligations when they file for bankruptcy. Among the  six states we contacted, Texas was readily able to provide us with an  extract of their child support caseload. Our universe totaled 1,931  individuals, which included noncustodial parents with child support  orders who were participating in the Texas CSE program at some point  between October 17, 2005, and October 17, 2006, and who filed for  bankruptcy between October 17, 2005, and October 17, 2006. From this  universe, we then selected a simple random probability sample of 100  noncustodial parents. With this probability sample, each member of the  study population had a nonzero probability of being included, and that  probability could be computed for any member. Each sample element was  subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the  members of the population, including those who were not selected.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain  the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that the interval ranging  from less than 1 percent to over 7 percent would contain the true  percentages of our sample population who completed all of their  bankruptcy paperwork and had not reported their child support  obligations.", "To conduct our review of the bankruptcy case files for the Texas sample,  we developed a data collection instrument to gather information  systematically from the selected bankruptcy files and used the  Administrative Office\u2019s electronic public access service to review all  bankruptcy filings and to record whether the child support obligation was  reported in the bankruptcy paperwork. Bankruptcy filers (and their  attorneys) can report these obligations in a number of places in the  paperwork. We did not determine whether the individuals who neglected  to report their obligations eventually did so when asked by a case trustee.  The results of this case file review cannot be generalized nationwide;  however, they can be generalized to the population of 1,931 noncustodial  parents with IV-D orders on record in the automated system of the Texas  State CSE program who also filed for bankruptcy nationwide and are  intended for illustrative purposes. Moreover, it is possible that we  identified some individuals as non-reporters due to a timing issue rather  than their not disclosing a current obligation. While we attempted to  match the time frames of the bankruptcy and child support data as closely  as possible, it is possible that an individual\u2019s child support status on the  exact date they filed for bankruptcy might not have been captured in our  data match. We determined that this timing issue was not a significant  methodological limitation because we found so few filers that did not  report their child support obligations.", "To help us understand the potential benefits as well as the feasibility and  cost of data matching on a routine basis, we interviewed officials in both  the bankruptcy system and the CSE program, including officials  representing federal, regional, and state entities. In interviews with these  officials, we also discussed challenges that data matching would involve  for all parties, including technical, legal, financial, and security challenges  that data matching would entail for all parties. We spoke with officials in  the Administrative Office, the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees, and  OCSE. We also interviewed officials at state agencies in Alabama,  California, Illinois, New York, Texas, and West Virginia. We chose these  six states for their diverse geography, caseload sizes, and administrative  structures. Our work at the six state agencies focused on the notices they  receive from case trustees under the new DSO provisions of the  Bankruptcy Reform Act rather than the notices they receive from  bankruptcy courts under the more general requirement that all creditors  specified in bankruptcy filings are to be notified by the courts.  Additionally, we interviewed 5 regional U.S. Trustees and 1 bankruptcy  administrator in Alabama and the 16 case trustees who report to them in  bankruptcy districts in these six states.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2006 to January  2008 with generally accepted government auditing standards.
