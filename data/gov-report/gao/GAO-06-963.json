Against the backdrop of this litigation, Congress enacted a temporary exemption from antitrust laws for higher education institutions in 1992. The exemption allows limited collaboration regarding financial aid practices with the goal of promoting equal access to education. The exemption applies only to institutional financial aid and can only be used by schools that admit students without regard to ability to pay. In passing an extension to the exemption in 2001, Congress directed GAO to study the effects of the exemption. GAO examined (1) how many schools used the exemption and what joint practices they implemented, (2) trends in costs and institutional grant aid at schools using the exemption, (3) how expected family contributions at schools using the exemption compare to those at similar schools not using the exemption, and (4) the effects of the exemption on affordability and enrollment. GAO surveyed schools, analyzed school and student-level data, and developed econometric models. GAO used extensive peer review to obtain comments from outside experts and made changes as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-eight schools--all highly selective, private 4-year institutions--formed a group to use the antitrust exemption and developed a common methodology for assessing financial need, which the group called the consensus approach. The methodology used elements already a part of another need analysis methodology; schools modified this methodology and reached agreement on how to define those elements. By the 2004-2005 school year, 25 of 28 schools in the group were using the consensus approach. Schools' implementation of the approach varied, however, with officials from 12 of the 25 schools reporting that they partially implemented it, in part because they believed it would be costly to do so. Over the last 5 years, tuition, room, and board costs among schools using the antitrust exemption increased by 13 percent compared to 7 percent at all other private 4-year schools not using the exemption. While the amount of institutional aid at schools using the exemption also increased--it did so at a slower rate. The average institutional grant aid award per student increased by 7 percent from $18,675 in 2000-2001 to $19,901 in 2005-2006. There was virtually no difference in the amount students and their families were expected to pay between schools using the exemption and similar schools not using the exemption. While officials from schools using the exemption expected that students accepted to several of their schools would experience less variation in the amount they were expected to pay, GAO found that students accepted to schools using the exemption and comparable schools not using the exemption experienced similar variation in the amount they were expected to pay. Not all schools using the consensus approach chose to adopt all the elements of the methodology, a factor that may account for the lack of consistency in expected family contributions among schools using the exemption. Based on GAO's analysis, schools' use of the consensus approach did not have a significant impact on affordability--the amount students and families paid for college--or affect the likelihood of enrollment at those schools to date. While GAO found that the use of the consensus approach resulted in higher amounts of need-based grant aid awarded to some student groups compared to their counterparts at schools not using the consensus approach, the total amount of grant aid awarded was not significantly affected. It was likely that grant aid awards shifted from non-need-based aid, such as academic and athletic scholarships, to aid based on a student's financial need. Finally, implementing the consensus approach did not increase the likelihood of low-income or minority students enrolling at schools using the consensus approach compared to schools that did not. The group of schools using the exemption reviewed this report and stated it was a careful and objective report. However, they had concerns about the data used in GAO's econometric analysis, which GAO believes were reliable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1991, the U.S. Department of Justice sued nine colleges and universities,  alleging that by collectively making financial aid determinations for  students accepted to more than one of these schools, the schools had  unlawfully conspired to restrain trade in violation of the Sherman Act.  Specifically, Justice argued that by agreeing upon the amount of money  that the families of admitted students would be expected to pay towards  their student\u2019s education, these schools were engaging in price fixing.  Justice and the schools ultimately reached settlements that ended these  activities. These schools, which are among the nation\u2019s most prestigious  private universities, had engaged in these activities for more than 30 years.", "Against the backdrop of this litigation, in 1992 Congress enacted a  temporary exemption from the antitrust laws for higher education  institutions that has been renewed several times and is set to expire in  2008. Under the exemption, schools are allowed a limited degree of  collaboration on financial aid practices in the hope that it would further  the government\u2019s goal of promoting equal access to educational  opportunities for students, including low income and minority students.  Under the exemption, schools that admit students without regard to ability  to pay would be able to develop and use common principles of financial  aid policies and make changes to formulas used to calculate financial aid  awards, but not discuss specific students\u2019 awards. Specifically, such  schools would be allowed to engage in the following joint practices:  1.  agreeing to award financial aid only on the basis of demonstrated  2.  using common principles of analysis for determining financial need;  3.  using a common aid application form; and  4.  exchanging, through an independent third party, financial information  submitted by students and their families.", "The exemption only applies to an institution\u2019s own aid. Federal aid, which  is allocated based on a statutory formula, was not targeted by the  exemption. Proponents of the exemption believe that common principles  could lead to a more equitable allocation of aid, make attendance at  schools using the exemption more affordable, and, in turn, increase  enrollment of low income students at these schools. Moreover, proponents  believe that allowing schools to use common principles for determining  financial need should reduce variation among schools in what a family is  expected to pay and enable students to choose a school without making  cost the defining factor. On the other hand, some are concerned that  exempting schools from antitrust laws would reduce competition.  Specifically, with less competition, some students would pay more for  college because their opportunities to consider price differences when  choosing schools would be diminished.", "In passing the 2001 extension to the exemption, Congress directed GAO to  study whether the exemption resulted in changes in the amount students  and their families would pay for college. In response to this mandate, we  determined: (1) how many schools used the exemption and what joint  practices these schools implemented, (2) trends in cost of attendance and  institutional grant aid at schools using the exemption, (3) how expected  family contributions at schools using the exemption compare to those at  similar schools that did not use the exemption, and (4) the effects of the  exemption on affordability and enrollment.", "To determine the number of schools that made use of the exemption since  1992, we reviewed literature and studies on the exemption, interviewed  higher education associations, and reviewed documents that identified a  group of schools that were using the exemption. We interviewed officials  of these schools, reviewed reports of their activities, and collected  information on their financial aid policies. To determine if other schools  might have formed groups to participate in activities allowed under the  exemption, we also surveyed selected similar schools and found no such  other groups.", "To determine trends in cost of attendance\u2014tuition, room, and board\u2014and  institutional grant aid at the schools using the exemption, we collected  data from them and supplemented it with information available from the  U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data  System (IPEDS) for school years 2000-2001 through 2005-2006. We  received data from 26 of the 28 schools using the exemption. We  determined that the IPEDS and institutional data were sufficiently reliable  and valid for purposes of our review.", "To determine how expected family contributions (EFC) at schools using  the exemption compared to those at similar schools not using the  exemption, we collected and compared student-level EFC data from both  sets of schools as of April 1, 2006. To assess the extent of variation in EFC  across multiple schools, we isolated the EFCs of individual students  accepted at (1) multiple schools using the exemption, (2) multiple schools  not using the exemption, and (3) both schools using the exemption and  schools that did not. While EFC determinations of students accepted at  both schools using the exemption and those that did not best show the  extent of variation because it allows us to control for differences in  student characteristics, this group of students was small. Thus, we  supplemented our analysis with data from the other two groups listed.  Based on our discussions with school officials on the steps taken to  ensure reliability of the EFC data, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable and valid for purposes of our review. See appendix I  for further details of our statistical analysis.", "To assess the effects of the exemption on affordability and enrollment, we  developed econometric models to examine the effects of the exemption on  tuition, financial aid (including grants and loans), amount paid for college  (measured by the total cost of attendance less total grant aid), and student  enrollment at schools using the exemption. Determining \u201ceffect\u201d requires  both a treatment group (those schools using the exemption) and a control  group (a comparable set of schools that did not use the exemption) as well  as controlling for variations in the actions of the schools over time that are  independent of the exemption. Differences found between the two groups  in terms of affordability and enrollment (effects) can then be attributed to  the exemption (treatment). GAO\u2019s econometric analysis was focused on  the mandate from Congress that requires us to examine the effects of the  exemption.  It is different from a market-specific analysis conducted in an  antitrust investigation and is not intended to address whether or not  conduct may be taking place that might violate the antitrust laws in the  absence of the exemption.  In order to find a comparative set of schools,  we used the U.S. News and World Report annual rankings of the \u201cbest  colleges.\u201d We obtained school-level data from IPEDS and student-level  data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study for academic  years 1995-1996, 1999-2000, and 2003-2004.  We also collected data from  other sources, including a GAO survey of the schools using the exemption  and the comparable schools.  We analyzed whether there were any effects  on affordability and enrollment at schools using the exemption for all  students and whether there were differences by family income or race. We  also controlled for other factors that could cause changes in affordability  and enrollment, such as school or student characteristics. Because of data  limitations, we were not able to include all schools using the exemption in  the treatment group.  Nevertheless, there were sufficient similarities  between the excluded schools and the schools we included in our model  to allow for a meaningful analysis. In developing the models, we reviewed  several studies on the economics of higher education. We provided a  detailed draft outline of our econometric methodology, including a  description of the types and sources of data we used, to outside experts  with whom we consulted on the design and analysis because of their in- depth knowledge of antitrust law and the economics of higher education.  We also provided a draft of our report to peer reviewers in academia and  incorporated their comments when appropriate.

By consulting  about aid policies and aid decisions, through what was known as the  Overlap group, the schools made certain that students who were accepted  to more than one Overlap school would be expected to contribute the  same towards their education. Thus, according to Justice, \u201cfixing the  prices\u201d students would be expected to pay. All but one school,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), settled with Justice out of  court, ending the activities of the Overlap group. The District Court ruled  that MIT\u2019s joint student aid decisions in the Overlap group violated the  Sherman Act. On appeal, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with  the District Court that the challenged practices were commercial activity  subject to the antitrust laws.  However, it reversed the judgment and  directed the District Court to more fully consider the procompetitive and  noneconomic justifications advanced by MIT during the court proceedings  and whether social benefits attributable to the practices could have been  achieved by means less restrictive of competition. In recognition of the  importance of financial aid in achieving the government\u2019s goal of  educational access, but also mindful of the importance of antitrust laws in  ensuring the benefits of competition, the Congress passed a temporary  antitrust exemption.

In school year 2004-2005, about   $113 billion in grant, loan, and work-study aid was awarded to students  from a variety of federal, state, and institutional sources. Need analysis  methodologies are used to determine the amount of money a family is  expected to contribute toward the cost of college and schools use this  information in determining how much need-based financial aid they will  award.  For the purposes of awarding federal aid, expected family  contribution (EFC) is defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, as  amended, as the household financial resources reported on the Free  Application for Federal Student Aid, minus certain expenses and  allowances. The student\u2019s EFC is then compared to the cost of attendance  to determine if the student has financial need.

Others prefer a methodology developed by the College  Board (called the institutional methodology) or their own methodology.  Schools that use the institutional methodology require students to  complete the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid PROFILE  application and the College Board calculates how much they and their  families will be expected to contribute toward their education. Schools  that use these alternative methodologies feel they better reflect a family\u2019s  ability to pay for college because they consider many more factors of each  family\u2019s financial situation than the federal methodology.

For example, three schools in the group  attempted to share student-level financial aid data through a third party.  However, they reported that because the effort was too burdensome and  yielded little useful information, they chose not to continue. The group  also expressed little need or interest in creating another common aid  application form as such a form already existed. Schools also decided to  leave open the option to award aid on a non-need basis.", "According to the officials representing the 28 schools, the main purpose of  the group was to discuss ways to make the financial aid system more  understandable to students and their families and commit to developing a  common methodology for assessing a family\u2019s ability to pay for college,  which they called the consensus approach. Developing an agreed upon  common approach to need analysis, according to school officials, might  help decrease variation in what families were expected to pay when  accepted to multiple schools, allowing students to base their decision on  what school to attend on factors other than cost. School officials also  believed that agreeing to a common need analysis methodology would  produce expected family contributions that were reasonable and fair for  families and allow schools to better target need-based aid. The group did  not address the composition of a student\u2019s financial aid package;  specifically, what combination of grants, loans, or work-study a student  would receive.", "In developing the consensus approach for need analysis, the schools  modified elements already in the College Board\u2019s institutional  methodology, but member schools agreed to treat these elements the same  when calculating a student\u2019s EFC. Some of the modifications that the  group made to College Board\u2019s institutional methodology were later  incorporated into the institutional methodology. The consensus approach  and the institutional methodology similarly treat income from the non- custodial parent, and both account for the number of siblings in college in  the same manner when calculating a student\u2019s expected family  contribution. However, there are differences in how each methodology  treats a family\u2019s home equity and a student\u2019s assets. For example, the  institutional methodology uses a family\u2019s entire home equity in its  assessment of assets available to pay for college, while the consensus  approach limits the amount of home equity that can be included.  According to one financial aid officer at a member school, including the  full amount of a family\u2019s home equity was unfair to many parents because  in some areas of the country the real estate market had risen so rapidly  that equity gains inflated a family\u2019s assets. Officials representing some  member schools stated that adjustments to home equity would likely  affect middle and upper income families more than lower income families  who are less likely to own a home. Table 3 below further illustrates the  differences and similarities between the consensus approach and the  institutional methodology.", "In addition, under the consensus approach schools agreed to a common  calendar for collecting data from families. Members continue to maintain  the ability to exercise professional judgment in assessing a family\u2019s ability  to pay when there are unique or extenuating financial circumstances.", "Twenty-five of 28 schools implemented the consensus approach; 3 did not.  While 13 schools implemented all the elements of the consensus approach,  the remaining schools varied in how they implemented the methodology.  As shown in table 4 below, seven schools chose not to use the consensus  approach method for accounting for family loan debt, home equity, and  family and student assets.", "The 25 schools that implemented the consensus approach did so between  2002 and 2005. Member schools reported that they preferred to use the  consensus approach as opposed to other available need analysis  methodologies because it was more consistent and fairer than alternative  methodologies. Moreover, according to institution officials, they believed  the new methodology had not reduced price competition and had resulted  in the average student receiving more financial aid. In some cases, if using  the consensus approach lowered a student\u2019s EFC, the institution would  then allocate more money for financial aid than it would have if it had  used a different need analysis methodology. For some schools the  consensus approach was not that different from the methodology their  institution already had in place, but other schools said that fully  implementing the consensus approach cost their school more money.

Some schools that used the consensus approach  were not included because there were no data available for them.   However, we believe there were enough similarities between the included  and excluded schools to allow for a meaningful analysis.  The group also  stated that a number of conclusions were based on a very small number of  observations.  In appendix II, we acknowledge the small sample size of the  data could make the estimates less precise, especially for some of the  subgroups of students we considered.

It is important to note that the award of grant aid represents  a discount from the nominal \"list price\", which lowers the price students  actually pay for college.  So, any decision to limit grant aid would be an  agreement to limit discounts to the list price, and thus may raise the price  some students would pay.  It is also important to note that schools admit  only a limited number of students.  One of the theories suggests that  allowing schools a limited degree of collaboration could reduce the  variation in financial need determination for an individual student and  reduce price competition among colleges vying for the same students.  While the reduced competition would imply lower financial aid (hence  higher prices) for some students, schools could thus devote more financial  aid resources to providing access to other students, especially  disadvantaged students. This \u201csocial benefit theory\u201d assumes that under  these conditions disadvantaged students would receive more grant aid and  as a result, pay less for school. Also, an implicit assumption of this theory  is that the exemption would essentially result in redistribution of financial  aid without necessarily changing the amount of financial aid resources  available.  Moreover, because costs to students and their families would  change for some students, enrollment of such students would be affected.", "An opposing theory is that the exemption will allow schools to coordinate  on prices and reduce competition. This \u201canti-competitive theory\u201d  essentially views coordination by the group as restraining competition.  Specifically, under this theory, allowing an exemption would result in less  grant aid and higher prices on average, especially for students that schools  competed over by offering discounts on the list price.  As a result, the  amount of financial aid available to some students would likely decrease.   If prices are higher on average, it could cause a decrease in enrollment,  particularly of disadvantaged students since they would be less able to  afford the higher prices.

First, we  limited the selection of all the schools (controls and treatments) to those  that were ranked in tier 1. This reduced the sample of schools from 250 to  106 schools, comprising all 36 treatment schools and 70 control schools.  Second, the list of 106 schools was used to match school-level data from  the IPEDS in each of the three academic years.

It is also important to note  that, for any given variable, it is possible that there are other factors than  implementing the consensus approach that are responsible for the  observed differences, including differences between CA and non-CA  schools\u2019 student populations or differences in the characteristics of the  schools, or both. For instance, the price paid by middle-income students  increased more in CA than in non-CA schools. While this may reflect the  effect of consensus approach, it is possible that other factors are  responsible for the differences. For example, the racial composition of  middle-income students might also be different between the two groups,  or there may be systematic differences in endowment growth between the  CA and non-CA schools that affect financial aid to middle-income  students.

For example, the  effects of the consensus approach implementation on prices paid by low- income (INCLO) students can be estimated by  \u03b4where the school-level and student-level  variables are averaged over the low-income students. More specifically,  the second term is the coefficient estimates of each school-level variable  multiplied by the school-level variable averaged over the subset of low- income (INCLO) students attending CA schools after the consensus  approach implementation; similarly the average is taken for the third term,  which is for the student-level variables.", "Alternatively, we can use equation 1 to illustrate the effects of the  consensus approach implementation for particular groups. Consider a  simple example in which there are two student characteristics,  ijtF is an indicator variable equal to one if the student is a financial  aid applicant and zero otherwise, and ijtA is an indicator equal to one if the  student is black, and zero otherwise. Then, using equation 1, the equation  for this example is:     (1.1)", "Now consider a white student who is a financial aid applicant in school j  at time t.  The predicted price for a white student if j is a CA school is:  (1.2) and the predicted price if j is not a CA school is:  (1.3)", "The effect of the consensus approach implementation for a financial aid  applicant at school j is then the difference between equations 1.2 and 1.3,  which is:  (1.4)", "The coefficient  measures the effect of adopting the consensus approach  that is invariant across school and student type, the term  differential effect of adopting the consensus approach for a school with  characteristics Ijt, and the third term, \u03b3\u02c6 , captures the differential effect of  adopting the consensus approach for a white student who is a financial aid  applicant. Repeating the exercise above for a black student who is a  financial aid applicant, the predicted effect of adopting the consensus  approach would be:  (1.5)", "The first three terms in equation 1.5 are the same as equation 1.4, while the  fourth term captures the differential effect of the consensus approach  implementation for a black student. In this example, then, the estimated  effect of the consensus approach implementation on financial aid students  would be the weighted average of the terms in equations 1.4 or 1.5, with  weights corresponding to the proportions of white and black financial-aid  students across all schools j that adopted the consensus approach at time  t, respectively.", "Another estimate of the consensus approach\u2019s effect on a particular group  is the estimated differential effect on a group, given by\u03b3\u02c6 , holding  everything else constant.  For example, one can ask how a low-income  student as compared to a high-income student would be affected by the  consensus approach implementation, assuming all other characteristics of  the student and the student\u2019s school are held constant.  This estimated  effect is simply given by the element of the vector in \u03b3\u02c6  that corresponds to  INCLO.  This differs from the total effect of the consensus approach  implementation discussed above by taking as given the consensus  approach implementation, and by abstracting from the likelihood that low- income students will have other characteristics and attend different  schools than non low-income students.

Similarly,  the effects of the student-level variables would depend on the theories of  the effects of the exemption. For the effects of the school-level variables,  ENDOWSTU should be negative because with more resources there is less  need to raise tuition and there will be more funds for grant aid. RANKAVG  should be negative because as the quality of the school decreases tuition  as well as grant aid should decrease. ENROLUG would be negative if  higher growth in student enrollment perhaps means more revenues and  less need to raise tuition. On the other hand, if students\u2019 education is on  net subsidized by other sources of school income then ENROLUG would  be positive as increased enrollment increases the costs to the school of  providing education. And TENURED should be positive if more tenured  faculty implies higher quality.", "We estimated equation 1 for price, as well as for tuition and the financial  aid variables, using probability-weighted regression and robust standard  errors, as well as the fixed-effects estimator for panel data. See the  regression estimates for price and tuition in table 14, and those for the  financial aid variables in table 15.", "The regression models for the price, tuition, and financial aid variables are  all highly significant using the F-values of the models. See tables 14 and 15.  Furthermore, the school-level variables generally have the expected  effects. In particular, for the price equation, a student enrolled in a school  with an endowment per student (ENDOWSTU) of $250,000 paid about  $5,000 lower price. Also, a student paid about $464 less for a school with  a unit drop in its selectivity (RANKAVG). Although the effect is not  significant, the positive sign for ENROLUG suggests that an increase in  enrollment growth may result in a higher price paid, implying that  education is net subsidized and increases in enrollment increases the cost  of providing education; and vice versa. Finally, a student enrolled in a  school with 10 percent higher tenured faculty (TENURED) paid about  $3,310 higher.

It should be noted that if  AY2003 affects the probability of enrollment in CA schools, it would be a  valuable suggestive evidence about the potential impact of the consensus  approach implementation. However, it would not establish that the  consensus approach implementation caused the shift. This is because it is  possible that such effects might be due to changes in other factors at CA  schools versus non-CA schools (e.g., more rapid endowment growth in the  latter than the former). The effect of the consensus approach  implementation is the change in the probability of enrollment in CA  schools relative to non-CA schools as a result of the consensus approach  implementation.
