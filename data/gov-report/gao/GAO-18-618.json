These strategies also highlight the importance of police respect for human rights, but agencies have few objectives or other control mechanisms to ensure police receive related training. For instance, none of the 14 State projects and 2 of the 8 USAID projects that GAO reviewed had such objectives. Officials said this is because objectives were designed to be broader in focus. DOD also does not have objectives but has other control mechanisms to ensure its training includes human rights content. Federal standards for internal control call for managers to establish control mechanisms consistent with priorities. Without them, it may be difficult for State and USAID to ensure that training supports agencies' goals to promote police respect for human rights.", "DOD, State, and USAID collect information on police training, but State lacks readily available, reliable data on the number of police trained\u2014a key indicator in the U.S. Strategy for Central America . State's data are not readily available because, according to officials, the process to track training is decentralized and data are not consolidated. Further, GAO found State's fiscal year 2017 police training data to be unreliable because, among other reasons, the data did not include training delivered by some implementers. Officials noted that State did not have sufficient internal control mechanisms and staff in place to collect data as it expanded police training in the Northern Triangle.

The police forces in these countries are challenged by corruption,  inadequate resources, insufficient training, and a lack of public trust,  according to U.S. Department of State (State) documents. Supporting  the efforts of the Northern Triangle governments to professionalize and  reform police forces is a focus of U.S. policy in the Western Hemisphere.  The White House\u2019s U.S. Strategy for Central America aims to improve  governance and security in the region and emphasizes that security  assistance should address corruption, promote governmental  transparency, and protect human rights. In support of this strategy, the  United States has devoted significant resources to train police units in the  Northern Triangle. For example, State\u2019s Bureau of International  Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) reported having allocated at least $37  million and $11 million, respectively, to train police in El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras from appropriations for fiscal years 2014  through 2017.", "Congress has clearly articulated the importance of respect for human  rights in U.S. assistance to partner nations\u2019 security forces, and in Senate  Report 115-125, accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2018, the Committee on Armed Services included a  provision for us to report on various aspects of U.S. police training efforts  in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

We focused on  State and USAID because officials identified them as the primary funders  of police training in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. While DOD  primarily provides assistance to foreign military entities, we included DOD  in our analysis because some of the training funded by the agency  includes police participants. We included police training implemented by  the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) when  their training efforts were funded by State, DOD, and USAID, but not  separate efforts funded by DOJ and DHS.

Our analysis included  U.S. global, regional, and country-specific strategic documents such as  government-wide Integrated Country Strategies and DOD country  security assistance plans for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. We  also reviewed documents from State, USAID, and DOD about police  assistance efforts implemented during fiscal years 2014 through 2017  that included assistance for police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras. Specifically, we reviewed 22 projects\u201414 funded by State  and 8 funded by USAID\u2014that the agencies identified as including  assistance for police.

We asked State to provide us with information related to the indicator and  compared State\u2019s data with training information from implementing  agencies to determine the extent to which State\u2019s data were reliable and  readily available. We assessed State\u2019s data on how many police were  trained by comparing similar data from different sources; reviewing  agency information regarding underlying data systems; and interviewing  cognizant agency officials. We found that the data on police trained  through INL\u2019s International Law Enforcement Academies program  (hereafter referred to as ILEA) were sufficiently reliable for reporting on  the number of police trained.

Agencies also described a number of factors that challenge  police forces in the Northern Triangle, including a culture of impunity and  limited partner nation capacity to address these challenges.", "Many U.S. agencies implement assistance to civilian police in El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, with State\u2019s INL being the primary  source of funding. Federal law generally prohibits the use of foreign  assistance funds for police training, but Congress provided several  exceptions including for training in internationally recognized standards of  human rights, the rule of law, anti-corruption, and the promotion of civilian  police roles that support democracy. Accordingly, as part of USAID\u2019s  broader security sector reform assistance efforts, the agency provides  some police training, which often includes training on community policing  practices. DOD generally is not authorized to train civilian police and  focuses on building the capacity of its military and other national security  counterparts. However, under its authority to build the capacity of foreign  security forces for various purposes, DOD has provided a limited amount  of training for civilian police and military units that provide civilian security  in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. For example, several U.S.  agencies, including DOD, have delivered training to the Joint Group  Cuscatl\u00e1n in El Salvador, an interagency task force that includes police;  and to the Special Response Intelligence and Security Group in Honduras  (commonly called TIGRES, its acronym in Spanish), which, according to  State, is an elite, vetted unit within the Honduran National Police,  specializing in high-risk tactics.", "State, USAID, and DOD deliver training in a variety of ways, including  through the agencies\u2019 own subject matter experts, interagency  agreements with other U.S. agencies, and contracts with nongovernment  implementing partners. For example, USAID has contracts and  cooperative agreements with corporations, universities, and  nongovernmental organizations to implement assistance projects that  include training of police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  State\u2019s INL uses contracts to procure the services of nongovernment  implementing partners and interagency agreements to partner with  several other U.S. government agencies and components, including DHS  and DOJ, to implement police assistance and training. State\u2019s ILEA  program also funds a network of police training academies, including one  located in San Salvador, El Salvador (see fig. 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Established Objectives and Delivered Training to Professionalize Police but Have Not Consistently Done So Related to Respect for Human Rights Agencies Have Established Training Objectives to Professionalize Police and Have Delivered Such Training", "paragraphs": ["Global, regional, and country-specific strategies outlining U.S. policy in El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras all include objectives to  professionalize police.

However, State and DOJ  officials in Washington, D.C., told us that DOJ\u2019s Drug Enforcement  Administration and Federal Bureau of Investigation had delivered  INL-funded courses to Salvadoran police during fiscal year 2017.", "Second, INL officials at the U.S. embassy in Guatemala told us  that the training data they provided excluded training delivered by  DOJ\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Miami-Dade Police  Department. These officials assured us that more complete data  associated with additional police training activities did exist, but  they stated that they did not include these data because doing so  would have required them to collect and compile data from several  different sources\u2014a difficult and time-consuming effort.", "Third, data from INL officials at the U.S. embassy in Honduras  were similarly unreliable in that they did not align with training data  we collected from implementing partners. For example, embassy  data indicated there were 6 police participants of a training  provided by DOJ\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration in Honduras,  but DOJ reported that 34 Honduran police participated in the  same training.", "Fourth, data from all three embassies included information about  ILEA training that did not align with the data we received directly  from the ILEA program. Officials from the U.S. embassy in  Guatemala acknowledged that the ILEA data they had provided to  us were likely unreliable. Officials from the ILEA program noted  that they provide data on the number of police trained directly to  headquarters INL officials who may have a need for such  information.", "INL officials at the U.S. embassies in the Northern Triangle agreed the  fiscal year 2017 data they provided to us may be unreliable in that the  data are incomplete and may be inconsistent with data available from  implementing partners. Despite acknowledging the information they  provided had problems with reliability, INL officials told us that they would  use a similar process to compile data for reporting progress related to the  U.S. Strategy for Central America indicator on the number and  percentage of civilian police trained by INL.", "In May 2018, State and USAID issued the first report to Congress on  results of that strategy, which included data on the number of civilian  police from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras that INL trained  during fiscal year 2017. Although INL officials told us that they used the  same process to provide data to us in April 2018 and to compile data for  the May 2018 report, we found the two sets of data differed. INL officials  explained that these discrepancies were because State included training  delivered to additional types of police and by more training implementers  in its May 2018 report than they included in the data provided to us in  April 2018. Despite identifying reasons for these discrepancies, INL  officials acknowledged their data collection process is decentralized and  agreed that improvements could be made in the availability and reliability  of the data on the number of police trained. Moreover, INL noted  challenges collecting these data. Specifically:  INL officials from U.S. embassies in the Northern Triangle  responsible for collecting police training data noted that a large  number of implementing partners deliver training, which makes  collecting data more difficult. These officials told us they are  beginning to use a smaller number of institutions, such as local  police academies, where implementing partners deliver INL- funded training. Officials believe this change has helped improve  the reliability of their data on police training because a greater  portion of the training is delivered through a small number of  institutions, making it easier for implementing partners to track  participation. However, the officials also noted that processes  such as reviewing travel orders to find U.S. trainers who had  visited the country and requesting data from individual  implementing partners are still routinely employed to compile  training data when such data are requested.", "INL officials in Washington, D.C., where police training data are  aggregated for reporting purposes, told us that it is difficult to  compile reliable information in a timely manner. This is because  embassies use unique processes and systems to collect  information on police training events and the data collected are  not systematically consolidated within the individual embassies or  centrally at INL headquarters. Further, they explained that  following the establishment of the U.S. Strategy for Central  America State received increased funding for police training  efforts, particularly in fiscal year 2016. Although they used some  of these funds to provide more training, they told us that INL was  not fully prepared to implement proper internal control  mechanisms to help ensure the collection of reliable data.  According to these officials, this shortcoming was exacerbated by  a worldwide hiring freeze for State that precluded INL from  employing additional staff at the affected embassies to assist with  data collection and analysis.", "INL officials stated that they recognize that effective data collection is a  necessary element of high quality monitoring and evaluation. For that  reason, in September 2017, the INL office for Western Hemisphere  Programs contracted a private firm to conduct data collection and develop  a data management system for INL efforts throughout the hemisphere,  including those related to police training. INL officials told us they intend  to extend the contract for the optional second year and are considering  the potential need to procure additional contractor services to continue  the effort after that. INL officials said that the contractors have made  some progress toward the goals set forth in the contract but  acknowledged that it is early in the process and that data reliability  challenges remain. For example, according to agency officials, in June  2018, contractors were still developing a broad set of indicators related to  INL efforts in the Western Hemisphere and had begun the process of  collecting data related to some of them in June 2018. Further, the  contractors reported that as of March 2018 they had yet to build a data  management system or produce training materials and reporting  templates for data collection.", "Readily available and reliable data allow managers to make informed  decisions and evaluate an entity\u2019s performance. Without such information,  INL cannot accurately assess the number of police trained in the Northern  Triangle\u2014a key indicator in the U.S. Strategy for Central America.  Further, it may be difficult to fully assess the extent to which training is  having the desired effect."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Planned and Undertaken Various Actions to Support the Ability of Partner Nations to Sustain Police Training, Including for Human Rights", "paragraphs": ["State, USAID, and DOD have established plans and taken action to  support the ability of partner nations to sustain police training, including  training on promoting respect for human rights. INL\u2019s Sustainability Guide  defines sustainability as the ability of host-country partners and  beneficiaries to take complete responsibility for the foreign assistance  programming, and maintain or improve program outcomes and impacts  beyond the life of the program and U.S. government funding.", "Government-wide and funding agency guidance discusses the  importance of sustainability for police assistance. According to  Presidential Policy Directive 23 on Security Sector Assistance, a principal  goal is to help partner nations build sustainable capacity to address  common security challenges. Guidance from agencies that fund police  training\u2014including State, USAID, and DOD\u2014also stresses the  importance of sustainability in assistance for police. For example, State\u2019s  INL Guide to Police Assistance notes that police assistance projects  should emphasize sustainable, institutional capacity building to achieve  maximum effect. In line with such guidance, country-level and agency  strategic and project documents have established objectives related to  sustaining police training. For example, the Integrated Country Strategy  for Guatemala for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 has an objective to  assist the government in establishing, training, and maintaining anti-gang  investigative units. Agency police training project documents also address  sustainability. For example, the interagency agreement between INL and  DHS\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enhance border security  and build capacity in Honduras aims to create a trained law enforcement  unit that is sustained by local resources.", "To enhance the sustainability of police training programs, agency officials  identified various activities they undertake, including the following:", "Training-the-trainer. State\u2019s INL Guide to Police Assistance  states that train-the-trainer models can create a sustainable  training program, and officials from multiple agencies told us that  they use train-the-trainer programs to sustain police training. For  example, the INL-funded Gang Resistance Education and  Training program is a regional training program that trains police  officers to teach children and young adults to resist the pressures  to join gangs or engage in other risky behaviors. According to INL,  this police training program has certified over 1,171 regional police  officers as teachers and taught more than 211,000 at-risk youth in  Central America.", "Developing policy or guidance. Officials from USAID stated that  helping partner nations develop policy or guidance for law  enforcement can help strengthen institutions and make police  training more sustainable. For example, a USAID project in El  Salvador supported the development of a new use-of-force policy  that was adopted by the national police. Further, USAID supported  the dissemination of the new policy by distributing 10,000 copies,  training police instructors who subsequently taught the policy to  other officers, and holding workshops on human rights, ethics, and  the proper use of force.", "Supporting police academies. The ability of partner nations to  incorporate and institutionalize training in their own police  academies is among the most significant determinants of  sustainability, according to U.S. officials from several agencies.  For example, State officials said they try to incorporate curriculum  from U.S. training into the law enforcement academies\u2019 training  curriculum in partner nations. They said doing so has a more  lasting effect than individual training events and leads to the host  government paying for the training going forward. In El Salvador,  USAID developed community policing training in conjunction with  the civilian national police that, according to officials, is now  administered to every new police officer in the country at the  country\u2019s National Academy of Public Security (see fig. 4). At the  same institution, INL supported the development of online training  that includes a human rights component. According to INL  officials, the Salvadoran police were planning to make the online  training a yearly continuing education requirement for the entire  police force.", "Continuing engagement. Officials from various agencies told us  that continuing engagement with participants helps sustain police  training, whether through additional training, on-the-job  mentorship, or service requirements for receiving training. For  example, the ILEA academy in San Salvador provides a list of  alumni to the U.S. Embassy San Salvador and encourages  implementing partners to follow up with these alumni, according to  officials. The San Salvador academy also plans to develop an  online alumni portal for engaging with past participants in order to  sustain training.", "Building relationships. Building relationships\u2014both within and  across countries\u2014between partners\u2019 law enforcement agencies  and rule of law institutions can help sustain police training,  according to officials from multiple agencies. For example, in  2013, DOD\u2019s Defense Institute of International Legal Studies  conducted border security training in El Salvador that included  military, police, and civilian officials. The training focused on  improving El Salvador\u2019s interagency cooperation and enhancing  respect for human rights. To build and sustain relationships across  countries, DOJ\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation holds an annual  training conference that brings together vetted police units from  various partner nations, according to officials.", "Developing civil society. Officials from both State and USAID  told us that police reform efforts are more sustainable if there are  parallel civil society organizations that can advocate for  accountability from police and other law enforcement institutions.  USAID works with civil society and community organizations to  track police abuses, including human rights violations. Officials  said that external monitoring can promote the transparency,  accountability, and effectiveness of the police. For example,  USAID\u2019s Justice, Human Rights, and Security Strengthening  project in Honduras seeks to build the capacity of civil society  organizations to advocate for vulnerable groups and victims of  human rights abuses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Civilian police forces that protect human rights are essential to functioning  democracies, and U.S. agencies recognize that it is important to include  respect for human rights in training provided to partner nation security  forces, including police.

However, unlike DOD, which has written policies requiring  the inclusion of human rights content in its training, State and USAID  have few such formal mechanisms to ensure human rights content is  appropriately included. Creating internal control mechanisms, such as  objectives or directives to training implementing partners, would help  ensure that State- and USAID-funded police training is consistent with  U.S. government and agency priorities in including content related to  respect for human rights as appropriate. Such control mechanisms would  also enable the agencies to better account for implementing partners\u2019  related activities. In addition, State lacks a standardized process to  readily compile reliable data on the total number of police trained through  INL-funded programs in the Northern Triangle countries. Without such  data, State cannot reliably report on progress toward the U.S. Strategy for  Central America and thus cannot accurately assess the efficacy of such  training.

We  focused on State and USAID because officials identified them as the  primary funders of police training in El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras. While DOD primarily provides assistance to military and other  national security entities, we included DOD in our analysis because some  of the training funded by the agency includes police participants. We  included police training implemented by the Departments of Justice (DOJ)  and Homeland Security (DHS) when their training efforts were funded by  State, DOD, and USAID, but not separate efforts funded by DOJ and  DHS. In addition to reviewing documents, we conducted fieldwork in El  Salvador and interviewed agency officials in Honduras; Guatemala; and  Washington, D.C., who oversee and conduct police training.", "To determine the extent to which U.S. agencies have established  objectives for and delivered training to professionalize police, including  promoting respect for human rights, we reviewed agency documents and  assessed them against federal standards for internal control, which state  that management should set objectives or other control mechanisms to  meet an entity\u2019s mission, strategic plan, and goals. Our analysis included  U.S. global, regional, and country-specific strategies such as government- wide Integrated Country Strategies and DOD country security assistance  plans for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Officials from DOD,  State, and USAID told us that all agency-funded classroom training  delivered to police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras is done to  professionalize those forces, of which training to promote respect for  human rights may be one element. We also reviewed documents from  DOD, USAID, and State about police assistance efforts implemented  during fiscal years 2014 through 2017 that agencies identified as projects  that included assistance for police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras. Specifically, we reviewed 22 projects\u201414 funded by State and  8 funded by USAID\u2014that the agencies identified as including assistance  for police. The projects and documents we identified for each agency are  as follows:", "We reviewed DOD strategic plans covering assistance for El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras during fiscal years 2014  through 2017 and found that they did not contain objectives to  specifically train police. DOD officials confirmed that security  assistance they provide is focused on military recipients and that  they had no projects to specifically provide assistance to civilian  police. Thus, we determined that no DOD projects would be  included in our review of project documents to identify objectives  related to training to professionalize police.", "USAID provided a list of USAID-funded efforts in El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras implemented during fiscal years 2014  through 2017. Among the projects were eight with funds used for  police training, which we included in our review. USAID provided  work plans for six of the eight projects. For the remaining two  projects, USAID did not identify similar project work plans, so we  identified alternative documents to use for our analysis. For one of  them, we used a progress report submitted to USAID by the  contractor that included a project work plan specifically for fiscal  year 2016. For the other, we used a final evaluation report that  included the objectives of the project.", "State identified efforts funded by its Bureau of International  Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras implemented during fiscal years 2014  through 2017. Because INL assistance generally includes police  among target recipients of assistance, we requested project  documents for all of the efforts State identified. We worked with  State officials to identify project documents that included work  plans or other summaries that identified objectives for these State- funded efforts. Ultimately, State provided documents for 19  projects. Based on our review of those documents, we determined  5 of the projects should not be included in our review for one or  more of the following reasons: They (a) were not implemented  during fiscal years 2014 through 2017, (b) did not provide  assistance to police, or (c) did not have sufficient documentation  provided by State to conduct our analysis. Among State efforts  excluded from our scope due to insufficient documentation is  State-funded training provided through the Colombian National  Police. For the 14 projects that we included in our scope, we used  documents such as work plans for our analysis of objectives.", "For each of the 22 USAID and State police assistance projects we  reviewed, we analyzed related project documents, such as work plans or  reports, to identify objectives or other internal control mechanisms related  to police professionalization, including promoting respect for human  rights. To do so, we assessed these documents using definitions we  developed based on our analysis and discussions with agency officials,  as follows:", "We defined \u201cpolice\u201d as civilian\u2014not military\u2014police, as well as other  civilian law, customs, and maritime forces.", "We defined \u201ctraining\u201d as classroom-style training and workshops, not  including mentoring or technical assistance.", "We defined \u201cobjective\u201d as any statement containing the words goal,  objective, aim, intent, we will, or other statements with actionable  items aimed at reaching an end state.", "We defined \u201cprofessionalize\u201d in line with agency officials\u2019 descriptions  of the term, using related words such as professionalism, professional  competence, or capacity building.", "We defined \u201cpromotion of respect for human rights\u201d to specifically  include the phrase human rights or elements of human rights as  defined in agency documents, such as the proper use of force and  minority rights, and the United Nations Universal Declaration of  Human Rights.", "The project documents for the 22 projects in our scope were  independently reviewed by two analysts. The analysts discussed and  resolved any disagreements in their initial determinations about the extent  to which project documents included relevant objectives or other internal  control mechanisms.", "With respect to our reporting on the extent to which training incorporated  content to professionalize police, agencies lack a formal definition of what  types of training constitute police professionalism. To better understand  what types of training we should consider to be training to professionalize  police, we interviewed officials at U.S. agencies that fund and execute  police training in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Officials at  agencies that fund and implement such training consistently described all  training delivered to police to be training intended to professionalize  recipients. Thus, for the purpose of this report, we defined training to  professionalize police as all training provided to police and determined  that all three agencies had delivered such training.", "With respect to reporting on the extent to which training incorporated  content related to human rights, we spoke with implementing partner  officials and analyzed documents on police training, such as training  agendas and course catalogs. To determine the extent to which training  delivered by State\u2019s International Law Enforcement Academies program  (hereafter referred to as ILEA) incorporated content related to human  rights, we requested data from the program on the courses it provided to  participants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras during fiscal  years 2014 through 2017. We then analyzed the descriptions in fiscal  years 2015, 2016, and 2017 course catalogs and embassy cables related  to 189 training courses the ILEA program reported to have delivered to  participants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras during fiscal  years 2015 through 2017. For our analysis, we defined training to  promote respect for human rights as training specifically addressing  human rights or elements of human rights as defined in agency  documents, such as the proper use of force and minority rights, and the  United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
