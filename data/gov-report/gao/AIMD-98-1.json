Under the CFO Act, as expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, 24 major agencies, which account for 99 percent of federal outlays, are required to annually prepare organizationwide audited financial statements beginning with those for fiscal year 1996.

An updated version reflecting changes in legislation and policies was released in September 1995. This document establishes the standard requirements for a core financial system to support the fundamental financial functions of an agency. Framework for Federal Financial Management Systems was published in January 1995 and describes the basic elements of a model for an integrated financial management system in the federal government, how these elements should relate to each other, and specific considerations in developing and implementing such an integrated system. In this regard, FFMIA defines financial management systems as \u201cfinancial systems\u201d and the financial portions of \u201cmixed systems\u201d necessary to support financial management, including automated and manual processes, procedures, controls, data, hardware, software, and support personnel dedicated to the operation and maintenance of the system.", "Other documents in the JFMIP series provide requirements for specific types of systems covering personnel/payroll, travel, seized/forfeited asset, direct loan, guaranteed loan, and inventory systems.

If they do, the standards are published by OMB and GAO and become effective. As discussed further in the section \u201cStatus of Federal Accounting Standards,\u201d this process has resulted in issuance of two statements of accounting concepts and eight statements of accounting standards.

This is interim guidance to be used in connection with audits of federal financial statements for fiscal year 1997.", "OMB\u2019s guidance emphasizes implementation of federal financial management improvements by fully describing in separate sections each of the requirements under the act, which are (1) federal financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable federal accounting standards, and (3) the SGL at the transaction level. Each section begins by identifying and discussing the executive branch policy documents that previously established the requirement. Information is also provided on the meaning of substantial compliance and the types of indicators that should be used in assessing whether an agency is in substantial compliance. For example, one indicator of substantial compliance with financial management systems requirements would include financial management systems that meet the requirements of OMB Circular A-127. Likewise, an indicator of substantial compliance with financial accounting standards would include an agency that has no material weaknesses in internal controls that affect its ability to prepare auditable financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with federal accounting standards.", "Information is also provided for the auditor to consider in evaluating and reporting audit results, as well as other reporting requirements. The guidance states that the auditor shall use professional judgment in determining substantial compliance with FFMIA. Further, substantial noncompliance in any one or more of the three requirements of FFMIA would result in substantial noncompliance with FFMIA. For example, an agency could have an unqualified opinion on its financial statements indicating that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable federal accounting standards, yet have financial management systems that are not in substantial compliance with financial management systems requirements. This situation would preclude the agency from being in substantial compliance with FFMIA. Finally, the guidance also directs auditors to follow the reporting guidance, with respect to compliance, contained in OMB Bulletin 93-06.", "We have been discussing with OMB some refinements to this bulletin, with particular focus on four areas: (1) clarifying, based on information provided in OMB\u2019s implementation guidance, that the auditor should perform tests of the reporting entity\u2019s compliance with the requirements of FFMIA, (2) including in the reporting entity\u2019s management representation letter a representation about whether the reporting entity\u2019s financial management systems are in substantial compliance with FFMIA requirements, (3) clarifying that the auditor\u2019s report on the reporting entity\u2019s compliance with applicable laws and regulations state that the auditor performed sufficient compliance tests of FFMIA requirements to report whether the entity\u2019s financial management systems comply substantially with FFMIA requirements, and (4) separately stating in the auditor\u2019s report whether such tests disclosed any instances in which the reporting entity\u2019s financial management systems did not comply substantially with FFMIA requirements.", "Finally, we have discussed with OMB the requirement in the act, that if the reporting entity does not comply substantially with FFMIA requirements, the auditor\u2019s report needs to identify the entity or organization responsible for the financial management systems that have been found not to comply with FFMIA requirements; disclose all facts pertaining to the noncompliance, including the nature and extent of the noncompliance, such as the areas in which there is substantial but not full compliance; the primary reason or cause of the noncompliance; the entity or organization responsible for the noncompliance; and any relevant comments from reporting entity management or employee responsible for the noncompliance; and state recommended remedial actions and the time frames to implement such actions.", "We are also exploring other tools to assist the CFO and IG communities in implementing OMB\u2019s interim guidelines. OMB plans to review its interim guidelines and replace them during 1998 with revisions to appropriate OMB policy documents.", "Agencies are also taking steps to improve the quality of their financial management systems. According to the CFO Council\u2019s and OMB\u2019s Status Report on Financial Management Systems, dated June 1997, agencies are reporting plans to replace or upgrade operational applications within the next 5 years. For applications that are now under development or in the process of a phased implementation, reported plans are also in place to fully implement the SGL at the transaction level and comply with federal financial management system requirements.

A financial statement audit provides a meaningful measure of compliance with applicable federal accounting standards. An unqualified opinion is one of several indications that the agency\u2019s financial management systems support the preparation of accurate and reliable financial statements with minimal manual intervention. However, for fiscal year 1996, only 6 of the 24 CFO agencies received unqualified opinions on their organizationwide financial statements. Further, according to OMB\u2019s Federal Financial Management Status Report & Five-Year Plan, only 13 CFO agencies anticipate being able to obtain unqualified opinions on their fiscal year 1997 financial statements.", "Our past audit experience has indicated that numerous agencies\u2019 financial management systems do not maintain and generate original data to readily prepare financial statements. Consequently, many agencies have relied on ad hoc efforts and manual adjustments to prepare financial statements. Such procedures can be time-consuming, produce inaccurate results, and delay the issuance of audited statements. In addition, agencies\u2019 lack of reliable and consistent financial information on a regular, ongoing basis undermines federal managers\u2019 ability to effectively evaluate the cost and performance of government programs and activities.", "Also, the current status of federal financial management systems portends potential problems in agencies complying fully with federal financial management systems requirements and the SGL as mandated by the act. When FFMIA was enacted, federal agencies lacked many of the basic systems needed to provide uniform and reliable financial information. Agencies are still struggling to comply with governmentwide standards and requirements, although they have recently exhibited some progress in implementing and maintaining financial management systems that comply with federal financial system requirements and the SGL.", "For instance, according to the CFO Council\u2019s and OMB\u2019s FY 1995 Status Report on Federal Financial Management Systems, issued in June 1996, only 29 percent of agencies\u2019 financial management systems were reported to be in compliance with JFMIP federal financial management system requirements. In addition, agencies had fully implemented the SGL in only 40 percent of the operational applications to which they reported it applied. The fiscal year 1996 status report, issued in June 1997, showed some improvement, with 36 percent of agencies\u2019 financial management systems reported as complying with federal financial management system requirements and full SGL implementation reported in 45 percent of the applications to which agencies reported it applied.
