About a quarter to a third of students rated their academy's performance standards for developing military officers as too low. Most differences in student responses on academy emphasis on prevention of gender- and race-/ethnicity-based discrimination and harassment were generally between male and female students and minorities and nonminority students. Over 80 percent of students who were not recruited as athletes responded that recruited athletes receive preferential treatment during the admissions process. The faculty members who responded to the survey generally agreed with the students' perceptions of student life at the academies, but they were less likely than students to say that quality-of-life problems are seldom openly confronted and/or solved.

In our report on the three service academies,  we recommended that the Secretary of Defense, in concert with the  services, enhance performance goals and measures to improve oversight  of the academies\u2019 operations and performance. In our report on the three  service academy preparatory schools, we recommended that the Secretary  of Defense, together with the services and service academies, clarify the schools\u2019 mission statements, establish quantified performance goals  and measures, and enhance the existing oversight framework by using  quantified performance goals and measures to objectively evaluate  the performance of the schools.

In total, we surveyed  12,264 students and 2,065 faculty members between February 5 and  March 7, 2003. We obtained responses from 9,238 students (an overall  response rate of 75 percent) and 1,586 faculty members (an overall  response rate of 77 percent) to questions related to such student life issues  as academic and military programs, the honor code/concept, social life  and campus services, gender- and race-/ethnicity-based discrimination and  harassment, and preferential treatment for various student groups.

The individual academy response  rates for the faculty survey were 90 percent at the Military Academy;  73 percent at the Naval Academy; and 69 percent at the Air Force Academy.  We were unable to determine the reason for the lower overall response  rates from students and faculty at the Air Force Academy. There were  initial difficulties in resolving inaccuracies in the list of student and faculty  E-mail addresses provided to us by the Air Force Academy, resulting in  delays in notifying all students and faculty of the surveys\u2019 availability.  Additionally, during the survey period, issues associated with alleged  sexual assaults at the Air Force Academy became widely reported in  the press, and several Air Force and Department of Defense (DOD)  investigations commenced. Due to concerns about the overall lower Air  Force Academy survey response rates, we extended the survey period by a  week to March 7, 2003, at all academies. We received full cooperation from  Air Force Academy officials, who sent additional notices to students and  faculty encouraging them to respond to our surveys. Although overall  response rates at the Air Force Academy were lower, our analysis shows  that the survey responses for various groups at each academy (e.g., women  and minorities) appear generally representative of their respective  academy populations.

Specifically, we reviewed student and faculty surveys on quality-of-life  issues administered by the Military, Naval, and Air Force Academies  within the last 2 years. We also reviewed the student and faculty  surveys on various aspects of student life that we administered during  our 1994 review of the Air Force Academy.

First, to determine whether  the questions and the manner in which we planned to ask them were  adequate for addressing the larger questions posed by our evaluation.  Second, to find out whether academy students and faculty had the  knowledge to answer our survey questions. The reviewing officials did  not act as pretest interviewees; they provided critiques. Based on the  comments received, we modified the survey terminology to apply to the  respective academies, eliminated and/or changed questions or response  items that did not apply, and added questions or response items to  address issues germane to all three service academies.", "To test the survey questions before they were administered, we  pretested the surveys in focus groups of students and faculty at the  Naval and Air Force Academies.

This notification was followed by our E-mail to all students and  faculty, containing the Web link to the appropriate survey as well as the  individual\u2019s unique user name and password. The previously discussed  inaccurate E-mail addresses resulted in delays in notifying all students  and faculty at the Air Force Academy of the surveys\u2019 availability. The  Web-based surveys were initially operational from February 5 to  February 28, 2003. During this time, students and faculty completed the  surveys and contacted designated GAO personnel, via telephone or E-mail,  regarding any difficulties. Each week, we sent follow-up E-mail to all  respondents, requesting that they complete the surveys if they had not  done so. At the end of the survey period, we extended the survey at all  academies by 1 week to March 7, 2003, to allow respondents at the Air  Force Academy additional time to complete the surveys. Each academy\u2019s  superintendent sent out an additional notification E-mail, announcing that  we were extending the deadline for the surveys and once again  encouraging participation. Table 15 shows that the response rates for the  surveys were generally high.", "To analyze the response rates for possible errors due to some  groups responding out of proportion to the population as a whole,  we compared the rates for certain demographic subgroups to the  relevant academy student populations. We found comparable distributions  of students for these subgroups and concluded that the survey results for  each academy appeared to be generally representative of the academy  populations. Although overall response rates for the Air Force Academy  were lower than those of the other two academies, the pattern of  responses across demographic groups is much the same as for the other  academies. Table 16 shows the percentage of groups who completed the  student survey compared to the percentage of identified groups in the  entire student population.", "To analyze survey results, we noted responses for all questions and  highlighted those where a significant response occurred in a particular  category, such as an unfavorable opinion. We also compared responses  by groups for questions addressing those groups (e.g., male and female  student responses and minority and nonminority student responses).  Since we surveyed the entire student and faculty populations at all three  academies and not a statistical sample, achieved high response rates, and  found minimal occurrences of some groups responding out of proportion  to the population as a whole, the responses can be considered  representative of those populations.", "We performed our work between November 2002 and July 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aspects of Student Life at the Academies: Student Survey and Responses", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Academic Climate", "paragraphs": ["1.
