For example, broadcast stations must obtain, install, and test the necessary equipment needed to finalize their digital facilities, and some stations will need to coordinate the movement of channels on the day the analog signal ceases transmission. This requested report examines (1) the status of broadcast stations in transitioning to digital, (2) the extent to which broadcast stations are encountering issues, and (3) the actions the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken to guide broadcasters in the digital transition. To address these issues, GAO conducted a Web-based survey of full-power television broadcast stations. GAO surveyed 1,682 stations and obtained completed questionnaires from 1,122 stations, for a response rate of 66.7 percent. GAO also reviewed legal, agency, and industry documents and interviewed public, private, and other stakeholders.

Approximately 91 percent of the 1,122 full-power stations responding to our survey are currently transmitting a digital signal, with approximately 68 percent of survey respondents transmitting their digital signal at full strength and 68 percent transmitting their digital signal on the channel from which they will broadcast after the transition date. However, some stations still need to complete construction of their final digital facilities, and others need to relocate their digital channel to complete the transition. For example, 23 percent of survey respondents indicated they will be moving their digital channel to their analog channel. In addition, other stations need to move to a completely new channel. While almost all full-power stations are already broadcasting a digital signal, 9 percent of stations responding to our survey indicated that they are not currently broadcasting digitally. Almost all of these stations, however, indicated that they plan to have their digital signal operational by February 17, 2009. Some stations, including those already broadcasting a digital signal, need to resolve various technical, coordination, or other issues before their transition to digital is complete. For example, over 13 percent of stations responding to our survey reported that they need to install or relocate their digital or analog antennas. Some of these stations still need to order equipment, such as antennas, to build their final digital facilities. Furthermore, stations may have coordination issues to address to complete their final digital facilities. In particular, some stations are awaiting agreements with the Canadian and Mexican governments regarding their signals crossing the borders of these respective countries before they can complete their digital facilities. Stations also need to coordinate with cable providers and satellite companies to ensure that cable and satellite facilities receive digital signals when the analog signals are turned off. Lastly, the construction of broadcast towers or financial constraints might affect some stations during their transition. FCC's actions have provided guidance to broadcasters throughout the digital transition, but at the time we completed our survey, some broadcasters were awaiting FCC decisions. Since 1987, FCC has directed broadcasters with a series of rulemakings and orders, including assigning digital broadcast channels and developing timelines for the construction of digital facilities. Furthermore, FCC has conducted periodic reviews of the transition and released a ruling on its third periodic review on December 31, 2007, in which FCC addressed a number of important DTV issues. However, some stations responded to our survey that they needed decisions from FCC, such as approval for a construction permit or for changes to their final digital channel. According to FCC, it will address remaining issues quickly and with the release of an order in March 2008, FCC stated that it believes broadcasters have everything they need from the commission to proceed with construction of their final digital facilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 requires all  full-power television stations in the United States to cease analog  broadcasting by February 17, 2009.

For example,  broadcast stations must obtain, install, and test the necessary equipment  needed for their final digital facilities, and some stations will need to  coordinate the movement of channels on the day that they cease analog  signal transmission. Most television broadcasters are already transmitting  both an analog and a digital over-the-air signal to television households.  However, prior to or on the final transition date, broadcasters will be  vacating portions of the spectrum, and 108 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum  will be reclaimed by the federal government. The Federal  Communications Commission (FCC), which is the federal entity  responsible for guiding the transition, has reallocated 24 MHz of the  spectrum for public safety purposes. In January 2008, FCC began  auctioning the remaining spectrum for commercial purposes.", "You asked us to provide information on technical issues surrounding the  DTV transition.

In November 2007, we reported on the  status of consumer issues related to the DTV transition. We are continuing  to review consumer issues related to the DTV transition and will provide  an update on those issues later in 2008.", "To obtain information on the status of the broadcast industry in  transitioning to digital and the issues broadcasters were encountering, we  conducted a Web-based survey of the full-power commercial and  noncommercial television broadcast stations (such as network broadcast  stations and public television stations) in the 50 states and the District of  Columbia. Among other things, we asked the broadcasters questions  related to their digital facilities, construction plans, and issues affecting  the digital transition. We obtained the list of full-power stations from FCC  in June 2007. Since FCC did not maintain e-mail addresses for all of the  licensed broadcasters at that time, we needed to obtain contact  information on the broadcasters through alternate sources. Of the 1,747  stations on FCC\u2019s list, we surveyed 1,682 stations located in the 50 states  and the District of Columbia for which we could obtain contact  information. We conducted our survey from December 2007 through  February 2008 and obtained completed questionnaires from 1,122 stations,  for a response rate of 66.7 percent.

With a firm  date established in law, all full-power television broadcasters will cease  broadcasting their analog signal by February 17, 2009. There are numerous  benefits to transitioning to digital-only broadcast signals, such as enabling  better quality television picture and sound reception and using the  radiofrequency spectrum more efficiently than analog transmission. With  traditional analog technology, pictures and sounds are converted into  \u201cwaveform\u201d electrical signals for transmission through the radiofrequency  spectrum, while digital technology converts these pictures and sounds into  a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones for transmission. While the  digital signal disperses over distances, a digital receiver can adjust and  recreate the missing zeros and ones from the digital transmission, thus  making the digital picture and sound near perfect until significant fading  occurs, at which point no picture can be seen.", "To facilitate the digital transition, Congress and FCC temporarily provided  each eligible full-power television station (both commercial and  noncommercial educational stations, including public stations) with  additional spectrum so they could begin broadcasting a digital signal. This  companion, or paired, digital channel simulcasts the analog program  content in digital format. Assignment of the paired digital channel began in  1997 with the hopes that operating this digital channel would help stations  learn about broadcasting a digital signal, in addition to raising consumer  interest and understanding about the digital transition. The paired digital  channel was intended to be used for a limited period until all stations were  assigned a final digital broadcast station and were able to broadcast on  their final digital channel. FCC completed the digital channel assignment  for most stations in August 2007. A station\u2019s final digital channel could be  (1) the same channel as its paired digital channel, (2) the same channel  that its analog signal uses to broadcast, or (3) an entirely new channel.", "The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 addresses  the responsibilities of FCC related to the DTV transition. The act directs  FCC to require full-power television stations to cease analog broadcasting  after February 17, 2009. Stations are responsible for meeting this  requirement and being prepared to commence digital broadcasting by this  date; stations not ready to commence digital broadcasting risk losing  interference protection and operating authority. The capability to provide  a digital broadcast signal often involves a large outlay of capital and effort  by broadcast stations. Sometimes a new broadcast tower or significant  modifications to an existing tower is required. While a new antenna could  cost a station several hundred thousand dollars, an industry association  stated that stations could spend as much as $2 million to purchase and  install a new broadcast tower, antenna, and equipment. If new towers or  antennas are not required, stations may still need to alter or upgrade  existing towers. Alterations may include moving the digital antenna from a  side-mounted antenna to the top of the tower to increase the coverage of  the digital signal. Upgrades to an existing tower may include strengthening  a tower before additional antennas can be added. For stations building  new towers, installing new antennas, or making changes to existing  structures, the stations must plan in advance to order the proper  equipment and schedule construction crews.", "In September 2007, FCC adopted an order designed to ensure that all cable  subscribers, including those with analog television sets, can view digital  broadcasts after the transition. FCC stated that all cable operators must  make all broadcast signals viewable to all subscribers and cannot degrade  any signal so that a difference in the cable signal and the broadcast signal  would be perceptible to a viewer. According to the order, cable operators  can meet this requirement in one of two ways, either (1) carry the signals  of commercial and noncommercial must-carry stations in analog format to  all analog cable subscribers or (2) for all-digital systems, carry those  signals in a digital-only format, provided all subscribers with analog  television sets have the proper equipment to view the digital signals. This  requirement ensures that subscribers will have the ability to view a digital  signal or an analog signal, depending on which best suits their equipment.", "While this ruling did not address satellite companies, FCC is considering  how to apply the content and degradation requirements to satellite  carriage of digital broadcast signals, and the commission expects to  complete this ruling before the transition.

According to a  broadcast industry representative, many stations need to have their digital  antenna at the top of the tower to fully replicate the area that their analog  service covers. The broadcast industry representative stated that stations  have two options in placing their digital antenna at the top of the  broadcast tower: (1) move the digital antenna to the top now, and buy a  new side-mounted analog antenna, which would ensure that the analog  signal continues until it is switched off and that the digital signal would be  at full power, or (2) keep the analog antenna at the top of the tower until it  is turned off on February 17, 2009, and then install the digital antenna at  the top of the tower. The industry representative stated that both options,  however, present problems for broadcast stations. For the first option,  stations may have to purchase a new analog antenna, which will only be  used for a few months. Also, as a result of the analog antenna being side  mounted, stations\u2019 analog broadcast coverage area would be reduced by a  range from 2 to 9 percent of the viewing market. Stations agreed that they  might have to reduce their analog service prior to the transition date. For  example, the owner of a station in Minnesota commented that it may not  be possible to complete the construction of its digital facilities without  significantly disrupting its analog operations as well as its digital  operations. The owner said the power of its analog signal would have to be  significantly reduced before February 17, 2009, which would affect a large  number of its viewers.", "Several survey respondents that were already broadcasting a digital signal  reported that they needed to take additional steps to complete their digital  facilities. According to our survey results, 151 stations (13 percent)  indicated that they needed to relocate their digital or analog antenna on a  current tower, reinforce an existing tower to allow for additional  antennas, or coordinate antenna placement on another tower. Figure 3  shows the number of stations that need to complete these various steps,  with some stations reporting that they have to complete multiple steps.", "FCC recognizes that there are many technical issues associated with  antenna and equipment replacement or relocation that might force  stations to terminate analog signals prior to the transition date. For  example, FCC noted that there are 49 stations that have documented  problems with side-mounted analog antennas. These stations will have to  relocate their analog antenna to another location on their tower and  operate with reduced analog facilities as they complete the transition.  Other stations may have a tower at capacity, preventing the installation of  an additional antenna on the tower. According to FCC, these stations will  have to terminate analog operations prior to the end of the transition to  mount their digital antenna. In addition, stations with an antenna that is  located on a shared tower may need to reduce or terminate analog signals  as the stations coordinate the configuration of their final digital facilities.  Still other stations have equipment currently in use with their analog  operations that they plan to use with their digital operations. Such a  situation will force stations to terminate their analog signals prior to the  transition so that the equipment can be reconfigured for the final digital  facilities. Although FCC established February 17, 2009, as the new  construction deadline for stations facing unique technical challenges, FCC  will also consider stations\u2019 requests to operate their digital facilities at less  then full power until August 18, 2009\u2014provided the stations continue to  serve at least 85 percent of their viewers.", "According to an antenna manufacturer with whom we spoke, stations will  need to place orders for their antenna by the second quarter of 2008 for  the stations to be prepared for the February 17, 2009, deadline. According  to this manufacturer, the amount of time needed to design, order, and  install an antenna can range from 6 weeks and 9 months, depending on its  complexity. This manufacturer said a typical antenna serving one station  requires about 4 or 5 months, from design to installation. In its third  periodic review and order on the DTV transition, FCC noted that absent  extraordinary circumstances, it would no longer consider a lack of  equipment as a valid reason for granting an extension of time to construct  facilities. FCC also said that stations demonstrating that they placed  equipment orders well in advance will be considered eligible for an  extension on these grounds.", "Antenna work and replacement could be hampered by weather conditions  for towers located in northern climates and on higher elevations.  According to an antenna manufacturer with whom we spoke, although  antenna work can be done during the winter months, it can be much more  difficult, take longer, and entail additional costs. According to this  manufacturer, winds over 10 miles an hour can be problematic for  installing equipment. Installation crews need several days of limited wind  speed to complete antenna work. In addition, ice and snow can present  safety issues when installing antennas on towers. FCC recognizes that for  some stations, work cannot be completed because of weather conditions,  and that those stations facing legitimate delays will be considered for  construction extensions. For example, if a station has a side-mounted  digital antenna and can demonstrate that weather considerations would  force it to reduce or terminate its analog signal well before the transition  date to complete building of their final facility, it might qualify for an early  reduction or termination of analog service prior to February 17, 2009. FCC  states that in such situations, it could be preferable to accept a limited loss  of analog service for a short time prior to the transition date to ensure the  station is able to complete its transition to digital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues with Channel Relocation", "paragraphs": ["FCC notes that the stations facing the most significant amount of  construction to finalize their facilities are those that are moving to a  different channel. According to FCC, 643 stations will move to a different  channel to complete the transition. FCC states that 514 of these stations  will relocate their current digital channel to their analog channel. Stations  might prefer to relocate their digital channel to the analog channel  because it is the channel that viewers recognize. For example, one station  we visited has its digital signal on channel 16 but plans to relocate the  digital signal to channel 9, which is the station\u2019s current analog channel  and the channel number people recognize for that station. In addition,  stations currently located on channels 52 through 69 need to relocate their  channel because these channel frequencies will be used for public safety  and new wireless services after the transition. According to FCC,   129 stations will move to a completely new channel once the transition is  complete. Such moves entail additional challenges for these stations  because they may need to address such issues as (1) can the stations use  any of their current analog or digital equipment, (2) will their viewers be  impacted during construction of their digital facilities, and (3) will the  stations have to coordinate with other stations because the channel they  are moving to will be occupied by another station until the transition date.", "Because of the issues associated with channel relocation, FCC is allowing  stations moving to a different digital channel to cease operations on their  pretransition digital channels and begin operating digitally on their new  channels before the transition date. Stations can operate on their new  channel before the transition date provided (1) the early transitioning  stations will not cause impermissible interference to another station and  (2) the early transitioning stations continue to serve their existing viewers  for the remainder of the transition, and commence their full-power,  authorized posttransition operations upon expiration of the   February 17, 2009, transition deadline. In addition, stations that are  moving to a different digital channel for posttransition operations may  temporarily remain on their pretransition channel while they complete  construction of their final digital facilities. Stations can remain on their  pretransition channel provided (1) they build facilities serving at least the  same population that receives their current analog television and digital  services so that over the air viewers will not lose service and (2) they do  not cause impermissible interference to other stations or prevent other  stations from making their transition."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coordination between Broadcast Stations and Various Public and Private Entities May Be Necessary to Support a Smooth Transition", "paragraphs": ["Coordination issues might affect television broadcast stations\u2019 ability to  finalize their digital operations, according to stations that responded to  our survey and our discussions with broadcast stations and industry  representatives.

Another  survey respondent stated that objection by the Canadian government to its  final channel assignment was very late in the process and will seriously  jeopardize its ability to build its digital facilities by the transition date.  Another station that responded to our survey expressed concern about  Canadian coordination being completed by the 2009 deadline. In its third  periodic review and order, FCC stated that it will consider extensions of  construction deadlines for stations encountering delays in cases where  resolution of issues related to international coordination is truly beyond  the control of the station. FCC also stated that if agreements cannot be  reached, stations might be required to construct facilities with a smaller  area of signal coverage. At the time of this report, there was a set of  companion bills in the Senate and House known as the DTV Border Fix  Act, which, if enacted, would authorize FCC to allow full-power television  stations serving communities located within 50 miles of the U.S.-Mexican  border to continue operating an analog signal until February 17, 2014.

The company representative stated he believes that there are a  significant number of stations that will wait until early 2008 to start  making inquiries about work needing to be done on broadcast towers.", "According to FCC, stations constructing a new tower should consider  whether there are any existing towers that can be used or if a new tower  must be constructed. FCC states that because of the lead times involved in  purchasing or leasing land with the appropriate federal government  clearances, local and state zoning requirements, and varying timelines for  designing and constructing the new tower, stations must begin planning as  soon as possible to have all of the work completed by the deadline.", "Similar to weather conditions affecting work on antennas, winter weather  could hamper tower construction in northern climates and on higher  elevations. Television stations commented that working on towers in the  winter months can be problematic, if not impossible. For example, a major  broadcast network commented that many station transmitting sites are not  readily accessible during the winter, especially to cranes and other heavy  equipment necessary for tower rigging and equipment installation. In fact,  the broadcaster commented that snow and ice make one of its stations  accessible only by a special vehicle from October until March. Another  station commented that it has been difficult to perform heavy construction  at a remote and high-altitude transmitter site, and that the short weather  window, difficult access, and complex work make the transition date hard  to attain. A representative of a major tower construction company stated  that weather is always a factor when determining the amount of time a  project takes. The company representative stated that subzero conditions  and ice are not conducive for tower work, and, although the work can be  done, it is very dangerous and takes a much longer time to complete.", "Stations encountering financial constraints may also have difficulties in  completing the digital transition. According to our survey, 38 stations  noted that financial constraints had been an issue during the process of  constructing their final digital facilities. In addition, 39 stations that are  broadcasting a digital signal, but have yet to begin building their final  digital facilities, indicated that financial constraints were a reason they  had not yet started construction. Furthermore, another 33 stations, or 42  percent of stations not yet broadcasting a digital signal, indicated that  financial constraints contributed to delays in building their final digital  facilities. One station commented that the digital transition has been a  financial drain on small-market television stations. This station noted that  the cost for the equipment is the same whether the station serves a small  or large market, but large-market stations have a much higher financial  base to pay for the equipment.", "In its third periodic review, FCC acknowledged that some stations face  financial obstacles to completing construction, but stated that it is  imperative that stations devise and implement a plan to complete their  final digital facilities. FCC established criteria for extensions of  construction on final digital facilities due to financial hardship. To obtain  an extension on the grounds of financial hardship, FCC requires a station  to demonstrate that it (1) is the subject of a bankruptcy or receivership  proceeding or (2) has experienced a negative cash flow for the past 3  years. FCC stated that while adopting the tighter financial hardship  standard, it recognizes that some stations, including some noncommercial  educational stations and some smaller stations, face extraordinary  financial circumstances that do not fit within the new financial hardship  criteria but may warrant an extension of time to finalize construction. Two  stations that responded to our survey stated that they would qualify under  FCC\u2019s new criteria of financial hardship. One station commented that it  was in the process of filing bankruptcy after 3 years of negative cash flow.  Another station commented that it would qualify for financial hardship  due to costs associated with locating its analog antenna and operating  with a digital-only signal for a period of time, which resulted in a 30  percent drop in viewers and a negative cash flow from the reduction of  viewers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Taken Numerous Actions to Guide Broadcast Stations through the Digital Transition", "paragraphs": ["FCC\u2019s actions have provided guidance to broadcast stations throughout  the transition process.

FCC determined that establishing a digital standard for  broadcasters was critical to begin the transition to digital broadcast; the  establishment of a digital standard was completed with the adoption of an  order in 1996. Since then, FCC has taken additional actions to continue  moving broadcasters toward the digital transition, as shown in table 1. For  example, FCC assigned paired digital channels for stations that would be  broadcasting both a digital and an analog signal prior to the digital  transition. These paired digital channels were important to allow  broadcasters time to gain experience in operating a digital service,  stimulate interest in the DTV transition, and encourage consumers to  begin purchasing digital equipment.", "In its December 2007 third periodic review and order, FCC finalized a  number of actions to facilitate broadcasters\u2019 completion of the DTV  transition. For example, the third periodic review and order addressed,  among other things, (1) time frames for television stations to complete  construction of their digital facilities; (2) information all full-power  television stations must provide to FCC by February 19, 2008, detailing the  station\u2019s current transition status, any additional steps needed to  commence its full, digital operations, and its timeline to meet the   February 17, 2009, transition deadline; (3) when and for how long  stations will be permitted to reduce or cease service on their analog or  paired digital channel; and (4) guidelines for rapid approval of minor  expansion of authorized service areas for stations that are moving their  digital channel for posttransition operations to allow these stations  additional flexibility to use their existing analog antenna."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Broadcast Stations Required FCC Decisions Prior to Finalizing Their Digital Facilities", "paragraphs": ["In our survey of broadcast stations, 128 respondents indicated they were  \u201cawaiting action from FCC\u201d to complete building their final digital  facilities. In following up with these stations after they had responded to  our survey, our analysis suggested that the actions many stations were  awaiting were addressed in FCC\u2019s third periodic review and order.  However, at that time, a few broadcasters still had issues that required  FCC decisions\u2014such as approval for a construction permit, petitions to  alter their signal power, or FCC reconsideration of their final digital  channel assignment. According to FCC, approximately 100 petitions for  reconsideration of final DTV channel assignments were filed by  broadcasters. FCC said these petitions needed engineering analysis  performed to determine the feasibility and impact on other stations. FCC  told us that the analysis had been completed, and released its decisions  regarding the petitions in early March 2008.

Our intent was to survey  all full-power commercial and noncommercial broadcast television  stations in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. We asked the  broadcast stations questions related to their (1) digital facilities and plans,  (2) issues affecting the digital conversion, (3) antenna locations, (4) DTV  information advertisements and public service announcements, (5) digital  signal contour and coordination with cable and satellite, (6) relocation of  digital channels, (7) digital and analog signal coverage, (8) international  issues, and (9) translator stations. The initial sample frame for the study  was all FCC licensed full-powered television stations as of June 2007\u2014a  total of 1,747 stations. Since FCC did not maintain e-mail addresses for the  licensed broadcasters at that time, we needed to obtain contact  information on the broadcasters through alternate sources. We requested  and received contact information from the following sources: the  Association of Public Television Stations, ABC, CBS, NBC, CW, FOX, and  Telemundo. In total, we received contact information for 1,058 stations.  For the remaining 625 stations, the engagement team spent 1 week  compiling a list of contact information. Of the 1,747 broadcasters on FCC\u2019s  list, we surveyed 1,682 stations located in the 50 states and the District of  Columbia for which we could obtain contact information. In several  instances, we identified stations that were not on FCC\u2019s list of full-power  broadcast stations, or stations for which we did not initially have contact  information and subsequently sent the survey to these stations. From  September 27, 2007, through October 16, 2007, we conducted a series of  pretests with general managers of broadcast television stations to help  further refine our questions, clarify any ambiguous portions of the survey,  and identify any potentially biased questions. Upon completion of the  pretests and development of the final survey questions and format, we sent  an announcement of the upcoming survey to 1,682 broadcast television  stations on November 30, 2007. These stations were notified that the  survey was available online on December 7, 2007. We sent follow-up e-mail  messages to nonrespondents on December 14, 2007, December 21, 2007,  January 8, 2008, and January 9, 2008, and then attempted to contact by  telephone those stations that had not completed the survey.", "The survey was available online until February 8, 2008. Of the 1,682  broadcast stations that were asked to complete the survey, we received  1,122 completed surveys, for an overall response rate of 66.7 percent. Of  those completed questionnaires, 72 percent were from commercial  stations and 28 percent were from noncommercial stations. The practical  difficulties of conducting surveys may introduce errors commonly referred  to as \u201cnonsampling errors.\u201d For example, questions may be misinterpreted  and the respondents\u2019 answers may differ from broadcast stations that did  not respond to the survey. To minimize nonsampling errors, we pretested  the survey and conducted numerous follow-up contacts with  nonrespondents. In addition, steps were taken during data analysis to  further minimize errors, such as performing computer analyses to identify  inconsistencies and completing a review of data analysis by an  independent reviewer. We also conducted a nonresponse bias analysis,  comparing our survey estimates with estimates obtained from FCC  records, and found small, but statistically significant differences. Because  of the differences identified through the bias analysis, we decided to  provide estimates only for respondents and not to project our results to  the population. The survey results were reliable enough for our purpose  because the bias does not appear to be more than a few percentage points.  A difference of 5 percentage points in any of our estimates would not  affect our findings.

We interviewed officials  with FCC as well as a wide variety of industry and other private sector  stakeholders with an interest in the DTV transition, such as commercial  and noncommercial broadcasters; antenna and equipment manufacturers;  tower construction companies; and industry advocacy groups, such as the  National Association of Broadcasters and the Association for Maximum  Service Television. We conducted this performance audit from April 2007  through April 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
