The most prevalent disabilities among these veterans were post-traumatic stress disorder and tinnitus (\"ringing in the ears\"). GAO's review of 182 IL cases from fiscal year 2008 shows that VR&E provided a range of IL benefits to veterans; the most common benefits being counseling services and computers. Less common benefits included gym memberships, camping equipment, and a boat. GAO estimates that VR&E spent nearly $14 million on benefits for veterans entering the IL track in fiscal year 2008--an average of almost $6,000 per IL veteran.", "About 89 percent of fiscal year 2008 IL veterans were considered by VR&E to be \"rehabilitated\" by the end of fiscal year 2011; that is, generally, to have completed their IL plans. These plans identify each veteran's independent living goals and the benefits VR&E will provide. The remaining 11 percent of cases were either closed for various reasons, such as the veteran declined benefits, or were still active. Rehabilitation rates across regions varied from 49 to 100 percent, and regions with larger IL caseloads generally rehabilitated a greater percentage of IL veterans. On average, IL plans nationwide were completed in 384 days; however, completion times varied by region, from 150 to 895 days.", "GAO identified four key areas where VR&E's oversight was limited. First, some regions may not be complying with certain case management requirements. For instance, while VR&E is required to coordinate with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) on IL benefits, VR&E counselors have difficulty obtaining timely responses from VHA. This has resulted in delayed benefits or VR&E providing the benefits instead of VHA. Second, VR&E does not systematically monitor regional variation in IL caseloads and benefits provided. Instead, it has relied on its quality assurance reviews and ad hoc studies, but these are limited in scope. Third, VR&E's policies for approving IL expenditures may not be appropriate as regions were permitted to purchase a range of items without Central Office approval, some of which were costly or questionable. In one case GAO reviewed, Central Office review was not required for expenditures of $17,500 for a boat, motor, trailer, and the boat's shipping, among other items. Finally, VR&E's case management system does not collect information on IL costs and the types of benefits purchased. VR&E also lacks accurate data on the number of IL veterans served. While the law currently allows up to 2,700 veterans to enter the IL track annually, data used to monitor the cap are based on the number of IL plans developed, not on the number of individual veterans admitted. Since veterans can have more than one IL plan in a fiscal year, one veteran could be counted multiple times towards the cap. VA plans to make modifications to its case management system to address this, but officials noted that it could take up to 3 years to obtain funding for this project."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The IL track--one of five tracks within VA's VR&E program--provides a range of non-employment related benefits to help veterans with service-connected disabilities live more independently when employment is not considered feasible at the time they enter the VR&E program. These benefits can include counseling, assistive devices, and other services or equipment. This testimony is based on GAO's report issued in June 2013, and describes (1) the characteristics of veterans in the IL track, and the types and costs of benefits provided; (2) the extent to which their IL plans were completed, and the time it took to complete them; and (3) the extent to which the IL track has been administered appropriately and consistently across regional offices.", "GAO analyzed VA administrative data from fiscal years 2008 to 2011, and reviewed a random, generalizable sample of 182 veterans who entered the IL track in fiscal year 2008.

Under VA regulations, VR&E may  declare a veteran successfully \u201crehabilitated\u201d when all goals in their IL  plan have been achieved, or if they meet other conditions. Therefore,  \u201crehabilitation\u201d does not necessarily mean that the veteran\u2019s disabilities  have improved, but rather that the goals developed in their IL plan to  facilitate independence have been met.

Because there is no statutory limit on the number of IL plans a veteran  can have, officials told us that veterans can reapply to the VR&E program  at any time and start another IL plan. However, unlike VR&E\u2019s four  employment-related tracks, the number of veterans who can be admitted  into the IL track annually is limited by the law. While this number has  increased over the years, the cap was set at 2,600 veterans in fiscal year  2011, and 2,700 in fiscal year 2012.", "My remarks today are based on our report, which was released on June  7, 2013, and describes (1) the characteristics of veterans in the IL track,  and the types and costs of benefits they were provided; (2) the extent to  which their IL plans were completed, and the time it took to complete  them; and (3) the extent to which the IL track has been administered  appropriately and consistently across regional offices. To obtain this  information, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; standards  for internal controls and managerial cost accounting; as well as VR&E  policies, procedures, and other relevant studies and documentation. We  also interviewed VA officials and veteran service organizations, and  visited VA regional offices in San Diego, California; Atlanta, Georgia;  Detroit, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the District of  Columbia. In addition, we analyzed VA administrative data and used  statistical models to determine any differences in rehabilitation times.  Moreover, we reviewed the case files of a random, generalizable sample  of 182 veterans who were assigned to the IL track at some point during  fiscal year 2008.

The most  common type of goods or services were related to counseling, education  and training, and computer and camera equipment.

Of the IL cases that had been  discontinued, the reasons included the veteran declining benefits, not  responding to VA\u2019s attempts to contact them, worsening medical  conditions, and death. We also found that some IL plans were easier to  close as rehabilitated than others, due to the varied nature and  complexity of IL plans, which are based on veterans\u2019 individual disabilities  and needs. For example, one IL plan we reviewed for a veteran with  rheumatoid arthritis only called for the purchase and installation of eight  door levers and a grab rail for the bathtub to facilitate his independence.  However, another IL plan we reviewed called for providing a veteran who  used a wheel-chair with medical, dental, and vision care as needed, and  about $24,000 in modifications to the veteran\u2019s home, including modifying  the veteran\u2019s bathroom, widening doors and modifying thresholds, and  installing an emergency exit ramp in a bedroom.", "While the overall IL rehabilitation rate nationwide was 89 percent for  veterans who started an IL plan in fiscal year 2008, the rate varied by  regional office, from 49 to 100 percent.

VRCs told us that this requirement is a  challenge due to the size of their caseloads and the distances that they  may have to travel to meet with veterans. Furthermore, while VR&E and  the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) both have policies that require  them to coordinate on the provision of goods and services for IL track  veterans, we found that some VRCs experience challenges in doing so.  Several VRCs in the regions we interviewed indicated that when they  refer IL track cases to VHA physicians, the physicians do not respond or  they respond too late. As a result, services for IL track veterans are  delayed or purchased by VR&E instead of VHA.

In analyzing VR&E\u2019s administrative data, we found that  VR&E counts the number of IL plans developed annually rather than  the number of individual veterans admitted to the track. Because  multiple IL plans can be developed for an individual veteran during the  same fiscal year, veterans with multiple plans may be counted more  than once toward the statutory cap.
