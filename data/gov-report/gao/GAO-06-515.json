In response to a requirement in the 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Conference Report and a congressional request, GAO examined (1) HUD's management of the program, including loan underwriting and monitoring; (2) the extent to which HUD's oversight of insured facilities is coordinated with the states' oversight of quality of care; (3) the financial risks the program poses to HUD's General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance (GI/SRI) Fund; and (4) how HUD estimates the annual credit subsidy cost for the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While HUD's decentralized program management allows its 51 field offices flexibility in their specific practices, GAO found differences in the extent to which staff in the five field offices it visited were aware of current program requirements. For example, four offices were unaware of required addendums to the programs' standard regulatory agreement. Further, while individual offices had developed useful practices for loan underwriting and monitoring, they lacked a mechanism for systematically sharing such practices with other offices. Also, field office officials were concerned about adequate current or future levels of staff expertise--a critical factor in managing program risk in that health care facility loans are complicated and require specialized knowledge and expertise. FHA requires a review of the most recent annual state-administered inspection report for state-licensed facilities applying for program insurance, and recommends, but does not require, continued monitoring of such reports for facilities once it has insured them. Four of the five HUD field offices GAO visited do not routinely collect annual inspection reports for their insured facilities. While the reports are but one of several monitoring tools, they provide potential indicators of future financial risk. HUD has proposed revising its standard regulatory agreements to require insured facility owners or operators to submit annual inspection reports and to report notices of violations. However, the proposed revisions have been awaiting approval since August 2004, and the implementation date is uncertain. The Section 232 program accounts for only about 16 percent of the GI/SRI Fund's total unpaid principal balance, but program and industry trends pose potential risks to the Section 232 program and to the GI/SRI Fund. For example, in recent years the program has insured increasing numbers of assisted living facility loans and refinancing loans, for which there are limited data available to assess long-term performance. Other potential risk factors include increasing prepayments (full repayment before loan maturity) and loan concentration in several large markets and among relatively few lenders. Projected shifts in demand for residential care facilities could affect currently insured facilities and the overall market for the types of facilities that HUD insures under the program. To estimate the program subsidy cost, HUD uses a model to project cash flows for each loan cohort (the loans originated in a given fiscal year) over its entire life. HUD's model does not explicitly or fully consider certain factors, such as loan prepayment penalties, interest rate changes, or differences in loans to different types of facilities, and uses some proxy data that is not comparable to Section 232 loans. The model's exclusion of potentially relevant factors and it use of this proxy data could affect the reliability of HUD's credit subsidy estimates."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Through its Section 232 Mortgage Insurance for Residential Care Facilities  program (Section 232 program), the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures  mortgages for nursing homes, assisted living facilities, board and care  homes, and intermediate care facilities. As of December 31, 2005, the  program insured mortgages with an unpaid principal balance of  approximately $12.5 billion. The program insures HUD-approved private  lenders against financial losses from loan defaults; insured loans can be  used to finance the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of a facility,  enable borrowers to refinance projects that do not need substantial  rehabilitation, or to install fire safety equipment.", "For budget and accounting purposes, the Section 232 program is part of  HUD\u2019s General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance (GI/SRI) Fund; other  programs in the GI/SRI Fund provide mortgage insurance for various types  of multifamily housing projects and for hospitals. HUD is required to  annually estimate the subsidy cost, or the cost to the federal government of  guaranteeing credit to residential care facilities over the life of the loans.  This estimate requires FHA to forecast future cash flows associated with  the loans, which can be influenced by factors that are associated with the  potential risks facing the program\u2019s loan portfolio.", "While private lenders may finance the purchase or construction of nursing  homes, public funding, including Medicare and Medicaid, has accounted  for an increasing percentage of spending on nursing home care. For  example, in 2000 Medicare and Medicaid financed 39 percent of the nation\u2019s  spending on nursing home care, up 28 percent from 1990. In 2004,  Medicare accounted for 14 percent and Medicaid accounted for 44 percent  of the nation\u2019s spending on nursing home care, and the total of all public  funds, including Medicare and Medicaid, accounted for approximately 61  percent. Federal and state governments share responsibility for oversight  of nursing homes that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines standards that  nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs and contracts with states to conduct annual inspections.  Generally, states license nursing homes (and in some cases related  facilities) and oversee their operations through inspections.", "The 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Conference Report mandated that  we review the design and management of two FHA mortgage insurance  programs \u2014those for the Section 232 program and the Section 242 Hospital  Mortgage Insurance program. In addition, the Ranking Member of the  Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, Senate Committee on  Banking, and others requested that we review several aspects of the  Section 232 program. Accordingly, this report provides both the results of  the mandated review and our response to the request. Specifically, we  examined: (1) HUD\u2019s management of the program, including loan  underwriting and monitoring; (2) the extent to which HUD\u2019s oversight of  insured residential care facilities is coordinated with the states\u2019 oversight  of the quality of care provided by those facilities that are subject to state  licensing or inspection; (3) the financial implications of the program to the  GI/SRI Fund, including risk posed by program and market trends; and (4)  how HUD estimates the annual credit subsidy for the program, including  the factors and assumptions used. In addition, we examined HUD\u2019s action  in response to a HUD Inspector General report that concluded that HUD\u2019s  Office of Housing did not have adequate controls to effectively manage the  Section 232 program; this information is summarized in appendix III.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed program manuals and  documentation of loan processing procedures and underwriting  requirements and analyzed program financial data that we tested and found  reliable for our purposes. In examining HUD\u2019s management of the  program, we focused on how underwriting and loan monitoring activities  were carried out through visits to five of HUD\u2019s field offices (Atlanta,  Georgia; Buffalo, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and  San Francisco, California), where we interviewed program officials and  obtained relevant documents in each office. We also reviewed  documentation of the model HUD uses to estimate program subsidy costs,  applicable program laws, regulations, and policy statements. We obtained  relevant program documentation and interviewed headquarters officials in  HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Development and Office of Asset Management  and HUD\u2019s Office of Evaluation and Office of Inspector General. We also  interviewed representatives of residential care associations; lenders with  loans insured by the program, as well as other private lenders that offer  non-FHA-insured residential care loans; and representatives of nursing  homes and assisted living facilities. Our review did not include an  evaluation of the need for the Section 232 program.

Congress established the Section 232  program in 1959 to provide mortgage insurance for the construction and  rehabilitation of nursing homes. The Housing and Community  Development Act of 1987 expanded the program to allow for the insuring of  refinancing or purchase of FHA-insured facilities and, in 1994, HUD issued  regulations implementing legislation to expand the program to allow for  the insuring of assisted living facilities and the refinancing of loans for  facilities not previously insured by FHA. Since 1960, FHA has insured 4,372  loans through the Section 232 program in all 50 states, the District of  Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. As of the end of fiscal  year 2005, there were 2,054 currently insured loans.", "FHA does not insure all residential care facilities, as there are  approximately 16,500 nursing home facilities and over 36,000 assisted living  facilities in operation. We did not identify any private mortgage insurance  that is currently available for loans made to nursing homes or other similar  facilities. According to HUD officials, in recent times, the Section 232  program exists, in part, to support the market for residential care facilities  when the private market is reluctant to finance such projects due to market  conditions. The loans are advantageous to borrowers because they are  nonrecourse loans whereby the lender (in this case the lender and the  insurer, FHA) has no claim against the borrower in the event of default and  can only recover the property. The loans are also generally long term (in  some cases up to 40 years) and, according to HUD and lender officials,  offer an interest rate that is, in many cases, lower than what private lenders  offer for non-FHA insured loans made to nursing homes and other similar  facilities. Additionally, FHA insures 99 percent of the unpaid principal  balance plus accrued interest.", "HUD administers the Section 232 program through its field offices, with  HUD headquarters oversight. HUD\u2019s field structure consists of 18 Hub  offices and 33 program centers. Generally, each Hub office has a number of  program centers that report to it. Program centers administer multifamily  programs within the states in which they are located or portions thereof.  Hub offices also administer multifamily programs, as well as augment the  operations of and coordinate workload between their program centers.", "Under Medicaid, states set their own nursing home payment rates  (reimbursement rates), and the federal government provides funds to  match states\u2019 share of spending as determined by a federal formula. Within  broad federal guidelines, states have considerable flexibility to set  reimbursement rates for nursing homes that participate in Medicaid but are  required to ensure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy,  and quality of care. Under Medicare, skilled nursing facilities receive a  federal per diem payment that reflects the resident\u2019s care needs and is  adjusted for geographic differences in costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Decentralized Management Provides Field Offices Flexibility, but Varying Awareness of Underwriting and Monitoring Practices and Concerns Over Insufficient Staff Expertise Increase Program\u2019s Potential Risks", "paragraphs": ["While the decentralization of the program allows field offices some  flexibility in their specific practices, the results of our visits to five field  offices revealed differences in the extent to which field office staff were  aware of current program requirements.

FHA also requires a variety  of reviews for monitoring Section 232 loans. (Loan underwriting and  monitoring requirements, which can involve fairly complex reviews and  analyses, are described in more detail in app. II.)", "According to HUD headquarters officials, the field offices that administer  the Section 232 program are required to follow all program statutes and  regulations, but the decentralization of the program allows field offices  some flexibility in their specific practices. For example, individual field  offices can designate how to staff the underwriting and monitoring of  Section 232 loans, depending on such factors as loan volume relative to  other multifamily programs, to fully utilize resources. HUD headquarters  provides guidance on program policies and requirements; when necessary,  reviews applications for certain types of loans, such as those submitted by  nonprofit entities; and provides technical assistance or additional guidance  and support if contacted by field offices. HUD headquarters staff also  conduct Quality Management Reviews, which are management reviews of  field offices administering HUD programs and services. For these reviews,  evaluators visit offices and coordinate subsequent reports. The process  also involves reporting the status of follow-up corrective actions. While not  focused on the Section 232 program, this process helps to oversee the  program by reviewing the management of the field offices that administer  it.", "We found that the five field offices that we visited varied in their  understanding and awareness of policies related to the Section 232  program. For example, staff in two field offices said that their standard  regulatory agreement (that serves as the basic insurance contract and  spells out the respective obligations of FHA, the lender, and the borrower)  did not include language that would require operators of insured facilities  to submit financial statements on new loans. According to officials at  HUD headquarters, field offices should be using language requiring these  financial statements. HUD and most lender officials we interviewed told us  that operator financial statements provide information on the legal entity  operating the facility in cases where the borrower and the operator of the  residential care facility are different entities. These officials also stated  that, in such situations, borrower financial statements may not disclose  expenses, income, and other financial information, and may only show the  transactions between the borrower and operator, thus making operator  financial statements a necessity. Also, HUD\u2019s Inspector General identified  HUD\u2019s lack of a requirement for operators to submit financial statements  electronically to be part of an internal control weakness for the Section 232  program.", "Additionally, we found that the field offices that we visited were not always  aware of specific notices that established new requirements or processes  for the Section 232 program. For example:  Four of the five field offices that we visited were not aware of a notice  that disqualifies potential Section 232 borrowers if they have had a  bankruptcy in their past. According to a HUD headquarters officials, this  policy is intended to protect HUD from insuring a potentially risky loan  based on a borrower\u2019s financial history.", "Officials at four of the five field offices we visited did not know about  required addendums to the regulatory agreement regarding state  licensing requirements for nursing homes. HUD developed these  addendums to place a lien on a property\u2019s operational documents, such  as a Certificate of Need and state licenses, to prevent operators from  taking these documents with them upon termination of a property\u2019s  lease. Without these documents, a facility may not be able to operate  and, consequently, the property\u2019s value would be greatly diminished.", "According to HUD headquarters officials, HUD headquarters  communicates changes in the Section 232 program\u2019s policies and  procedures to field offices in a variety of ways besides sending formal  notices. For example, HUD headquarters also posts some notices on a  \u201cfrequently-asked questions\u201d section of a Web site available to field offices,  lenders, attorneys, and others. HUD headquarters officials also conduct  nationwide conference calls with the field offices in which various HUD  multifamily programs, including the Section 232 program, are discussed.  The conference calls are conducted separately for loan development staff  and asset management staff that work, respectively, on the underwriting  and monitoring of loans. HUD headquarters officials stated that these  conference calls provide a forum to disseminate information to the field  offices and for individual field offices to discuss any issues, questions, or  concerns regarding any multifamily programs, including the Section 232  program.", "HUD headquarters officials stated that they plan to address the lack of  awareness we observed by updating the \u201cMultifamily Asset Management  and Project Servicing Handbook\u201d to clarify current policies and  requirements for the Section 232 program. HUD is also planning to update  the handbook to address the 2002 HUD Inspector General report that  identified that HUD's current handbook was not specific to Section 232  nursing home operations.

They stated that the additional steps result in the better screening  of loan risk and could result in the rejection of a risky loan they might  otherwise approve.", "We found a similar variety of practices in the monitoring of Section 232  loans. In some cases, field offices we visited had taken additional steps  beyond those required by HUD. For example:  While HUD requires a review of the annual financial statements of  insured facilities, two field offices that we visited require monthly  financial accounting reports from facilities either for the first year of the  loan or until the facility has reached stable occupancy.", "Two field offices had developed their own specialized checklists for  monitoring Section 232 loans. These checklists were specifically  designed for the oversight of residential care facility loans and included  items such as the facility\u2019s replacement reserve accounts and  professional liability insurance, among other items.", "One of the offices had established a Section 232 working group, where  underwriting and asset management staff met periodically to discuss  loans in the portfolio and issues related to the overall management of  the program in the field office.

These were asset management staff whose primary  or sole responsibility was oversight of the Section 232 portfolio.", "While HUD headquarters officials stated that they do not require  management reviews of Section 232 facilities, three of the five field  offices we visited conducted management reviews on some part of their  Section 232 portfolios.", "One field office obtained the state annual inspection reports on its  Section 232 facilities on a regular basis.", "According to officials in these offices, the unique characteristics associated  with residential care facilities make the additional measures necessary.", "Officials in field offices we visited that had developed these specific  practices stated that the practices result in better underwriting and  monitoring of loans and could potentially help to prevent claims. However,  HUD field offices do not have a systematic means by which to share  information with other field offices about practices they have developed.  While field office officials can raise concerns and issues through  conference calls with HUD headquarters officials, most explained that  these conference calls are not particularly designed for field offices to  share practices with other field offices. Officials in the five field offices that  we visited told us that they occasionally contact their counterparts in other  field offices regarding loan processing or asset management questions or  issues. Additionally, officials in some field offices said that they  occasionally see their counterparts at regional lender conferences.  However, aside from these forms of contact, there was no systematic  method by which to learn about other field office practices. Consequently,  officials in one field office are likely to be unaware of additional steps or  practices taken by another field office that are intended to help officials  improve underwriting or monitoring of Section 232 loans.

In its 2002 report,  HUD\u2019s Office of Inspector General also identified that field office project  managers did not have sufficient training on reviewing Section 232 loans  and dealing with the issues unique to Section 232 properties.", "All of the private lenders we interviewed\u2014those that offer non-FHA  insured loans to residential care facilities and face similar risks to FHA\u2014 had a specialized group that conducted the underwriting of these loans. All  of the individuals that conducted the underwriting of these loans were part  of a health care lending unit that focused exclusively on loans made to  health care facilities. According to the lenders, they believed it was  necessary to have specialized staff underwriting such loans due to the  unique nature of lending money to a facility that was designed for a  residential health care business. Additionally, almost all of the private  lenders we interviewed had specialized staff that monitored their  residential care facility loans. According to lender staff we interviewed,  nursing home and assisted living facility loans require an understanding of  the market, trends, expenses, income, and other such unique  characteristics associated with these types of facilities.", "While officials in only two of the five offices expressed concern about the  expertise of current staff, officials in all field offices we visited stated that  they are concerned about the ability to adequately staff the Section 232  program in the next 5 years. They stated that as older staff retire in the next  5 years or so, any expertise that such staff currently have will take time to  replace. All of the field offices that we visited staffed the underwriting  process for Section 232 loans similar to that of other multifamily programs,  based on workload and staff resources. However, while two field offices  assigned their Section 232 properties, along with other multifamily  properties, to general asset management staff for oversight, three field  offices designated specific staff to oversee Section 232 properties. This was  due to the latter field office officials\u2019 belief, similar to that of the private  lenders we interviewed, that the properties require a certain level of  knowledge and expertise associated with residential care facilities.  Expertise in Section 232 loans allows for a better understanding of the  distinct issues associated with oversight of residential care facilities. In one  of the offices that had general asset management staff overseeing the  portfolio, eight project managers shared responsibility for monitoring  Section 232 properties in conjunction with other multifamily program  properties. In contrast, in one of the offices with staff designated  specifically for the Section 232 program, one member of the asset  management staff was responsible for the entire Section 232 portfolio.  Officials from the two field offices that have experienced staff specialized  in monitoring Section 232 loans stated that they are concerned about losing  their specialized staff over time and acknowledged that they will need to  find replacements in order to continue to adequately monitor Section 232  loans. Their concern stems in part from the fact that Section 232 facilities,  unlike other multifamily properties, require specialized knowledge and an  understanding of the marketing, trends, and revenue streams associated  with residential care facilities.", "According to officials in all of the field offices that we visited, monitoring of  Section 232 loans, when compared with other FHA-insured multifamily  programs, requires additional measures. Section 232 loans contain a  complex business component\u2014the actual assisted living service or the  nursing service operating in a facility\u2014making them different from other  multifamily programs that are solely realty loans. Consequently, for Section  232 loans, field office officials monitor the financial health of the business,  including expenses, income, and other such items. Some field office  officials also stated that it is important to monitor the operator to ensure  that the facility is adequately managed. Additionally, some field office  officials stated that to ensure the facility is generating enough income, they  have to monitor Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, as well as  occupancy rates.", "According to HUD headquarters officials, as part of its overall strategic  human capital efforts, HUD is currently assessing the loss of human capital  in field offices over time.

The analysis  of the entire portfolio showed that the 10-year claim rates for more recent  loan cohorts (loans originated between 1987 and 1991 and loans originated  between 1992 and 1996) ranked among the highest historical cohort claim  rates (see fig. 2).

New construction loans are for loans that involve the construction of a new  residential care facility. Substantial rehabilitation loans are for loans that  meet HUD criteria for substantial rehabilitation of a residential care facility,  such as two or more building components being substantially replaced.  Purchase loans are for loans in which the borrower is acquiring an existing  residential care facility, while refinance loans are the refinancing of an  existing HUD insured loan or a loan not previously insured by HUD. As  described earlier in the report, HUD began to allow for the refinancing of  FHA-insured facilities and non-FHA insured facilities in 1987 and 1994,  respectively. When analyzing Section 232 loan data by loan purpose, we  found that new construction/substantial rehabilitation loans have a higher  5-year claim rate than refinance/purchase loans for the most recent cohort  for which data are available (see fig. 3). New construction/substantial  rehabilitation loans originated between 1997 and 2001 also have the highest  historical 5-year cohort claim rate for these type of loans. Because of the  higher claim rates in recent years, continued monitoring will be important.  In contrast, the number of refinance and purchase loans endorsed in the  last 5 years is more than double those endorsed in the previous 5 years. The  future impact of the refinance and purchase loans on the overall  performance of the Section 232 program is uncertain since they have  existed for a shorter period of time and thus there is currently limited data  available to assess the relative risk of claims.", "As discussed earlier in the report, HUD insures different types of  residential care facilities that include nursing homes, intermediate care  facilities, assisted living facilities, and board and care facilities. Assisted  living facilities are relatively new to the portfolio, and the number of these  loans have been increasing. Our analysis of Section 232 loan data by facility  type found that board and care facilities had a slightly higher 10-year claim  rate than nursing home facilities in the most recent cohorts; however, these  loans remain a very small percentage of the active portfolio and are being  made in decreasing numbers. There are limited data to observe claim  trends on assisted living facilities, making their risk difficult to assess, but  the 5-year claim rates for assisted living facilities have increased  significantly in the most recent cohort years for which claim rate data are  available (see fig. 4). A continued high claim rate in assisted living facilities  could negatively affect the performance of the Section 232 program and the  GI/SRI Fund. However, lenders and HUD officials told us that, although  assisted living facilities had high claim rates in the past, they believe the  market has stabilized and lessons have been learned.", "Another observable trend is the increase in the portion of loans in each  cohort that is prepaid. (Prepayment occurs when a borrower pays a loan in  full before the loan reaches maturity.) There have been 1,688 prepayments  in the Section 232 program from 1960 through the end of fiscal year 2005  and loans that terminate do so overwhelmingly because of prepayment.  Moreover, the proportion of loans that terminate due to prepayment within  10 years of origination is increasing. Specifically, the 10-year prepayment  rates for the three most recent cohorts for which 10-year claim rates are  available are more than double that of some earlier cohorts. As more  borrowers prepay their loans, HUD loses future cash flows from premiums;  thus, higher prepayment rates will likely make the net present value of cash  flows decrease.

New York  holds close to 24 percent of the active loan dollars in the portfolio. This is  an improvement since 1995 when we found that eight states accounted for  70 percent of the portfolio, and New York accounted for 32 percent of the  portfolio.

Private lenders we interviewed that offer non- FHA-insured residential care facility loans explained that one of the  primary reasons their loans are shorter-term loans than those of HUD is  due to their perception of the potential, long-term uncertainty in the  funding of the Medicaid and Medicare programs, which generally account  for a large share of patient payments in nursing homes. We and others have  reported that Medicare and Medicaid spending may not be sustainable at  current levels. In our 2003 report on the impact of fiscal pressures on  state reimbursement rates, however, we found that even in states that  recently faced fiscal pressures, reimbursement rates remained largely  unaffected. At that time, we concluded that any future changes to state  reimbursement rates remain uncertain. If program cuts occur in federal  spending on Medicaid that result in shifting costs from the federal  government to state governments, states could contain costs by taking a  number of steps, including freezing or reducing reimbursement rates to  providers. An ongoing tension exists, however, between what federal and  state governments and the nursing home industry believe to be reasonable  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates to operate efficient and  economic facilities that provide quality care to public beneficiaries.

We agree, as our draft  report stated, that economic studies have shown mixed results  regarding the significance of the impact of loan-to-value and debt  service coverage ratios on commercial mortgage defaults, with some  studies finding them to be significant predictors and others finding them  to be insignificant predictors. We further stated that these mixed results  may be the result of small sample sizes and model specification issues.  Nevertheless, we continue to believe that HUD should explore the value  of factoring initial loan-to-value ratio and debt service coverage ratio  into its credit subsidy model, and we did not change our  recommendation. Regarding the second point, HUD has the data for  analyzing loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios in individual  loan files and could include these data in its credit subsidy modeling by  creating an electronic record of this information either for its entire  portfolio or for a sample of the portfolio. Consequently, we did not  change the recommendation.", "Factors potentially affecting prepayments. HUD disagreed with our  suggestion that its credit subsidy model does not fully capture the  effects of prepayment penalties, stating that its use of historical data  captures the effect of prepayment penalties on project owners\u2019 behavior.  However, as we stated in the draft report, HUD\u2019s use of historic data  would not fully capture trends related to changes in prepayments. HUD  also stated that it has tested using the difference between mortgage  interest rates and the 10-year Treasury bond rates in its modeling of  prepayments. However, our recommendation was to consider a ratio of  these two interest rates, not the difference. As we noted in our report,  economic theory suggests that the use of a ratio is the best way to  capture the effects on existing loans when market interest rates change.  Consequently, we did not change the recommendation.", "Use of Section 207 loans as proxy data for refinance loans. HUD stated  that it did not believe that the differences between Section 207 and  Section 232 loans that our report noted justify concerns that residential  care refinance loans are being improperly modeled and noted a lack of  available data. We agree that sufficient relevant data on Section 232  refinance loan performance do not yet exist, but we continue to  question the use of Section 207 loan data as a proxy. While we did not  change the recommendation, we added language to our report  suggesting that, until enough Section 232 refinance loan data are  available, one possible approach, among others, would be to use a  simpler estimation method, such as using average claim and prepayment  rates over time as is done in estimating credit subsidy rates for the  Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance program.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

The Inspector General also agreed with the Office of Housing  task force\u2019s finding of potential problems associated with the nonrecourse  nature of HUD Section 232 loans. In particular, it found that HUD needed to  strengthen the regulatory agreements and underwriting process for Section  232 loans if these mortgages were to remain nonrecourse and to avoid  potential increase in the portfolio claim rate.
