We identified these providers by reviewing our past work in this  area, reviewing federal procurement solicitation and award information,  conducting interviews with agency officials, and conducting internet  searches about federal use of reverse auctions. We also used these  data to identify and select six of the largest users of reverse auctions, by  number of auctions and dollar value, to include in our review\u2014the  Departments of the Army, Homeland Security (DHS), the Interior, the  Navy, State, and Veterans Affairs (VA).", "To examine federal agencies\u2019 use of reverse auctions between 2013 and  2017, we collected data on reverse auction use from the eight reverse  auction providers, which include both government agencies and private  companies, to identify the number and dollar value of awarded reverse  auctions. We present the dollar value from fiscal years 2013 through  2017 in constant fiscal year 2017 dollars using the Congressional Budget  Office\u2019s June 2017 Gross Domestic Product price index projection\u2014the  most recent projection available at the time of our analysis. For this  analysis, we excluded data from two of the eight providers we identified,  Procurex and the Army Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and  Solutions (CHESS) Information Technology (IT) e-mart reverse auction  platform. In 2017, according to data we obtained from Procurex, the  Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA) total auction activity was worth roughly  $1 billion, and according to data from Army CHESS, the total auction  activity through its platform was worth about $91 million. However, we  cannot determine what portion of these auctions resulted in contract  awards. These providers do not track which reverse auctions actually  result in contract awards, and the agencies using these providers\u2019  platforms (primarily DLA and Army) do not require this information for  their own reporting and oversight purposes. Since we did not include  auctions that did not result in contract awards in our analysis, for  purposes of this report, all references to reverse auction use exclude  auctions conducted with these providers. For those providers that do  track which reverse auctions result in contract awards, about half of  auctions conducted in 2016 did not result in contract awards. We have  included information on auctions conducted by DLA and using Army  CHESS IT e-mart in appendix I.

Our analysis of fiscal year 2016 auctions included  almost 15,000 auctions with a total awarded value of approximately  $910 million. We did not include VA in our detailed analysis of  2016 auctions because the agency conducted few auctions in that year.  We assessed the reliability of the reverse auction provider data by  comparing it with information contained in selected contract files and by  reviewing it for issues such as missing data elements, duplicates, and  outliers, among other steps, and determined they were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of reporting on federal agencies\u2019 use of reverse auctions.", "To identify the extent to which selected agencies achieved the benefits of  reverse auctions, we analyzed the 2016 data we collected to identify  factors related to competition and savings. To obtain a more in-depth  understanding of the benefits achieved by selected agencies, we selected  and reviewed a nongeneralizable selection of 40 auctions awarded from  2016 reverse auctions across the five agencies. The 40 auctions included  12 Army auctions, 7 DHS auctions, 5 Interior auctions, 10 Navy auctions,  and 6 State auctions, and roughly reflect each agency\u2019s relative use of  reverse auctions. These contracts were chosen to obtain variety across a  number of characteristics, such as dollar value, goods and services being  purchased, and reverse auction platforms used. The 40 auctions selected  generally reflect the extent to which auctions were conducted using  various reverse auction platforms, with FedBid, as the largest provider,  accounting for the majority of auctions. Therefore, of the 40 auctions,  33 were FedBid auctions, 4 were General Service Administration (GSA)  Reverse Auctions, 2 were Army CHESS IT e-mart auctions, and 1 was  conducted using Compusearch. For each of the selected case studies,  we reviewed contract documentation related to the reverse auction, such  as documentation of market research, pre-auction cost estimates (e.g.  independent government cost estimates), price negotiation memoranda,  and contract award documents. In addition, to obtain contracting officials\u2019  perspectives on the benefits of reverse auctions, we interviewed the  contracting officials involved with 35 of these 40 auctions. The remaining  five knowledgeable officials were no longer with the agencies or were not  available for interviews. We did not compare reverse auctions to  alternative acquisition methods to compare the relative costs and  benefits.", "To identify the extent to which selected agencies had insight into reverse  auction fees, we analyzed data on indirect fees paid to reverse auction  providers in 2016 for the five agencies selected for our review. We also  analyzed contract documentation from the 40 selected auctions to identify  the extent to which fee information was available to the contracting  officials, and interviewed contracting officials to develop an understanding  of their knowledge of the fees related to the auctions. The 40 selected  auctions included 33 that incurred an indirect fee, 2 for which the provider  waived the fee, and 5 for which no fee applied. We interviewed the  contracting officials involved with 30 of the auctions that incurred a fee  and 5 of the auctions for which the fee was waived or no fee applied. To  develop an understanding of the fee arrangements and the selected  agencies\u2019 oversight of reverse auctions and their fees, we reviewed  contracts between the selected agencies and reverse auction providers  as well as other arrangements, including provider terms of service.", "We also used a variety of investigative tools and techniques to determine  if government officials or commercial and government providers have  engaged in potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement  associated with reverse auction use.

Since we last reported on  this issue in December 2013, two federal agencies developed platforms  to facilitate reverse auctions through existing contract vehicles, by  adapting existing electronic platforms. In July 2013, GSA\u2019s Federal  Acquisition Service launched its platform, GSA Reverse Auctions, which  was built off its e-Buy tool and initially offered reverse auctions for a  limited number of GSA and VA Federal Supply Schedule contracts,  expanding to additional schedule contracts and agency-specific multiple  award contracts over the following 2 years. In November 2015,  GSA Reverse Auctions expanded further to offer open market auctions. In  January 2016, Army\u2019s CHESS program launched a capability using its IT  e-mart to run reverse auctions on certain CHESS contracts. Similarly to  when the private sector builds a platform, new government capabilities  have costs associated with development and ongoing maintenance.  According to GSA officials, development of the reverse auction capability  cost approximately $2 million, and operations and maintenance costs are  expected to total about $650,000 over the next 3 fiscal years. According  to CHESS officials, its capability was developed at no additional financial  cost under the fixed-price contract for the IT e-mart, although there were  opportunity costs because other lower priority actions were delayed.

Full-service providers may offer services such as creating draft  auctions, soliciting vendors to participate, helping create a marketplace of  vendors, and encouraging vendor participation for low-bid-count auctions.

State  awarded a $19 million contract, including option periods, for construction  support services in Afghanistan following a 17-hour reverse auction  among Federal Supply Schedule vendors, although only one vendor had  responded to market research inquiries. Officials said that they had  sought to combine this contract with another set of services for which the  same vendor was the only identified source likely to respond, but  coordinating with the customers took too long, and they ultimately ran out  of time before the predecessor contract was set to expire and services  would stop.

During  the reverse auction, Interior obtained five bids from four vendors,  resulting in an award valued at $1.4 million, including option periods.  The auction\u2019s savings were then calculated to be $670,000.", "In another auction resulting in a $430,000 contract awarded by the  Army for laptops, the contracting official noted that the pre-auction  cost estimate was developed by the customer based on historic  pricing. In turn, the price obtained through the reverse auction  reflected a calculated savings of $67,000 or about 13 percent from the  pre-auction estimate. However, the contracting official said that this  method is not a reliable way to calculate savings as his customers  typically use a high estimate to make sure they do not have to request  additional funds. The contracting officer also noted that, in his  experience, using historical pricing for technology products can be  problematic since pricing changes very quickly as new technology is  developed and old products become obsolete.", "We reported in December 2013 that it was unclear whether comparing  auction award prices to the pre-auction cost estimate produced an  accurate estimate of savings, as it depended on the quality of the  pre-auction cost estimate, which is generally informed by market  research. In our current review, contracting officials reiterated this  perspective. Federal regulations provide flexibility in terms of the extent to  which market research should be conducted, and how that research  should be conducted, including for low dollar procurements.

As discussed above,  however, FedBid automatically adds fees on to all vendor bids. An official  who was involved in developing policy related to reverse auction use at  Interior told us that agency officials were not fully aware of the fee  structure used by FedBid when they initially contracted for the company\u2019s  reverse auction services in October 2010.

For instance, some contracting officials at  State and Customs and Border Protection told us in error that FedBid  would waive its fee if there was only one bidder in an auction.  Additionally, contracting officials for two auctions told us that they  thought the fees associated with their auctions had been waived and  expressed surprise when they learned the fee amount.

While three  DHS components had their own contracts with FedBid that were active in  2016, four additional components plus DHS headquarters used FedBid in  2016 without either an agency- or component-level contract in place. At  Interior, the contract with FedBid expired in September 2015 and was not  renewed, although contracting officials at Interior components continued  to conduct reverse auctions on FedBid.

There are more reverse auction providers,  including government providers, in the marketplace, with the vast majority  of auctions conducted through FedBid. The use of reverse auctions,  however, continues to constitute a relatively small percentage of federal  contract spending. For the most part, agencies are using reverse auctions  to acquire low-cost, commercial products and benefitting from the ease of  use and reduced administrative burden that reverse auctions can provide.  Agencies are also achieving more robust competition in the form of  iterative bidding on nearly three-quarters of reverse auctions. Despite this  level of competition, however, precisely quantifying the amount of savings  is inherently difficult. Given that the vast majority of auctions are small  dollar procurements which are, by design, intended to be simpler and to  pose less administrative burden on the acquisition workforce, it may be  counterproductive to expend more time and resources to produce a better  estimate of savings. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement in the  guidance agencies provide to their contracting personnel to ensure the  appropriate use of reverse auctions, increase benefits, and reduce costs.  Agencies could benefit from paying more attention to  rates of one-vendor participation, provider fee structures, and  contracts with reverse auction providers.", "Across the agencies in our review, often only one bidder participates, in  particular when agencies conduct a reverse auction using existing  contract vehicles rather than opening the auction to all potential vendors.  At State, its requirement for contacting officers to use reverse auctions for  all non-complex acquisitions may result in reverse auction use in  situations where it is not warranted; that is, without the type of highly  competitive marketplace that can result in savings.", "Our work also identified a need for agencies to provide contracting  officers better information on the fee structures so that they can make  informed decisions as to whether to use a reverse auction and which  reverse auction platform to use. Further, agencies are not requiring data  on or analyzing the fees they are paying. The indirect nature of provider  fees\u2014combined with fee arrangements that are missing important details  or are nonexistent and a lack of visibility into those fees\u2014puts agencies  at risk of paying more than necessary for the level of service needed.  These issues are not new: we raised similar concerns in our report more  than 4 years ago.

DHS concurred with our recommendation that it assess why reverse  auctions conducted using existing vehicles have higher one bidder rates  and provide information to contracting officials about factors that indicate  conducting reverse auctions using existing vehicles is appropriate.  However, DHS did not believe that it needed to conduct an assessment  specific to reverse auctions. The department stated that the factors that  contribute to one bidder participating in other procurements\u2014such as  inadequate market research and poorly defined requirements\u2014would  similarly affect reverse auctions. Nevertheless, DHS stated that the Office  of the Chief Procurement Officer will communicate to its contracting  officials that when market research for a planned reverse auction buy on  an existing contract vehicle demonstrates that only one bid is expected, a  reverse auction must not be used to conduct the procurement. DHS  expects to complete actions in response to this recommendation by the  end of November 2018.", "DHS also concurred with our recommendation that it determine if it would  be advantageous for the agency to enter into contracts with third party  reverse auction providers. DHS stated that an assessment should be  done periodically to determine if there is a need to have a department- wide reverse auction provider. In that regard, DHS stated that an  assessment was conducted in 2016 to evaluate providers and platforms  and, based on this evaluation, DHS made the decision to continue to  provide contracting offices the flexibility to choose their own reverse  auction provider. DHS stated that it believes its past actions address our  recommendation. However, the intent of our recommendation is not to  suggest that DHS consider whether to mandate a certain provider be  used agency-wide. Rather, we are recommending that DHS assess  whether agency-level contracts with reverse auction providers\u2014be it one  or several different providers\u2014are desirable to protect against the risk  that individual contracting officials may be agreeing to fees or other terms  that have not been reviewed and approved by agency acquisition and  legal offices. It is unclear whether DHS\u2019s 2016 assessment considered  these issues.", "DHS did not concur with our recommendation that it provide information  to contracting officials regarding available reverse auction providers and  fee structures and, as appropriate, provide guidance to contracting  officials to ensure they compare available options for reverse auctions. In  its response, DHS stated that there is limited value in centrally collecting  and updating this information, and that it is the contracting officer\u2019s  responsibility, as a part of market research, to be knowledgeable about  reverse auction providers and fee structures. DHS stated that its May  2017 reverse auctions policy requires contracting officers to understand  the fees that will be charged and determine and document that the fee  structure represents a fair and reasonable cost and offers best value to  the government. DHS stated that the Office of the Chief Procurement  Officer will issue an alert reminding contracting professionals of these  responsibilities by the end of November 2018. Given the pervasive  confusion we found among contracting officials about the fee structures of  reverse auction providers, we continue to believe that DHS should  document and provide information to contracting officials, which could  help eliminate confusion and minimize the duplication of individual  reverse auction users repeatedly collecting the same information.", "DHS also did not concur with our recommendation that it obtain timely  information on how much the agency is paying for reverse auction  services, stating that aggregating fee data at the department level would  require systems changes or manual collection that would not inform DHS  as to whether reverse auctions were used correctly or if the fee was too  high. In this case, however, our work found that reverse auction providers  have this data available upon request. As such, in lieu of making changes  to systems or attempting to have contracting officers manually collect this  information, we believe DHS could obtain this information from its reverse  auction provider and use this information to help DHS understand what it  pays for reverse auction services. This approach would also better inform  the department in its periodic assessments of contractual relationships  with reverse auction providers.", "In its written response, reproduced in appendix VI, State concurred with  all six recommendations, and described actions the Office of Acquisitions  Management intends to take to address them, including reviewing current  guidance and revising it as appropriate; increasing contracting officer  awareness through training and policy guidance; and engaging with its  primary reverse auction provider to obtain a better understanding of the  fee structure and timely reporting of fees.

According to DLA officials,  the agency\u2019s declining use is largely due to a policy revision that no  longer requires, but rather allows contracting officers to consider using  reverse auctions for all procurements over $150,000. DLA pays a flat fee  to its reverse auction provider for use of the reverse auction platform. This  payment mechanism is different from the fee arrangements in contracts  between agencies and many other reverse auction providers, for which  providers calculate fees on a per-transaction basis. In addition, DLA  generally uses a reverse auction as a price negotiation tool among a  group of selected vendors that the agency determined to be technically  acceptable based on vendors\u2019 initial responses to a solicitation.

Through these efforts, we identified eight reverse auction  providers that offered reverse auction services either government-wide or  to specific agencies (see table 10 below).", "While it is possible that our efforts did not identify all reverse auction  providers that federal agencies use, we are reasonably confident we have  included the largest reverse auction providers used by the selected  agencies in our review. In addition to the identification efforts described  above, for the selected agencies in our review, we asked component  officials to identify reverse auction providers with which the agency has a  contractual relationship and which reverse auction platforms the agency\u2019s  contracting officials use. We also asked numerous individual contracting  officers about the various platforms the individual has used. No additional  providers or platforms were identified as part of those efforts.", "We collected fiscal year 2013 through 2017 data on reverse auctions use  from these reverse auction providers and analyzed it to identify the  number of reverse auctions conducted annually across the government  and the dollar value of those reverse auctions. For our analysis of the  number and dollar value of the auctions, we analyzed auctions that  resulted in a contract award between the agency and a vendor in a  particular year, according to provider data. We describe these as  awarded reverse auctions. The dollar value of an awarded auction is  based on the dollar amount of the bid selected for award; however, the  dollar amount of the bid selected for award is not necessarily equivalent  to the amount ultimately obligated on the resulting contract. We present  the dollar value of agencies\u2019 awarded auctions from 2013 through 2017 in  constant fiscal year 2017 dollars using the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s  June 2017 Gross Domestic Product price index projection\u2014the most  recent projection available at the time of our analysis. We generally  collected data from reverse auction providers because information about  reverse auction use is not available in the Federal Procurement Data  System-Next Generation, a government-wide source of contract data. In  addition, the selected agencies we reviewed do not separately track use  of reverse auctions. We collected data from the Department of Housing  and Urban Development directly because the agency tracks its reverse  auction use, including which auctions it awards. Two of the providers we  identified, Procurex and the Army CHESS IT e-mart reverse auction  platform, do not track the reverse auctions that agencies award to  vendors. The agencies using these providers, Defense Logistics Agency  and the Department of the Army, do not require this information for their  own reporting and oversight purposes or for paying for the reverse  auction services.", "For purposes of this report, all references to reverse auction use exclude  auctions conducted with these providers. Therefore, our analysis includes  only the value and number of known, awarded auctions between  2013 through 2017. As a result, we underestimate total federal reverse  auction use. Using available data for the Department of the Army, we  estimate our analysis includes over 95 percent of the value and  99 percent of Army auctions. For the Defense Logistics Agency, Procurex  reported that over the five-year period the agency conducted  approximately 7,100 auctions valued at about $19 billion. While we  cannot say with certainty the number and value of awarded auctions, we  can assume the agency awarded fewer auctions than it conducted. Based  on information from other providers for which we have data on the number of auctions conducted and awarded, agencies using these  providers awarded about 45 percent of the auctions conducted between  2013 and 2017. Of the six providers with awarded auction data, FedBid  accounted for almost all auctions and the vast majority of dollars agencies  awarded using reverse auctions from 2013 through 2017.", "We also used this data to identify six of the largest users of reverse  auctions for that period\u2014Departments of the Army, Homeland Security  (DHS), the Interior, the Navy, State, and Veterans Affairs (VA)\u2014by  number of auctions and dollar value. In determining the largest users of  reverse auctions, we excluded energy-related auctions from our analysis.  Energy-related auctions represented a sizable portion\u201410 percent\u2014of  reverse auction value, but less than 1 percent of auctions. We determined  that conducting a detailed review of energy-related auctions was not likely  to provide insight for other procurements because the unique  characteristics of energy markets make it difficult to compare to reverse  auctions for other goods and services that were included in our review.", "For five of the six selected agencies (Army, Navy, DHS, Interior, and  State), we collected additional data on auctions awarded in fiscal year  2016\u2014the most recent year of detailed data available at the time that we  began our review. We limited our analysis to auctions for which we  identified a start, end, and contract award date in 2016, according to  provider data. Our analysis of fiscal year 2016 auctions included almost  15,000 auctions with a total awarded value of approximately $910 million.  We excluded reverse auctions for which the data indicated that they were  awarded in 2016 but for which the auction dates indicated that the  auctions were conducted in a prior year. At least some of these auctions  represent options exercised on earlier auctions, rather than new auctions,  and we wanted to ensure we could compare auction activity to policies  and procedures in place for a specific period. Our analysis of awarded  auctions excluded auctions identified as cancelled or with an auction  start, end, or award date outside of 2016. The sixth agency (VA)  conducted less than a dozen new auctions in 2016, and so we excluded  them from our analysis of 2016 data, as well as our analysis of the  benefits and fees associated with reverse auctions.", "We analyzed agencies\u2019 use of reverse auctions, including but not limited  to  the number and dollar value of the awarded auctions,  types of products and services purchased,  level of competition achieved (number of participating vendors and  bids received),  savings from government pre-auction estimates, and  fees associated with the auctions.", "For our analysis of the number and dollar value of the awarded auctions,  we included auctions that resulted in a contract award between the  agency and a vendor, according to provider data. Actual award  obligations may differ. For example, an agency may adjust the  procurement (such as increasing or decreasing the number of items  purchased) between the auction and the final award, which may not be  reflected in the data we used. In addition, the number of awarded  auctions may differ. While we took steps to exclude awarded auctions for  which agencies had cancelled the resulting contracts, if the provider data  did not identify an auction as cancelled we may have included it in our  analysis. For the analysis of products and services, we examined  auctions conducted and awarded in 2016 by two of the three reverse  auction providers, both of which had product and service code data  available for awarded reverse auctions. These two providers accounted  for almost all contracts awarded via reverse auctions that year. Provider  data included an overall product and service code for the auction. The  auction may include goods and services outside that particular code. For  our purposes, we used the code provided to categorize the auction as a  product or service and the type of purchase. The third provider, GSA  Reverse Auction, does not capture similar product and service code data.", "Using other data GSA Reverse Auction provided, we were able to  estimate that about 20 percent of dollars awarded using GSA\u2019s Reverse  Auctions platform included information technology products and services.", "For our analysis of contract vehicles, we used provider data on whether  the buyer selected to conduct the auction on the open marketplace or  limit the auction to vendors qualified to bid on existing contract vehicles.  For example, buyers may have conducted auctions on the open market,  which is available to any vendor selling the good or service that is  registered to bid via the reverse auction provider or conducted auctions  that were limited to vendors with specific agency or government-wide  contracts. For our analysis of competition, we included all vendors and  associated bids submitted in provider data. During our interviews with  contracting officials, we learned that in some auctions officials determined  particular vendors were not technically acceptable following an auction.  This information is not available in provider data and, as a result, our  analysis includes vendors that contracting officials determined were not  technically acceptable.", "We also obtained contract-related information from the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation for awarded auctions with  available contract or order numbers to identify if agencies used  commercial acquisition procedures and firm-fixed-price contracts in  accordance with the effective practices outlined in the June 2015 OFPP  memorandum. Government auditing standards require that we assess the  reliability of data we use in our products. As part of our assessment, we  reviewed the reverse auction data collected for obvious issues, such as  missing data elements, duplicates, and outliers. We also tested the  relationships between variables. In addition, we interviewed agency and  reverse auction provider officials to understand the data and collected  information on the systems used to collect and store the data, as well as  how those data are used. Further, we compared the data for a  non-generalizable sample of 40 auctions to contract files. We assessed  the reliability of the data used in this report and determined they were  sufficiently reliable for describing the known number and value of  awarded reverse auctions by federal agencies from 2013 through 2017  and identifying salient characteristics of selected agencies\u2019 awarded  auctions in 2016, including the number of participating vendors and bids,  type of good or service purchased, and indirect fees associated with the  auction.", "To identify the extent to which selected agencies achieved the benefits of  reverse auctions, we analyzed the 2016 data we collected on reverse  auction use at our five selected agencies to identify factors related to  competition (e.g., the number of participating vendors in auctions and the  number of bids received, and the frequency of iterative bidding, defined  as when there are multiple bidders and at least one bidder submits more  than one bid during the auction) and savings (e.g., savings as calculated  by the reverse auction providers). This analysis excludes auctions  conducted using the Army CHESS IT e-mart because it does not track  which auctions result in awards. However, the analysis still includes at  least 93 percent of reverse auction award value and 98 percent of the  awarded auctions in 2016. To obtain a more in-depth understanding of  the benefits achieved by selected agencies, we selected and reviewed a  nongeneralizable selection of 40 contracts awarded from 2016 reverse  auctions across the five agencies. These contracts were chosen to  obtain variety across the following characteristics: buying agency and  component; contract vehicle (open market or orders on existing contracts  such as Federal Supply Schedules or agency indefinite-delivery /  indefinite-quantity contracts); dollar value; fees charged by the reverse  auction providers; and goods and services being purchased (see table  11).", "At DHS, we selected case studies from two components, Customs and  Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Customs  and Border Protection had an active contract with FedBid in 2016 and  Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not, so we selected these two  components in order to understand the difference in how components  with and without an active contract used FedBid.", "For each of the selected case studies, we reviewed contract  documentation related to the reverse auction, such documentation of  market research, pre-auction cost estimates (e.g. independent cost  estimates), price negotiation memoranda, and contract award documents.  In addition, to obtain contracting officials\u2019 perspectives on the benefits of  reverse auctions, we interviewed the contracting officials involved with  35 of these 40 auctions: for the remaining 5, knowledgeable officials were  not available to interview. We conducted our interviews using a semi- structured interview process in which we asked contracting officials a  standard set of questions about their experiences conducting reverse  auctions. We did not compare reverse auctions to alternative acquisition  methods to compare the relative costs and benefits.", "To identify the extent to which selected agencies had insight into reverse  auction fees, we analyzed provider data on fees paid indirectly to FedBid  and GSA Reverse Auctions in 2016 for the five agencies selected for our  review. Fees paid to these two reverse auction providers were paid  indirectly by the agencies through the winning vendor. Our analysis  included the total amount of fees paid by each agency in 2016 to each  reverse auction provider and the amount of fees paid by each agency in  2016 for auctions with only one bidder.", "We also analyzed agency guidance to determine the extent of information  provided to contracting officials on reverse auction fees. Specifically, we  assessed whether agency guidance identified roles and responsibilities of  contracting officials in understanding and assessing reverse auction fees  and provided sufficient information to help ensure contracting officers  understood how reverse auction fees are applied. Further, we interviewed  contracting officials for 35 of our 40 selected auctions to develop an  understanding of the officials\u2019 knowledge of the fees related to the  auctions they conducted. As noted above, officials for the other 5 auctions  were not available to interview. The 40 selected auctions included 33 that  incurred an indirect fee, 2 for which the provider waived the fee, and 5 for  which no fee applied. We interviewed the contracting officials involved  with 30 of the auctions that incurred a fee and 5 of the auctions for which  the fee was waived or no fee applied. To determine whether contracting  officials we interviewed had a complete and accurate understanding of  reverse auction fee structures, we analyzed their responses to questions  about reverse auction fee structures and the fee paid for the reverse  auction we reviewed in detail, and compared their responses to fee  structures documented in agency contracts and reverse auction provider  terms and conditions.", "Lastly, to determine whether agencies had sufficient insight into reverse  auction fees to conduct appropriate oversight, we analyzed contracts  between the selected agencies and FedBid as well as other fee  arrangements, including provider terms of service and GSA\u2019s Federal  Supply Schedule contract with FedBid. Our analysis included both  contracts that were in place in fiscal year 2016 in order to understand the  terms and conditions that covered the reverse auctions we reviewed in  detail, as well as contracts agencies awarded subsequent to fiscal year  2016 so that we could understand whether and how agencies fee  arrangements with reverse auction providers had changed. We analyzed  the contracts and other fee arrangements to determine the extent to  which they explained details of how the fees were applied, such as what  fee percentage would be charged, how the fees would apply to contract  option years, and how fee caps were applied.", "We also used a variety of investigative tools and techniques to determine  if reverse auction procurement officials and commercial and government  providers have engaged in potential fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement associated with reverse auction use. We reviewed fraud  alerts to learn about potential complaints, coordinated with agency  inspector general offices regarding work related to reverse auctions,  inquired about contracting officials\u2019 awareness of fraud incidents among  the 35 case studies for which we interviewed contracting officials, and  conducted a limited review for obvious financial relationships among  agency officials responsible for drafting reverse auction policy and  commercial reverse auction providers. While steps we took did not  uncover any obvious fraud, waste, abuse, or systemic mismanagement,  we cannot definitively state that there is no fraud, waste, abuse, or  mismanagement in federal use of reverse auctions.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to July 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

They also were easy to use.", "However, most contracting officers we interviewed did not fully understand the fees they paid to use reverse auctions. Agencies we reviewed indirectly paid $3 million in fees when a free alternative was likely available.", "We made 21 recommendations, including that agencies inform contracting officials about fees."]}
