Total JSF program acquisition costs (through 2027) have increased by $31.6 billion and now DOD will pay 12 percent more per aircraft than expected in 2004. The program has also experienced delays in several key events, including the start of the flight test program, delivery of the first production representative development aircraft, and testing of critical missions systems. Delays in the delivery of initial development aircraft were driven by incomplete engineering drawings, changes in design, manufacturing inefficiencies, and parts shortages. Despite these delays, the program still plans to complete development in 2013, compressing the amount of time available for flight testing and development activities. Also, the program projects it will meet all but one key performance requirement--line of sight communications--that is currently dependent on other capabilities being developed outside the JSF program. Accurately predicting JSF costs and schedule and ensuring sufficient funding will likely be key challenges facing the program in the future. JSF continues to pursue a risky acquisition strategy that concurrently develops and produces aircraft. While some concurrency may be beneficial to efficiently transition from development to production, the degree of overlap is significant on this program. Any changes in design and manufacturing that require modifications to delivered aircraft or to tooling and manufacturing processes would result in increased costs and delays in getting capabilities to the warfighter. Low-rate initial production will begin this year with almost the entire 7-year flight test program remaining to confirm the aircraft design. Confidence that investment decisions will deliver expected capability within cost and schedule goals increases as testing proves the JSF will work as expected.

We recommended DOD pursue an acquisition strategy  consistent with best practices and DOD policy preferences regarding  evolutionary and knowledge-based acquisitions including deferring  production investments until the aircraft have been proven to work in  flight testing. DOD has taken no direct actions in response to these  recommendations and has stated that its current acquisition approach  fulfills the intent of DOD policy and further limits on production are  unnecessary.

Lockheed Martin won the competition, and the  program entered system development and demonstration in October 2001.", "The program\u2019s objective is to develop and deploy a technically superior  and affordable fleet of aircraft that support the warfighter in performing a  wide range of missions in a variety of theaters. The single-seat, single- engine aircraft is being designed to be self-sufficient or part of a  multisystem and multiservice operation, and to rapidly transition between  air-to-surface and air-to-air missions while still airborne. To achieve its  mission, JSF will incorporate low observable technologies, defensive  avionics, advanced onboard and offboard sensor fusion, internal and  external weapons, and advanced prognostic maintenance capability.  According to DOD, these technologies represent a quantum leap over  legacy tactical aircraft capabilities. At the same time, the JSF aircraft  design includes three variants: a conventional take-off and landing variant  for the Air Force; an aircraft carrier-suitable variant for the Navy; and a  short take-off and vertical landing variant for the Marine Corps and the  United Kingdom. JSF is intended to replace a substantial number of aging  fighter and attack aircraft in DOD\u2019s current inventory.", "In 2003 the JSF program system integration efforts and a preliminary  design review revealed significant airframe weight problems that affected  the aircraft\u2019s ability to meet key performance requirements. Software  development and integration also posed a significant development  challenge. The program\u2019s inability to meet its ambitious goals resulted in  the Department\u2019s failing to deliver on the business case that justified initial  investment in JSF. As a result, purchase quantities have been reduced,  total program costs have increased, and delivery of the initial aircraft has  been delayed. These changes have effectively reduced DOD\u2019s buying  power for its investment as it will now be buying fewer aircraft for a  greater financial investment. It is too late for the program to meet these  initial promises. To its credit, in fiscal year 2004, DOD rebaselined the  program extending development by 18 months and adding resources to  address problems discovered during systems integration and the  preliminary design review. Program officials also delayed the critical  design reviews, first flights of development aircraft, and the low-rate initial  production decision to allow more time to mitigate design risk and gather  more knowledge before continuing to make major investments.

During this period,  estimates in some cost areas grew by $48 billion but were offset by   $16.4 billion due to quantity changes and the proposed termination of an  alternate engine program. According to the program, the cost estimate is  still mostly based on cost estimating relationships\u2014like cost per pound\u2014 not actual costs and, therefore, is subject to change as the program  captures the actual costs to manufacture the aircraft. Also, the official  program estimate is based on the program\u2019s December 31, 2005, Selected  Acquisition Report delivered to Congress in April 2006.

The majority of the cost growth, over 95 percent,  was for procurement. According to the program office, several factors led  to an increase in the procurement cost estimate. The most significant  increases include:    $10.3 billion\u2014result of design and manufacturing changes to large  bulkheads in the wing section of the aircraft, need for 6 times more  aluminum and almost 4 times more titanium than originally estimated.  At the same time, titanium costs almost doubled.    $3.5 billion\u2014result of reduced manufacturing efficiency because of  plans to build a certain number of wings at a new subcontractor.    $5.5 billion\u2014result of changing the business relationship of the prime  and two major subcontractors.    $4.4 billion\u2014result of projected higher support costs.    $14.7 billion\u2014result of changing assumptions for estimating labor rates  and inflation.", "The increases in procurement costs were offset by two main factors. First,  the cost estimate reflects production efficiency benefits of $9.2 billion  from producing 508 international partner aircraft that were not included in  previous estimates. Secondly, the program reduced procurement costs by  $5.1 billion as a result of the proposed elimination of the alternate engine  program. According to the program office, it expected savings from  manufacturing efficiencies by having one engine contractor producing a  larger quantity of engines. Program officials stated that they have had  difficulty quantifying cost savings that might accrue from competing  engine buys between contractors. For now Congress has reinstated the  alternate engine program and has required further analysis from DOD and  others on the costs of the program.", "The program also reported that development costs decreased by   $1.2 billion. The reduction in development costs was due almost entirely to  the removal of the remaining estimated costs to complete the alternate  engine\u2019s development. Again, Congress has since reinstated funding for the  alternate engine program.", "The net effect of the JSF program cost increases is that DOD will pay more  per aircraft than expected when the program was rebaselined.

Holding firm to these dates forces the program to  find ways to complete development activities in less time, especially if  problems are discovered in the remaining 6 years of development. The  program office is evaluating different ways to reduce the risk of this  compression by being more efficient in its flight test activities. The first  JSF flight was scheduled for August 2006 but did not occur until mid  December 2006\u2014about 4 months later than expected. According to the  program office, the first flight was successful but was shortened because  of a problem with instrumentation on the aircraft. Although the first  aircraft will be able to demonstrate some performance\u2014limited flying  qualities, propulsion, and vehicle subsystems\u2014it is not a production  representative aircraft with fully functioning critical mission systems or  the design changes from the rebaselined program that reduced airframe  weight.", "The first flight of a production representative aircraft has been delayed   8 months to May 2008.

Manufacturing data on subsequent development  aircraft that have begun manufacturing indicate these aircraft are not  currently meeting their planned manufacturing efficiencies either.  According to contractor data as of November 2006, the first development  aircraft had required 35 percent or 65,113 more labor hours than expected.  The program encountered most of the inefficiencies in the mate and  delivery phase and with the fabrication of the center fuselage and wing.", "Figure 3 shows the planned hours versus the actual hours needed for  completing the first test aircraft.", "When the first aircraft began manufacturing, the program had released  about 20 percent of the engineering drawings needed for building the  aircraft. This led to a backlog of drawings, negatively impacting the  availability of parts needed for efficient manufacturing operations. To  compensate for delays and parts shortages for production, components of  the aircraft were manufactured out of sequence and at different  manufacturing workstations than planned. For example, the wing section  was mated to the center fuselage before work on the wing was completed.  The wing was only 46 percent complete and still required more than   18,500 hours of work. Because this remaining work was completed at a  different workstation than was planned, contractor officials stated that  major tooling\u2014such as a stand that supports the wing structure upright to  allow workers to install wiring and other parts\u2014was not available for use.  As a result, workers were required to lie on the ground or bend under or  over the wing structure to complete the wing assembly, significantly  increasing the number of hours needed to complete this effort. According  to Defense Contract Management Agency, out-of-station work performed  on the wing required an additional 46 percent more hours than planned.  Late delivery of parts and late qualification of subsystems were the major  drivers to the mate and delivery inefficiencies, more than doubling the  hours needed to complete this activity.", "Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor, appears to be focused on  developing an efficient and effective manufacturing process for the JSF,  but it is still very early in that process. The development aircraft now in  manufacturing are not currently meeting their planned efficiencies. As  with the first test aircraft, the program does not expect to manufacture the  development aircraft in the planned manufacturing sequence. The program  expects to move some wing fabrication activities to final assembly and do  both fabrication and final assembly concurrently. Early development  aircraft are already experiencing inefficiencies and delays. As of December  2006, wing manufacturing data for one of these aircraft shows the program  had completed less than 50 percent of the activities expected at this time  while requiring 41 percent more hours than planned. According to the  contractor and program officials, these inefficiencies are largely due to  late delivery of the wing bulkheads because of a change in their  manufacturing process. The Defense Contract Management Agency has  rated manufacturing as high risk, stating that the primary cause of risk is  the late delivery of parts to properly support the manufacturing work flow.  It projects further delays to schedule, increased costs, and subsequent out- of-sequence work.", "An early indicator of design stability is the completion of design drawings  at the critical design review. In February 2006, the program held its critical  design review for production representative conventional and short take- off and vertical landing aircraft. At that time, the program had completed  47 percent of the short take-off aircraft design and 3 percent of the  conventional aircraft design. Our previous best practices work suggests  that completion of 90 percent of a product\u2019s engineering drawings  provides tangible evidence that the design is stable. As with the first  aircraft, the program has experienced late releases of engineering  drawings, which has delayed the delivery of critical parts from suppliers to  manufacturing for the building of the initial aircraft. For example, based  on program data as of October 2006, more than one-third of the drawings  needed to complete these two variants are expected to be released late to  manufacturing.", "Although the first aircraft encountered manufacturing inefficiencies, the  JSF Program and the contractor have pointed to some successes in this  initial manufacturing effort. For example, they have stated the mate of the  major sections of the aircraft was more efficient than in past aircraft  programs because of the state-of-the-art tools used to design the aircraft  and develop the manufacturing process. Likewise, they have indicated that  they have experienced fewer defects in this first aircraft than experienced  on legacy aircraft.", "We would agree that the contractor has made progress in demonstrating  the use of several large tools and fabrication processes in building the first  test aircraft. However, a key factor in developing an efficient and effective  manufacturing process is a mature aircraft design. Major design  modifications can cause substantial and costly changes in the  manufacturing process. For example, since the first aircraft entered  production, the manufacturing process has had to be altered due to  redesigning required to resolve weight and performance problems.  According to Defense Contract Management Agency officials, some tools  already bought and in place were either no longer useful or being used less  efficiently. New tools had to be procured and the manufacturing process  had to change. The Defense Contract Management Agency noted that  these additional tooling costs were about $156 million. Contractor officials  stated that the current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to produce  about 24 aircraft per year.  Given that only one aircraft has been built and  essentially all of the flight and static and durability testing remains to be  done there is still significant risk that the JSF design for each of the three  variants will incur more changes as more design knowledge is gained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The JSF Program Projects Key Performance Parameters Will Be Met Based on Modeling and Simulations", "paragraphs": ["Currently, the JSF program estimates that by the time the development  program ends the aircraft design will meet all but one of its key  performance parameters.

This threatens to slip operational testing and initial operational  capability.", "Predicted maintenance times for propulsion system support, integrated  combat turn, and gun removal and installation do not meet  requirements.", "Design requirements to preserve volume, power, and cooling for future  growth are in jeopardy and will limit capability to meet future  requirements.", "Certain technical challenges in the aircraft or its subsystem design that  could impact operational capability.", "In a follow-up discussion on the report, test officials stated that these  concerns were still current and they had not been informed by the  program office of planned actions to address them. The December 2006  Annual Report of DOD\u2019s Director, Operational Test and Evaluation  recommended that the JSF program follow up on these issues.", "The CAIG has expressed concerns about the reality of estimated program  costs. Its preliminary cost estimate in 2005 was substantially higher than  the program office estimate. The CAIG cited costs associated with mission  systems, system test, engines, and commonality as drivers in the  difference between its estimate and that of the program office. According  to discussions in 2006 with CAIG officials, they still have concerns and  continue to expect program costs to be much higher than the program  office\u2019s current estimate. The CAIG is not required to submit its next  formal independent cost estimate until the preparations for Milestone C,  which for the JSF program is full-rate production. For major defense  acquisition programs, this milestone generally should occur before low- rate initial production. Milestone C is scheduled for late 2013.", "DCMA\u2019s concerns focus on the prime contractor\u2019s ability to achieve its  cost and schedule estimates. DCMA, responsible for monitoring the prime  contractor\u2019s development and procurement activities, found that delays in  aircraft deliveries and critical technical review milestones put at risk the  contractor\u2019s ability to meet the current schedule. DCMA also identified  manufacturing operations as a high-risk area highlighting issues with parts  delivery, raw material availability, and subcontractor performance. Finally,  it raised concerns with contractor cost growth stating that the contractor  has shown continuing and steady increases since development started,  even after the contract\u2019s target price was increased by $6 billion as part of  the program\u2019s rebaseline. As of November 2006, DCMA projects that the  contractor\u2019s current estimated development costs will increase by about  $1 billion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The JSF is entering its 6th year of a 12-year development program and is  also entering production. The development team has achieved first flight  and has overcome major design problems found earlier in development. In  addition, the department counts on this aircraft to bear the brunt of its  recapitalization plans. Therefore, we believe the program is critical to the  department\u2019s future plans and is viable, given progress made to date.  However, the current acquisition strategy still reflects very significant risk  that both development and procurement costs will increase and aircraft  will take longer to deliver to the warfighter than currently planned. Even  as the JSF program enters the mid point of its development, it continues to  encounter significant cost overruns and schedule delays because the  program has continued to move forward into procurement before it has  knowledge that the aircraft\u2019s design and manufacturing processes are  stable. Although some of the additional costs were predictable, other  costs, especially those resulting from rework, represent waste the  Department can ill afford.", "Flight testing began just a few months before the decision to begin low- rate initial production. The challenges and risks facing the program are  only expected to increase as the program begins to ramp up its production  capabilities while completing design integration, software design, and  testing. DOD\u2019s approval to enter low-rate initial production this year  committed the program to this high risk strategy. If the program is unable  to mitigate risks, its only options will be to reduce program requirements  or delay when the program achieves initial operational capability. We see  two ways this risk can be reduced: (1) reducing the number of aircraft for  procurement before testing demonstrates their performance capabilities,  thereby reducing the potential for costly changes to the aircraft and  manufacturing processes or (2) reexamining the required capabilities for  initial variants with an eye toward bringing them up to higher capability in  the future.", "Last year Congress reduced funding for the first two low-rate production  lots of aircraft thereby slowing the ramp up of production. This was a  positive first step in lowering risk during the early years of testing.  However, a significant amount of ground and flight tests remains over the  next 6 years.  All three variants need to demonstrate their flight  performance.  The carrier variant will be the last of the three variants to be  delivered to the flight test program.  It is now scheduled to start flight  testing in May 2009 and has nearly 900 flight tests planned to demonstrate  its flight performance.  If the program executes its plan for a steep ramp  up in production before proving the basic flying qualities of each aircraft  variant, the likelihood of costly changes to its significant investment in  production will remain high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve chances of a successful outcome, we are recommending that  the Secretary of Defense limit annual low-rate initial production quantities  to no more than 24 aircraft per year, the current manufacturing capacity,  until each variant\u2019s basic flying qualities have been demonstrated in flight  testing now scheduled in the 2010 time frame."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report. The  comments appear in appendix II.", "DOD non-concurred with our recommendation stating that the current JSF  acquisition strategy provides an effective balance of technical risk,  financial constraints, and operational needs of the services. However, we  believe DOD\u2019s actions to reduce aircraft quantities in the fiscal year 2008  President\u2019s Budget are in line with our recommendation to limit  production to current manufacturing capacity until each variant\u2019s flying  qualities have been demonstrated in flight testing.  In the 2008 budget,  DOD reduced the number of production aircraft it plans to buy during the  flight test program by about 35 percent as compared to its previous plan  for the JSF.  Under this new plan DOD does not substantially increase its  buy quantities of production aircraft until 2011. We continue to believe  that limiting production quantities until the design is demonstrated would  reduce the overlap in production and development while still allowing the  efficient transition from development to production. It would also make  cost and schedule more predictable and lessen the risk to DOD\u2019s  production investment. The JSF program is still only in its sixth year of a  12-year development program with significant challenges remaining such  as completing the design, software development, and flight testing. As  such, there is continued risk that testing will not go as planned and  demonstrating the aircraft\u2019s capability could be delayed beyond the  current plan.  Therefore, we maintain our recommendation and will  continue to monitor the progress in the test program and the resulting  dynamics between development and production.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, and Navy; and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget.
