FAA\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission depends on the adequacy and reliability of the nation\u2019s air traffic control (ATC) system\u2014the principal component of the NAS\u2014which comprises a vast network of radars; automated data-processing, navigation, and communications equipment; and ATC facilities. It is through the ATC system that FAA provides services such as controlling takeoffs and landings and managing the flow of traffic between airports. Sustained growth in air traffic and FAA\u2019s aging equipment have strained the current ATC system. This growth in traffic is predicted to continue as the number of passengers traveling on U.S. airlines is expected to grow from about 674 million in 1998 to 1.055 billion by 2010, an increase of about 57 percent.", "To relieve the problems of aging equipment and to accommodate the predicted growth in air traffic, FAA initiated a multibillion-dollar modernization effort in December 1981. Our work over the years has chronicled many of FAA\u2019s failures in meeting projects\u2019 cost, schedule, and performance goals. Because of the size, complexity, cost, and problem-plagued past of FAA\u2019s modernization program, we have designated it a high-risk information technology investment since 1995."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The ATC System Modernization Program Is Complex, Costly, and Historically Problematic", "paragraphs": ["Under its ambitious modernization program, FAA is acquiring new surveillance, data-processing, navigation, and communications equipment in addition to new facilities and support equipment. Totaling 126 active projects, the modernization is estimated to cost $26.5 billion from fiscal year 1982 through fiscal 2004. Of this total, FAA estimates that it will need $12.9 billion from fiscal year 1982 through 2004 for 59 information technology projects\u2014the software-intensive and complex information and communications systems supporting the ATC system. These projects range from those designed to replace equipment used by controllers to communicate with aircraft and with each other to radars that provide controllers with surveillance information for separating aircraft. An example of an information technology project is the Display System Replacement project that will modernize equipment in FAA\u2019s en route facilities by replacing 20- to 30-year-old display channels, controllers\u2019 workstations, and network infrastructure.", "Over the past 17 years, FAA\u2019s modernization projects have experienced substantial cost overruns, lengthy delays, and significant performance shortfalls. To illustrate, the longtime centerpiece of the modernization program\u2014the Advanced Automation System\u2014was restructured in 1994 after estimated costs to develop the system tripled from $2.5 billion to $7.6 billion and delays in putting significantly less-than-promised system capabilities into operation were expected to run 8 years or more over the original estimates. These problems have persisted. For example, two key projects in the modernization effort\u2014the Wide Area Augmentation System and the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System\u2014have encountered significant cost increases, delays, and changes in requirements. In the case of the Wide Area Augmentation System, between September 1997 and January 1998, total estimated costs increased by $600 million, or 25 percent, from $2.4 billion to $3 billion. The increased costs were attributable to FAA\u2019s including previously overlooked costs for periodically updating the project\u2019s equipment and to higher-than-expected operations and maintenance costs. In the case of the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System, although FAA has not officially changed the project\u2019s baseline approved in February 1996, the baseline is in jeopardy of being breached because of unions\u2019 concerns surrounding human-factor and design issues, the refinement of requirements, and the interjection of a new project phase. FAA estimates that these issues have the potential to increase the project\u2019s costs from $294 million to $410 million above the approved baseline. FAA also estimates that the project\u2019s initial completion could be delayed by almost 2-1/2 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Developed the Acquisition Management System to Manage Its Modernization Investments", "paragraphs": ["Because of FAA\u2019s contention that some of its modernization problems were caused by federal acquisition regulations, the Congress enacted legislation in November 1995 that exempted the agency from most federal procurement laws and regulations and directed FAA to develop and implement a new acquisition management system that would address the unique needs of the agency. On April 1, 1996, in response to the Congress\u2019s action, FAA implemented a new acquisition management system. The system is intended to reduce the time and cost to field new products and services by introducing (1) a new investment management system that spans the entire life cycle of an acquisition, (2) a new procurement system that provides flexibility in selecting and managing contractors, and (3) organizational and cultural reform that supports the new investment and procurement systems.", "The Acquisition Management System (AMS) provides high-level acquisition policy and guidance for selecting and controlling FAA\u2019s investments throughout all phases of the acquisition life cycle, which is organized into a series of phases and decision points, including (1) mission analysis, (2) investment analysis, (3) solution implementation, (4) in-service management, and (5) service life extension. AMS provides guidance on the documents and decisions that result from each of these phases. For example, through the mission analysis process, FAA identifies critical needs that the agency must meet for improving the safety, security, capacity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the NAS. Approval of a mission need statement by the Joint Resources Council\u2014FAA\u2019s corporate decision-making body\u2014signifies that the agency agrees that the need is critical enough to proceed to the next phase, investment analysis. During the investment analysis phase, teams of acquisition and program specialists (1) identify and analyze alternatives, (2) develop baselines and assesses affordability, (3) prepare an investment analysis report, and (4) recommend a preferred solution to the mission need. FAA then scores and ranks each proposed project based on a number of factors, including how well, relative to other projects, it meets mission needs and has a favorable cost-benefit ratio. Once a project is selected, life-cycle cost, schedule, benefits, and performance baselines are established in a formal document called the acquisition program baseline. The acquisition program baseline, which must be approved by the Joint Resources Council, is used to monitor a project\u2019s status in achieving those baselines throughout the remaining phases of the acquisition management life cycle.", "During the solution implementation phase, a multidisciplinary team develops and carries out an acquisition strategy for implementing the project. Once the project has been implemented and is in operation (the in-service management phase), the team monitors and assesses its performance, costs, and support trends; proposes fixes for any defects or other problems; incorporates product improvements; seeks new technology to enhance the capability or reduce costs; and identifies and prepares for decisions to correct capability shortfalls at the end of the project\u2019s service-life. Finally, during the service-life extension phase, a determination is made about whether the current capability satisfies the demand for services or whether another solution offers the potential for improving safety or effectiveness or for significantly lowering costs. The team initiates a process whereby the mission need would be revalidated and the investment analysis process begun again, which could lead to a new investment decision. See figure 1.1 for a graphic depiction of FAA\u2019s life-cycle acquisition management process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Acquisitions Are Funded From Two Major Budget Accounts", "paragraphs": ["Funding for FAA\u2019s investments is primarily provided through two of its budget accounts: (1) facilities and equipment and (2) operations. The facilities and equipment account covers the costs to develop, procure, and place the new equipment or facility in operation. Once the project goes into full operation, it is funded by the operations account, which covers the costs to support and maintain the new equipment or facility. Costs for planned product improvements and upgrades to the technology can be funded from either the facilities and equipment or the operations accounts.", "Some investment funding is also provided through the research, engineering, and development account. This account is relatively small compared with the facilities and equipment and operations accounts. For example, in fiscal year 1999, $150 million was appropriated for research, engineering, and development; approximately $2.1 billion for facilities and equipment; and approximately $5.6 billion for operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guidance Provides a Framework for Assessing Federal Agencies\u2019 Information Technology Investment Decision-Making", "paragraphs": ["Several recent management reforms\u2014including the revision of the Paperwork Reduction Act and the passage of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990\u2014have introduced requirements emphasizing the need for federal agencies to improve their management processes for selecting and managing information technology resources. GAO and the Office of Management and Budget have developed guidance to assist federal agencies in evaluating information technology investments. One such guide, Assessing Risks and Returns: A Guide for Evaluating Federal Agencies\u2019 IT Investment Decision-Making, incorporates our analysis of the management practices of leading private and public sector organizations as well as of the provisions of major federal legislation (e.g., the Clinger-Cohen Act) and executive branch guidance that address investment decision-making. The guide outlines three phases of a successful investment management approach\u2014selection, control, and evaluation. To help ensure that real, positive change is produced as agencies seek to improve their decision-making about their information technology investments, agencies need to (1) institutionalize management processes; (2) regularly validate the cost, benefit, and risk data used to support information technology decisions; and (3) focus on measuring and evaluating results. The guide provides a framework for evaluating and assessing how well a federal agency is achieving these goals and identifies specific areas where improvements can be made.", "Many of the concepts in our Assessing Risks and Returns have been incorporated into the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Capital Programming Guide, which provides guidance on the planning, budgeting, acquisition, and management of different kinds of capital assets, including information technology. Our guide has also been endorsed by the federal Chief Information Officers Council. A third guide we prepared, Executive Guide: Leading Practices in Capital Decision-Making, summarizes 12 fundamental practices that have been successfully implemented by organizations recognized for their outstanding capital decision-making.Since information technology investments are a form of capital asset, this guide emphasizes many of the same concepts as the aforementioned guides, such as evaluating alternative approaches to achieving results; assessing investments as a portfolio; tracking projects\u2019 costs, schedules, and performance; and conducting post-implementation reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Given the large expenditures required to carry out FAA\u2019s modernization program, the past problems, and the continuing concerns about key projects funded under the program, the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Aviation and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Aviation asked us to evaluate the extent to which AMS provides a comprehensive approach for managing FAA\u2019s modernization investments. This report addresses the extent to which FAA, through AMS, (1) has established a structured approach for selecting and controlling its investments; (2) incorporates all investments, including those in operation, in the agency\u2019s portfolio; and (3) selects, controls, and evaluates its investments with complete and reliable information.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed FAA\u2019s overall approach for managing investments, as carried out through AMS, including the policies, procedures, and guidance for managing the life-cycle acquisition process. AMS is designed to include all of FAA\u2019s acquisition projects, including those related to facilities, mission support, and information technology. Our review focused primarily on information technology projects, and we worked with FAA to identify the universe of such projects. Then, in concert with FAA, we selected five projects for review to obtain a more detailed understanding of how the investment management process is implemented at the project level. The five projects we reviewed were (1) the NAS Infrastructure Management System, (2) the Oceanic Automation Program, (3) the Operational and Supportability Implementation System, (4) the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System, and (5) the Voice Switching and Control System. We selected these projects because they were in various stages of implementation when AMS was established in April 1996, were key to replacing the aging NAS infrastructure or improving its capacity and effectiveness, and represented significant expenditures. Total estimated facilities and equipment funding for each of these projects exceeds $100 million. Two of the five projects\u2014the NAS Infrastructure Management System and the Operational and Supportability Implementation System\u2014are subject to all AMS requirements because they were selected after AMS went into effect in April 1996. The other three projects, which were ongoing when AMS was established, are subject to AMS requirements for the remaining stages in their development and implementation.", "As part of our effort, we applied the methodology prescribed in Assessing Risks and Returns. We used the questions in this guide to determine the extent to which FAA has decision-making and management processes and data in place to select information technology projects and systems, control these projects throughout their life cycles, and evaluate results and revise the processes based on lessons learned. We provided the questions in the guide to FAA officials and assessed their responses, along with supporting documentation, as a basis for determining whether FAA\u2019s approach provided the necessary elements for managing its investments. We also incorporated the guidance from the Executive Guide: Leading Practices in Capital Decision-Making in determining whether FAA managed its investments as a portfolio; tracked projects\u2019 costs, schedules, and performance; and conducted post-implementation reviews.", "To gain an overall perspective on FAA\u2019s investment management process, we interviewed FAA officials responsible for implementing and managing AMS. We also interviewed FAA officials responsible for preparing the facilities and equipment and operations budgets and reviewed the agency\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget justification documentation to understand how data on FAA\u2019s investments are used to support FAA\u2019s budget request to the Congress. Finally, we interviewed officials responsible for managing the five projects we reviewed to obtain their views on how AMS is applied at the project level as well as potential areas for improvement.

Such an approach builds on an organization\u2019s assessment of where it should invest its resources for the greatest benefit over the long term. The Clinger-Cohen Act requires federal agencies to apply this sort of structured approach in deciding whether to undertake particular investments in information technology systems.", "A starting point for the selection phase is the screening process in which projects being submitted for funding are compared against a uniform set of screening criteria and thresholds to determine whether the projects meet minimal requirements and to identify at what organizational level the projects should be reviewed. Next, the costs, benefits, risks, and mission focus of all the projects are assessed, and the projects are compared against each other and ranked or prioritized. In conducting their selection processes, leading organizations require all projects to have complete and accurate project proposals and justification information. Finally, a decision-making body of senior managers makes decisions about which projects to select for funding on the basis of mission needs and organizational priorities. The selection phase helps ensure that the organization selects those projects that will best support mission needs and identifies and analyzes each project\u2019s risks and proposed benefits before a significant amount of funds is spent.", "Through AMS, FAA has established two processes\u2014mission analysis and investment analysis\u2014that together constitute a set of policies, procedures, and guidance that are designed to enhance the agency\u2019s ability to select investments. These two processes define what should be done and who should do it, what reports are required, who reviews and approves reports and processes, who makes corporate-level decisions, and the roles and responsibilities of those involved. AMS policy and guidance\u2014which is on an easily accessible Internet Website\u2014contain the procedures, process flowcharts, document templates, checklists, and other acquisition-related information needed for FAA\u2019s project officials and senior management to understand and implement the selection processes.", "Although AMS does not include an explicit screening step, screening activities are part of the agency\u2019s mission analysis process. This process culminates in a mission need statement reflecting the Joint Resources Council\u2019s decision that a high-priority, critical need exists and that the agency should go forward with a detailed investment analysis of proposed solutions to meet that need. During mission analysis, FAA\u2019s operating divisions identify and quantify projected demand for and supply of services, capability shortfalls, and technological opportunities to meet those shortfalls, and summarize the major decision factors that the Joint Resources Council should evaluate in considering the need. The Joint Resources Council approves mission need statements.", "Once a mission need statement is approved, AMS\u2019 investment analysis process provides a set of detailed steps for evaluating the costs, benefits, and risks of alternative solutions and for selecting the best solution to meet the need. Under AMS, multidisciplinary investment analysis teams\u2014comprising officials from the operating divisions and other acquisition and engineering specialists\u2014assess each project proposed for funding to define the technical requirements; estimate the life-cycle costs, benefits, schedule, and risks; and determine the project\u2019s affordability relative to other projects. As part of the investment analysis process, FAA scores and ranks each proposed project on the basis of defined criteria for how well\u2014relative to other projects\u2014it meets the agency\u2019s mission objectives, whether it is of high priority to the organization sponsoring the project, whether it is consistent with the NAS architecture or provides critical administrative capacity for the agency, and whether it has a favorable cost-benefit ratio. AMS requires that the mission need be revalidated during the investment analysis and that the underlying analyses be documented through cost-benefit studies, risk assessments, and other documents.", "After considering the results of the investment analysis process, the Joint Resources Council decides whether to proceed with a proposed project.

The acquisition program baseline is supposed to be established when the investment decision is made for a project. The baseline, which is the agreement between the organizations within FAA that are acquiring and will use the project, sets the cost and schedule boundaries within which the project is authorized to proceed, defines the performance and benefits the project must achieve, and establishes the performance measurements for assessing the project\u2019s success as it advances through its life cycle.", "FAA\u2019s ultimate goal is to establish an acquisition program baseline document for every acquisition project. When AMS was established in April 1996, however, the agency decided to establish two standards for baseline documentation to facilitate the preparation of baselines during FAA\u2019s transition to AMS. One standard applies to those projects initiated after AMS and another, less detailed standard applies to those projects ongoing at the time that AMS was established. The post-AMS projects must have an acquisition program baseline that provides a full set of detailed information on each baseline element as well as a document called a parameter sheet that summarizes a subset of baseline information that is designated for the Joint Resources Council\u2019s control and that is considered critical to assessing the project\u2019s ability to satisfy mission need, achieve needed operational capability, achieve benefits, and meet the schedule requirements of interdependent programs. Projects begun before AMS was established are required only to have the parameter sheet. Table 2.1 summarizes the full set of baseline information contained in the acquisition program baseline and the subset of information contained in the parameter sheet.", "At the agencywide level, FAA has a two-tiered process for monitoring projects\u2019 estimated versus actual baselines. Under one process, known as the Integrated Baseline Establishment and Management (I-BEAM) process, the project officials and officials responsible for overseeing projects\u2019 baselines monitor the projects and prepare reports. Project officials prepare a monthly status report that is supposed to analyze estimated versus actual results for the subset of baseline information that is monitored by the Joint Resources Council and summarized in the parameter sheets prepared for every project. Project officials must also inform the Joint Resources Council of any baseline violation or \u201cbreach\u201d through a document called a baseline management notice and receive the Council\u2019s approval for any change in the baselines. Additionally, FAA\u2019s acquisition oversight officials prepare a monthly report that analyzes the status reports, baseline management notices, and other documents to identify baseline variances and report this information to the Joint Resources Council.

FAA\u2019s cost estimating techniques do not satisfy recognized standards that call for organizing and retaining cost information on projects in a historical database and using cost models that are calibrated and validated on the basis of actual experience. FAA\u2019s processes allow each project to approach cost estimating in whatever manner its estimators choose. The result is inconsistency in the rigor and discipline with which cost estimates are derived, which in turn means estimates vary in their degrees of reliability. For example, of the six projects reviewed in our 1997 report, two were too poorly documented to permit any comparative analysis, and none of the remaining four satisfied all the recognized standards. Compounding the estimating weaknesses is FAA\u2019s practice of presenting cost estimates as precise point estimates, thus failing to disclose the estimates\u2019 inherent uncertainty and risks.

At leading organizations, even after a project has been implemented, senior managers regularly review how well the acquired system meets organizational needs, including whether it needs unexpected modifications or premature replacement to meet emerging needs. These reviews are used to make decisions pertaining to the retirement or replacement of systems. In addition, because operations activities\u2014such as hardware upgrades, system software changes, ongoing training, and maintenance costs\u2014can consume a significant level of resources, a plan for the review of each project should be developed and periodically reevaluated.

Two of the projects in our review provide examples of continuing cost and schedule problems. In the case of the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System, although FAA has not officially changed the baseline approved in February 1996, the baseline is in jeopardy of being breached because of unions\u2019 concerns about human-factor and design issues, the refinement of the project\u2019s requirements, and the interjection of a new project phase.

Similarly, in the case of the NAS Infrastructure Management System, the agency has not officially changed the baseline that was approved in March 1997.
