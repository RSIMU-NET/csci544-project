At the same time, the percentage of Americans who are uninsured or rely on Medicaid\u2014particularly children\u2014continues to increase. The effect of being uninsured on the health of families can be significant. For example, uninsured children are less likely than insured children to receive primary care, immunizations, and treatment for injuries. The lack of such care can lead to health conditions and disabilities that require more costly and long-term care.", "Concerned about the decline in employment-based health insurance coverage, you asked us to (1) identify any recent trends in employment-based private health insurance, particularly for family coverage; (2) determine any corresponding changes in the number of adults and children with private insurance coverage as dependents; and (3) identify the potential effect of these changes, if any, on public costs for health care coverage. To answer these questions, we analyzed surveys of health insurance coverage conducted by the Department of Labor (DOL) and by private benefits consultants, such as KPMG Peat Marwick and Hewitt Associates. We also analyzed the Bureau of the Census\u2019 Current Population Surveys (CPS) on health insurance coverage for 1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995.

U.S. employers traditionally have provided private group health insurance as an employment benefit for their employees and their employees\u2019 spouses and children. Beginning with World War II\u2014when wages were frozen and employers wanted to attract good employees\u2014employment-based insurance became a more common fringe benefit. Today, private health insurance offered through employment is the main source of health insurance coverage in the United States\u2014in 1995, more than 90 percent of people under 65 years old with private insurance\u2014150 million people\u2014were insured through their employment. The majority of working adults 18 to 64 years old with private insurance (74 percent) work for private companies, but 17 percent work for the federal, state, or local governments. Most of the remainder are self-employed.", "Employment-based insurance\u2014where employers pay part or all of the costs\u2014can be advantageous for employees and many employers. For employees, such health insurance is generally more affordable because they receive group rates for coverage, which are typically lower than those for individual coverage. In addition, employees do not pay taxes on contributions that their employers make toward their employment-based coverage\u2014an advantage employees would lose if they were to receive additional cash income and to purchase individual coverage. For employers, offering affordable health insurance is an attractive benefit that helps them promote the health and productivity of their work force and remain competitive in recruiting new employees. Employers\u2019 contributions to employee benefits are deductible from their companies\u2019 gross income and thus reduce their companies\u2019 tax liability. In the United States, the system of private health insurance based on employment is entirely voluntary. Employers are not required to provide insurance, nor are employees required to purchase it.", "In addition to private insurance, the federal, state, and some local governments provide public funding for health insurance, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare, state health insurance plans, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). Medicaid is the largest public source of health insurance coverage for children and working-age adults, covering 29 million people under 65 years old in 1995. Enacted in 1965, Medicaid was designed to provide health care coverage for populations whose incomes and resources were insufficient to meet the costs of needed medical care, including adults and children receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and aged, blind, or permanently and totally disabled individuals. Although Medicaid has expanded eligibility beyond these groups, it still limits eligibility to specific populations of lower-income adults and children. Medicare provides health care coverage for over 37 million people\u2014most of them people 65 years old or older. Medicare also covers people entitled to disability benefits for 24 months or more, people with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or kidney transplant, and certain others who elect to buy into the program through premium payments. CHAMPUS provides medical care for active-duty or retired military families, as well as to the immediate families of deceased active-duty or retired military personnel.", "Although these private and public health insurance systems provide coverage for many Americans, many remain uninsured.

Between 1988 and 1989, employer costs for health insurance rose 18 percent in one year. By contrast, general inflation was under 5 percent. Health insurance premium costs began to stabilize recently.

Of those who thought businesses should be required or encouraged to provide insurance to employees\u2019 families, nearly half agreed that employers should contribute an even smaller share for family coverage than employee coverage. According to the study, employers viewed their role in providing coverage to employees and their dependents as diminishing.", "Some firms\u2014particularly those with fewer than 25 employees or that primarily employ low-wage employees\u2014do not offer health insurance.

Offering an attractive and costly benefits package can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage with firms who do not pay as much for benefits, and do not attract their employees\u2019 families to enroll.", "According to several benefits consultants, some employers no longer want to subsidize families to the extent that they have because they prefer to more closely link total employee compensation to work contribution. Employers that provide generous family health insurance packages, in effect, pay employees with family coverage more than they pay employees without family coverage\u2014considering the value of benefits. Some employers are concerned that this is not equitable. For example, a company that pays 100 percent of the cost of employee health insurance premiums could provide a benefit that is worth, on average, more than twice as much to the employee who chooses family coverage over employee-only coverage\u2014$5,000 versus $2,000."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Employers Raise Employees\u2019 Contributions to Premiums, Especially for Families, and Discourage Family Coverage in Other Ways", "paragraphs": ["Employers have responded to the increases in health insurance costs in several ways.

Some employers used other strategies to encourage employees not to choose family health insurance coverage, including paying incentives to those who choose employee-only coverage.", "These changes can provide significant savings for companies.

From 1984 to 1993, the number of employees in large firms who were enrolled in managed care plans, such as HMOs, increased from 5 percent to 50 percent. HMO premiums were generally lower than premiums for fee-for-service plans, so employers could lower premium costs by switching the types of plans they offered.

Flexible plans and accounts allow employees to select the benefits they want from a menu of benefits, thus allowing them to maximize the value of their benefits by selecting the ones they need most. Generally, firms designate a portion of employee salaries as per-year credits; employees then allocate these credits among available benefits, including health insurance. The amount of employer-provided flexible benefit credits is typically set each year with reference to some target\u2014such as the change in current cost of one health insurance option\u2014plus enough to cover certain other benefits. However, the increased flexible benefit credits may not cover employees\u2019 increased costs.

Over time, they can make other changes to shift more cost to employees with families, such as expanding the benefits for employees using employee-only coverage and restraining benefits for families. For example, one major high-technology manufacturing firm gives a $1,000 credit to an employee\u2019s flexible benefits account if the employee chooses to get health insurance coverage through his or her spouse.

If states develop separate application processes for TANF and Medicaid, such processes may raise barriers to Medicaid enrollment.", "Generally, families who would have qualified for AFDC-Medicaid coverage will still qualify for Medicaid. The law extends eligibility to people who would have been eligible under AFDC rules in effect as of July 16, 1996. However, states can roll back the July 16, 1996, AFDC income standards to May 1, 1988, levels. States also can raise these levels for inflation and can use more liberal methodologies to determine countable income and resources. The new law allows states to terminate Medicaid eligibility for any adult who is terminated from TANF because of failure to work, but their minor children cannot be terminated from Medicaid on that basis. The law also extends Medicaid for up to a year for those who either become employed or have increased earnings and received Medicaid under the prewelfare reform AFDC eligibility criteria in 3 of the preceding 6 months.", "There are no changes in current eligibility rules for pregnant women and children based on age and income. However, SSI eligibility for children with disabilities is tighter under the new law, which could reduce Medicaid enrollment of SSI children. Some children who lose eligibility based on SSI or because their families exhaust transitional Medicaid may be able to gain eligibility based on age and income.", "The new law limits eligibility in a significant way\u2014based on citizenship status. Before the new law, all legal immigrants and permanent residents who qualified based on other eligibility criteria were eligible for Medicaid. Under the new law, qualified aliens currently residing in the United States will be eligible for Medicaid only at the state\u2019s option, unless a qualified alien is a member of one of the excepted groups whose Medicaid eligibility is mandated by law. Qualified aliens who enter the country in the future will be banned from Medicaid coverage for 5 years from their date of entry, except for treatment of emergency medical conditions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As the cost of health insurance escalated, many employers restructured their benefits. Some employers dropped health insurance coverage entirely\u2014particularly small employers\u2014shifting the burden entirely to employees. But more commonly, employers increased the amount employees had to pay to gain coverage, particularly for family coverage.", "As this occurred, coverage became less available and less affordable for many Americans. The percentage of Americans under 65 years old with private health insurance decreased. Thus, many Americans who are unable to purchase health insurance for themselves and their families have trouble getting health care. In particular, some children and working adults who earn low wages are being squeezed out of the private insurance market. At the same time, many of these Americans are not eligible for public medical assistance. This slow erosion of private coverage contributed to a loss of coverage\u2014leaving more than 40 million Americans under 65 years old uninsured.", "Public pressure to increase publicly funded care may intensify if the number of Americans who lose private insurance coverage continues to rise. However, state and federal efforts to reform welfare may decrease the number of people covered through Medicaid. In addition, policymakers have become concerned that increasing public coverage will encourage employers or families to drop private coverage in favor of public coverage. If the availability of both public and private coverage continues to erode, the number of uninsured will inevitably continue to grow.", "Through welfare reform, states will be trying to move families off assistance and into the private sector. Ideally, as welfare recipients begin working, they will gain access to private insurance. However, former welfare recipients tend to land low-wage jobs, which often do not offer health insurance coverage or may not offer insurance which they can afford. Even after a year in the workforce, many former welfare recipients may still not be able to access or afford private coverage for their families. This suggests that low-income working families may continue to need subsidized health insurance if they are to have health insurance coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We sought comments on a draft of this report from experts on private health insurance issues and from the Health Care Financing Administration on the section of the draft report that dealt with Medicaid and welfare reform.

We used the CPS to measure private insurance coverage and private dependent insurance coverage in 1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995. Because of certain methodological changes implemented in March 1995 and continued in March 1996 (which affected the 1994 and 1995 data), including changes in the questionnaire, we considered it more appropriate to compare private insurance coverage, rather than make such comparisons for employment-based insurance coverage in 1995 to earlier years.", "We did not independently verify data from these sources.

These changes include moving to a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system and reordering and rewording survey questions on health insurance. The earlier questionnaire asked people (1) if they had private insurance, (2) if they were the policyholder, (3) if the insurance was obtained through their employment, and (4) who else was covered as a dependent. The new questionnaire asks (1) if they have private insurance through an employer or union; (2) who is the policyholder; (3) who else is covered; and (4) if they have purchased individual health insurance and, if so, additional people who are covered by this policy.", "These changes appear to affect how people answer questions about their insurance coverage, which can affect estimates of insurance coverage. These changes also can affect the comparability of 1994 and subsequent years\u2019 estimates with previous years\u2019 estimates. When the 1994 data were released, officials at Census stated that the 1994 estimate of overall private insurance agreed well with previous years\u2019 estimates. However, the number of people who report that their private insurance coverage comes from their employer or union increased, while the number who reported that their private insurance was individually purchased decreased. Therefore, because these apparent differences may be due to the questionnaire change\u2014rather than actual changes in the composition of private health insurance coverage\u2014comparisons of employment-based insurance coverage in 1994 and 1995 with previous years may not be appropriate to understand trends in coverage. In particular, dependents appeared to be misclassified as not having employment-based insurance in past surveys. This is why our CPS analysis compares private insurance, rather than employment-based insurance.", "Because we were concerned that changes in the questionnaire would affect estimates of private dependent health insurance coverage, we also partially analyzed the March 1994 CPS (1993 data), to compare dependent coverage in 1993.
