Little is known, however, about how many participants got jobs related to their training. From program year 2006 through program year 2011, the percentages of training participants who earned a credential declined from about 74 percent to 58 percent for the Adult Program and from about 75 percent to 63 percent for the Dislocated Worker Program, according to data from the Department of Labor (DOL). Of those training participants who attained a credential in program year 2011, about 65 percent earned occupational credentials, such as a welding certificate, followed by lower percentages who earned occupational skill licenses and associate's degrees, among others. In contrast, GAO found training-related employment data unreliable primarily because a significant portion of the data was missing.", "Workforce officials in four of six selected states cited some obstacles in reporting data on credential attainment, and both DOL and states are taking steps to address challenges. Officials in four states GAO contacted said reporting such data can be resource-intensive, largely because case managers must manually track this information from various sources, including participants, training providers, and third-party organizations. To improve credential attainment and reporting, DOL clarified which credentials should be reported and began measuring credential attainment through an agency-wide goal in 2010. Officials in five states have taken similar steps, such as setting goals and tracking credential attainment, and enhancing data exchange with training providers. Officials in most of the six states GAO contacted noted some obstacles to obtaining such data. For example, officials from several states cited student privacy laws as a barrier in verifying credentials with training providers. Officials in three states told us that they ask participants to sign consent forms allowing training providers to give credential information to local officials.", "Workforce officials in most of the selected states identified even greater challenges reporting data on training-related employment, including the high degree of resources required and the subjective nature of determining whether employment is linked to training. DOL has taken only limited steps to address these challenges. To report such data, case managers seek participants' employment information from participants, employers, and wage records. Then they must piece it together to determine whether participants' employment is \"substantially related\" to their training. Officials in most of the six states described this process as resource-intensive and noted that making such determinations are subjective since one case manager's interpretation of \"substantially related\" may differ from another's. Given these challenges, officials in all six states have taken some steps to increase access to employment information or make decisions less subjective. DOL has recently stressed the importance of reporting data on training-related employment and shared a few practices with states to increase reporting rates; however, it has not identified and disseminated strategies to address the ongoing challenges states face regarding resource intensiveness and subjectivity, which could improve the quality of such data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL identify and share with states strategies that may ease collection and improve the quality of training-related employment data.

To assess the performance of these programs,  WIA requires that states report on outcome measures in key areas  including employment, retention, earnings, and credential attainment.  WIA also requires states to negotiate expected performance levels for  each of these measures with DOL and allows DOL to hold states  accountable for achieving their performance goals through financial  incentives and sanctions. In 2005, DOL began allowing states to request  waivers to replace the WIA performance measures with a set of common  measures to assess multiple employment and training programs. These  measures focus on employment, retention, and earnings but do not  include credential attainment. DOL still requires states to report data on  training participants who received credentials. In addition, while it is not a  WIA performance measure, WIA requires states to report the number of  training participants who obtain employment in their field of training.However, DOL\u2019s Office of Inspector General has raised questions about  the quality of such data.

We identified these  experts by reviewing relevant literature and using an iterative process to  solicit recommendations from DOL officials and experts. The results of  these interviews are not generalizeable, but provided insights about the  overall challenges states face in reporting on these outcomes and any  efforts by states to overcome them. To more specifically identify the  challenges states face in reporting data on credential attainment and  employment related to training, as well as to learn about any steps they  are taking to address these challenges, we interviewed state and local  workforce officials from a nongeneralizeable sample of six states:  Alabama, Illinois, Kansas, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington. We  selected the states to reflect a mix of those that had leading edge data  practices (as identified by experts) and those with either incomplete data  or relatively high rates of reporting errors (as identified by WIA data  quality reports on credential attainment). We also factored geographic  diversity into state selection. In each state, we interviewed state  workforce officials and also local workforce officials from at least one  workforce investment board (WIB), and at least one American Job  Center. In addition, we interviewed at least one employer organization in  each state. In selecting these entities, we considered states\u2019 input on  organizations that could provide us with an employer perspective on the  value of credentials and certain types of training for various industries.  These employer organizations included statewide business associations,  regional business associations, individual employers, and industry- specific representatives.", "To assess the reliability of the data DOL collects on credential attainment  and training-related employment for participants in the WIA Adult and  Dislocated Worker Programs, we analyzed data from DOL\u2019s Workforce  Investment Act Standardized Record Data system for 2010 and 2011, the  most recent program years for which data were available. We reviewed  existing documentation related to reporting these data, tested the data  electronically, assessed it for factors such as completeness and  consistency, and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials. We found  the data on training and credential attainment to be sufficiently reliable for  reporting overall estimates of participants who entered training, the  minimum number of training participants who earned credentials, and the  types of credentials they attained.

In February 2002, we recommended that  DOL more clearly define this term. Since that time, DOL issued guidance  to clarify its definition of credential attainment.

Beginning in December  2007, the significant increase in the overall number of participants is likely  attributed to the downturn in the economy that led to a dramatic rise in  unemployment and the subsequent infusion of additional funds to WIA  programs from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Recovery Act). The Recovery Act provided $500 million for grants for  the Adult Program and $1.25 billion for grants for the Dislocated Worker  Program. By spring of 2009, DOL began allocating these funds to states  to supplement existing WIA funds. DOL encouraged states to use  Recovery Act funds to increase training in an effort to help Americans  acquire new skills and return to work. DOL officials stated that the  increase in demand for training services exceeded the increase in supply  provided for by the Recovery Act, which may have led to shortages in  training capacity that contributed to a relative decline in training. Another  factor, according to DOL officials, is that some program participants had  limited access to needs-based financial assistance and other supportive  services, such as child care, which may have prevented them from  entering WIA training services. Further, DOL noted that the preference of  many program participants is for immediate employment rather than job  training.", "Similarly, the percentage of training participants who earned credentials  has also generally declined from program year 2006 through program  year 2011 (see fig. 3). For example, DOL\u2019s data show the percentage of  those who earned credentials in the Adult Program dropped from about  74 percent in program year 2006 to about 58 percent in program year  2011. Likewise, the percentage of those in the Dislocated Worker  Program who earned credentials dropped from about 75 percent in  program year 2006 to about 63 percent in program year 2011.

Officials in one of  these states also said they stopped collecting and reporting these data  until DOL issued clarifying guidance in 2010 emphasizing the importance  of credential attainment as a pathway to employment.", "DOL\u2019s data on credential attainment also show that participants in the  Dislocated Worker Program typically have higher credential attainment  rates than participants in the Adult Program. DOL officials explained that  the Dislocated Worker Program has a higher funding level that supports  more training, and that participants in this program generally have longer  work histories and more advanced education and so are more likely to  enter into training programs that lead to credentials. In contrast,  participants in the Adult Program are more likely to require training  focused on remedial education and job readiness which are less likely to  result in credentials as defined by DOL.", "Of the training participants who attained credentials during program year  2011\u2014approximately 89,000 in the Adult Program and 84,000 in the  Dislocated Worker Program\u2014 about two-thirds in each program earned  an occupational credential, such as a welding certificate or clinical  medical assistant certificate (see fig. 4). The next two most common  types of credentials attained by training participants were an occupational  skills license, such as a license in nursing, and an associate\u2019s degree.  The fact that training participants attained occupational credentials at  higher rates than longer-term academic degrees is consistent with DOL\u2019s  recommendation that states shorten training duration in an effort to  increase credential attainment.

Third-party credentialing  organizations represent an additional source of credential  information. For some occupations, a license or certification is  required before a person can be employed in that capacity, such as a  licensed practical nurse. In these cases, third-party organizations,  such as state regulatory bodies, issue credentials. Case managers  can sometimes search licensing databases online to confirm  credential attainment.

Some  employer groups also noted the value of credentials in some high- demand occupations, such as manufacturing and information technology.

Officials in nearly every state we  interviewed reported that this guidance was helpful largely because it  more clearly defined which credentials should be reported to DOL.", "In addition, selected states and local areas have taken steps to ease the  resource-intensive process of collecting data on credentials by enhancing  communication with participants and working to overcome privacy issues  with training providers. Workforce officials in three states told us that case  managers seek to build rapport with participants early in the process so  they are more likely to be responsive after their training program ends.  Regarding training providers, officials in four of six states said they have  made efforts to address privacy concerns. Local officials in Alabama,  Kansas, and Texas, for example, told us that they ask participants to sign  consent forms to allow training providers to share credential information  with officials. In Washington, state officials access some credential data  from the National Student Clearinghouse and from their state database of  community and technical colleges. They said that student privacy rights  are generally not a barrier to accessing credential data in Washington  because students attending their community and technical colleges are  notified that such information can be released to other entities unless the  student opts out of sharing it. Washington state officials noted that they  have been refining their process for collecting data on credential  attainment for 15 years and now have a fairly sophisticated approach.", "While these varied efforts to mitigate challenges may help reduce the  resources required or improve the quality of reported data, workforce  officials from three states and three experts we interviewed raised some  additional considerations about measuring performance on credential  attainment (see table 4). Establishing a performance measure on  credential attainment may affect the type of training provided and which  participants receive training. For example, neither work readiness training  nor on-the-job training (OJT) leads to what DOL has defined as a  credential for reporting purposes. However, these may be the most  appropriate types of training for participants with basic skills or for  particular industries, according to officials from two states we  interviewed. Our December 2013 report found that participants in the WIA Adult and Dislocated Worker Programs often lacked the relevant  qualifications and basic skills needed to participate in training that would  meet the needs of employers seeking employees for in-demand  occupations. In addition, work readiness certificates are generally  valued by employers, according to several employer group  representatives and local workforce officials we interviewed.  Representatives from a few employer groups also noted that, in some  cases, experience is more important than credentials. For example, local  officials we interviewed in Illinois said that the vast majority of participants  in OJT obtained jobs with the employers once their training was  completed. The officials said OJT provided a good return on investment,  despite the fact that these participants did not earn credentials.  Currently, DOL\u2019s credential attainment data do not include participants  who completed these types of training programs. If credential attainment  is established as a performance measure, it will be important to consider  ways to address participants who are enrolled in certain types of training  that do not lead to a credential, such as by excluding these participants  from a credential attainment measure or considering if other measures,  such as basic skill attainment, could capture the value of training provided  to participants excluded from the measure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States Face Continuing Challenges Reporting Data on Training- Related Employment, Despite Efforts by States and DOL to Improve Reporting", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reporting Data on Training-Related Employment Is Resource- Intensive and Involves Subjective Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Workforce officials in most states we studied identified challenges  reporting data on training-related employment that were greater than  those for reporting data on credential attainment, including the high  degree of resources required and the subjective nature of determining  whether employment is linked to training. Similar to credential attainment,  there is no definitive source for these data, so case managers must  generally collect participants\u2019 employment information from various  sources, including participants, employers, and UI wage records. Then\u2014 in a step beyond what is required for reporting on credential attainment\u2014 they must piece this information together to determine whether  participants\u2019 employment is substantially related to their training. Also  unlike reporting on credential attainment, DOL does not require that local  WIA programs collect and retain documentation on training-related  employment in the participants\u2019 case files to verify the accuracy of data  they report to states.", "Officials in four of the six states we studied, as well as at DOL, said this  data collection process often requires considerable time and effort.  Further, officials from DOL and four states emphasized the need to  consider the balance between the time required to collect outcome data  and the time case managers spend serving participants, especially in an  environment of reduced resources. In addition, officials in all six states  said that making training-related employment determinations can be  subjective. According to DOL\u2019s reporting guidance, participants\u2019  employment is related to their training if it uses \u201ca substantial portion of  the skills taught in training.\u201d workforce experts from one national organization, said that one case  manager\u2019s interpretation of what constitutes a substantial portion of the  skills obtained in training may differ from another\u2019s. The training-related  employment decision can be straightforward if the training and job are  clearly connected. For example, if a participant received training to attain  a commercial driver\u2019s license and was subsequently hired as a driver by a  trucking company, the case manager can easily determine that the  participant\u2019s employment is substantially related to the training received.  In other cases, however, the decision may be more subjective. For  example, officials in one state could not agree whether a participant who  had received aviation instruction training had secured training-related  employment in his position as an airframe and power plant mechanic.  Some state officials thought the skills obtained were transferable, but  others were unsure.", "U.S. Department of Labor, Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 17-09:  Quarterly Submission of Workforce Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD)  (March 10, 2010).", "Collecting participants\u2019 employment information and attempting to  determine whether it was training-related generally entails several steps  (see fig. 5).", "Contacting participants. Several state and local officials we  interviewed said that they generally begin the process of collecting  data on training-related employment by attempting to contact  participants, though some can be unresponsive or inaccessible, which  workforce experts from one national organization noted as well. If  case managers are successful, they ask participants for information  such as the name of their employer and their job title. Some local  areas also ask participants directly if their new jobs are\u2014in the  participants\u2019 opinion\u2014related to the training they received. In some  cases, case managers make their training-related employment  determinations based solely on information the participants provide  about their employment.", "Contacting employers. Some case managers contact employers to  obtain participants\u2019 employment information, though employers may  not be responsive. If case managers could not reach a participant but  know where the person works, they may contact the employer to  obtain their job title and description. They may also contact an  employer to verify the information provided by a participant. Case  managers can use the employment information obtained from an  employer, or from both the participant and employer, to determine if a  participant\u2019s job is training-related. However, workforce officials in  Illinois and Texas said employers may not be responsive because  they are concerned about employee privacy or about the amount of  follow-up required.", "Checking UI wage records. Some local workforce officials said that if  they are unable to gather information about a participant\u2019s  employment from the participant or the employer, they check the UI  wage records, which are generally not available until several months  after a participant exits from WIA services. DOL officials and  workforce experts at two national organizations said the UI wage  records generally provide the name of the participant\u2019s employer and  a code associated with the employer\u2019s industry, but specific  information on the participant\u2019s occupation is rarely included. In some  cases, the industry code has a clear connection to the training  received, making the case manager\u2019s training-related employment  determination straightforward. For example, if a participant who was  trained as a nurse was hired by a hospital, the case manager can  reasonably assume that the employment and training are related.  However, some officials noted that the industry code is not always a  good predictor of a participant\u2019s occupation. For example, if the same  participant was hired by the health unit of a manufacturing company,  the industry code in the UI wage records would suggest that the  person\u2019s job was associated with manufacturing and not related to the  nursing training.", "Other steps to determine training-related employment. If  successful in accessing a participant\u2019s employment information,  including job title, some workforce officials said case managers use  DOL\u2019s Occupational Information Network (O*NET), which provides an  online tool to match job title occupational codes to the skills code  associated with the participant\u2019s training. This can help case  managers decide whether the participant\u2019s employment is training- related.", "According to some local workforce officials, however, it can be difficult  to find the precise occupational code that matches the participant\u2019s  new job. In addition, DOL officials told us that even attempting to  match O*NET codes in this manner might not help case managers  determine if participants\u2019 employment is related to their training  because the threshold of relatedness is still subjective, as mentioned  previously. DOL officials also told us it is difficult to prescribe a  standard definition for determining whether a job is related to training  because it often requires some judgment on the part of local officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Have Taken Steps to Address Challenges by Improving Reporting on Training-Related Employment", "paragraphs": ["To improve reporting, some states have taken steps to increase their  access to information about participants\u2019 employment. Similar to their  efforts to collect information on credential attainment, some local  workforce officials told us that case managers seek to build rapport with  participants. At the same time, officials we interviewed in four of six states  have taken steps to increase access to employment-related information.  In Illinois, Rhode Island, and Texas, local workforce officials ask  participants to sign release forms authorizing employers to release  employment information to officials. Local workforce staff in Kansas and  Texas also said they obtain information on participants\u2019 employment,  including the names of their employers, and\u2014unlike UI wage records\u2014 their job titles, by subscribing to an online payroll database called The  Work Number. This service verifies employment via a database of  national payroll data but does not include all employers, and local WIA  programs must pay to subscribe.", "Officials said they conduct this survey for  internal use to collect and share data on  training-related employment that is not  otherwise available to program managers and  state officials. Another official noted that a  significant percentage of respondents who do  not report their job as training-related find the  training instrumental in getting the job or that  the skills they acquired in training are useful  on their job.", "In addition, local workforce officials in four states we contacted said they  have developed strategies to help reduce the subjectivity in determining  whether a participant\u2019s employment is related to their training. For  example, local officials in Texas told us that staff may consult their  American Job Center\u2019s local business services office, which often has  specific knowledge about what skills correspond with particular job titles.  Officials in Texas and Alabama also said case managers may consult  with their peers or supervisors to reach consensus about a training- related employment decision. Further, state workforce officials in Kansas  told us that when employers post jobs on the state\u2019s job bank, they are  required to enter occupational codes from DOL\u2019s online O*NET database.  If a training participant gets one of these jobs, case managers can  compare the employer-provided occupational code with the training codes  supplied by training providers to help them determine whether the job is   training-related. State and local officials in Washington also said  managers routinely use O*NET when making their training-related  employment decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL Has Taken Limited Steps to Address Challenges and Improve Data on Training-Related Employment", "paragraphs": ["While DOL has recently issued guidance aimed at increasing reporting  rates for training-related employment data, it has taken limited steps to  address states\u2019 ongoing reporting challenges. As previously discussed, a  September 2011 report by DOL\u2019s Office of Inspector General raised  questions about the quality of these data and made recommendations to  address this issue. In response, DOL issued a notice to states in  September 2013 that reiterated the requirement for states to report these  data and stressed the data\u2019s importance for program analysis and  evaluation efforts pertaining to the value of investments in WIA training.  The DOL notice also acknowledged that reporting on training-related  employment is challenging largely because the information must be  collected manually. According to the DOL notice, nearly every state that  participated in conference calls on the topic indicated that there was  considerable cost in conducting the necessary follow-up for reporting on  training-related employment and that this was the primary reason the data  were not well-reported. State and local officials we interviewed also noted  that such data may be underreported because of the difficulty of following  up with participants and employers. DOL also concluded that states with  larger training caseloads had less complete reporting on training-related  employment. In the notice, DOL also described a few practices most  common among states with higher reporting rates for training-related  employment. For example, DOL cited the practice of instituting a data  system check to ensure that training-related employment data are  recorded before closing a participant\u2019s case file.", "Use of crosswalk not necessarily a  solution for determining training-related  employment  Another program DOL administers, Job  Corps\u2014a residential, educational, and career  technical training program for disadvantaged  youths\u2014uses a crosswalk that links specific  training codes and occupational codes to help  staff determine training-related employment.  However, in a September 2011 report, the  DOL Inspector General found that this  crosswalk included some matches that were  either not related or poorly related. Moreover,  DOL officials said that using a crosswalk for  the WIA Adult and Dislocated Worker  programs could make the training- employment link too restrictive and would  require a considerable amount of resources to  develop.", "DOL has not identified and disseminated strategies for increasing access  to employment-related data or helping to minimize the subjectivity of  training-related determinations, but instead has focused exclusively on  increasing data reporting rates. While DOL officials maintain that manual  follow-up with participants is the best approach for obtaining employment  related data, they also recognize that such data collection is resource- intensive. In addition, as officials in all six of our selected states also  noted, DOL officials acknowledged that determining whether a  participant\u2019s employment is training-related can be a subjective decision.  They noted challenges in defining training-related employment more  precisely. For example, officials said some training is intended to develop  broad, nonspecific skills that may help participants get jobs but are not  associated with a specific occupation or industry. We recognize that  utilizing professional judgment is inherent in certain tasks such as  determining whether a participant\u2019s employment is related to the training  the participant received. However, minimizing the amount of subjective  decision-making involved to the extent possible could help ensure better  quality data on training-related employment. Reasonable approaches for  improving the quality of performance data focus on aspects of  completeness, accuracy, consistency, and ease of use. By identifying  and sharing with states practices to increase access to employment- related data and reduce the subjectivity of some determinations, DOL  could help states improve their reporting of data on training-related  employment.", "In addition to the strategies all six selected states use to mitigate  reporting challenges, workforce officials from three states and workforce  experts at two national organizations said some additional considerations  should be taken into account in weighing a performance measure on  training-related employment (see table 5). We previously noted concerns  about the level of resources required and the subjectivity of  determinations, both of which could affect the data\u2019s completeness and  consistency\u2014key aspects of performance data quality. The state and  local strategies we identified may help mitigate some reporting  challenges. In addition, a participant\u2019s successful placement in a training- related job depends on both the ability and decision to pursue such a  position. Some local workforce officials we contacted said that it may take  participants longer to find employment in their field of training than is  allowed for reporting purposes. For example, workforce officials in  Rhode Island said that due to the poor economy in their state, it is not  uncommon for some participants to take 2 years or more to find a job.  Additionally, workforce officials in three states we contacted said  participants may decide to take a job unrelated to their training if it is the  only job they can find or if they simply choose not to pursue a job in the  field in which they were trained."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that public funds invested in WIA\u2019s Adult and Dislocated  Worker Programs are spent wisely, program managers and policymakers  need performance data that are accessible, complete, accurate and  consistent.

Beyond these, data on outcomes such as  credential attainment and training-related employment can potentially  provide information more specifically on the value of training services.
