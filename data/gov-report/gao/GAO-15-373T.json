L. No. 113-146, 128 Stat.  1754), which provides $15 billion in new funding for Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) health care. Generally, this law requires VA to offer  veterans the option to receive hospital care and medical services from a  non-VA provider when a VA facility cannot provide an appointment within  30 days, or when veterans reside more than 40 miles from the nearest VA  facility. Under the law, VA received $10 billion to cover the expected  increase in utilization of non-VA providers to deliver health care services  to veterans. The $10 billion is available until expended and is meant to  supplement VA\u2019s current budgetary resources for medical care. Further,  the law appropriated $5 billion to increase veterans\u2019 access to care by  expanding VA\u2019s capacity to deliver care to veterans by hiring additional  clinicians and improving the physical infrastructure of VA\u2019s facilities. It is  therefore critical that VA ensures its resources are being used in a cost- effective manner to improve veterans\u2019 timely access to health care.", "We have categorized our concerns about VA\u2019s ability to ensure the  timeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality, and safety of the health care the  department provides into five broad areas: (1) ambiguous policies and  inconsistent processes, (2) inadequate oversight and accountability, (3)  information technology challenges, (4) inadequate training for VA staff,  and (5) unclear resource needs and allocation priorities. We have made  numerous recommendations that aim to address weaknesses in VA\u2019s  management of its health care system\u2014more than 100 of which have yet  to be fully resolved. For example, to ensure that its facilities are carrying  out processes at the local level more consistently\u2014such as scheduling  veterans\u2019 medical appointments and collecting data on veteran suicides\u2014 VA needs to clarify its existing policies. VA also needs to strengthen  oversight and accountability across its facilities by conducting more  systematic, independent assessments of processes that are carried out at  the local level, including how VA facilities are resolving specialty care  consults, processing claims for non-VA care, and establishing  performance pay goals for their providers. We also have recommended  that VA work with the Department of Defense (DOD) to address the  administrative burdens created by the lack of interoperability between  their two IT systems. A number of our recommendations aim to improve  training for staff at VA facilities, to address issues such as how staff are  cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing reusable medical equipment, and to  more clearly align training on VA\u2019s new nurse staffing methodology with  the needs of staff responsible for developing nurse staffing plans. Finally,  we have recommended that VA improve its methods for identifying VA  facilities\u2019 resource needs and for analyzing the cost-effectiveness of VA  health care.", "The recently enacted Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act  included a number of provisions intended to help VA address systemic  weaknesses. For example, the law requires VA to contract with an  independent entity to (1) assess VA\u2019s capacity to meet the current and  projected demographics and needs of veterans who use the VA health  care system, (2) examine VA\u2019s clinical staffing levels and productivity, and  (3) review VA\u2019s IT strategies and business processes, among other  things. The new law also establishes a 15-member commission, to be  appointed primarily by bipartisan congressional leadership, which will  examine how best to organize the VA health care system, locate health  care resources, and deliver health care to veterans. It is critical for VA  leaders to act on the findings of this independent contractor and  congressional commission, as well as on those of VA\u2019s Office of the  Inspector General, GAO, and others, and to fully commit themselves to  developing long-term solutions that mitigate risks to the timeliness, cost- effectiveness, quality, and safety of the VA health care system.", "It is also critical that Congress maintains its focus on oversight of VA  health care. In the spring and summer of 2014, congressional committees  held more than 20 hearings to address identified weaknesses in the VA  health care system. Sustained congressional attention to these issues will  help ensure that VA continues to make progress in improving the delivery  of health care services to veterans.", "We plan to continue monitoring VA\u2019s efforts to improve the timeliness,  cost-effectiveness, quality, and safety of veterans\u2019 health care. To this  end, we have ongoing work focusing on topics such as veterans\u2019 access  to primary care and mental health services; primary care productivity;  nurse recruitment and retention; monitoring and oversight of VA spending  on training programs for health care professionals; mechanisms VA uses  to monitor quality of care; and VA and DOD investments in Centers of  Excellence\u2014which are intended to produce better health outcomes for  veterans and service members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and Operations", "paragraphs": ["Although the executive branch has undertaken numerous initiatives to  better manage the more than $80 billion that is annually invested in  information technology (IT), federal IT investments too frequently fail or  incur cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to  mission-related outcomes.

These  and other failed IT projects often suffered from a lack of disciplined and  effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition,  and program oversight and governance. In many instances, agencies  have not consistently applied best practices that are critical to  successfully acquiring IT investments.", "We have identified nine critical factors underlying successful major  acquisitions that support the objective of improving the management of  large-scale IT acquisitions across the federal government: (1) program  officials actively engaging with stakeholders; (2) program staff having the  necessary knowledge and skills; (3) senior department and agency  executives supporting the programs; (4) end users and stakeholders  involved in the development of requirements; (5) end users participating  in testing of system functionality prior to end user acceptance testing; (6)  government and contractor staff being stable and consistent; (7) program  staff prioritizing requirements; (8) program officials maintaining regular  communication with the prime contractor; and (9) programs receiving  sufficient funding.", "While there have been numerous executive branch initiatives aimed at  addressing these issues, implementation has been inconsistent. Over the  past 5 years, we have reported numerous times on shortcomings with IT  acquisitions and operations and have made about 737 related  recommendations, 361 of which were to the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and agencies to improve the implementation of the recent  initiatives and other government-wide, cross-cutting efforts. As of January  2015, about 23 percent of the 737 recommendations had been fully  implemented.", "Given the federal government\u2019s continued experience with failed and  troubled IT projects, coupled with the fact that OMB initiatives to help  address such problems have not been fully implemented, the government  will likely continue to produce disappointing results and will miss  opportunities to improve IT management, reduce costs, and improve  services to the public, unless needed actions are taken.

I want to acknowledge the leadership of this  Committee and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs in leading efforts to enact this important legislation.  To help address the management of IT investments, OMB and federal  agencies should expeditiously implement the requirements of the December 2014 statutory provisions promoting IT acquisition reform.Doing so should (1) improve the transparency and management of IT  acquisitions and operations across the government, and (2) strengthen  the authority of chief information officers to provide needed direction and  oversight.
