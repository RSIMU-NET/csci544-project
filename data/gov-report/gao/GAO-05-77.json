Under this act, agencies are required to submit strategic plans and annual performance plans that detail their long-term and annual goals as well as information on how they plan to meet these goals. GPRA also requires agencies to submit annual performance reports that provide information on their progress in meeting the goals. However, the Commission has not updated or revised its strategic plan since 1997. Without revisiting its strategic goals, the Commission lacks a firm basis on which to develop its annual goals and evaluate its performance. In addition, its most recent annual performance plan and annual performance report contain weaknesses that limit the agency's ability to effectively manage its operations and communicate its performance. For example, the performance plan does not discuss the Commission's strategies or resources for achieving its goals, does not provide budgetary information for its programs, and does not provide performance indicators for some annual goals. Similarly, the performance report does not account for the Commission's performance for many of the annual goals set forth in its performance plan and does not provide plans, schedules, or recommendations for addressing each of the Commission's unmet goals. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) have provided oversight for the Commission's budgetary and human capital operations in recent years. OMB's oversight has focused on the Commission's budget requests and GPRA plans and reports. OPM conducted two reviews of the Commission's human capital management systems in the 1990s and made recommendations for improvement, including improvements to its grievance and performance appraisal systems. Although the Commission has implemented some of OPM's earlier recommendations, it has not implemented five of six broader, systemic recommendations made in 1999 for improvement to its human capital management systems. Unlike many other executive agencies, the Commission does not have an Inspector General to provide oversight of its operations beyond OMB and OPM. GAO has conducted several reviews of the Commission's management operations in recent years. The Commission took some actions in response to the recommendations in GAO's 1994 and 1997 reports.

The potential problems  stemming from the Commission\u2019s failure to associate costs with specific  annual goals or break down its budget request by goal may be exacerbated  by the large gap between the Commission\u2019s budget requests and its actual  appropriations. Since 1999, the Commission\u2019s appropriations have  averaged approximately 26 percent less than the amount requested. For  fiscal year 2004, the Commission based its annual performance plan on a  budget request of $15.2 million, but its appropriation for that year totaled  only $9.1 million.", "In addition, the Commission has consistently not revised its annual  performance plans to reflect its actual appropriations and illustrate the  impact on its annual goals. Although agencies are not required to revise  their plans to reflect actual appropriations under GPRA, the fact that the  Commission\u2019s plans are based upon a budget that is so much larger than  its actual appropriations limits the plans\u2019 usefulness in detailing how the  agency will achieve its annual goals and in assessing the impact of  appropriations decisions on its planned performance.", "Furthermore, the Commission\u2019s annual performance plan for fiscal year  2005 does not provide the performance indicators to be used in measuring  achievement of each annual goal.

While the report explains  why some goals were not met, it does not provide plans, schedules, or  recommendations for addressing these unmet goals.

However, in 2003, we found that the actions taken did not fully address the  problems identified in our 1997 report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Commission Has Not Implemented Most Recommendations from Our 2003 Report", "paragraphs": ["In October 2003, we reported that, although the Commission had made  some improvements in its project management procedures for  Commissioners and staff, the procedures lacked certain key elements of  good project management, such as providing Commissioners with project  cost information and opportunities to contribute to Commission reports  before they are issued. We also reported that the Commission lacked  sufficient management control over its contracting procedures and that  little, if any, external oversight of the Commission\u2019s financial activities had  taken place, since no independent accounting firm had audited the  Commission\u2019s financial statements in at least 12 years. To address these  issues, we recommended that the Commission  1.  monitor the adequacy and timeliness of project cost information  2.  adopt procedures that provide for increased Commissioner  involvement in project implementation and report preparation,  3.  establish greater controls over its contracting activities in order to be  in compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and  4.  take immediate steps to meet the financial statement preparation and  audit requirements of the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 for  fiscal year 2004.", "The Staff Director generally disagreed with these recommendations, and  the Commission has not adopted three of them. In their June 2004 letter  responding to our report recommendations, Commission officials asserted  that the first two recommendations were a matter of internal policy to be  decided by the Commissioners. In addition, they disagreed with the need  for the third recommendation and asserted that they were taking steps to  address the last recommendation. Although they disagreed with the third  recommendation, the Commission hired a contracting and procurement  specialist starting in December 2003 to provide supplemental services, and  the Staff Director acknowledged that the Commission could improve in  this area. As of September 16, 2004, the Commission had yet to contract  with an independent auditor to prepare for meeting the requirements of  the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002.

Strategic planning is not a static or occasional  event. Instead, it is a dynamic and inclusive process that, if done well, is  integral to an organization\u2019s entire operations. By not devoting the time  and resources required to update its strategic plan, the Commission has no  assurance that it is pursuing long-term goals that reflect the needs of its  key stakeholders and that address the many management challenges  presented by the shifting external and internal environments in which it  operates. Furthermore, the Commission lacks a foundation to use in  aligning its daily activities, operations, and resources to support its  mission and achieve its goals. Without using the GPRA planning process to  periodically reexamine its long-term goals and set its course, the  Commission is not in a strong position to set relevant annual goals or  develop measures for assessing whether it has achieved them. Given the  consistent shortfall between the Commission\u2019s annual budget requests and  its appropriations over the past decade, it is even more important for the  Commission to chart a strategic course that is realistic.", "Although the Commission has improved some policies and practices in  response to recommendations from OPM and GAO, the problems that  remain are still cause for concern, particularly given the lingering nature  of the Commission\u2019s management difficulties.

Finally, annual  budgetary and other reviews based on periodic cycles or specific requests  may not be sufficient to address longstanding concerns about the  Commission\u2019s management and accountability.

We have carefully reviewed the Commission\u2019s concerns and  overall do not agree with its comments on our findings and conclusions.  For example, the Commission disagreed with our GPRA findings, asserting  that its GPRA processes were appropriate and sound for an agency of its  size. The Commission also asserted that, as a small agency, it was not cost- effective or efficient for it to institute its own accountability system for  managing its human resources, as OPM had recommended. The  Commission similarly cited its small size in asserting that it would be an  \u201cextreme\u201d challenge to institute our October 2003 report  recommendations. We disagree with these assertions. The Commission\u2019s  size is not relevant here: Size does not mitigate the need for the  Commission to address longstanding management and human capital  problems identified in previous OPM and GAO reports. Furthermore,  instead of implying that it is acceptable for the Commission as a small  agency to operate under diminished expectations for GPRA compliance,  the Commission could make use of GPRA\u2019s planning and reporting  framework to strengthen itself as an agency. For example, the Commission  could use GPRA's planning framework to update and sharpen its goals,  clearly identify the strategies and resources needed to achieve those goals,  and improve its management and human capital practices. The  Commission could then also use GPRA\u2019s reporting framework to  demonstrate the progress it has made towards achieving those goals.", "In addition to providing these comments, the Commission criticized our  approach to our work, asserting that the draft report contained inaccurate  and incomplete analyses and that we rushed to complete the report within  an artificially constrained timeline. We strongly disagree. At all times, we  scoped, designed, and conducted this engagement in accordance with  applicable professional standards and our quality assurance requirements.  Furthermore, many of the Commission\u2019s comments about how we  conducted our work were themselves misleading and inaccurate. For  example, we did not suddenly and drastically change our focus, as the  Commission asserted. In our May 2004 entrance conference with the  agency, we noted our specific focus on certain areas, including the  Commission\u2019s GPRA products and the agency\u2019s actions in response to  OPM and GAO recommendations. Our focus on oversight of the  Commission and GPRA requirements remained consistent throughout the  assignment.

We  disagree strongly with this assertion. To the contrary, we scoped,  designed, and conducted this engagement in accordance with  applicable professional standards and our quality assurance  requirements. To further ensure the quality of our work, we included  an initial design period, in which we built upon our considerable  knowledge of the Commission from previous GAO reports and  obtained further information as needed. In designing and conducting  our work, we also consulted with our internal experts on GPRA and  other issues. Far from rushing through the engagement, we in fact  extended our design period so that we could perform high-quality work  within a timeframe useful to our congressional requesters. At the end  of this design period in July, we narrowed our scope, deferring a  potential objective on the organizational structure of the Commission.  Refining the scope of an engagement following a design phase is not an  unusual audit practice. By agreement with our requesters, we did not  include work on the Commission\u2019s organizational structure not  because of any arbitrary decision, as the Commission alleges, but  rather to enable us to complete our work on time and in accordance  with our quality standards. Our focus on GPRA, oversight, and the  Commission\u2019s response to our October 2003 report recommendations  remained consistent throughout the assignment, from initial  notification to report drafting. Furthermore, in our May 2004 entrance  conference with the agency, we noted our focus on these areas, and in  July 2004, at the end of our design phase, we shared these objectives  and our approach with Commission staff in an interview.", "The Commission asserted that we did not follow up with its staff as  needed to obtain answers to questions and that they expected us to  interview more people, both staff and Commissioners, in the course of  our work. We disagree. Our methodology called for analyzing  Commission documents, pertinent legislation and guidance, and  various reports by OPM and GAO. Although at the beginning of our  project, we envisioned interviewing key managers and all of the  Commissioners as part of possible work on the Commission\u2019s  organizational structure, these interviews became unnecessary when  we decided to focus on the Commission\u2019s GPRA plans and reports,  oversight of the Commission, and the agency\u2019s response to our  previous report recommendations. As noted in our report, to obtain  information for these objectives, we conducted interviews with the  Staff Director, Special Assistant to the Staff Director, Human  Resources Director, and Budget Chief. We also followed up with e- mails and telephone calls as needed. Finally, in our exit conference, we  presented all of our findings and provided an opportunity for  Commission staff to comment on our findings and provide technical  corrections. At that meeting, Commission officials provided a few  comments, but no technical corrections; with few exceptions, they did  not disagree with the facts or conclusions we presented.", "The Commission asserted that it cooperated with us fully, at all times.", "However, while our working relationships were professional and  Commission officials were usually responsive in providing documents  as requested, we do not agree that Commission staff cooperated fully  with us throughout our work. Obtaining interviews with the  Commission and key staff was frequently difficult, with each one  requiring a minimum of 3 weeks to schedule. For example, although we  notified the Commission on April 19, 2004, about our planned work and  called shortly thereafter to schedule an initial meeting, it took  numerous calls to set up our entrance conference on May 20, 2004. This  delay in scheduling the initial meeting occurred despite our reference  to the need for a rapid response. In addition, since it was difficult for  Commission officials to find the time to meet with us, we combined our  entrance conference with that of another GAO team that was  examining the Commission\u2019s financial transactions so that they would  not also experience a delay in starting their work. We had similar  difficulties scheduling other meetings as well.", "The Commission has repeatedly asserted that it is a small agency, with  a budget of approximately $9 million and fewer than 70 staff\u2014 information that we noted in the draft report.

The Commission\u2019s size is not  relevant here: Size does not mitigate the need for the Commission to  address longstanding management and human capital problems  identified in previous OPM and GAO reports.

The Commission could then also use  GPRA\u2019s reporting framework to demonstrate the progress it has made  towards achieving those goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Response to Specific Comments from the Commission", "paragraphs": ["In addition to making these broad comments, the Commission disagreed  with our findings more specifically. Our detailed responses to the  Commission\u2019s comments follow.   1.  We disagree that the Commission has implemented or was  \u201cengaged in implementing\u201d all of the recommendations in our  October 2003 report. See responses 2 through 6.   2.  Although the Commission reported that it has taken various steps  to meet the financial statement preparation and audit requirements  of the act, we disagree that it is in a position to meet the act\u2019s  requirements for financial statement preparation and audit this  year. As of September 16, 2004, the Commission had not hired an  independent auditor to conduct this work. The agency\u2019s ability to  meet the act\u2019s requirements in the less than 2 remaining months is  highly doubtful, since the agency has not had its fiscal activities  independently audited in more than 12 years, and no audit work  has begun.   3.  The Commission\u2019s assertion is not accurate: The Commission has  not implemented our recommendation to provide for increased  commissioner involvement in project implementation and report  preparation. In fact, as the Commission noted in its comments, the  Commission has \u201ccontinued to follow longstanding Commission  policy on Commissioner-staff interaction.\u201d As we reported in  October 2003, this policy does not provide for systematic  Commissioner input throughout projects. Nothing precludes the  Staff Director from providing additional information about projects  and report status to Commissioners as a matter of good project  management and quality assurance. Furthermore, the Staff  Director could respond in various ways to Commissioners\u2019  concerns for increased input without obtaining a formal vote to  change the Commission\u2019s procedures. For example,  Commissioners could receive a summary of preliminary facts and  findings or an outline of a planned report.   4.  The Commission asserted that there is no requirement that the  Commissioners\u2019 judgment must be substituted with our judgment  on policy decision matters. While our recommendations are not  requirements, we provide recommendations in our reports in  accordance with our statutory responsibilities to investigate the  use of public money, analyze agency expenditures, and evaluate  the results of federal programs and activities. Our reports and  recommendations provide agencies with the information necessary  to improve their mission performance and Congress with the  information necessary for oversight, including the development of  legislation that will help agencies in their efforts. As the  administrative head of the Commission, the Staff Director is  authorized to make administrative changes that are consistent with  the law and Commission policies. While it may be difficult at times  to distinguish between an administrative and policy matter, we are  not aware of any Commission policies that would prevent the Staff  Director from implementing our recommendations nor would it be  contrary to the law.  5.  The Commission asserted that it has provided the Commissioners  with project cost information and made efforts to monitor the  adequacy and timeliness of the information given, as recommended  in our October 2003 report. According to Commission staff, the  agency provides cost information on a quarterly basis to  Commissioners and has done so since the last quarter of fiscal year  2003.  However, we continue to believe that having regular project  cost reports, such as monthly reports, would enhance the  Commissioners\u2019 ability to plan for and monitor projects during  their monthly meetings. Monthly reports would allow greater  accountability for the projects by integrating cost information in a  timely manner into project management. Since the Commission\u2019s  Budget Chief told us that he prepares monthly project cost reports  for the Staff Director, preparing reports for the Commissioners\u2019  monthly meetings should not be unduly burdensome. To ensure  that cost reports can be best used to strengthen project monitoring  and management, these reports should also be provided to  Commissioners shortly after the month ends.   6.  We believe that it is a deficiency for the Commission to provide  quarterly cost reports to Commissioners 3 months after a quarter  has ended. Our October 2003 recommendation called for the  Commission to monitor the adequacy and timeliness of project  cost information provided to Commissioners. In our view,  information provided in 3-month-old project cost reports cannot be  considered timely.  7.  We believe that it is a deficiency for project cost reports to omit  mention of the status of planned projects. The Commission\u2019s  second quarter 2004 cost report for the Commissioners did not  indicate the status of 4 of the 12 projects. To be useful for decision  making and monitoring, the project cost report should have noted  that some planned projects had already been completed and that  some work had not yet begun, so that the Commissioners  monitoring the projects would have also been aware of the status  of these projects.   8.  We disagree that our conclusions on the Commission\u2019s response to  OPM\u2019s 1999 recommendations are inaccurate and incomplete. See  responses 9 through 16 as well as our response to broad assertions  in the Commission\u2019s comments.  9.  The Commission asserted that we did not indicate concerns about  its implementation of OPM\u2019s 1999 recommendations until officials  received the draft report. However, it is not clear to us why  Commission officials should have been unaware of the direction of  our findings. Four Commission officials, including the Human  Resources Director, participated in two major meetings, one of  which focused extensively on the Commission\u2019s actions in  response to six of OPM\u2019s human resources recommendations.  The  Human Resources Director also participated in our exit conference  in which we summarized our findings, including our finding on the  Commission\u2019s responses to oversight by OPM. We noted explicitly  during this meeting that we had focused on certain  recommendations and had found that the actions taken by the  Commission were limited. The Human Resources Director did not  provide any corrections or technical comments on the agency\u2019s  human resources practices during this meeting, nor did any other  Commission official. In addition to these meetings, we obtained  additional documents, comments, and answers to questions by       e-mail from the Commission during the course of our work and  incorporated this information into our draft report as appropriate.   10.  The Commission asserts that we did not dispute that it complied  with 11 of OPM\u2019s 1999 recommendations. This statement is  incorrect. We selected 6 of OPM\u2019s 16 recommendations for  analysis; we did not analyze the Commission\u2019s response to the  remaining recommendations. We noted in our report that the  Commission had implemented 1 of the 6 recommendations that we  analyzed. We have clarified our methodology in the final report.  See comment 11 for more information on our methodology.   11.  The Commission asserted that we arbitrarily decided to focus on 6  of the 16 recommendations OPM made in 1999. We strongly  disagree. To follow up on the Commission\u2019s response to OPM\u2019s  recommendations, we judgmentally selected six recommendations  that had broader, more systemic implications for the agency. At no  point, however, did we pre-select these recommendations in order  to emphasize a particular outcome or \u201ccast the agency in a bad  light.\u201d We have clarified the basis for our selection of these  recommendations in the final report.   12.  We do not agree that the Commission has implemented OPM\u2019s  recommendation to delegate HRM authority to managers. OPM\u2019s  report stated that \u201cthe Staff Director retains final approving  authority for most  decisions, including  appointments, promotions, and performance ratings.\u201d Policies  described in OPM\u2019s 1999 report remain in place at the Commission  today. For example, in our interviews this year, Commission  officials told us that the Staff Director must approve all hiring and  promotion decisions as well as managers\u2019 evaluations of  employees. As of February 2004, according to the Commission\u2019s  administrative manual, \u201cthe staff director retains approval  authority\u201d as well for quality step increases, accomplishment  awards, performance awards for its employees, and  recommendations to OPM for other awards. While the Commission  has taken certain actions to improve its human resources  management practices, such as developing an employee handbook  on human resources matters and providing managers with OPM\u2019s  HRM Accountability System Development Guide, the Commission  has not delegated human resource authorities to managers in all  program areas, as OPM had recommended.   13.  The Commission\u2019s assertion that it was acting in accordance with  Merit System Principles is misleading and largely irrelevant for this  discussion. OPM\u2019s recommendation for an accountability system  stemmed from its analysis of the Commission\u2019s human resource  accountability and internal self-assessment efforts (an area of  weakness also identified in its 1996 review). In 1999, OPM found  that the Commission had not \u201cdeveloped an effective system to  hold managers accountable for HRM-related decisions.\u201d OPM  further noted that the \u201cStaff Director retains final approving  authority for most  decisions\u2026 leaving managers  uncertain about their own accountability when making these HRM  decisions . . . Employees see this lack of accountability too, saying  that the supervisory chain of command is unclear and that they are  unsure of where work assignments and agency work priorities  originate.  Also, employees report that their jobs do not make good  use of their skills and abilities; that they are not satisfied with their  jobs; and that they do not feel free to disclose waste, fraud, and  abuse without fear of reprisal.\u201d OPM noted that an internal self- assessment program was \u201curgently needed to assure  accountability.\u201d References to the Commission\u2019s delegated  examining authority and general compliance with OPM\u2019s Merit  System Principles are not pertinent to the finding that led to this  recommendation.  14.  The Commission is inaccurate in asserting that OPM \u201cmay have  made a recommendation for additional improvement of the  Commission\u2019s personnel processes.\u201d As we noted in our report,  OPM made 16 recommendations for improvement of the  Commission\u2019s human resource management practices in its 1999  report. The Commission is also inaccurate in asserting that OPM  found that \u201cthose basic  processes were already sound,\u201d  and that \u201cthere was no real need to implement this  recommendation [on using OPM\u2019s HRM Accountability System  Guide], since Commission operations were good.\u201d This is an  inaccurate reading of OPM\u2019s 1999 findings and recommendations.  While OPM found overall that the Commission\u2019s human resource  program complied with the Merit System Principles, OPM also  urged the Commission to consider its recommendations in five  broad areas of human resource management. In the executive  summary of the 1999 report, the first of 12 bullets highlighting  OPM\u2019s findings summarizes concerns raised in its earlier 1996  report on the Commission; acknowledges that the Commission  \u201chas improved its administration of the HRM program, particularly  in the recruitment and placement area\u201d; and continues by saying,  \u201cHowever, the other concerns we identified in 1996 continue to  require attention.\u201d  Of the 11 remaining bulleted  findings in OPM\u2019s summary, 7 describe problem areas, 3 are  positive, and 1 is mixed.   15.  The Commission asserts that using OPM\u2019s guide instead of  designing its own system is appropriate because it is a small  agency. However, the Commission\u2019s assertions reflect a  misunderstanding of OPM\u2019s guidance to agencies and of what  constitutes an accountability system for human resources.  According to OPM, an HRM accountability system is a process and  should be seen as a continuous cycle. This systemic, continuous  process \u201cenables an agency to identify, collect, and use the  information or data on which accountability is ultimately based.\u201d It  includes identifying the agency\u2019s strategic goals, including human  resource goals; developing performance measures and a baseline  to assess whether human resource goals are being met; and using  this information to make improvements. The accountability  process also requires cyclical, periodic reassessment. The  Commission has taken various actions to improve its human  resources management, including updating several administrative  instructions, conducting an employee survey in fiscal year 2000,  and developing an employee handbook. However, the Commission  has not developed an accountability system\u2014an ongoing process  involving goal setting, evaluation, improvements, and  reassessment\u2014to address the concerns raised in OPM\u2019s report.  16.  We cannot agree that goals established in 1997 address and  implement OPM\u2019s 1999 recommendation, nor do we agree that our  referring to the Commission\u2019s strategic plan in this discussion is  unfair. The Commission\u2019s strategic plan was developed in 1997 and  remains the Commission\u2019s only strategic plan. In 1999, OPM  recommended that the Commission\u2019s strategic plan include human  resources elements that OPM did not find in the Commission\u2019s  1997 plan. In examining goal six in the Commission\u2019s 1997 strategic  plan, OPM \u201cdid not find that a link between HRM and agency  mission accomplishment has been made apparent in the Strategic  Plan. Further, the Strategic Plan does not list specific HRM goals  and measures that could be used to assess the HRM function\u2019s  ability to effectively and efficiently support agency mission  accomplishment. We found no evidence that key measures and/or  outcome indicators are used by  to track its  efforts to achieve HRM goals.\u201d The Commission\u2019s assertion that the  1997 strategic plan contains human resources goals, measures, and  indicators is therefore neither accurate nor relevant: The 1997 plan  does not include human resources measures and indicators and it  was not part of the Commission\u2019s response to OPM\u2019s  recommendation because it was developed 2 years before OPM  made this recommendation.    17.  The Commission\u2019s statement that we examined its GPRA processes  is incorrect, and its description of the processes it used in 1997 to  develop its strategic plan and first performance plan and report are  irrelevant. Our objective was to assess the Commission\u2019s  compliance with GPRA\u2019s requirements for agency strategic plans,  annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. We  did not focus on the agency\u2019s process for developing these GPRA  plans and reports, nor did we analyze the Commission\u2019s initial  performance plan for fiscal year 1999 or its initial performance  report for fiscal year 1999. As noted in our report, we analyzed the  Commission\u2019s most recent performance plan (for fiscal year 2005)  and the most recent performance report (for fiscal year 2003). We  also compared the Commission\u2019s plan for fiscal year 2003 to its  performance report for the same year.    18.  The Commission is incorrect in asserting that its descriptions of  completed studies in its performance report provide information  equivalent to performance indicators and that its plans and reports,  by implication, comply with GPRA standards. Under GPRA, a  performance indicator means a particular value or characteristic  used to measure output or outcome. A narrative description of a  report\u2019s findings cannot be used for measurement purposes. See  comment 19 as well.   19.  The assertion that the Commission can use non-quantifiable  measures in its reports is misleading. GPRA allows the Director of  OMB to authorize the use of alternative, nonquantifiable  performance goals for annual performance plans if necessary.   However, Commission officials explicitly told us that the agency  did not apply for or receive authorization from OMB to submit  goals in their annual performance plan in an alternative,  nonquantifiable format. Agencies that are authorized to use  alternative formats must comply with certain other requirements,  which the Commission has not done.  20.  The Commission has not received an exemption from GPRA  reporting requirements. Although agencies with annual outlays of  $20 million or less are eligible to apply to OMB for an exemption,  as the Commission notes, Commission officials told us that the  agency has not applied for nor received such an exemption.    21.  Although the Commission has filed annual performance plans and  annual reports each year, as required under GPRA, it has not  revised and updated its strategic plan, which is also required under  GPRA.  Furthermore, we cannot agree that the Commission\u2019s plans  and reports comply with \u201cmaterial requirements\u201d of GPRA because  of the numerous shortcomings in these products, as described in  our report.   22.  As noted in our report, according to OMB officials, OMB conducts  primarily budgetary reviews and does not provide agencies that  have small budgets and staff, such as the Commission, with the  same level of scrutiny that it provides to larger agencies. OMB  officials further told us that OMB does not approve or reject  agencies\u2019 GPRA plans and reports, but provides comments as  appropriate. Because of OMB\u2019s focus on budgetary reviews and on  larger agencies, the absence of criticism from OMB does not  necessarily constitute approval of an agency\u2019s GPRA plans and  reports.  23.  Contrary to the Commission\u2019s assertion, GPRA does require  agencies to update and revise its strategic plan at least every 3  years.  The Commission has not updated and revised  its strategic plan since 1997 when it should have done so in fiscal  year 2000 and again in fiscal year 2003. The Commission further  asserts that its 1997 plan does not need updating or revision  because its authorizing statute has not changed in the interim. This  assumption is incorrect and demonstrates a misunderstanding of  GPRA\u2019s purposes and requirements. As noted in our report,  strategic planning is not a static or occasional event. If done well, it  is dynamic, continuous, and results-oriented, and it provides the  foundation for everything the organization does."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Key Recommendations from OPM in 1999 and the Commission\u2019s Response", "paragraphs": ["Of the 16 recommendations that the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) made to the Commission in 1999, we judgmentally selected 6  recommendations that had broader, more systemic implications for the  agency.

Because the  Commission has not updated its strategic plan, it has not included  additional human capital goals and assessment measures. In addition,  although the Commission issued a Human Resources Plan in fiscal year  2000 that contains five human capital performance goals, the plan does not  link these goals to its overall strategic goals, set forth a timeframe for  achieving them, or describe how it will assess its progress. The plan also  does not describe how Commission staff will participate in human  resource planning and evaluation, as OPM recommended.", "OPM Recommendation: Use OPM\u2019s Human Resource Management  Accountability System Development Guide as a framework for  creating an accountability system that will ensure that the  Commission\u2019s employees are used efficiently and effectively and  that personnel actions are taken in accordance with Merit Systems  Principles in support of agency mission accomplishment.", "Although Commission officials reported that they have developed and  implemented an accountability system, we found little evidence to support  this claim. OPM recommended that the Commission use its Human  Resource Management Accountability System Development Guide as a  framework for creating an accountability system. The Commission\u2019s fiscal  year 2000 annual performance report noted that their managers were  provided copies of the Accountability Guide for review and that the  Commission planned to adopt or modify some of its procedures and  recommendations. According to Commission officials, they used the  Accountability Guide to develop a system similar to the one OPM outlines  in its guide. They also told us that Commission managers were presented  with a copy of the Accountability Guide and that their employees are  aware of the system. According to the Commission\u2019s Human Resources  Manager, the accountability system the agency developed in response to  OPM\u2019s recommendation is in the Commission\u2019s Administrative  Instructions Manual and its fiscal year 2000 Human Resources Plan. The  Commission has taken various actions to improve its human resources  management since OPM\u2019s 1999 review, such as conducting an employee  survey in fiscal year 2000 and developing an employee handbook.  Although the Commission has also updated several key sections of its  administrative manual, most of the manual was published in April 1999,  before OPM issued its report. Furthermore, the Commission\u2019s most recent  annual performance plan does not refer to a human capital accountability  system, nor does it detail human capital goals or baselines to use in  evaluating such goals.", "OPM Recommendation: Delegate human resources management  authorities to managers in all program areas. Hold managers  accountable for exercising the delegations through the Human  Resources Management Accountability System.", "The Commission has not implemented this recommendation. Overall, the  Staff Director\u2019s authority for most human resources decisions remains  essentially the same as in OPM\u2019s 1999 report findings. According to  Commission officials, managers can recommend employees for hire,  promotion, and awards and conduct annual and mid-year reviews of their  staff. However, the Staff Director must approve all hiring and promotion  decisions as well as managers\u2019 evaluations of employees before appraisals  are given to employees.", "OPM Recommendation: Develop a system for periodically collecting  employee feedback regarding human resources services and  policies. Incorporate that feedback in the Human Resources  Management Accountability System.", "The Commission has not implemented this recommendation. To date, the  Commission has not developed a formal system to regularly collect  employee feedback about its human capital services and policies, even  though a similar recommendation to obtain customer feedback and track  customer views was also made in OPM\u2019s earlier 1996 review. In fiscal year  2000, the Commission administered a staff survey on human resources and  other Commission issues. According to officials, the Commission plans to  administer another staff survey in the fall of 2004. However, the  Commission has not developed plans to survey staff on a regular basis. In  addition, since the Commission was unable to locate the results of its 2000  survey, its managers cannot use earlier human capital findings to  systematically set goals and make improvements. According to OPM  officials, OPM will conduct a Web-based Human Capital Survey of  Commission staff beginning in September or October of 2004.", "OPM Recommendation: Require that all managers make progress  reviews and performance appraisals in a timely manner when the  Human Resources Division notifies them they are due, and require  that the Staff Director review appraisals when they are made  without delay.", "The Commission has implemented this recommendation, which was also  made in OPM\u2019s 1996 review. According to the Commission\u2019s Human  Resources Director, the agency is on schedule for its fiscal year 2004  performance appraisals. Commission guidance on the 2004 performance  appraisal cycle requires Commission supervisors and managers to conduct  annual and mid-year performance reviews of their staff. For non-Senior  Executive Service employees, the process is outlined in a memorandum  that the Human Resources Director sends annually to Commission  supervisors and managers.", "OPM Recommendation: With employee involvement, consider  developing a new performance management system linked to  organizational and agency goals established under the  Commission\u2019s Strategic Plan.", "The Commission has not implemented this recommendation. The  Commission\u2019s performance management system is described in its  Administrative Instructions Manual, most of which was issued in April  1999\u20146 months before OPM issued the recommendations in its October  1999 report. The Administrative Instructions do not clearly require that  employees\u2019 performance plans link individual staff goals to broader  strategic goals. The parts of the manual that set forth the Commission\u2019s  policies and procedures on appraisals make no reference to the  Commission\u2019s strategic plan, nor does it specify how to link individual  staff goals to the Commission\u2019s strategic goals or how to involve  employees in this process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO\u2019s October 2003 Recommendations and the Commission\u2019s Response", "paragraphs": ["GAO Recommendation: Monitor the adequacy and timeliness of  project cost information that the Staff Director provides to  Commissioners and make the necessary adjustments, which could  include providing information on a monthly, rather than a  quarterly, basis and as necessary.", "The Commission has not implemented this recommendation. In our 2003  review, we found that the Commission\u2019s procedures did not provide for  the Commissioners to systematically receive project cost information\u2014a  key element of good project management. As a result, the Commissioners  approved the majority of projects and products each year without having  any specific information on how much the project would cost, or how  much similar projects have cost in past years.", "In the Commission\u2019s June 2004 letter responding to our 2003  recommendations, the Staff Director stated that this recommendation  spoke to \u201cCommission policy on the proper level and mode of interaction  between the Commissioners and staff \u2026  the Commissioners  have reaffirmed on numerous occasions the current policy regarding  interaction with staff.\u201d He added that the Commission \u201cis continuing to  monitor the adequacy and timeliness of project cost information provided  to Commissioners.\u201d", "According to the Staff Director, his office provides the Commissioners  with cost information for each project and office on a quarterly basis, and  they began doing so during the last quarter of 2003. However, the cost  report for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, ending March 31, was not  sent to the Commissioners until June 30, 2004, and was sent in response to  requests from the Commissioners for this information. It is also not clear  that the Commission is monitoring the adequacy and timeliness of project  cost information, as recommended. For example, the quarterly report for  the second quarter of 2004 cites costs for only 8 of the 12 projects outlined  in the Commission\u2019s fiscal year 2004 performance plan.", "GAO Recommendation: Adopt procedures that provide for  increased Commissioner involvement in project implementation  and report preparation.", "The Staff Director does not agree with this recommendation and has not  implemented it. In our 2003 review, we found that Commissioners have  limited involvement in the management of projects once they have been  approved. As a result, we recommended that the Commission adopt  procedures for increasing Commissioner involvement after project  implementation by providing them with project updates and allowing them  to review the product at various stages in the drafting process, so that they  participate more actively in shaping products released to the public.", "The Staff Director did not agree with this recommendation and told us that  he believes that the current procedures that govern Commissioner  involvement in the development of products are appropriate and efficient.  In his June 2004 letter responding to our recommendations, the Staff  Director wrote that the responsibility for determining policy on  Commissioners\u2019 interaction with the staff is \u201cdelegated by statute to the  Commissioners.\u201d According to the Staff Director, the Commissioners  requested that he assess the situation and issue recommendations on their  involvement in report preparation. The Staff Director said that involving  the Commissioners in the writing stage would \u201cbog down\u201d the process and  that it would be difficult to incorporate the viewpoints of the eight  Commissioners. To date, the Commission has not adopted any procedures  to increase Commissioner involvement in the report preparation stage.", "GAO Recommendation: Establish greater controls over contracting  activities in order to comply with the Federal Acquisition  Regulation.", "Although the Staff Director disagreed with this recommendation, the  Commission took one step towards establishing greater controls by  contracting with a contracts and procurement specialist to supplement its  operations. In 2003, we reported that the Commission lacked sufficient  management controls over its contracting procedures. We found that, in  fiscal year 2002, the Commission had not followed proper federal  procedures in awarding most of its 11 contracts. Moreover, we found that  the Commission failed to follow procedures that would allow it to track  vendors\u2019 performance against objective measures and ensure that public  funds are being used effectively.", "While the Staff Director disagreed in his June 2004 response letter with the  need for the actions associated with this recommendation, he later told us  that the Commission \u201ccould be stronger\u201d in the area of procurement. Since  our 2003 report was issued, the Commission has supplemented its  contracts and procurements operations by contracting with a contracts  and procurements specialist with over 30 years of experience in  government contracting.

In 2003, we  found that the Commission\u2019s fiscal activities had not been independently  audited in at least 12 years.
