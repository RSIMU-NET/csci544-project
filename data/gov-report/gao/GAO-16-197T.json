Specifically, the Library had drafted an IT strategic plan that addressed  some, but not all, of these elements, but at the time of our review it had  not been finalized. Thus, the Library lacked a clear vision of what it wants  to accomplish with IT and strategies for achieving those results. Such a  strategic approach is essential to the Library as information is increasingly  created, shared, and preserved digitally.", "Regarding enterprise architecture, the Library had developed an  architecture that described the current state of the Library\u2019s IT systems  and operations; however, the data supporting this effort were not  gathered from management and validated by stakeholders, calling into  question its reliability.

Specifically, Library policy did not clearly define the  responsibilities of its investment board by, for example, specifying when  investment decisions should be made by the board and when they should  be elevated to the Library\u2019s Executive Committee. Further, since the  Library did not have a fully developed IT strategic plan or enterprise  architecture, its investment management process was not fully  coordinated with these processes, limiting the agency\u2019s ability to make  investment decisions that effectively support its mission and goals.", "In addition, while the Library had developed a process for selecting  investments for funding based on a balancing of risk factors and program  benefits, it lacked policies or procedures for \u201cre-selecting\u201d investments for  continued funding once they were operational. This is significant because  operational investments accounted for the majority of the Library\u2019s IT  spending. Moreover, the Library had not integrated its investment  selection and funding processes, meaning that decisions to fund projects  were not informed by the evaluation of their relative risks and benefits. In  some cases, individual service units secured funding for investments  before bringing them to the investment review board\u2014or the investments  were not reviewed by the board at all.", "Regarding investment oversight, the Library conducted assessments of  investments\u2019 progress through reviews of variations from planned cost  and schedule baselines and the management of risk, among other things.

For example, the inventory  listed over 18,000 active personal computers, even though officials told  us that fewer than 6,500 personal computers were actually in use. Also,  the Library had conflicting inventories of information systems, which  disagreed on the number of systems in the agency. Specifically, Library  officials provided us with two lists of systems, one with 30 systems and  one with 46. After we raised this discrepancy, we were provided with a  revised list of 70 systems.

For example, it assigned security-related roles to  appropriate officials, including the Librarian, Deputy Librarian, CIO, and  Chief Information Security Officer. The Library also documented  information security policies and procedures to safeguard its information  and systems. Similarly, the Library developed policies to protect the  privacy of data processed by its systems and designated the General  Counsel as the agency\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer, with responsibility for  managing the protection of personally identifiable information maintained  by Library systems.", "However, the Library had not fully implemented key elements of its  information security and privacy programs. For example, while the Library  did establish and implement a process for reporting and responding to  security incidents, it had not always developed a complete and accurate inventory of systems that would  allow it to ensure that appropriate security controls had been applied; documented key controls in system security plans to inform officials  about the security risks involved in operating those systems;  conducted complete and effective security testing of its systems to  ensure that controls were implemented and operating as intended; developed remedial action plans for identified security weaknesses  and taken timely action to complete those it did develop; ensured that all systems had been appropriately reviewed and  authorized to operate, increasing the risk that officials may not be  aware of system security risks; ensured that all required users completed security awareness training; included appropriate security-related provisions in contracts for IT  products and services; and fully assessed risks to privacy arising from the use of selected  systems.", "In addition to these program shortcomings, we also identified weaknesses  in the implementation of technical security controls for nine selected  systems.

In particular, the Copyright Office  relies heavily on its eCO system to support the registration process. This  system provides a public interface for submitting applications as well as a  back-end system for Copyright staff to process these applications. While  the office relies on other legacy systems to support its recordation and  licensing functions, Copyright staff told us that the office plans to  consolidate functionality from all registration and recordation systems into  eCO.", "However, eCO has had significant technical issues, both with the system  itself, which is managed by the Copyright Office, and its underlying  infrastructure managed by the Library.

Maintaining access to these files for that  long will require migration to new storage solutions as technology  evolves.", "In addition to these technical challenges, the Copyright Office faced  organizational challenges related to the IT management weaknesses at  the Library (as highlighted in our report and discussed above). For  example, the lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities among the  Library CIO and the service units had impeded the Copyright Office\u2019s  ability to meet its IT needs. In addition, the office had been hindered in  developing its own IT strategic plan and other long-term plans due to the  absence of such plans for the Library as a whole. Further, inconsistent  service management had resulted in dissatisfaction at Copyright with IT  services provided by the Library, which led the office to pursue IT  activities on its own. As mentioned above, ITS did not always establish  levels of expected services it provides to other units in the Library, and  this has resulted in services that do not meet business needs.

In addition, as  noted above, the office recently developed a draft overall strategic plan,  and it includes strategies to support the goal of improving the Copyright  IT environment. This is an important step that should help provide  direction for future IT initiatives.", "In conclusion, effectively managing its IT resources is critical for the  Library to carry out its mission of preserving and making available the  knowledge and creative output of the American people, as well as  ensuring the smooth operations of the nation\u2019s copyright system.  Widespread weaknesses in IT management at the Library raised serious  concerns about its ability to effectively carry out its responsibilities in a  21st century digital environment. In addition, dissatisfaction with services  and support provided by the Library\u2019s central IT organization had led to  other service units pursing activities independently, potentially resulting in  overlapping or duplicative activities. Implementing our recommendations  will help ensure the Library is better positioned to effectively use  technology to support its mission. The Library\u2019s recent appointment of a  permanent CIO is a positive development; ensuring that this official has  the appropriate authority and responsibilities is key to addressing the  many weaknesses we identified. For its part, the Copyright Office has  taken steps\u2014such as developing a draft strategic plan and detailed plans  for new IT improvement initiatives\u2014that can help lay the groundwork for a  proactive approach to modernizing its IT environment.", "Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Brady, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared statement.
