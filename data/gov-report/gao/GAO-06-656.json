The Department of Labor (DOL) enforces several labor laws to protect these and other workers, including the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which provides minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor protections. In June 2000, GAO reported that contingent workers lagged behind standard full-time workers in terms of income, benefits, and workforce protections, and that some employees do not receive worker protections because employers misclassified them as independent contractors. GAO was asked to update this report by describing (1) the size and nature of the contingent workforce, (2) the benefits and workforce protections provided to contingent workers, and (3) the actions that DOL takes to detect and address employee misclassification. We analyzed DOL survey data on contingent workers and interviewed DOL officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Contingent workers constituted a relatively constant proportion of the total workforce from 1995 through 2005 and had diverse characteristics. While the population of the contingent workforce grew by an estimated 3 million workers during this time period, the proportion of contingent workers in the total workforce remained relatively constant at about 31 percent. In 2005, there were about 42.6 million contingent workers in the workforce. Contingent workers vary in terms of their demographic characteristics, industries, and occupations. For example, on average, contingent workers range in age from about 35 years for one category of temporary workers to about 48 years for self-employed workers. In addition, contingent workers are employed in a wide range of industries and occupations, including the services industry, construction, and retail trade. A smaller proportion of contingent workers than of standard full-time workers has health insurance or pension benefits, or is protected by key workforce protection laws, including laws designed to ensure proper pay and safe, healthy, and nondiscriminatory workplaces. While 72 percent of standard full-time workers received employer-provided health insurance in 2005, the proportion of contingent workers who received employer-provided health insurance ranged from 9 to 50 percent, depending on the category of contingent worker. With regard to pension benefits, 76 percent of standard full-time workers reported working for an employer who offered a pension, whereas 17 to 56 percent of contingent workers reported working for an employer who offered a pension. One reason that contingent workers are less likely to receive protections is that some laws contain requirements that exclude certain categories of contingent workers. DOL detects and addresses misclassification of employees by investigating complaints, but does not always forward misclassification cases to other federal and state agencies. Some workers do not receive worker protections to which they are entitled because employers misclassify them as independent contractors--a category of contingent workers excluded from many protections--when they should be classified as employees. DOL investigators detect and address employee misclassification primarily when responding to FLSA minimum wage and overtime pay complaints. DOL investigators examine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor to determine coverage under FLSA. DOL relies heavily on complaints from workers to enforce FLSA, but the FLSA workplace poster does not contain any information on employment classification or provide a telephone number for individuals to register complaints. Misclassification of employees may contribute to an FLSA violation or may violate laws enforced by other agencies, such as tax laws. DOL procedures require officials to share information with other federal and state agencies whenever investigators find possible violations of other laws. However, the district offices we contacted vary in how often they forward misclassification as a possible violation of other agencies' laws."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Millions of workers in the U.S. economy participate in some form of  \u201ccontingent\u201d employment, such as temporary or part-time work.

We used  this CPS contingent workforce supplement to produce estimates of  characteristics of contingent workers, their receipt of health insurance,  and their participation in pension programs. To ensure reporting  consistency, we used the same definition of contingent workers that we  used in our 2000 report. This definition included eight categories of  contingent workers: agency temporary workers (temps), direct-hire temps,  on-call workers, day laborers, contract company workers, independent  contractors, self-employed workers, and standard part-time workers. We  interviewed BLS officials and other researchers about contingent worker  issues. We also reviewed key workforce protection laws to determine  coverage of contingent workers. To obtain information on DOL\u2019s efforts to  detect and address employee misclassification as part of FLSA  enforcement, we reviewed DOL documents and interviewed DOL officials  from headquarters, 3 of 5 regional offices, and 9 of 51 district offices.

Broadly defined, \u201ccontingent  work\u201d refers to work arrangements that are not long-term, year-round, full- time employment with a single employer. For example, an employer may  hire workers when there is an immediate and limited demand for their  services, without any offer of permanent or even long-term employment.  Temporary workers, independent contractors, and part-time workers are  examples of contingent workers. In 2000, we reported our definition of  contingent workers that we also used in this report. Figure 1 shows this  definition, which includes eight categories of contingent workers.", "Research has shown that employers use contingent work arrangements for  a variety of reasons. Employers may hire contingent workers to  accommodate workload fluctuations, fill temporary absences, meet  employee\u2019s requests for part-time hours, screen workers for permanent  positions, and save on wage and benefit costs, among other reasons.  Previous analyses of data from the CPS Contingent Work Supplement have  indicated that workers also take temporary and other contingent jobs for a  variety of personal and economic reasons. For example, workers in  various types of contingent jobs indicated that they (1) preferred a flexible  schedule to accommodate their school, family, or other obligations;   (2) needed additional income; (3) could not find a more permanent job; or  (4) hoped the job would lead to permanent employment. Studies using  data from the BLS National Longitudinal Survey of Youth show that events  such as the birth of a child or a change in marital status affect the  likelihood of entering different types of employment arrangements and  prompt some workers to enter contingent work arrangements.", "Concerns arise when employers misclassify workers as independent  contractors, who are in a category of contingent workers excluded from  certain worker protections. Employee misclassification occurs when an  employer improperly classifies a worker as an independent contractor  when the worker should be classified as an employee. In 2000, we  reported that because most key workforce protection laws cover only  workers who are employees, independent contractors and certain other  contingent workers, such as self-employed workers, are, by definition, not  covered. (See app. IV for a more detailed description of these key laws.)", "Misclassification of employees can affect the administration of many  federal and state programs, such as payment of taxes and pension  benefits. For example, if employers misclassify workers as independent  contractors, then they may not be paying the payroll taxes required to be  paid for employees. At the federal level, misclassification can reduce tax  payments, Medicare payments, and Social Security payments. At the state  level, misclassification can affect payments into state tax, workers\u2019  compensation, and unemployment insurance programs. Table 1 shows key  federal and state agencies that can be affected by employee  misclassification issues.", "DOL may encounter employee misclassification while enforcing worker  protection laws.

In addition, because these laws are based on the  traditional employer-employee relationship, they generally cover only  workers who are employees; independent contractors and self-employed  workers, therefore, are not covered. According to the 2005 Contingent  Work Supplement, 10.3 million individuals are independent contractors;  these individuals would not be covered by these workforce protection  laws.", "When employers have misclassified workers as independent contractors,  workers may need to go to court to establish their employee status and  their eligibility for protection under the laws. In addition, DOL may bring a  lawsuit on behalf of the worker or group of workers to require that the  employer provide the benefit or protection under the law. As shown in  figure 5, the key workforce protection laws cover a wide range of issues.", "Certain categories of contingent workers, such as temporary, on-call, and  part-time workers, are not covered by some of the laws designed to  protect workers. For example, the Family and Medical Leave Act requires  workers to have worked for the same employer at least 12 months and a  minimum of 1,250 hours during the past 12 months to be covered. These  conditions decrease the likelihood that workers who are temporary, on- call, or part-time will be covered. Although employers are not required to  provide pension or health care plans to their employees, when plans are  offered, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) has rules  that govern which employees must be included in the plans in order to  qualify for special tax treatment. For example, ERISA allows employers to  exclude workers who have worked less than 1,000 hours in a 12-month  period from entering their pension plans. ERISA also allows employers to  exclude employees who have worked for the company less than 3 years as  well as part-time and seasonal employees from the count of employees  who must be included in self-insured medical plans and group term life  insurance plans. As a result, some temporary, on-call, and part-time  workers may not be included in their employers\u2019 benefit plans. These  exclusions are intended to strike a balance between providing benefits to  workers and not be unduly burdening employers. For example, the  exclusions in ERISA were enacted to recognize that it may be impractical  or too costly for employers to include all short-term employees in their  pension plans.", "Some laws have exemptions for portions of certain industries or types of  employers that may disproportionately affect contingent workers. For  example, FLSA exempts all agricultural employers from the overtime pay  requirement and exempts agricultural employers who do not use more  than 500 days of labor in any calendar quarter from the minimum wage  requirement. These exemptions affect some categories of contingent  workers more than standard full-time workers because a greater  proportion of these contingent workers is in the agriculture industry; for  example, an estimated 11 percent of self-employed workers, 2 percent of  on-call workers and day laborers, 2 percent of independent contractors,  and 1 percent of direct-hire temporary workers are employed in  agriculture, compared with 1 percent of standard full-time workers.", "Similarly, the nature of contingent work makes it difficult for some  contingent workers to meet state eligibility requirements for  unemployment insurance. Temporary and part-time workers may not meet  the minimum earnings requirements, which vary by state, and these  workers may have difficulty meeting the rules governing job loss because  they have less flexibility when the circumstances of their jobs change.", "For example, temporary workers who choose this type of work in order to  meet family obligations or to attend school might be more likely to quit if  their employer changed the job location or required them to work different  hours. Nevertheless, they would be ineligible for unemployment insurance  benefits in many states because they voluntarily quit without good cause.  In addition, contingent workers can find it difficult to meet continuing  eligibility requirements.", "Some contingent workers, such as temporary or contract workers, may  also find it difficult to meet the requirements of the National Labor  Relations Act (NLRA) for joining an existing bargaining unit or forming a  new bargaining unit. For example, under the act, temporary workers  wanting to join an existing collective bargaining unit at a work site must  first demonstrate that they have a \u201csufficient community of interest\u201d with  the permanent workers in the bargaining unit. In 2004, the National Labor  Relations Board (NLRB) overturned a decision made in 2000, and required  consent from both the user and supplier employer before temporary  employees could join an existing bargaining unit. The 2004 decision made  it more difficult for temporary and leased employees to join unions and  bargain collectively. Contingent workers may also find it difficult to form  new collective bargaining units. For example, temporary workers and day  laborers may find it difficult to form bargaining units because they do not  work at one location or with one employer long enough to identify with a  particular group of workers and organize a union. In addition, some  worker advocacy groups maintain that contract company workers have  difficulty forming new collective bargaining units because employers that  use contract company workers may cancel contracts and contract with  other companies when workers attempt to unionize."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incorrect Employment Relationship May Result in Lack of Worker Protections", "paragraphs": ["In some cases it is difficult to determine which employer is responsible for  providing workers with workforce protections because some contingent  workers have more than one employer.

Investigators receive classroom training and on- the-job mentoring on the Supreme Court factors and techniques for  applying the factors. In their training, they are taught to identify all the  relevant factors and make a full, balanced assessment of the facts of each  case.", "Investigators may identify possible employee misclassification at different  points during the investigation. According to DOL officials,  misclassification issues may come up during the initial conference with  the employer or during an investigator\u2019s review of records to determine  whether an employer had classified workers as employees or independent  contractors. At the initial conference with the employer, investigators ask  employers about the nature of their work, annual dollar volume of  business, the number of workers, and how workers are paid, and they  request payment documents, such as payroll records, time cards, and W-2  forms. While it is standard practice for investigators to review payroll and  other records related to wages and employment, investigators do not  necessarily review contracts or 1099 forms used to pay independent  contractors unless they have a reason to suspect possible  misclassification.", "Investigators may have reason to suspect misclassification stemming from  the complaint that initiated the case or their knowledge of potential  misclassification in that industry. In these cases, the investigator would  ask employers about whether they contract any work and how they  classify their workers. For example, according to DOL officials, if an  investigator was conducting an investigation of a large drywall employer,  then the investigator would probably spend a large amount of time  pursuing independent contractor issues because misclassification has  been a problem in the past with construction contractors subcontracting  work to drywallers, roofers, electricians, and carpenters. In other cases  where the investigator has no knowledge about potential misclassification,  the employer\u2019s responses at the initial conference may raise questions. For  example, if the employer had millions of dollars in annual business but  only two employees, then the investigator would likely ask further  questions about the employment relationship of any other workers. In  addition, DOL officials told us that investigators compare payroll records  with the work process identified by the employer to see if there are any  gaps. For example, investigators would need to follow up with employers  who describe work processes that required many workers but had no  employees listed on the payroll. Such a scenario could indicate that  employers had misclassified workers as independent contractors who  were not listed on the payroll.", "Investigators may learn about employment relationship when interviewing  workers to verify the employer\u2019s payroll and time records or to identify  workers\u2019 duties in order to determine whether FLSA applies. According to  DOL officials, an investigator would not ask directly whether the worker is  an independent contractor or an employee; instead, an investigator would  ask questions to determine whether the worker is an employee or an  independent contractor. For example, an investigator would ask whether  workers set their own work hours or use their own equipment on the  job\u2014indications that workers may be independent contractors, not  employees.", "Investigators may obtain additional information on employment  relationship while touring an employer\u2019s establishment. During a tour,  investigators can compare their observations about employment  relationship in the work environment to the information from the records  and interviews with employers and workers. Specifically, investigators can  observe control issues, such as whether workers are supervised and  provided with supplies and equipment. For example, if an apartment rental  complex treats its maintenance workers as independent contractors, then  the investigator would observe who provides the plumbing supplies and  paint\u2014the employer or the workers\u2014to help determine whether workers  are independent contractors or employees. Also, a tour can identify  potential misclassification issues for an investigator to follow up on. For  example, if the payroll records show that the employer has 10 employees  but the investigator sees 15 workers during the tour, then the investigator  will conduct further interviews and record review to determine whether  these other 5 workers are employees or independent contractors.", "Because employee misclassification is not a violation of FLSA,  investigators are not required to discuss misclassification identified during  FLSA investigations with employers or to include it in their investigation  report. According to DOL officials, however, an investigator may discuss  misclassification with the employer during the investigation and may note  instances of misclassification in the investigation report. In discussing a  misclassification case with the employer, the investigator would explain  that the workers should be classified as employees, not independent  contractors, and that the employer may be violating other laws  administered by other agencies, such as tax laws or workers\u2019  compensation laws. Specifically, investigators would explain to the  employer how they applied the Supreme Court factors in determining that  the workers were employees, not independent contractors. DOL officials  said that investigators would provide employers with publications and fact  sheets on employment relationship if they identified misclassification  during an investigation. In addition, the investigators may mention  employee misclassification in their final investigation report that  summarizes the facts of the investigation. According to DOL officials, if  the investigators included misclassification in the case report, it would be  mentioned as an underlying reason for a minimum wage or overtime  violation.

DOL investigations have identified FLSA violations associated with  employee misclassification. For example, one misclassification case  involved a valet parking company located in Arizona that provided  services to local restaurants, sports venues, hotels, and theaters. In 2004,  this company paid $66,947 in minimum wage and overtime pay back wages  to 262 employees who had been misclassified as independent contractors.  When reviewing the employment relationship, the DOL investigator found  that the services provided by these workers were integral to the business,  and that the employer had imposed strict policies and procedures to  follow and told them when they would work, where they would work,  what their pay rate would be, and what uniforms they would wear. The  investigator determined that the workers were not required to use  initiative, judgment, or foresight to be successful as independent  contractors; did not have any investment in facilities or equipment; and  were not operating to make a profit.", "Another misclassification case involved a chicken-processing company  based in California that contracted out its deboning operations to a  subcontractor. In 2005, DOL investigators found that the subcontractor  had misclassified as independent contractors the employees he hired to  work at this deboning plant. The subcontractor violated FLSA when he  failed to meet payroll for 2 weeks, pay minimum wages and overtime pay,  and keep adequate payroll records. The subcontractor also illegally  deducted the cost of aprons, gloves, hair nets, and other required  equipment from workers\u2019 paychecks. When the subcontractor went  bankrupt, the contractor agreed to cover the back wages due\u2014$40,000  owed to 59 workers\u2014although the contractor was not legally required to  do so.", "DOL officials told us that their investigators have encountered cases  where employers classified workers as independent contractors instead of  employees to avoid paying proper wages under federal and state wage  laws or to avoid providing benefits under other laws, such as workers\u2019  compensation and unemployment insurance laws. For example, in 2004, a  joint DOL-State of California investigation found that a services company  located in California had misclassified employees and not paid overtime in  accordance with FLSA. The affected workers provided janitorial services  to a major department store chain located in California, Arizona, Nevada,  Texas, and New Mexico. According to DOL officials, the company  contracted out the janitorial work to individuals who were not legitimate  contractors in that, among other things, they did not control the location  or hours of work. These \u201ccontractors\u201d then hired others to do the janitorial  work. As a result of this arrangement, the services company avoided  paying minimum wage, overtime, and other benefits, such as workers\u2019  compensation. In response to the investigation, the company agreed to pay  $1.9 million in back wages to 775 employees.

DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Division posts its  Employment Relationship under FLSA (WH Publication 1297) and fact  sheets that provide information on determining the employment  relationship in applying provisions of FLSA. For example, Fact Sheet 13:  Employment Relationship under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)  outlines the Supreme Court\u2019s factors for determining an employment  relationship under FLSA and is available in several languages, including  Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Thai, and Vietnamese. It also identifies common  problems: (1) construction contractors hire so-called independent  contractors, who in reality should be considered employees because they  do not meet the Supreme Court tests for independence and (2) individuals  who work at home are often improperly considered independent  contractors. Another DOL Web site resource is Employment Laws  Assistance for Workers and Small Businesses (elaws) FLSA Advisor, an  interactive system that allows employers and workers to determine  whether a worker would be considered an employee or an independent  contractor.

FLSA  regulations require that every employer that has employees subject to the  act\u2019s provisions post a notice explaining the act in a prominent and  accessible place at the work site. While DOL relies heavily on complaints  from workers to enforce FLSA, the FLSA workplace poster does not  provide a telephone number for workers or others to call to register  complaints.

To the extent that contingent workers neither  receive health or pension benefits nor qualify for unemployment or  workers\u2019 compensation, they may have to turn to needs-based programs,  such as Medicaid, to make ends meet. To the extent that this occurs, costs  formerly borne by employers may be shifted to federal and state public  assistance budgets.

FLSA requires that an  employer-employee relationship exist for a worker to be covered by the  act\u2019s provisions. FLSA\u2014which provides minimum wage and overtime pay  protections\u2014requires that employers pay those employees covered by the  act at least the minimum wage and pay overtime wages when they work  more than 40 hours a week. The act defines \u201cemployee\u201d broadly as an  individual employed by an employer. The U.S. Supreme Court has  identified certain factors that should be considered in determining  whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor under  FLSA. In general, a worker who meets the FLSA definition of employee is  one who is economically dependent on the business he or she serves. In  contrast, an independent contractor is one who is engaged in a business of  his or her own. The test used to determine whether an employment  relationship exists for FLSA purposes is referred to as the economic  realities test. The court has indicated that in applying this economic  realities test under FLSA, such determinations must consider the  circumstances of the whole activity and cannot be based on isolated  factors or a single characteristic. In enforcing FLSA, DOL uses the  following factors:      The extent to which the worker\u2019s services are an integral  part of the employer\u2019s business    Examples: Does the worker play an integral role in the  business by performing the primary type of work that  the employer performs for their customers? Does the  worker perform a discrete job that is one part of the  business\u2019 overall process of production? Does the  worker supervise any of the company\u2019s employees?", "The permanency of the relationship    Example: How long has the worker worked for the same  company?", "The amount of the worker\u2019s investment in facilities and    Examples: Is the worker reimbursed for any purchases,  materials, or supplies? Does the worker use his or her  own tools or equipment?", "The nature and degree of control by the employer    Examples: Who decides on what hours to be worked?", "Who is responsible for quality control? Does the worker  work for any other company(s)? Who sets the pay rate?", "The worker\u2019s opportunities for profit and loss    Examples: Did the worker make any investments such  as insurance or bonding? Can the worker earn a profit  by performing the job more efficiently or exercising  managerial skill or suffer a loss of capital investment?", "The amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open  market competition with others required for the success  of the claimed independent contractor    Examples: Does the worker perform routine tasks  requiring little training? Does the worker advertise  independently through the Yellow Pages or business  cards? Does the worker have a separate business site?", "In some cases, employers misclassify workers as independent contractors  when they should be classified as employees. Under FLSA, the courts have  examined the issue of misclassification by applying the economic realities  test and making case-by-case determinations as to whether the workers  are employees and thereby covered by the act. For example, a federal  district court recently determined that over 500 delivery workers for  supermarket and drugstore chains had been misclassified as independent  contractors. The court ruled that the companies that had hired these  workers to make deliveries controlled their placement and pay, provided  them with delivery carts to rent and uniforms to purchase, required little  skill to perform the job, and that the work performed constituted an  integral part of the companies\u2019 business. Therefore, the court ruled that  they were employees and entitled to overtime wages under FLSA. In  another case, DOL brought suit on behalf of cable installers against cable  television providers and cable installation companies for overtime  compensation under FLSA. In this case, the court ruled that the employer  did not exhibit the type of control needed to characterize the relationship  as employee-employer, that the workers provided their own van and other  equipment, and that the job required skilled labor. On the basis of these  factors, the court denied the claim and held that the cable installers were  properly classified as independent contractors and not entitled to  protection under FLSA.", "The complexity of issues involving joint employment and misclassification  of employees is illustrated by litigation involving the Microsoft  Corporation. In the late 1980s, Microsoft began to hire what the company  classified as independent contractors to fill many of its full-time  employment vacancies. After the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  determined that these workers were common law employees in 1989 and  1990, Microsoft terminated the employment relationship, set up an  employment agency, and converted these workers into temporary agency  employees. The workers sued Microsoft, and in 1996 the court ruled that  they were employees of the company rather than independent contractors  or temporary agency employees. The court then considered whether or  not the employees were eligible for the employer\u2019s saving and stock  purchase plan benefits under ERISA. The determining factor was the  language included in Microsoft\u2019s plan, which expressly made any common  law employee on the U.S. payroll eligible for benefits. However, while the  court determined that the workers were common law employees, it  directed Microsoft to determine what rights these workers, as common  law employees, had under Microsoft\u2019s ERISA plan. Eventually the parties  entered into a settlement agreement in which Microsoft paid $96.9 million.", "Other cases have held that although workers may have been misclassified,  they still did not qualify for benefits under ERISA plans because they did  not qualify under the language of the plan that excluded certain types of  employees, such as temporary or leased employees. Some employers  amended their ERISA plans in response to the Microsoft decision to limit  participation to workers that the employers classified as employees,  whether or not the excluded workers may later be determined to be  employees by the IRS or courts. The IRS has approved the use of such  language in ERISA plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Size and Characteristics of the Contingent Workforce", "paragraphs": ["This table provides the following information on contingent workers:  growth rates (percentage changes) and changes in the share of the total  workforce (percentage point changes) for 1995-1999, 1999-2005, and 1995- 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Key Laws Designed to Protect Workers", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides a more detailed description of the key laws  designed for workers\u2019 protection and their applicability to members of the  contingent workforce.
