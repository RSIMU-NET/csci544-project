Based on DOD\u2019s infrastructure definition and categories in the bottom-up review report, we identified the program elements in the FYDP that we considered to be associated with infrastructure activities. In our 1995 report, we concluded that, based on our analysis of the 1996 FYDP using the program elements that we considered to be associated with infrastructure activities, the proportion of infrastructure funding in the total defense budget would remain relatively constant through 2001.

Using the FYDP, DOD has clearly identified program elements that fund infrastructure activities and refer to these as \u201cdirect infrastructure.\u201d However, there are parts of the total infrastructure funding that cannot be clearly identified in the FYDP. According to PA&E officials, this is about 20 to 25 percent of DOD\u2019s total infrastructure funding and mostly represents logistics purchases which cannot be specifically identified.", "Since the FYDP is the most comprehensive source of continuous defense resource data, PA&E, with assistance from the Institute for Defense Analyses, sought to define infrastructure programs in terms of FYDP program elements. In June 1995 the Institute issued a manual and a mapping scheme that categorize each of the FYDP program elements as either mission programs or infrastructure programs. Activities and programs that produce the outputs expected of DOD or directly support missions by deploying with the combat forces are classified as mission programs. Activities that provide support services to the mission programs and primarily operate from fixed locations are classified as infrastructure programs. PA&E assigned each infrastructure program element to one of the following eight categories based on the program\u2019s activities: acquisition infrastructure; installation support; central command, control, and communications; force management; central logistics; central medical; central personnel; and central training. These categories are described in appendix II. Central command, control, and communications is a new category since the bottom-up review. The program elements in this category were previously included in the force management category.", "PA&E officials told us that some infrastructure activities and programs could not be clearly identified in the FYDP because their funding is derived from the goods and services they provide to others. For example, the Defense Logistics Agency receives most of its funds from the goods and services it sells to other DOD activities. As a result, the costs of its infrastructure activities are included in all of the other defense activities\u2019 budgets that purchase their goods and services. This situation is common for activities that are included in DBOF. According to the officials, PA&E has estimated a range for the DBOF infrastructure costs funded by mission programs based on data from various DOD financial systems. For the fiscal year 1995 FYDP (1995-1999), PA&E estimated these annual costs to be between $28 billion and $39 billion, or about 20 to 25 percent of the total infrastructure funding.

In fiscal year 1996, intelligence, space, and command, control, and communications programs accounted for $25.2 billion, or 20 percent of mission programs. These programs include installations, facilities, and activities that would not deploy with combat forces but would support those forces. For example, the command, control, and communications mission program was projected to receive $3.6 billion in fiscal year 1996. Over $1 billion was for long-haul communications for the defense communications system and various expenses within the World-Wide Military Command and Control Systems. Although combat forces may link into these systems, the actual systems operate from fixed locations.

Most of the planned decline results from base closures and realignments and reductions in base operation costs and military construction costs. However, any savings resulting from the decline in installation support costs between 1996 and 1998 are offset by the projected reductions in DOD\u2019s total budget.

This is critical, since the savings derived from reducing infrastructure can be used for other purposes, such as to modernize weapon systems or reduce the deficit. Moreover, savings could also help address long-standing financial management problems in DOD. Historically, DOD has encountered problems in putting effective financial management systems in place. Our work has shown that DOD continues to have serious problems in many areas, including accounting for billions of dollars in annual disbursements, failing to identify and disclose potential future government liabilities, failing to protect its assets from fraud, waste, and abuse and being unable to reliably report on the costs of its operations. In order to address these problems, DOD may need to make investments to consolidate and improve the quality and reliability of its financial and accounting systems as well as to upgrade the agency\u2019s financial management personnel. Below, we discuss several examples of our work.", "Our work highlights several actions that could be taken to improve the cost-effectiveness of the DOD depot maintenance program. These actions include using more cross-servicing and public-private competitions and reducing costly excess capacity that exists at intermediate level maintenance units.", "Our work suggests that DOD could reduce costs by adopting commercial inventory management practices for hardware items. For example, DOD inventories of hardware items existing in 1992 are expected to decrease only 20 percent by 1997.

Even with declines in both the defense procurement budget and the civilian acquisition workforce since 1990, the number of acquisition organizations remains relatively constant. Subsequent to our report, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 required DOD to provide a plan to reduce the number of military and civilian personnel in acquisition organizations by 25 percent over 5 years and eliminate duplicative functions among existing acquisition organizations. CBO estimates the 5-year savings (fiscal years 1997-2001) associated with the civilian personnel reductions alone would be approximately $5.5 billion.", "Another option addresses savings for the central logistics infrastructure category. In February 1996, we reported that DOD\u2019s transportation costs are higher than necessary. DOD customers frequently pay prices for transportation services that are double or triple the cost of the basic transportation. Driving these higher costs are the U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s fragmented management processes and its inefficient organizational structure, which includes not only the command headquarters but the Army Military Traffic Management Command, the Navy Military Sealift Command, and the Air Force Air Mobility Command. Salaries and wages alone for the U.S. Transportation Command in fiscal year 1994 were more than $1 billion. Our option illustrates one way to improve the U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s operations by combining functions and eliminating some personnel at the Military Traffic Management Command and Military Sealift Command. Civilian personnel savings associated with this reorganization effort could be $450 million for fiscal years 1997-2001.", "An option for the central medical infrastructure category establishes copayments for care received in military hospitals. Health care received by military beneficiaries in military hospitals and clinics is free. However, military beneficiaries share in the costs of care they obtain from civilian providers. Research has shown that free care leads to greater and unnecessary utilization and, therefore, greater costs. By establishing cost-sharing requirements for care received in military hospitals similar to civilian cost-sharing requirements, 5-year savings for fiscal years 1997-2001 of approximately $1 billion could be achieved.", "Table 6 summarizes our options organized by infrastructure category.

Moreover, DOD\u2019s plan does not reflect leading-edge business practices and, therefore, may require additional consolidations if business process reengineering techniques are used to identify more productive business practices for DOD finance and accounting operations.", "Because DOD\u2019s decision to open 21 new operating locations was not based on current or future operating requirements, customer needs, or leading-edge business practices, other consolidation alternatives could produce substantial infrastructure savings. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Consolidation Task Force showed that savings could occur by retaining the 5 large centers plus 6, 10, or 15 operating locations. The Task Force concluded, however, that 6 new operating locations was the best alternative because it would save more money and allow an optimum consolidation of finance and accounting functions. Based on this and other factors, we recommended that DOD reassess the number of operating locations needed to efficiently perform finance and accounting operations.", "DOD\u2019s subsequent reassessment concluded that 16 rather than 21 operating locations are needed to support its finance and accounting operations. Because of its interpretation of congressional intent, however, DOD continues to support the opening of all 21 locations. We are currently in the process of analyzing DOD\u2019s reassessment of its operating location requirements but have preliminarily concluded that DOD has misinterpreted congressional intent and at a minimum, should not be opening the 5 facilities that it no longer believes are needed. We have not yet done enough work to determine how many, if any, additional operating locations are excess to DOD\u2019s needs. In presenting this option, therefore, we relied on the analysis performed by the DFAS Consolidation Task Force which identified 6 as the optimum number of operating locations.", "Recognizing the costs DOD has incurred to open 16 centers, reducing the number of operating locations from 16 to 6 could achieve savings in several different ways. First, a reduction in the infrastructure would require fewer support and management personnel and related items to operate the locations. Second, military construction funding for sites that would require extensive renovations would not be necessary. Third, in anticipation of the efficiencies and service improvements that would be achieved under DOD\u2019s reengineering and privatization efforts, annual funding could be reduced 10 to 15 percent. If Congress was to direct the Secretary of Defense to reduce the existing 16 locations to 6, as recommended by the DFAS Consolidation Task Force, the following savings could be achieved in civilian personnel and military construction. This represents the optimum consolidation of locations according to the DFAS Consolidation Task Force. The savings estimate assumes that by reducing the number of sites to six, 6,500 civilian personnel positions would be eliminated. This magnitude of personnel reductions can only be attained if DOD achieves the productivity gains it expects from reengineering and privitization/outsourcing initiatives. However, Congress and DOD will need to reach an agreement on the exact number of operating locations and reductions in personnel. Moreover, as we pointed out in our letter, DOD may need to make investments in this area to improve its financial management systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Related GAO Product", "paragraphs": ["DOD Infrastructure: DOD\u2019s Planned Finance and Accounting Structure Is Not Well Justified (GAO/NSIAD-95-127, Sept. 18, 1995)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Option: Cap Funding for the Civil Air Patrol", "paragraphs": ["Operation and Maintenance, Defense-wide (97-0100)", "The Civil Air Patrol is a nonprofit corporation that is comprised of private citizens who assist in national and local emergencies, such as inland search and rescue missions, emergency air transport, counter drug surveillance, and humanitarian airlift missions.

The reorganization has resulted in a need for more, not less, operation and maintenance funding. The reason for this is that the number of employees (about 250 before the reorganization) was not significantly reduced and state liaisons, who were once paid from the military pay appropriation, are now paid from operation and maintenance funds.", "After the reorganization is complete, there will be 75 Air Force military and civilian employees supporting the patrol.

Transportation processes were found to be fragmented, inefficient, and costly. Traffic management processes and automated systems were developed independently for each mode of transportation. The entire defense transportation system was built along service and modal lines. Furthermore, no one DOD transportation agency was responsible for handling or managing all facets of cargo movement.", "In 1987, after the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 urged that actions be taken to unify transportation management, the Secretary of Defense established the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). USTRANSCOM was created as a unified combatant command for transportation missions; combining the missions, responsibilities, and forces of the defense transportation single managers. The managers were the Army\u2019s Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), which is responsible for managing land transportation, military traffic, and water port operations; the Navy\u2019s Military Sealift Command (MSC), which is responsible for sealift; and the Air Force\u2019s Air Mobility Command (AMC), which is responsible for airlift.", "At first, mission responsibility was restricted to times of war or conflicts. But in 1992, USTRANSCOM\u2019s mission was expanded to cover both wartime and peacetime, and MTMC, MSC, and AMC, though they remained major commands of their respective services, became component commands of USTRANSCOM. In addition, USTRANSCOM was given control of all transportation assets, except for those that are service-unique or theater-assigned.", "A recent study by USTRANSCOM concluded that transportation process fragmentation remains. GAO\u2019s recent report concludes that traffic management processes perpetuate fragmentation, typically along service and transportation modal lines, much as they were before USTRANSCOM was created. The report also indicates that even with the establishment of USTRANSCOM, recommendations to change the organizational structure have not been implemented.", "This extensive infrastructure is costly. Transportation services that the military component commands have traditionally provided, such as port handling and intermodal transfers, are being handled primarily by commercial carriers. Component field offices are part of an antiquated system that moves cargo by separate modes and requires on-site personnel at modal transfer points. For example, a military customer is charged $2,624 for a shipment from New Jersey to Rotterdam, Netherlands; yet a commercial carrier charges $1,553 for the shipment. The added cost to the customer of $1,071 (which is 69 percent of the carrier\u2019s $1,553 charge) represents the overhead amount charged to the customer.", "Opportunities exist to reduce the defense transportation infrastructure and improve the efficiency of cargo traffic management operations. Combining common-user transportation functions and positions under the direct command and control of a single manager, USTRANSCOM, would eliminate unnecessary overhead, duplication of functions, and overlapping responsibilities. Ultimately, streamlining the command structure would reduce the costs of operations being passed to customers. Under such a realignment, service-unique functions would remain with the services. Likewise, unique transportation readiness requirements would be reported separately and funded directly to the services.", "Nearly 90 percent of defense cargo moves by domestic commercial motor carriers during peacetime and noncontingency operations. Additional opportunities for outsourcing include use of direct booking during noncontingency operations whereby customers book directly with carriers and substantially decrease the involvement of government traffic management; use of commercial freight forwarders, not government traffic managers; employment of third-party logistics firms to handle documentation, billing, and payment; and use of existing commercial system capabilities for in-transit and total asset visibility needs. By increasing the use of outsourcing to satisfy peacetime requirements, USTRANSCOM and its customers could achieve additional cost savings as well as dedicate resources to the critical role of strategic planning.", "Various options exist to achieve defense transportation infrastructure savings. Fixing the organizational structure is a mandatory first step to substantially reduce costs. A logical way, though not the only one, would be to take the following steps.", "First, place the 362 Defense Business Operations Fund Transportation MSC staff worldwide together with MTMC.

MTMC\u2019s Field Operating Activity and MSC\u2019s Central Technical Activity would be consolidated. One office would be responsible for all contract negotiations and administration, comptroller/budget activities, litigation/legal activities. And, all MSC field staff functions currently at area commands would be merged with MTMC area command staff. In fiscal year 1994, MSC\u2019s Defense Business Operations Fund Transportation staff costs were $54 million.", "Second, close MTMC continental United States area commands at Bayonne, New Jersey, and at Oakland, California. These commands are not justifiable because of budgetary pressures. Labor costs for these two commands alone in fiscal year 1994 were $65 million, $29 million for Eastern Area-Bayonne (civilian and military), $12 million for Eastern Area-Bayonne (military garrison-Bayonne), $21 million for Western Area-Oakland (civilian and military), and $3 million for Western Area-Oakland (military garrison-Oakland)", "Third, eliminate MTMC overseas area commands.

In contrast, students at the University enter active military service as medical students, receive the pay and benefits of an officer at the O-1 level, and incur a 10-year service obligation. In 1994, 155 medical students graduated from the University.", "GAO\u2019s analysis shows that the University provides a medical education that compares well with that of other U.S. medical schools. Traditional measures of quality place the University within the mid-range of medical schools nationwide and its graduates at or above other military physicians. In addition, the University provides education and training for other health care and related professions and engages in research, consultation, and archival activities. These activities, which do not directly contribute to the education of military physicians, involve University faculty and staff. DOD would likely continue to conduct these activities even if the University were closed.", "University graduates begin their military medical careers with more readiness training than their peers, but the significance of the additional training is unclear. Due to the absence of objective measures, no conclusive evidence exists that University graduates are better prepared to meet the needs of military medicine than their civilian-educated peers. The services have not assessed the impact of readiness training, and a thorough assessment is needed to determine the type and amount of such training that military physicians need.", "GAO\u2019s analysis shows that on a per graduate basis, the University is the most expensive source of military physicians when considering DOD costs and total federal costs. With DOD education and retention costs of about $3.3 million, the cost of a University graduate is more than 2 times greater than the $1.5 million cost for a regular scholarship program graduate.", "When costs are distributed over the expected years of military physicians\u2019 service, the University remains more costly when only DOD costs are considered, but it is nearly equal to the cost of the regular scholarship program and lower than the cost of the deferred program when total federal costs are considered. This difference occurs because University graduates are expected to have much longer military careers and the University receives much less non-DOD federal support than civilian medical schools.", "Given the changes in operational scenarios and DOD\u2019s approach for delivering peacetime health care, new assessments of the military\u2019s physician needs and the means to acquire and retain such physicians are needed. For example, if DOD continues to need a cadre of experienced career physicians, alternative strategies, such as an additional scholarship option with a longer service obligation, could be considered as a potentially less expensive way to increase the length of selected military physicians\u2019 careers.
