GAO was asked to evaluate the per capita methodology for profiling physicians--a method which measures a patient's resource use over a fixed period of time and attributes that resource use to physicians--in order to assist the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) with the development of a physician feedback approach. In response, this report examines (1) the extent to which physicians in selected specialties show stable practice patterns and how beneficiary utilization of services varies by physician resource use level; (2) factors to consider in developing feedback reports on physicians' performance, including per capita resource use; and (3) the extent to which feedback reports may influence physician behavior. GAO focused on four medical specialties and four metropolitan areas chosen for their geographic diversity and range in average Medicare spending per beneficiary. To identify considerations for developing a physician feedback system, GAO reviewed the literature and interviewed officials from health plans and specialty societies. Further, GAO drew upon literature and interviews to develop an illustration of how per capita measures could be included in a physician feedback report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Using 2005 and 2006 Medicare claims data and a per capita methodology, GAO found that specialist physicians showed considerable stability in resource use despite high patient turnover. This stability suggests that per capita resource use is a reasonable approach for profiling specialist physicians because it reflects distinct patterns of a physician's resource use, not the particular population of beneficiaries seen by a physician in a given year. GAO also found that our per capita method can differentiate specialists' patterns of resource use with respect to different types of services, such as institutional services, which were a major factor in beneficiaries' resource use. In particular, patients of high resource use physicians used more institutional services than patients of low resource use physicians. GAO identified four key considerations in developing feedback reports on physician performance. To illustrate how per capita measures could be included in a physician feedback report, we developed a mock report containing three types of per capita measures. Although the literature suggested that feedback alone has no more than a moderate influence on physicians' behavior, the potential influence of feedback from CMS on Medicare costs may be greater, in part because of the relatively large share of physicians' practice revenues that Medicare typically represents. CMS reviewed a draft of this report and broadly agreed with our findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, evidence has mounted that the Medicare program is  unsustainable in its present form. Because of rising health care costs and  the aging of baby boomers into eligibility for Medicare, future program  spending is projected to consume an increasing share of the government\u2019s  resources. In their 2009 annual report, the Medicare Trustees projected  that Medicare expenditures, which reached $468 billion in 2008, will  increase in future years at a faster pace than the overall economy, rising  from 3.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2008 to 11.4 percent by 2083.", "Physicians play a central role in the generation of health care  expenditures, through both the services they provide and the services they  order, including hospital admissions, diagnostic tests, and referrals to  other physicians. The evidence suggests that some of the spending for  services provided and ordered by physicians may not be warranted. For  example, the wide variation in Medicare spending for physician services\u2014 unrelated to beneficiary health status or outcomes\u2014indicates that health  needs alone do not determine spending.", "Consistent with physicians\u2019 central role in providing and ordering services  and their influence on the amount of spending for patient services,  physician groups, insurers, and Medicare officials have turned to profiling  as a possible tool to help identify and contain overuse of services and the  resulting high expenditures. In profiling, the resource use of a physician\u2019s  patients is compared to a benchmark. In our previous report on profiling,  Medicare: Focus on Physician Practice Patterns Can Lead to Greater  Program Efficiency, we profiled generalist physicians and found that in  each of the 12 metropolitan areas we studied there were physicians who,  relative to their peers in the same area, treated a disproportionate share of  overly expensive patients. In that report we used a profiling methodology  known as per capita, which measures per patient resource use for a  defined population over a fixed period of time and attributes that resource  use to physicians. We recommended that the Administrator of the Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) develop a profiling system to  identify individual physicians with inefficient practice patterns and  provide incentives for physicians to improve the efficiency of care they  provide. In our subsequent testimony on physician feedback to the  Subcommittee on Health of the House Ways and Means Committee we  stated that providing feedback to physicians on their practice patterns  could be a promising step toward encouraging efficiency in Medicare. The  Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has also  recommended providing feedback to physicians on their resource use. In  its reports, MedPAC has explored an episode-based profiling methodology,  which measures resource use for treating a particular episode of illness\u2014 for example, a stroke or heart attack\u2014and attributes that resource use to  physicians.", "Following the issuance of our report and subsequent testimony, Congress  passed the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008  (MIPPA), which directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services  (HHS) to develop a program to provide physicians confidential feedback  on the Medicare resources used to provide care to Medicare beneficiaries.  MIPPA gave HHS the flexibility to measure resource use on a per capita  basis, an episode basis, or both. In response to this mandate, CMS is  currently testing both profiling methodologies in its Physician Resource  Use Measurement and Reporting Program. MIPPA also directed us to  submit a report to Congress on CMS\u2019s physician feedback program by  2011.", "In your letter of August 22, 2007, you pointed out that both the per capita  and episode-based methods could be used to identify inefficient  physicians, but noted that less is known about the per capita method. At  that time, you asked us to evaluate the per capita method for profiling  physicians in order to assist CMS with the development of a physician  feedback approach for Medicare. This report explores the use of a per  capita method to profile physicians based on their patients\u2019 level of  resource use, and discusses the development and influence of feedback  reports. Specifically, this report examines (1) the extent to which  physicians in selected specialties show stable practice patterns and how  beneficiary utilization of services varies by physician resource use level;  (2) factors to consider in developing feedback reports on physicians\u2019  performance, including per capita resource use; and (3) the extent to  which feedback reports may influence physician behavior.", "We focused our analysis on four diverse specialties\u2014a medical specialty  (cardiology), a diagnostic specialty (diagnostic radiology), a primary care  specialty (internal medicine), and a surgical specialty (orthopedic  surgery); and four metropolitan areas\u2014Miami, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.;  Pittsburgh, Pa.; and Sacramento, Calif. We chose these areas for their  geographic diversity, range in average Medicare spending per beneficiary,  and number of physicians in each of the four specialties. We limited our  study to physicians who participate in Medicare fee-for-service (FFS). Our  results are not generalizable to other geographic areas and specialties.", "To measure beneficiaries\u2019 resource use, we first adjusted for beneficiaries\u2019  health conditions, because sick beneficiaries are expected to use more  resources than healthy beneficiaries. Using Hierarchical Condition  Category (HCC) and expenditure data obtained from CMS, we estimated a  risk adjustment model that uses the same 70 HCCs as the model CMS uses  to set managed care capitation rates. HCCs are a way of summarizing an  individual\u2019s diagnoses into major medical conditions, such as vascular  disease or severe head injury. Given beneficiaries\u2019 HCCs during the year,  we used our model to estimate Medicare\u2019s expected annual expenditures  for services provided to the beneficiaries in our study. Based on these  expected expenditures, we placed beneficiaries into 25 discrete risk  categories. Within each risk category and metropolitan area, we ranked  beneficiaries from 1 to 100 by their total annual Medicare FFS  expenditures such that the average beneficiary in a given risk category and  metropolitan area had a rank of 50. We used this rank as our risk-adjusted  measure of beneficiaries\u2019 resource use.", "Our measure of physicians\u2019 resource use is derived from the resource use  of their patients. For all physicians in our study, we calculated the  average rank of their patients. We then used this average to rank  physicians within the same metropolitan area and specialty on a scale of   1 to 100. This measure reflects how expensive a physician\u2019s patients are  compared to the patients of other physicians in the same specialty and  area after adjusting for differences in patient health status.", "To examine the stability of physicians\u2019 resource use from a year-to-year  perspective, we analyzed data for 2005 and 2006. We divided physicians\u2019  and beneficiaries\u2019 resource use into quintiles and examined which  physicians and beneficiaries stayed in the same resource use quintile from  2005 to 2006 and which ones did not. We also examined the degree of  turnover in the patients seen by physicians between 2005 and 2006. In  addition, we used the physician quintiles to examine how beneficiary  utilization of selected services in 2006 varied by physician resource use  quintile.", "We concluded that the information on Medicare claims that we used in  this report was sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our analysis,  because it is a record of Medicare\u2019s payments to health care providers. We  obtained beneficiaries\u2019 FFS expenditures from claims information, and we  used data from CMS files containing enrollment and institutional status in  order to determine whether beneficiaries were eligible for our study. CMS  provided us with a file containing beneficiaries\u2019 HCCs, which we used to  estimate their expected expenditures. We obtained physicians\u2019 specialties  from Medicare physician files that CMS uses to administer the program  and set payment rates. CMS and its contractors closely monitor these files,  so they are generally considered reliable. In addition, we interviewed  relevant CMS officials concerning the data and consulted data  documentation maintained by CMS. We consider the data sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To determine factors to consider in developing reports to provide  feedback to physicians on their performance, including their per capita  resource use, and the extent to which feedback reports may influence  physician behavior, we reviewed selected literature and interviewed  experts. To identify relevant literature, we searched 31 databases,  including MEDLINE and Science Citation Index, using terms such as  \u201cphysician performance feedback,\u201d for journal articles and other  documents published between January 1, 2000, and February 13, 2009.  From reference lists in documents identified during that search, we  identified additional documents that met our criteria. We selected for  review three types of documents: (1) meta-analyses, reviews, or scans of  the literature on the effectiveness of providing performance feedback to  physicians; (2) evaluations of various efforts to provide performance  feedback to physicians; and (3) documents that provided guidance from  experts on methods for providing performance feedback to physicians. In  addition to reviewing selected literature, we conducted interviews with  officials of four specialty societies to identify specialty-specific  perspectives and concerns, and to solicit officials\u2019 comments on a mock  feedback report we designed. We also conducted interviews with officials  of the five health insurers with the highest revenues in 2007 about their  experiences with feedback reports.", "There are several limitations to our findings. Our findings cannot be  generalized to other areas or specialties. We also restricted our scope to  individual physicians and did not analyze group practices. Most  importantly, we did not pilot our mock report, which illustrates how per  capita measures could be included in a physician feedback report, or test  it by giving physicians feedback based on actual resource use.  Consequently, we are unable to evaluate how helpful it would be to  physicians and, particularly, whether it has potential for increasing  physicians\u2019 efficiency.", "We conducted our work from February 2008 to September 2009 in  accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that  are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and  perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to  meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work.

Accounting for  differences in patient health status, a process sometimes referred to as  risk-adjustment, is an important and challenging aspect of physician  profiling.

Both the selected literature we reviewed and the officials we  interviewed supported including measures of quality along with measures  of cost, and ensuring that measures are actionable by providing  information that can help physicians improve their performance. The  officials we interviewed were divided as to whether these measures should  reflect physicians\u2019 performance at the individual level or the group level.", "Quality measures. All five of the insurers we contacted were profiling  physicians in terms of quality and cost, and four of the five had adopted a  model code for physician ranking programs that called for rankings to be  based on quality as well as cost. Most of the specialty society officials we  interviewed also called for the inclusion of quality measures in physician  feedback reports, and some cautioned that focusing solely on costs could  create perverse incentives\u2014for example, encouraging physicians to  reduce inappropriately the level of care provided to patients. The lack of  widely accepted, claims-based quality measures for some specialties has  limited the number of specialties some insurers profile. For example, at  the time of our interview, one insurer was profiling physicians in only one  specialty (cardiology) while planning to begin profiling other specialties  within a year.", "Actionable measures. According to one research report we reviewed,  little research has been done to determine how the reporting of global  scores\u2014such as an overall per capita cost rank\u2014influences physician  behavior, but experts on physician profiling and a broad array of  stakeholders, including physicians and insurance company officials,  agreed that performance data should be disaggregated into enough  categories to enable physicians to identify practice patterns to change.  According to some profiling experts, resource use reports must pinpoint  physicians\u2019 overuse and misuse of resources, and identify practices that  add costs but do not improve desired outcomes. Similarly, specialty  society officials we interviewed emphasized the importance of including  measures that focus on areas in which the physician has control.", "Individual versus group measures. Another measurement  consideration is whether physicians in group practices should be profiled  as individuals or as a group. The insurers we contacted took varying  approaches. In some cases, the approach was driven by contracting  arrangements, with insurers constructing group profiles for physicians  with whom they had group contracts. One insurance company official  pointed out that profiling at the group level allows more physicians to be  profiled, as it increases the data available to construct a profile. Another  official advocated profiling at the individual level because he believes  physicians are more interested in assessments of individual performance.  Officials of the four specialty societies generally saw some merit to both  approaches, but some underscored the difficulty of identifying group  affiliations or noted that groups are not necessarily homogeneous enough  for a group assessment to be appropriate.", "Comparative benchmarks. One consideration addressed by multiple  publications we reviewed was the kind of benchmark to which physicians\u2019  performance should be compared. For example, a physician\u2019s  performance may be compared to (1) an evidence-based standard, (2) a  standard based on professional judgment, such as the consensus standards  endorsed by the National Quality Forum, or (3) to a statistical norm, such  as the average for a physician\u2019s peers locally or nationally.", "Although studies we reviewed offered conflicting evidence as to whether  including peer comparisons in physician feedback reports increases their  effectiveness, some profiling experts and specialty society officials believe  comparative information is useful and of interest to physicians. In the  literature we reviewed, for example, one profiling expert suggested that  such comparisons can motivate behavior change by taking advantage of  physicians\u2019 desire to perform at least as well as their peers; another stated  that performance statistics are not meaningful to physicians without peer  comparisons.", "A physician\u2019s peer group can be defined in various ways. According to one  study, some organizations that provide performance feedback to  physicians have found comparisons within specialty and locality most  useful to and most frequently requested by physicians. Representatives of  some of these organizations said physicians find local information more  relevant because it reflects the practice patterns of their geographic area.  All five insurers we contacted compare physicians to others in the same  market and specialty; one of the five also compares physicians to peers  nationwide on some measures. In contrast, officials of all four specialty  societies recommended comparisons at the national level, with officials of  one society stating that there is no scientific basis for regional variations in  practice patterns. There was less agreement about whether physicians  should be compared to others in their specialty or to a more narrowly  defined group. Officials of one specialty society advocated comparisons at  the subspecialty level in recognition of the variation in resource use  patterns among subspecialists. Another official pointed out that such  comparison groups could be difficult to define because physicians in some  specialties tend to have multiple subspecialties. Because views differ on  appropriate comparison groups, one hospital-owned healthcare alliance  plans to incorporate in its physician reports a customizable feature that  will allow users to select the peer comparison they wish to see.", "Comparisons to physicians\u2019 own past performance (trend data) are  commonly presented in feedback reports, and the majority of physicians  surveyed in one study found these comparisons useful."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Report Design", "paragraphs": ["The selected literature we reviewed offered little hard evidence on how  feedback reports should be designed to engage physicians\u2019 interest or to  prove their comprehension of the material.

The cost efficiency page presented average cost per episode of  care by service category for the physician and the physician\u2019s peer group,  as well as the ratio of the two, in both tabular and graphic form. The  effectiveness page presented process-of-care measures for selected  conditions, including cardiovascular disease and asthma. Company  officials said summary reports were limited to two pages to accommodate  physicians\u2019 attention spans and that the two sets of measures were  presented separately to discourage attempts to link the two. Specialty  society officials agreed reports should be short\u2014most proposed one to  two pages\u2014and strongly recommended that information be presented  graphically to the extent possible.

None of the studies we  reviewed directly addressed this issue, but all of the specialty society  officials we interviewed advised sending reports to all or nearly all  physicians, rather than just to poor performers. They gave several reasons:  to provide positive recognition to physicians who are performing well; to  avoid singling out certain physicians as poor performers, especially on the  basis of excess costs over which they have little control; and to create  opportunities for voluntary peer-to-peer learning among physicians who  are at different points along the performance spectrum. Similarly, all three  of the insurers that routinely issued feedback reports sent them to all  physicians for whom they had performance measures.", "Frequency of reporting. According to one book we reviewed,  organizations that provide feedback to physicians should do so more than  once a year to give physicians an opportunity to improve their  performance in a timely manner. However, because of the time needed to  gather sufficient data to identify trends and patterns of performance, many  organizations provide feedback no more than twice a year. Of the two  insurers that told us how frequently they issued feedback reports, one did  so annually and the other at least every 6 months. Officials of the latter  company said the frequency of their reporting was limited by the number  of claims in their dataset and suggested that CMS would not face the same  limitations.", "Hardcopy versus electronic dissemination. Reports can be  disseminated in hardcopy through various channels, such as the mail, or  electronically, through e-mail or a Web site. One literature scan we  reviewed cited certain advantages of electronic formats such as Web- based applications. Specifically, they allow users to organize information  as they choose and are well suited to presenting data from the general to  the specific, which facilitates information processing. Although this report  noted some concerns about physicians\u2019 access to the Internet, according  to a report based on a national survey of physicians in December 2002 and  January 2003, almost all respondents said they had Internet access, and  most said they considered it important for patient care.", "Of the three insurers that routinely issued feedback reports, two issued  them electronically and one issued them in hardcopy. Officials of the latter  company said that staff typically hand-delivered the reports to physicians  during on-site visits in order to discuss the results. Officials of most of  the specialty societies we contacted did not advocate one dissemination  mode over the other, but some noted that organizations that issue reports  electronically must confront certain challenges, such as ensuring that  security features do not make access difficult, addressing the lack of high- speed Internet service in some areas, and determining whether to send  reports by e-mail or to instruct physicians to access them on the Internet.

Two important considerations are where to provide  information about methodology\u2014whether in the report itself or through  some other mechanism, such as a Web page\u2014and how much technical  detail to provide. Some of the insurers we contacted provide information  on-line about their profiling methodologies, including details about  measures, attribution of care to physicians, risk adjustment, and statistical  issues. In addition, some of the officials we interviewed said that company  staff will meet with physicians to explain the profiling methodology, if  requested. For example, officials of one company said that it has on staff  four profiling experts, mostly nurses, in addition to about 20 medical  directors who can answer physicians\u2019 questions.", "Specialty society officials we interviewed highlighted a potential trade-off  between providing enough information in the report to persuade  physicians of the validity of the measures and keeping the report concise  enough to maintain physicians\u2019 interest. All of the officials we interviewed  agreed that physicians should have access to details about the  methodology; some suggested this information might best be disseminated  through a Web site. Explaining how the data are risk-adjusted to account  for differences in physicians\u2019 patient populations was cited by specialty  society officials as particularly important.", "Data. Another consideration is ensuring transparency with regard to the  data used in profiling\u2014making patient-level detail available so physicians  can reconcile performance measures with their own information about  their practices. All five of the health insurers we contacted provided  opportunities for physicians to examine patient-level data and file appeals  before results are made public, although their processes or policies for  doing so varied (see table 6).", "Officials of one of the two insurers that made detailed data available on- line said their company previously sent hardcopy reports to physicians,  but learned from medical office managers that they would prefer an on- line format that could be manipulated to facilitate physician comparisons.  Officials of the other insurer said that their company planned to make the  data available in a manipulatable format soon. Most of the specialty  society officials we interviewed agreed that patient-level data should be  made available to physicians, but some predicted that few physicians  would access them.

To provide further context, we also  included per capita measures showing how the average Medicare costs of  patients the physician treated at least once were distributed among service  categories, and the percentage of those costs that were for services  directly provided by the physician to whom the report is directed. We kept  the mock report under two pages and included minimal text, while  ensuring transparency by indicating the availability of methodology details  and supporting data.

However, the potential  influence of feedback from CMS regarding Medicare costs is uncertain,  and may be greater than that of feedback from other sources, because  Medicare reimbursement typically represents a larger share of physicians\u2019  practice revenues than that from other insurers.", "In general, studies examining the effect of feedback on physicians\u2019  behavior have found it to have a small to moderate effect. Factors that  appear to influence the effectiveness of feedback include its source,  frequency, and intensity. For example, one review of the literature  concluded that physicians were more likely to be influenced by reports  from a source they expected to continue monitoring their performance.  This review also found that repeated feedback over a period of several  years may be more likely to get physicians\u2019 attention. Another review  reported that the intensity of the feedback appeared to influence its  effectiveness. The review cited individual, written feedback containing  information about costs or numbers of tests, but no personal incentives, as  among the least intensive, and therefore likely to be among the least  effective approaches.", "Consistent with the literature we reviewed, most of the insurance  company officials we interviewed questioned whether providing  performance feedback to physicians would have a significant impact on  the physicians\u2019 behavior in the absence of other incentives. While all five  insurers profiled physicians, none used the results solely to provide  feedback. Officials of four of the five insurance companies said that to  affect physicians\u2019 behavior, profiling results must be made public, thus  influencing patients\u2019 choice of physicians, or linked to monetary  incentives, as in pay-for-performance arrangements. However, officials of  one company disagreed, stating that feedback alone can affect physicians\u2019  behavior if the reports show how they rank against their peers and make  clear what behavior they need to change to improve their efficiency. These  officials also said that the impact of feedback could depend on the size of  physicians\u2019 practices and whether they have the resources to review the  reports and the management structure to affect changes.", "Whether the experiences of private insurers or the lessons from the  literature on the influence of feedback will hold in the case of the  Medicare program is uncertain. A survey conducted in 2004-2005 found  that, for most physicians, Medicare represented more than one-quarter of  practice revenue, and for 17 percent of physicians, the proportion was  more than one-half. Because physicians typically contract with a dozen  or more health insurance plans, few, if any, of these plans are likely t o  represent as large a share of physicians\u2019 practice revenue as Medicare.  Hence, the impact of feedback from CMS might be greater than that from  other sources. In addition, one profiling expert suggested that physicians  might expect feedback from CMS to be only the first step in efforts to  influence physicians\u2019 behavior\u2014to be followed, for example, by public  reporting of profiling results. This perspective comports with  recommendations in our earlier report. providing feedback on a confidential basis would be an appropriate first  step. One said it would allow time to test the profiling methodology and  gauge physicians\u2019 reactions; the other said it would provide an opportunity  for physicians to vet the measures and identify any errors.", "See GAO-07-307. suggestions for enhancing its effectiveness. Other suggestions can be  drawn from the literature we reviewed. These suggestions included:    providing advance notice of feedback reports (through presentations,  letters, or other communications) to help ensure that physicians open and  read the reports;   working through credible intermediaries, such as medical societies or  locally prominent physicians, to assure physicians that the feedback  process is reasonable and legitimate;    providing opportunities for physicians to discuss the reports through  videoconferences, teleconferences, or on-line discussion groups; and   offering in-person follow up, possibly drawing on the resources of the  Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations.", "Involving physicians in the development of a feedback system may also  enhance its effectiveness. One literature scan concluded that physician  involvement in system design was vital for obtaining physician buy-in.  Information from insurers suggested that, although physicians may not  always be involved in initial development of feedback systems, their  feedback can prompt modifications. Some insurance officials we  interviewed described an iterative process involving ongoing  communication with physicians and continuous modification of reports  and systems. For example, officials of one insurance company said that  the company did not seek initial input from physicians\u2014in the belief that  they would not have been able to provide much input without a complete  understanding of the data and methodology\u2014but took into account  physicians\u2019 responses to earlier, less formal systems.
