The deepwater acquisition strategy is unique and untried for a project of this magnitude. It carries many risks that could potentially cause significant schedule delays and cost increases. The project faces risks in the following four areas: (1) planning the project around annual funding levels far above what the administration has told the Coast Guard it can expect to receive, (2) keeping costs under control in the contract's later years, (3) ensuring that procedures and personnel are in place for managing and overseeing the contractor once the contract is awarded, and (4) minimizing potential problems with developing unproven technology.

Our assessments of the progress the Coast Guard has made in addressing these risks are based on reviews of many Coast Guard documents pertaining to the Deepwater Project and capital planning in general, as well as numerous detailed discussions with Coast Guard staff. Throughout this process, we brought our concerns to the Coast Guard\u2019s attention as soon as possible to increase the opportunity for useful exchange of information and, where necessary, timely corrective action.

In 1998, we reported that the service life of the Coast Guard\u2019s deepwater ships and aircraft might be much longer than the Coast Guard originally estimated in its 1995 analysis. We recommended that the Coast Guard develop additional information on the remaining service life of ships and aircraft. In 1998, the Coast Guard determined that the service life of the various aircraft classes could be extended by about 11 to 28 years over original estimates, assuming that increased maintenance and upgrades occur. In addition, by January 2001, the Coast Guard had issued an updated analysis that extended the service life of two of the four ship classes by an additional 5 years, assuming that increased maintenance and upgrades occur.  The Coast Guard provided this information to its contractors so that they could use it in developing their proposals.", "In December 1999, an interagency task force on the roles and missions of the Coast Guard reported that recapitalization of the Coast Guard\u2019s deepwater capability is a near-term national priority and endorsed the Deepwater Project\u2019s process and timeline. Although our earlier work took issue with the Coast Guard\u2019s initial analysis of how soon its deepwater assets would need to be replaced, we do not now take issue with the Coast Guard\u2019s position that it needs to modernize these assets, especially due to the additional studies completed since our 1998 report. Our congressional directive in this report has been to examine the acquisition approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Acquisition Approach for the Deepwater Project", "paragraphs": ["The acquisition approach for the Deepwater Project is innovative. Rather than using the traditional approach of replacing an individual class of ships or aircraft, the Coast Guard has adopted a \u201csystem-of-systems\u201d approach intended to integrate ships, aircraft, sensors, and communication links together as a system to accomplish mission objectives more effectively. The Coast Guard expects this approach will both improve the effectiveness of deepwater operations and reduce operating costs.", "The project has two basic phases\u2014a design phase (called \u201cconcept exploration\u201d and known as phase 1) and a final proposal preparation and procurement phase (called \u201cdemonstration and validation/full-scale development\u201d and known as phase 2). Phase 1 began in March 1998. As part of this phase, the Coast Guard contracted with three competing teams of contractors to conceive and begin designing a proposed deepwater system. Each proposal is to be based on meeting a set of performance specifications developed by the Coast Guard. Each team was instructed to develop its proposal on a funding stream of $300 million for the first year and $500 million annually until the project is completed. These amounts are in constant 1998 dollars; actual funding would be higher to account for inflation. Phase 1 ends with each team\u2019s development of a proposed deepwater concept, the functional design for which will be 80-percent complete.", "In phase 2, which begins in June 2001, the Coast Guard plans to issue a request for proposals (RFP) to the three industry teams to develop final proposals. The current schedule calls for these proposals to be completed and submitted to the Coast Guard during the last quarter of fiscal year 2001. The Coast Guard will evaluate which proposal provides best value for the government as gauged mainly by a combination of improvements in operational effectiveness and minimizing total ownership costs.  Other evaluation factors include the technical feasibility of the proposed design and the management capability of the systems integrator.", "When the deepwater contract is awarded early in 2002, the contract will actually be between the Coast Guard and the prime contractor, known as the \u201csystems integrator,\u201d of the winning contracting team. This systems integrator will be responsible for ensuring that each ship, aircraft, or other equipment is delivered on time and in accordance with agreed to prices. The systems integrator will also be called on to deliver the complete deepwater system in compliance with the Coast Guard\u2019s system performance specifications. The Coast Guard adopted this approach because it does not believe it has the technical expertise or the resources to be a systems integrator. Also, the Coast Guard believes that a team of contractors led by a systems integrator would provide the best method of acquiring a set of ships, aircraft, and other equipment and would optimize improvements in operational effectiveness and total ownership costs. This contracting approach could thus result in a long-term contractual arrangement with a single contractor and its team of subcontractors.", "The Coast Guard plans to have an initial 5-year contract with the systems integrator. The systems integrator would receive a base award for management and system integration services. Assuming the project proceeds as planned, task and delivery orders for deepwater equipment would be issued by the Coast Guard in accordance with the systems integrator\u2019s implementation schedule. If the performance of the systems integrator is satisfactory for each award-term contract, the Coast Guard plans to award follow-on, award-term contracts (as many as five for successive 5-year, award-term contracts) with the same systems integrator.

The contracting approach the Coast Guard has selected is not easily adaptable to lower levels of funding without stretching the schedule and increasing costs. However, there are signs that funding levels may be lower than the planned amount. Although the administration\u2019s budget request for the Deepwater Project for fiscal year 2002 will be about 10 percent less than the project\u2019s planned first-year funding, the average shortfall for fiscal years 2003 to 2006 is about 20 percent. Moreover, much of the funding for fiscal year 2002 is from the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act (P.L. 105-277), a source that will not be available after this year unless the act is extended.", "Capital funding for the Coast Guard is in competition with many other potential uses of federal funds within the Coast Guard itself, DOT as a whole, and other federal agencies. To accommodate the Deepwater Project, the Coast Guard is proposing to limit spending on its other ongoing capital projects to levels far below where they have been in decades. Given these various budgetary pressures, it appears advisable to have contractors develop their plans around a lesser amount. The Coast Guard\u2019s approach, however, is inextricably tied to the more optimistic option.

Adjustments that may be needed include revising the implementation plan for delivering equipment, renegotiating prices for deepwater equipment, and negotiating new cost and performance baselines with the systems integrator. Such adjustments would not only be costly; but, they could also slow the schedule to the point that (1) total ownership costs would rise and (2) advantages projected in the contractor\u2019s proposal, such as improvements in operational effectiveness, would not materialize. At the extreme, funding shortfalls would affect the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to proceed with the contract as well as the agency\u2019s ability to perform its deepwater missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administration\u2019s Funding Proposals Signal Caution About Whether Projected Funding Will Be Available", "paragraphs": ["The decision on funding the Deepwater Project rests ultimately with the Congress, but because this decision has yet to be made, we used the administration\u2019s budget proposal for the Coast Guard (as contained in the budget documents prepared by OMB) as a starting point for analyzing the funding issue. OMB\u2019s budget targets for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 do not propose specific amounts for the Deepwater Project; rather, they provide a single amount for all Coast Guard capital projects. As table 1 shows, this overall total ranges from $659 million (in-year-of expenditure dollars) in fiscal year 2002 to $719 million in fiscal year 2006. Because the Coast Guard has many other capital projects under way besides the Deepwater Project, it must decide how this money will be allocated among them. After receiving the budget targets from OMB in early March 2001, the Coast Guard estimated that the amount available for the Deepwater Project would range from $338 million (in year-of-expenditure dollars) in fiscal year 2002 to $547 million in fiscal year 2006.", "If the Coast Guard proceeds with its current plans in issuing the RFP, contractors will be instructed to develop plans around a much higher funding stream than is available under the OMB budget targets. For example, the funding stream that the Coast Guard currently plans to use for the project ($350 million the first year and $525 million in subsequent years) is in 1998 dollars. Adjusted for inflation, this figure becomes $373 million in fiscal year 2002 (compared with OMB\u2019s target of $338 million) and $569 million in fiscal year 2003 (compared with the target of $396 million). By the end of fiscal year 2006, the cumulative gap will total $496 million. While this shortfall may not seem so significant in the scheme of the overall budget, this amount is significant in the context of DOT\u2019s total budget, especially given the competition among DOT agencies for available funding\u2014a point that we discuss in more detail below. Figure 1 shows that the annual gap between planned funding and the amount available under OMB budget targets ranges from $35 million to $173 million.", "Although the Coast Guard may be able to begin the project as planned at the level of funding provided for fiscal year 2002, the success of this first year may provide a false sense of security about how easy it will be to sustain projected funding levels. In fiscal year 2002, spending is relatively low compared with later years. Coast Guard officials said they plan to fully fund the contractor\u2019s share of the planned amount and trim their own administrative expenses related to the project. In subsequent years, when planned payments to contractors rise much more steeply than amounts available, the gap may be far less manageable. In addition, the project\u2019s first-year funding comes mainly from a source that will be soon exhausted. About $243 million of the amount proposed for the Deepwater Project in fiscal year 2002 would come from funds authorized in the 1998 Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act (P.L. 105-277), which will expire this year unless it is extended. OMB officials told us that it plans to request additional appropriations under this act in fiscal years 2003 to 2006.", "Another concern is the potential effect of the Deepwater Project on other Coast Guard capital projects planned or under way. These other capital needs include, for example, modernizing communication equipment used to support search and rescue activities, and upgrading various shoreside facilities, such as boat stations and housing. The overall amount the Coast Guard now plans to spend on these projects is substantially less than the agency indicated in plans just a year ago. For example, in 2000, the Coast Guard\u2019s planning documents proposed spending $475 million on nondeepwater projects in 2005. However, under the current plan, that spending level would drop by more than half, to about $196 million. In part, these proposals reflect the fact that some of the other capital projects, such as the buoy tender project, will be winding down, and the costs of other projects will be absorbed as part of the Deepwater Project. Rather dramatic reductions in other capital projects cannot be explained as easily. For example, estimated spending for improved shore facilities in fiscal year 2005 dropped from $147 million in last year\u2019s plan to $59 million in the current plan. If estimates in the current plan hold true, fiscal year 2006 spending for nondeepwater projects will be at its lowest level in decades and call into question the validity of the agency\u2019s estimates to maintain its current nondeepwater infrastructure. The presence of these other capital needs cannot be forgotten in assessing how ready the Coast Guard is to assume the risks of the Deepwater Project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Funding for Deepwater Will Compete With Other Budget Priorities", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal environment in which the Coast Guard must obtain funds for the Deepwater Project and other capital needs is further complicated by competition for funds with other DOT priorities. Obtaining additional funding for the Coast Guard within the DOT budget is likely to be difficult because of competition with other entities within the DOT appropriation, such as the FAA and Amtrak, for available discretionary funding. For example, recent action by the Congress limited FAA\u2019s ability to use a separate funding source (the Airport and Airway Trust Fund) to fund FAA\u2019s operations. As a result, funding for FAA\u2019s operations now competes for the same limited DOT dollars on which the Deepwater Project would rely. FAA also expects its operating costs to increase to $7.4 billion by 2003, a 42-percent increase from 1998 levels. Similarly, Amtrak estimates that its capital needs alone will amount to about $1.5 billion annually through fiscal year 2020, part of which would come from the DOT budget.", "Outside of DOT, the overall budget process is still driven by caps in discretionary spending. If these caps (which currently cover through fiscal year 2002) are extended as the administration has proposed, funding for the Deepwater Project would have to come from cuts in some other agency or program. The percentage increase in the Coast Guard\u2019s budget request is among the largest of all federal agencies. However, the Coast Guard is basing its plans for the Deepwater Project on another major boost in funding beyond 2002. Thus, for all these reasons, sustaining the Deepwater Project at the funding level the Coast Guard is currently planning to use in its RFP appears to be a difficult task over a sustained period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing Deepwater Around Lower Funding Scenario Would Help Reduce Risk", "paragraphs": ["Our concern about this risk is not new. In several previous reports on the Coast Guard\u2019s planning for the Deepwater Project, we expressed concern about the Coast Guard overestimating the amount of funding that would be available in the future for the project. The Coast Guard agrees that funding for the Deepwater Project is high risk and that it provides limited funding flexibility but believes it should keep its current approach of developing the project around the planned funding stream. Coast Guard managers believe that a deepwater system funded at planned levels provides the optimum system to meet deepwater requirements. The agency also believes that OMB budget targets could rise in the future and that the Congress could appropriate more funds to meet the agency\u2019s capital needs. However, the potential risks are substantial and another strategy appears warranted. That strategy would be to develop a lower funding scenario around which the contractors can develop their proposals. If the project needs to be adjusted to a lower, more realistic funding stream, the time to do so is before the contract proposals are finished later this year.", "Directing contractors to develop proposals around a lower funding scenario aligned with OMB targets would have several advantages. First, the Coast Guard would have greater opportunity to evaluate which proposal will produce the best value to the government within likely budget constraints. Second, the agency would be in a better position to hold the contractor accountable for delivering a system that meets original schedule and cost estimates if it selects the plan developed at the lower funding level. Using realistic funding expectations will reduce the risk of schedule stretch-outs and cost increases with the contractor in a sole- source environment after the contract is awarded\u2014a situation in which the government\u2019s leverage is reduced because it does not have the benefit of competition for obtaining a fair and reasonable price.", "Any projection about likely funding levels for a project that lasts as long as the Deepwater Project will involve an element of uncertainty and risk. The Coast Guard\u2019s current funding scenario exacerbates that risk.

Contracting officials told us that with these parameters in mind, they conducted a limited evaluation of several contracting alternatives by meeting informally with government and private sector officials about the Coast Guard\u2019s proposed approach and meeting internally to discuss possible strengths and weaknesses of three approaches.

Presently, we focus on the cost-related issues of concern, namely the potential absence of competition for subcontracts in the project\u2019s later years and the heavy reliance on a single-systems integrator to procure the entire system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Absence of Competition in the Project\u2019s Later Years", "paragraphs": ["OMB guidance recognizes the value of competition as a lever to keep contract costs down. The benefits of competition are present in the contract\u2019s early years, as are other approaches for controlling costs. For the initial 5-year award term contract, prices for equipment and software to be procured are based on competition; and when the contract with the systems integrator is awarded, these prices will be fixed, according to Coast Guard officials. The Coast Guard also hopes to control costs by encouraging the use of commercially available (nondevelopmental) equipment. Prices for such equipment can be determined on the basis of previous orders from other buyers and by the use of fixed-price contracts.", "Beyond the first 5-year award term contract, however, the benefits of competition are less certain. In a practical sense, the opportunity for competition in the project\u2019s out years is diminished because the systems integrator will likely contract with those suppliers that were part of the team putting together the offer rather than opening the contract to a wider set of offerors. Coast Guard officials currently believe that a profit motive could drive the systems integrator to open competition to a wider set of offerors. Although this is possible, it would be easier to integrate equipment or subsystems acquired from a team member since equipment will be procured based on the plan developed by the team. A Coast Guard analysis of the same issue draws this same conclusion. We believe that this potential lack of competition reduces the normal marketplace control on price and subjects the Coast Guard to situations in which the supplier could potentially drive up project costs.", "The Coast Guard is attempting to develop strategies for encouraging competition among suppliers, and thereby controlling costs, in subsequent 5-year award term contracts. One approach involves providing incentives for the systems integrator to submit \u201ccompetitive proposals\u201d\u2014that is, proposals that are reasonably priced\u2014-beyond the first few years of the contract. Contracting experts brought in by the Coast Guard discouraged this approach, saying such incentives usually have limited effectiveness. As a result, the Coast Guard now indicates it will evaluate the systems integrator\u2019s performance in minimizing total ownership costs as part of its decision of whether to renew the systems integrator\u2019s contract. By doing so, the Coast Guard hopes that this will encourage the systems integrator to have competition. At this point, it is not clear what effect this evaluation would have.", "A second approach the Coast Guard plans to take is to negotiate a ceiling on the amount that will be paid for deepwater equipment in the 5-year period covered by a follow-on, award-term contract. This is a continuation of the approach being taken for the first 5-year contract. However, the ceiling could be waived if the project\u2019s schedule or requirements are changed. Given the funding-related concerns discussed earlier, the potential for such changes cannot be easily dismissed. If such changes occur, the Coast Guard will rely on the systems integrator to negotiate prices with its vendors in a sole-source environment. Although doing so is a valid alternative for pricing a contract, a sole-source environment leaves little leverage in negotiations and therefore carries a higher risk of goods being overpriced. This approach also carries the burden of obtaining and reviewing cost and pricing data from suppliers and the systems integrator."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliance on Single Contractor", "paragraphs": ["Another cost-related concern involves dependence on the systems integrator for a deepwater system that will take 20 or more years to acquire. This dependence is both one of the main strengths of the approach and one of its main weaknesses. On the positive side, if all aspects of the approach work well, the systems integrator will form a partnership with the Coast Guard and provide the technical expertise to assemble an integrated system and the continuity needed to bring a long- term project to a successful conclusion. However, the approach could establish the integrator as a monopoly supplier, substantially constraining the Coast Guard\u2019s options or leverage. The Coast Guard could be in a weak position to negotiate aggressively on price because of its reluctance to take on the risks of increased costs and other problems associated with switching systems integrators. For example, if the systems integrator\u2019s performance is unsatisfactory, a new systems integrator will have to step in to implement someone else\u2019s partially completed design; or the Coast Guard will have to adopt a more traditional approach of buying individual classes of ships or aircraft, according to Coast Guard officials.

We suggested that the Coast Guard identify and evaluate all viable contracting approaches, discuss the approaches with contracting experts, and document the results. In particular, we stated that the Coast Guard should be open to options that would maximize the benefits of competition in later years while still maintaining the interoperability of the system. We also urged the Coast Guard to convene an independent panel of contracting experts from the government and private sector to review the proposed deepwater contracting approach or whatever approach the Coast Guard selected. We felt that given the contract\u2019s uniqueness and the risks it poses, a rigorous review by a widely represented panel of experts was essential to both validate the Coast Guard\u2019s approach, and recommend potential mitigating measures to strengthen it.", "In December 2000, the Coast Guard proposed a limited peer review\u2014one involving experts only from DOD and GAO and consisting of a 3-hour process (a 1-hour presentation on the contracting approach that the Coast Guard plans to use, followed by a 2-hour question-and-answer session). Because of our concerns about the limited nature of this approach, the Coast Guard\u2014with our advice and assistance\u2014expanded the panel of experts and adopted a more extensive, structured format. OMB officials share our concerns about the contracting approach, and they support the need for a peer review and a careful consideration of issues raised before the RFP and acquisition plan are finalized. We also urged the Coast Guard to provide the experts with key documentation, namely the acquisition plan and excerpts from the draft RFP prior to the meeting. Doing so would better ensure that the members of the panel have an objective basis for evaluating the Coast Guard\u2019s contracting approach. However, the Coast Guard decided not to provide such documents to the panel members in advance, but instead provided them with selected excerpts from the acquisition plan. The entire acquisition plan and RFP was available for the panel upon request.", "Subsequent to our discussions with Coast Guard management, the Coast Guard contracted with two outside consultants to review the proposed contracting approach for the Deepwater Project. One consultant was tasked to develop and recommend a contracting strategy for the deepwater system, given the Coast Guard\u2019s requirement for an integrated \u201csystem of systems\u201d solution. The consultant determined that the Coast Guard should continue with the approach it selected. However, citing cost increases and limited cost negotiation leverage as weaknesses, the consultant identified risk mitigation strategies, such as including in the RFP requirements for increasing competition over the mid to long term. A second consultant evaluated the draft RFP. He noted that this was one of the most complex contracts he had ever seen and suggested that it be simplified. For example, he suggested that the Coast Guard consider using incentives as part of the provisions of the award-term contract rather than as a separate item. He also observed that the success of the contracting approach is dependent on the Coast Guard receiving the planned funding stream.", "To address the concerns raised by the consultants and to provide some time to respond to additional concerns that might be raised by the peer review, the Coast Guard has altered its planned date for issuing the deepwater RFP. The Coast Guard now plans to release the RFP in June 2001, or about 2 months later than its initial schedule. The Coast Guard is still responding to comments from its consultants and industry. Making necessary revisions to the RFP before giving it to contractors is important, because the RFP represents the contractual basis upon which the Coast Guard and the contractor will develop their relations. Also, changing the RFP after it has been issued could result in contractors having to amend their offers.", "At this point, we do not know what changes the Coast Guard might adopt. Until adequate steps are in place to address concerns expressed by its consultants and by members of the peer review, we believe the risk related to cost control remains high.

It is too early to know if the Coast Guard can repeat the same strong performance on this much larger scale, because plans for managing and administering the deepwater contract are still being developed. The major challenges the Coast Guard faces involve developing and implementing plans for (1) establishing effective human capital practices, (2) having key management and oversight processes and procedures, (3) forming close relationships with subcontractors, (4) funding useful segments of the project, (5) tracking data to measure contractor performance, and (6) having an exit strategy and a contingency plan in the event of poor performance by the systems integrator."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Project Management During the Planning Phase Was Generally Excellent", "paragraphs": ["In the planning phase of the project, the Coast Guard applied a number of \u201cbest practice\u201d techniques recommended by OMB and others.

The key promise of the approach is achievement of a fully integrated system that both maximizes improvements in operational effectiveness and minimizes total ownership costs (including not only the acquisition, but operation, maintenance, and support costs of the entire system over a 40-year period).", "While we recognize the merit of exploring innovative and even unique approaches, we believe the selected approach puts at risk precisely the purported benefits of the approach\u2014that is, maximizing operational effectiveness and minimizing operational costs. Development of this unique and untried approach on such a large scale and for an acquisition so critical to the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to perform every aspect of its deepwater mission puts a heavy burden on the Coast Guard. Not only would it be reasonable to expect a rigorous effort to identify and mitigate all the major potential risks associated with a totally new approach, but the Coast Guard would also need to ensure that other approaches were fully evaluated. Unfortunately, we found that the Coast Guard has yet to accomplish either. At our urging, the Coast Guard has only recently sought to set up a systematic effort to identify and mitigate risks associated with its chosen approach and the evaluation of alternative approaches remains limited and poorly documented.", "We remain concerned that the Coast Guard will soon be making critical decisions regarding the Deepwater Project, namely issuing the RFP in less than 2 months and awarding a contract to procure deepwater equipment in less than a year. Yet, significant risks still exist, and the Coast Guard has not completed actions to fully address them. The unique contracting approach of relying on a single systems integrator to manage, acquire, and integrate all Deepwater assets and capabilities poses two major risks, both of which still remain. First, the agency\u2019s choice of a contracting approach is now inextricably tied to a projected deepwater funding level of over $500 million annually for the next 2 to 3 decades. Attaining sustained funding for the project at this level looms as the major potential problem. By choosing to proceed with a funding scenario that appears to be unrealistically high in the face of budget projections that are substantially less, the Coast Guard is increasing the risk that the project will incur future cost increases and schedule stretch-outs. Second, the Coast Guard\u2019s reliance on a single contracting team raises serious questions regarding the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to control costs and ensure performance once the contract is awarded. Their strategy for adequately controlling costs in the project\u2019s later years is still being worked out and requires careful attention before the RFP is issued. Similarly, the Coast Guard is still developing plans for managing the contract, and much remains to be done. These are risks that need to be well understood and resolved before the RFP is issued. Moving ahead before addressing the major risks and evaluating options for addressing them, potentially including an evaluation of alternative approaches, would be unwise.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition approach for the Deepwater Project\u2014and its reliance on a large and sustained funding level over a long period\u2014 makes the Congress\u2019 next decision on the project crucial as well. This decision goes far beyond deciding what Coast Guard equipment needs to be replaced or modernized. The Congress is in effect being asked to provide the first installment based on the Coast Guard\u2019s spending plan for the project, which is essentially dependent on a continuous funding stream in excess of $500 million annually for decades. Allowing the project to proceed as planned and then later reducing that funding level significantly would result in higher system costs and reduced system performance. We think this is the central risk posed by the current approach, and that the Congress needs to make its decision about providing funding for the project this year with clear knowledge that the Coast Guard\u2019s chosen contracting strategy depends heavily on a sustained high level of funding for at least the next 20 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that before the Coast Guard issues the RFP for the Deepwater Project, the Secretary of Transportation should   ensure that a realistic level of funding, based on OMB budget targets, the Coast Guard\u2019s capital planning process, and congressional guidance is incorporated into the RFP and used by contractors as the basis for designing their proposed systems; and   direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to carefully consider and incorporate recommendations, if any, made by the peer review panel into the deepwater acquisition plan and RFP or if the peer review panel finds serious and unmitigated risks in the Coast Guard\u2019s approach, evaluate alternative contracting strategies that could address the risks.", "Before the Coast Guard signs a contract with the systems integrator for the Deepwater Project, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation should direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to address the following issues:   complete development of the Program Management Plan, including plans and procedures to (1) facilitate relations with subcontractors, (2) ensure that the project is adequately staffed and that the staff is properly trained to perform their respective project management responsibilities, and (3) cover actions to be taken in the event that the Coast Guard decides not to continue its contract with the systems integrator;   complete plans for ensuring that annual budget requests for the Deepwater Project are for useful segments and that a mechanism is in place for reporting to OMB and the Congress, as part of its annual budget submission, the progress that is made in achieving baseline goals of minimizing costs and improving operations due to investments in funding the Deepwater Project; and   select a process, such as the technology readiness levels approach, for assessing the technology readiness of equipment and major systems to be delivered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["The success of the contracting approach the Coast Guard selected for the Deepwater Project relies heavily on the Coast Guard being able to sustain the funding level around which the contractor\u2019s proposal is based.

OMB is also concerned that this approach sets up a situation where the administration and the Congress would have to fund the project in later years at the planned level, regardless of other competing priorities. Essentially, OMB believes that the deepwater funding strategy transfers the risk of program failure to external sources, such as the Congress. According to OMB, future funding levels cannot be guaranteed, and it would be inappropriate for the Coast Guard to use funding levels in the RFP that are not consistent with OMB\u2019s targets. Under the current acquisition approach, if sustained funding is substantially less than planned, the Coast Guard would have to rebaseline the project in a sole-source environment, a situation that could increase project costs even further.

Although the model is specifically designed to determine software acquisition process maturity, its application can be used for the acquisition of any type of asset (ships, aircraft, etc.). The model ranks organizational maturity according to five levels. Maturity levels 2 through 5 require the verifiable existence and use of certain acquisition processes, known as key process areas. Satisfying the requirements of maturity level 2 demonstrates that an organization has the policies needed to manage a project and the procedures needed to implement those policies. We evaluated the acquisition processes for two Deepwater Project matrix product teams against all seven level-2 areas (planning, solicitation, requirements development and management, project management, contracting and oversight, evaluation, and transition and support) and one level-3 area (risk management).

For example, in its project justification prepared in 1995, the Coast Guard estimated that its aircraft would need to be phased out starting in 1998. However, in 1998, a Coast Guard study showed that with proper maintenance and upgrades, its aircraft would be capable of operating until at least 2012 and beyond. Also, a September 1999 study revised earlier estimates and concluded that the Coast Guard\u2019s deepwater cutters have a service life until 2007 and beyond, assuming that adequate funds remain available for maintenance support and service life upgrades.

Our report notes that the Coast Guard took many innovative steps and recognizes that the agency\u2019s procedures and management structure for the planning phase of the Deepwater project were excellent. While its management during the planning phase provides a solid foundation for the project, the acquisition phase presents considerably tougher challenges. By almost everyone\u2019s assessment, the acquisition strategy is a high risk, untried approach to procure deepwater assets. Whether the Coast Guard has adequately addressed these risks will not be known for years to come. Furthermore, the Coast Guard\u2019s handling of remarks and suggestions made by members of the peer review are largely unknown at this point. 2.  The contracting approach lacks flexibility in several key areas. First, it requires sustained funding at planned levels of more than $500 million for 2 or more decades. Second, it offers no true means to ensure competition for major components as a lever to minimize costs. Third, if planned funding levels are not realized, it opens the door to added costs because the Coast Guard would have to renegotiate costs and delivery dates\u2014all in a sole source environment. Finally, changing the systems integrator after the contract is awarded\u2014while doable\u2014 would likely be costly both in terms of dollars and delays in the project. 3.  The added dollars expected from the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act has allowed the budget targets to increase substantially from prior year (fiscal year 2001) targets. However, OMB told us that had it not been for the act, the large increase in the Coast Guard\u2019s targets for capital projects would have been difficult to achieve given the budgetary environment. While targets may increase somewhat in future years, any large increases would require new funding sources or shifts in funding from other entities, such as FAA and Amtrak, which also have critical capital needs. Already, the funding requirements for the project are almost half a billion dollars more than OMB budget targets through 2006. Given the uncertainty of future funding, it would be unwise and fiscally imprudent for the Coast Guard to blindly proceed with an RFP that contains a planned funding stream of $500 million, hoping that funding at planned levels will materialize later. OMB echoed our position on this issue. 4.  While the Coast Guard has the flexibility to alter project plans based on reduced funding levels in future years, the Coast Guard would likely pay dearly for this. The Coast Guard recognizes this but steadfastly opposes including a lower, more realistic funding level in its RFP. It has essentially rejected our concerns and those of OMB in this area and has adopted a position that runs counter to sound \u201cbest practices\u201d for capital planning that are based on widely-accepted OMB guidance. 5.  The Coast Guard\u2019s characterization of the peer review panel\u2019s deliberations and findings are overly optimistic and overstate the positive results from the panel. Our review of the transcript of the panel\u2019s deliberations showed that there was not the unanimous consensus among panel members on the efficacy of the acquisition approach that was portrayed by the Coast Guard. For example, the panel member from the Office of Federal Procurement Policy voiced numerous concerns about whether a thorough and honest risk analysis of the acquisition approach had been done and whether adequate mitigation and management plans are in place. Another member also echoed this position, while another remarked that much work is needed before the RFP should be issued to contractors. We believe that such concerns by panel members do indeed refer to potentially serious and unmitigated risks that should not be dismissed lightly. In addition, given that panel members were not given the RFP or the acquisition plan prior to the panel meeting, we question the thoroughness of the panel\u2019s results and the depth to which it explored key questions. It is evident from the transcript of the panel discussions and our observations of the proceedings that panel members may not have had a good grasp or understanding of many issues in the depth necessary to make informed observations and suggestions. For example, one panel member remarked in his summary at the end of the panel discussion that there was an information void on some issues when the panel began discussions, and having more detailed information on the acquisition strategy ahead of time would have been useful. OMB officials who observed the peer review session told us that they felt the same way. Moreover, the panel members were not asked to determine whether this approach represents the \u201cbest approach among all possible alternatives,\u201d nor were panel members given the time or the information necessary to make such a determination. 6.  To provide funding for the Deepwater Project, the Coast Guard will likely have to keep funding for other capital projects at levels which would be substantially lower than levels experienced over the last decade or more. It is unrealistic to believe that other non-deepwater capital needs will be minimal for the entire duration of the Deepwater Project. The DOT Office of Inspector General, for example, has recently identified millions of dollars of potential capital projects associated with the Coast Guard\u2019s search and rescue program. Also, in its current fiscal year 2002 capital plan, the Coast Guard may have significantly understated amounts needed for information technology and other projects. For example, the current plan projects information technology funding needs of only $3 million in 2005; its capital plan of just a year ago cited information technology project needs of $31.4 million in 2005. Similarly, estimates of funding needs for shore facilities were $128.8 million in the 2001 plan and only $58.7 million in the fiscal year 2002 plan. Either the Coast Guard grossly overstated its non-deepwater needs in the fiscal year 2001 plan or it cut deeply into these projects for the fiscal year 2002 plan to accommodate funding for the Deepwater Project. Regardless, this leaves serious questions about whether the Coast Guard is understating funding needs for non- deepwater projects to give the appearance that the Deepwater Project funding needs can be met in the next 5 years. 7.  While the Coast Guard has provisions in the RFP that allow it to exit the contract if price or performance is unsatisfactory, the practical reality is that changing the systems integrator will be costly, and there is a natural reluctance for an agency to do so. Members of the peer review panel remarked similarly on this issue. In addition, complete, reliable data on total ownership costs and operational effectiveness may be absent, especially in the project\u2019s early years, making those measures less effective as a means to evaluate contractor performance. Members of the peer review panel made this point as well. Also, the inclusion of contract incentives does not guarantee competition will exist among subcontractors. The panel did not reach unanimous consensus that such incentives would necessarily be effective in this regard, as the Coast Guard contends. 8.  The Coast Guard did not comment on two recommendations that need to be addressed. Developing an effective assessment tool to evaluate the technology maturity of major equipment and components is critical to keep a tight rein on costs. Also, ensuring that future budget requests for deepwater components are for useful segments is essential. OMB strongly concurred with our view on these issues. Finally, keeping the Congress appraised of progress being made in achieving the baseline goals of minimizing costs and improving operations is vital as a basis for holding the Coast Guard accountable to the Congress and the administration for the significant investment in the project."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Marie Ahearn, Neil Asaba, Naba Barkakati, Alan Belkin, Christine Bonham, Sue Burns, John Christian, Tom Collis, Ralph Dawn, Paul Francis, David Hooper, Richard Hung, Matt Lea, Sterling Leibenguth, Lynn Musser, Madhav Panwar, Colleen Phillips, David Robinson, Katherine Schinasi, Stanley Stenersen, Mike Sullivan, and William Woods made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
