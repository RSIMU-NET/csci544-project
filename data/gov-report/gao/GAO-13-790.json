Section 2229a of Title10 requires DOD to report annually on the status of its prepositioned stocks and for DOD's report to include 12 specific elements--for example, the material condition of the equipment. The law also mandates that GAO review DOD's report and provide any additional information to Congress that would be informative on issues relating to the status of prepositioned stocks. This is GAO's sixth report, and it assessed the extent to which (1) DOD's fiscal year 2012 prepositioning report addressed the 12 statutory reporting elements and (2) DOD has made progress in addressing GAO's prior recommendations on department-wide strategic guidance and a coordinated joint-military service approach for managing prepositioning.

For example, DOD provided a list of non-standard items slated for inclusion in its prepositioned stocks but did not include a specific plan for funding those items as required by the law. Federal internal control standards state that decision makers need complete and relevant information to manage risks and achieve efficiency and effectiveness goals. However, GAO found that DOD's report contained some inconsistencies in information across the services as well as several inaccuracies and omissions. For example, DOD's report included funding information for 6 or 7 fiscal years for most of the services but only 2 fiscal years for the Navy's stocks. Service information was also presented in different formats in the report, which makes it difficult to compare data. Because the Joint Staff did not provide specific guidance to the services to ensure consistency when requesting data, the services adopted separate approaches to reporting information to the Joint Staff for compilation in the report. In addition, although an agency should monitor the quality of information provided to Congress, GAO found several inaccuracies in the report, such as incorrect calculations and information that had been inadvertently omitted. While officials from the Joint Staff and each of the services stated that they have their own review processes, the errors found in the report indicate weaknesses in DOD's quality assurance procedures. Until DOD addresses these issues and provides complete, consistent, and accurate information on its prepositioned stocks, its report will be of limited use to Congress in making informed decisions about DOD's prepositioning programs.", "DOD has not made progress in addressing GAO's prior recommendations to develop department-wide strategic guidance and implement a coordinated joint-service approach for managing its prepositioning programs, nor has it set a timeline for doing so. As far back as 2005, GAO has reported that each of the military services was planning the future of its prepositioning programs without the benefit of an overall plan or joint doctrine to coordinate their efforts, which made it difficult to determine how the services' different programs would fit together to meet the evolving defense strategy. Recently, DOD issued a strategy for materiel response to support the full range of military activities and an implementation plan for directing, coordinating, and prioritizing DOD-wide development plans, initiatives, and activities for the period 2013-2020 to achieve the strategy. However, neither provides guidance for DOD's prepositioning programs, and the plan specifically excludes prepositioning. Hence, the services' individual prepositioning programs are still not linked to overarching strategic guidance. DOD has also not improved joint oversight of its prepositioning programs because a working group that was expected to provide such oversight has not been functioning as intended, and other joint activities do not specifically address prepositioned stocks. An increased emphasis on joint oversight would help unify DOD's prepositioning efforts in support of defense priorities, reduce potential unnecessary duplication, and achieve cost savings and efficiencies. Congress is currently considering legislation that would direct DOD to develop an overarching strategy for its prepositioning programs and establish joint oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop guidance to ensure that it reports consistent information across the services and strengthens quality assurance procedures for its report.

We have issued several reports since 2005  addressing DOD\u2019s reporting and management of prepositioning, and this  report is GAO\u2019s sixth report in response to our annual reporting  requirement. In our prior reports, we have identified a number of ongoing  and long-term challenges to DOD\u2019s prepositioned stocks related to  strategic planning, joint service coordination, requirements determination,  inventory management, and other issues. In particular, we have  recommended that DOD develop a department-wide strategy on  prepositioned materiel and equipment and strengthen joint oversight of its  prepositioning programs to integrate and synchronize at a DOD-wide  level the services\u2019 prepositioning programs to maximize efficiency in  managing prepositioning across the department and reduce potential  unnecessary duplication. DOD has generally agreed with these past  recommendations. The objectives of this report are to assess: (1) the  extent to which DOD has addressed the 12 statutory elements and (2) the  progress DOD has made in addressing our prior recommendations to  develop department-wide strategic guidance and a coordinated joint- military service approach for managing its prepositioning programs.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD\u2019s annual report addressed the 12  reporting elements set out in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2229a, regarding prepositioned  stocks, we analyzed DOD\u2019s report on the status of prepositioned materiel  and equipment for fiscal year 2012. We performed a detailed content  analysis in which we compared the prepositioned stocks information in  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 report with the 12 reporting requirements and  assessed the extent to which DOD had addressed each required  element. We assessed an element as addressed if DOD\u2019s report explicitly  addressed all parts of the element. We assessed an element as partially  addressed if at least one or more\u2014but not all\u2014parts of the required  element were explicitly addressed. Finally, we assessed an element as  not addressed if it did not explicitly address any part of the required  element. We also included in our review analyses of DOD policies,  prepositioning guidance from the services, and the prior year\u2019s (fiscal year  2011) annual report to Congress on prepositioned materiel and  equipment to understand the variations of information reported by the  services on the status of prepositioned stocks and the quality assurance  processes used during the development of the fiscal year 2012 report.

Combatant  commands develop plans with varying levels of detail, and the most  detailed plans contain, among other things, time-phased force and  deployment data, which include the specific units to be deployed in  support of the plan and the timeline for when those forces are needed.  The services then determine how best to meet the needs of the  combatant commanders, which may include the use of prepositioned  stocks or other types of equipment to support the commanders\u2019 goals and  ensure timely support of deployed forces during the initial phases of an  operation until follow-on capabilities have been established.

First, the Marine Corps reported its procurement requirements as  \u201cto be determined\u201d rather than giving projected funding amounts, whereas  that information was provided for the other services in DOD\u2019s report.  Second, the Marine Corps and the Air Force provided information that  could be used to identify funding shortfalls in their prepositioning  programs for each fiscal year across the five year defense plan whereas  the Army and Navy did not provide this information. Third, three of the  services reported working capital funds requirements or indicated that  they had no working capital funds requirements. The Navy, however, did  not report whether or not it had working capital funding requirements.  Lastly, each of the services reported its current funding requirements, as  of fiscal year 2012, and its projected funding requirements, but they did  not all use the same time frame for these estimates.

DOD\u2019s report included information on the overall status of each  service\u2019s prepositioned stocks, but the amount of detail for specific items  or categories of items within the prepositioned stocks varied among the  services. For example, the Army reported the levels of fill and material  condition of individual major end items and categories of prepositioned  stocks, but it also provided information on the levels of fill for its  prepositioned equipment sets, which are located in selected sites across  the world. However, the Marine Corps and Navy did not provide similar  information on the levels of fill for on-hand prepositioned equipment sets  for their respective locations in the fiscal year 2012 report. Decision  makers could find this information useful in monitoring the fill levels of  prepositioned stocks in various parts of the world for oversight and  funding purposes, such as assessing the prepositioning needs in a given  combatant commander\u2019s area of responsibility and having greater  assurance that required assets would be available when and where they  are needed to meet combatant command requirements.", "According to service officials, the reason for the inconsistent reporting in  funding requirements and major end items was that without specific  guidance from the Joint Staff, each of the services had adopted its own  reporting approach, independent of each other.

This  tasking document to the services also included a copy of the 12 reporting  elements. However, the Joint Staff did not direct the services to  coordinate their information with each other or provide more consistent  reporting instructions.

Each of  the services did make some changes in its reporting based on changes  within its respective programs and added new information per GAO\u2019s  prior recommendations, but the type of information and formatting were  consistent with how the services had provided the information in the  previous fiscal year, thus yielding inconsistencies in DOD\u2019s final report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inaccuracies and Omissions in Data Reporting Affect Report\u2019s Quality", "paragraphs": ["According to GAO\u2019s internal control management and evaluation tool,  which is based on federal internal control standards, to effectively  communicate information to the Congress, an agency should monitor the  quality of the information being captured, maintained, and communicated  as measured by accuracy, among other things. However, we found  some inaccuracies and omissions in DOD\u2019s prepositioning report, which  affect the quality of the information provided to Congress by DOD. We  reviewed the information in DOD\u2019s report on each service and found  examples of inaccurate information, such as incorrect calculations within  data tables and reporting that seemed to conflict with data presented  elsewhere in the report. For instance, the Air Force, in one table, reported  the level of fill of equipment, such as fuel pumps and storage bladders,  that it uses for fuel operations at austere forward locations; however, the  Air Force had incorrectly calculated the change in operationally available  levels of equipment from fiscal years 2011 to 2012 for many of the items  in the table.

For those items, the Marine Corps  provided on-hand totals for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, but reported no  change between the two fiscal years even though the data seemed to  indicate changes had occurred. According to Marine Corps officials, they  reported \u201cno change\u201d for the items because those items were newly  added to the fiscal year 2012 report. Since these items were not reported  in fiscal year 2011, there would be no changes to report in the fiscal year  2012 report, according to Marine Corps officials. However, the fiscal year  2012 report did not provide an explanation for the differences in the data  or why the Marine Corps considered there to be no change.

In 2011, we  reported that it was important for DOD to provide context in its annual  prepositioning reports to enable decision makers to determine whether  there have been significant changes in DOD\u2019s prepositioning programs  from the prior year and the reasons for those changes.

Our report stated that such strategic guidance would  provide the services with information on the medium- and long-term  department-wide priorities they need to effectively plan and apply their  resources to meet future contingencies, thus linking DOD\u2019s prepositioning  programs with its overall national defense strategies.", "In response to our May 2011 report, DOD stated that it would develop  strategic direction concerning prepositioned stocks. In the fall of 2011,  DOD program officials stated that the department was in the process of  conducting a department-wide review, which would result in enhanced  joint oversight, increased program efficiencies, and expanded guidance to  link prepositioning programs with national military objectives. The result of  that review was DOD\u2019s Comprehensive Materiel Response Strategy,  issued in May 2012, which describes DOD\u2019s strategy for integrating and  synchronizing materiel response to support a full range of military  activities globally in an increasingly constrained resource environment.  Also, in January 2013, DOD issued a Comprehensive Materiel Response  Plan, which provides guidance for directing, coordinating, and prioritizing  DOD-wide development plans, initiatives, and activities for the period  2013-2020 in order to achieve the Comprehensive Materiel Response  Strategy end state.", "However, neither the Comprehensive Materiel Response Strategy nor the  Comprehensive Materiel Response Plan provides guidance for DOD\u2019s  prepositioning programs, and the plan specifically states that the services\u2019  prepositioned programs are outside the scope of the plan. During our  review for our September 2012 report, Joint Staff officials developing the  strategy told us that prepositioning programs were excluded because the  planners received new direction for this effort in spring 2012, re-focusing  the strategy and plan on integrating and synchronizing materiel response  to support the full range of military activities, which is much broader than  prepositioned materiel and equipment. Accordingly, in September 2012,  we reported that DOD still had not made progress in implementing  overarching DOD-wide strategic guidance for its prepositioning programs.  Because DOD had planned to develop department-wide strategic  guidance for its prepositioning programs and these efforts had not  materialized because of other departmental priorities, our September  2012 report recommended that DOD set a timeline for implementing our  prior recommendation. In commenting on a draft of that report, DOD  concurred with the recommendation but said the department will continue  to focus on ensuring that combatant commanders\u2019 equipment  requirements identified in operation and contingency plans are satisfied  by the services.", "In conducting our current review, we found that DOD had still not made  progress in developing an overarching strategy for its prepositioning  programs. Hence, the services\u2019 individual prepositioning programs are still  not linked to overarching strategic guidance, which could lead to  inconsistencies and potential overlap and duplication among the services\u2019  prepositioning strategies and between the service strategies and the new  national defense strategy. Further, without a set timeline for the  development and implementation of department-wide strategic guidance  that aligns DOD\u2019s prepositioning programs with national defense strategic  guidance and new departmental priorities, DOD could face difficulties in  effectively planning and implementing its prepositioning programs and  risks the potential for duplicative or unaligned efforts among the services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Improved Joint Oversight of its Prepositioning Programs", "paragraphs": ["DOD has also not improved its joint oversight of its prepositioning  programs because a working group that was expected to provide joint  oversight has not been functioning as intended and other joint activities  do not specifically address prepositioned stocks. We have previously  reported that an increased emphasis on joint program management and  oversight of prepositioned stocks is needed to reduce potential  unnecessary duplication and achieve cost savings and efficiencies. We  also identified the need to strengthen joint oversight and synchronize  prepositioning programs at a department-wide level in our first annual  report to Congress on potential duplication, overlap, and fragmentation in  the federal government. Without joint-service oversight, DOD may not  be able to fully recognize potential efficiencies among prepositioned  stocks across the department.", "DOD\u2019s instruction on war reserve materiel directed establishment of the  Global Prepositioned Materiel Capabilities Working Group, which is to  comprise officials from the services, the Defense Logistics Agency, joint  organizations, and entities within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  In particular, according to DOD officials involved with the group since its  inception, the intent of the working group is to provide an overall view of  DOD\u2019s prepositioning programs and ensure that the services\u2019 programs  are synchronized. Based on its charter, the working group\u2019s joint  prepositioning activities are to include, among other things, providing  oversight of DOD\u2019s prepositioning programs through reviewing risk  assessments, addressing joint issues concerning requirements and  positioning of prepositioned stocks, and making recommendations that  balance limited resources against operational risk for use during budget  and program reviews. However, the working group has not carried out all  of the responsibilities specified in the instruction or the objectives in its  own charter related to prepositioned stocks. Rather, officials said that the  main function of the working group has been to consolidate the services\u2019  individual submissions on their prepositioning programs into DOD\u2019s  annual report for Congress. According to DOD officials, the working group  has met only sporadically and has not yet addressed many of the duties  specified in its charter. Further, officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and the  Joint Staff told us that they are considering revising the DOD instruction  on war reserve materiel policy to eliminate the working group. Without  strategic guidance from the Secretary of Defense that emphasizes the  importance of joint oversight of prepositioned stocks, the working group  may in fact be abolished, or it may continue to operate as it has been,  with little impact on enhancing jointness or efficiency across the services\u2019  prepositioning programs.", "DOD has developed some joint activities related to the supply chain, but  many of these efforts are either in very early stages or do not specifically  address prepositioned stocks and focus instead on more broadly  supporting the full range of military activities. For example, DOD\u2019s  Comprehensive Materiel Response Plan calls for increasing sharing,  standardization, and synchronized planning across the services.  However, this plan does not contain details on where to position or how to  manage prepositioned stocks.", "An example of where joint oversight could highlight areas for potential  efficiencies is in the services\u2019 prepositioned medical stocks. Currently,  each service determines its requirements for prepositioned stocks in  support of a geographic combatant commander\u2019s operation plan. For  instance, each service has determined its requirements for the number of  prepositioned field hospitals\u2014the Army has 8; the Navy, in support of the  Marine Corps, has 10; and the Air Force has 3. Also, the size of these  hospitals varies across the services, with costs ranging from about $10  million for the smaller ones to about $33 million for the larger ones.  According to Joint Staff medical logistics officials, DOD has not conducted  a coordinated department-wide analysis of the services\u2019 requirements and  the preferred options for meeting those requirements and supporting each  other. Further, they said coordinating this type of analysis is difficult  because of the individual ways the services identify requirements,  configure hospitals, and package medical equipment. The officials  pointed out, for example, that while the services are providing essentially  similar medical services in their field hospitals, they individually identify  requirements and develop capabilities and design processes to address  them. Prepositioned hospitals are the end results of such processes;  therefore, the officials said opportunities exist to assess theater  hospitalization as a joint-service capability and still recognize potentially  minimal unique aspects of requirements that each service has. According  to the Joint Staff medical logistics officials, DOD has recognized that  there are challenges associated with the coordination of medical logistics  among the services, including prepositioned stocks to support theater  hospitalization. To address these challenges, the officials said that they  are taking a number of actions. For example, DOD plans to establish a  new agency\u2014the Defense Health Agency\u2014in October 2013. This agency  will interface with the combatant commanders and focus on improved  coordination between the services and shared services, including medical  logistics. However, until these challenges are met, the military services\u2019  fragmented approach to planning and prioritizing the need for  prepositioned resources, such as medical equipment, absent specific  strategic guidance, increases the potential for overlap and duplication at a  time when the services are seeking ways to reduce budgets and achieve  efficiencies in virtually all areas.", "Congress has expressed concerns that DOD has not implemented an  overarching strategy and joint-service oversight framework for its  prepositioning programs. In a proposed bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, the Senate Armed Services  Committee recommended a provision that would require the Secretary of  Defense to develop an overarching strategic policy, along with an  implementation plan, to integrate and synchronize at a department-wide  level, the services\u2019 prepositioning programs, among other things. In the  committee report accompanying the bill, the committee said that  developing such a strategy and implementation plan would help ensure  that DOD\u2019s prepositioning programs, both ground and afloat, align with  national defense strategies and DOD priorities and emphasize joint  oversight to maximize effectiveness and efficiencies in prepositioned  materiel and equipment across DOD. The legislation is currently  pending. The House also passed a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which does not include a similar  provision, thus it is unclear whether the final National Defense  Authorization Act, when passed, will address these issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s annual report on prepositioning programs\u2014with three partially- addressed elements, data inconsistencies among the services,  inaccuracies, and omissions\u2014is illustrative of long-standing problems  stemming from the lack of overarching DOD strategic guidance and  oversight. The resulting product is, for the most part, a separate report by  each of the services on its prepositioning efforts, rather than a  coordinated joint-service picture of DOD\u2019s prepositioning programs.  Strategic guidance and enhanced joint departmental oversight could  strengthen the coordination and quality assurance procedures that DOD  uses to compile its annual prepositioning reports for Congress.  Importantly, a more complete, consistent, and accurate report would aid  Congress in its ability to oversee and make informed decisions about  DOD\u2019s prepositioning programs. Further, an increased emphasis on joint  program management and oversight of prepositioned materiel and  equipment would serve to unify DOD\u2019s prepositioning efforts in support of  defense priorities, identify and reduce any unnecessary overlap or  duplication, and achieve cost savings and efficiencies.

We  performed a content analysis in which we compared the prepositioned  stocks information in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 report with the 12 reporting  elements and assessed the extent to which DOD had addressed each  required element. One GAO analyst conducted this analysis, coding the  information and entering it into a spreadsheet, and a different GAO  analyst checked the information for accuracy. Any initial disagreements in  the coding were discussed and reconciled by the analysts. The analysts  then tallied the responses to determine the extent to which the reporting  elements were addressed. We assessed an element as addressed if  DOD\u2019s report explicitly addressed all parts of the element. We assessed  an element as partially addressed if at least one\u2014but not all\u2014parts of the  required element were explicitly addressed. Finally, we assessed an  element as not addressed if it did not explicitly address any part of the  required element. We also analyzed each of the tables in the fiscal year  2012 report to identify any inconsistencies in the reporting of data among  the services, as well as any inaccuracies or omissions in the data.  Additionally, we compared the data in the fiscal year 2012 report with  data presented in the fiscal year 2011 report, where applicable, to identify  discrepancies between the two reports. We did not independently assess  the data in the fiscal year 2012 report, but we assessed the reliability of  the systems used to generate the data and concluded that the data were  sufficiently reliable to meet the objectives of this engagement. To assess  reliability, we developed and administered a survey to appropriate service  officials to collect information on data system management, data quality  assurance processes, potential sources of errors, and mitigations of those  errors. We also interviewed service officials to collect information on their  experiences working with these data systems and the data validation  process. Furthermore, we reviewed DOD policies, prepositioning  guidance from the services, and the prior year\u2019s (fiscal year 2011) annual  report to Congress on prepositioned materiel and equipment to  understand the variations of information reported by the services on the  status of prepositioned stocks and the quality control processes used  during the development of the fiscal year 2012 report.
