The Telecommunications Act of 1996 established that FCC should promote competition and reduce regulation to secure lower prices and higher-quality services for American consumers. FCC implements its policy aims through rulemaking, whereby the agency notifies the public of a proposed rule and provides an opportunity for the public to participate in the rule's development. These rulemakings are documented within a public docket that contains the rulemaking record. In response to a congressional request on FCC rulemaking, GAO (1) described FCC's rulemaking process; (2) determined, for specific rulemakings, the extent to which FCC followed its process; and (3) identified factors that contributed to some dockets and rulemakings remaining open. GAO reviewed recent FCC rules, interviewed FCC officials and stakeholders, and conducted case studies of rulemakings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FCC's rulemaking process includes multiple steps as outlined by law, with several opportunities for public participation. FCC generally begins the process by releasing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and establishing a docket to gather information submitted by the public or developed within FCC to support the proposed rule. Outside parties may meet with FCC officials but must file a disclosure in the docket, called an ex parte filing, that includes any new data or arguments presented at the meeting. FCC analyzes information in the docket and drafts a final rule for the commission to adopt. The FCC chairman decides which rules the commission will consider and whether to adopt them by vote at a public meeting or by circulating them to each commissioner for approval. Stakeholders unsatisfied with a rule may file a petition for reconsideration with the commission or petition for review in federal court. FCC generally followed the rulemaking process in the four case studies of completed rulemakings that GAO reviewed, but several stakeholders had access to nonpublic information. Specifically, each of the four rulemakings included steps as required by law and opportunities for public participation. Within the case studies, most ex parte filings complied with FCC rules. However, in the case studies and in discussions with other stakeholders that regularly participate in FCC rulemakings, multiple stakeholders generally knew when the commission scheduled votes on proposed rules well before FCC notified the public. FCC rules prohibit disclosing this information outside of FCC. Other stakeholders said that they cannot learn when rules are scheduled for a vote until FCC releases the public meeting agenda, at which time FCC rules prohibit stakeholders from lobbying FCC. As a result, stakeholders with advance information about which rules are scheduled for a vote would know when it is most effective to lobby FCC, while stakeholders without this information would not. The complexity and number of rulemakings within a docket and the priority the commission places on a rulemaking contribute to dockets and rulemakings remaining open. The commission determines when to open and close a docket and which rulemakings are a priority; therefore, the commission determines how a docket and rulemaking progress. Dockets and the rulemakings within them may remain open because the dockets are broad and include multiple rulemakings, or because the commission has not yet voted to close the dockets even though they include completed rules. Within dockets, some rulemakings may remain open because they involve complex, technical issues or because competing priorities can force FCC officials to work on one rulemaking as opposed to another. Stakeholders generally said they are not concerned about the number of open dockets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations potentially affect  the daily lives of every American, from rules governing who may own the  morning newspaper to the networks connecting the last long-distance  telephone call at night. These regulations have a direct influence on how  consumers and businesses access telecommunications and media services  by, for example, providing the regulatory framework for the digital  broadcasting transition, facilitating the deployment of broadband services,  and fostering competition to achieve a wider range of communications  services. FCC-regulated industries provide Americans with daily access to  local and long-distance communications services, mobile telephone  services, broadband Internet services, and free over-the-air radio and  television broadcasts.

The  Communications Act, which the Telecommunications Act of 1996  (Telecommunications Act) substantially revised, tasks FCC with regulating  methods of electronic communication to foster a competitive  environment, with an emphasis on the public interest. To implement the  intent of these and other laws, FCC makes regulations (or rules) through a  process that is largely defined in law. This process requires FCC to provide  the public with notice of its proposed and final rules and with an  opportunity to comment as the rules are developed. All comments and  information gathered by FCC constitute the public record to support  rulemakings and are electronically maintained in a docket. A docket may  address a number of issues, and, as a result, there may be several  rulemakings within one docket.", "Seeking information about FCC\u2019s efforts to maintain transparency and  opportunities for public participation, you asked us to review FCC\u2019s  rulemaking process.

Each of these rules originated in a different bureau\u2014Media,  Wireless Telecommunications, or Wireline Competition\u2014or in FCC\u2019s  Office of Engineering and Technology. These bureaus and office had the  most rulemakings during the period of our analysis. We also based our  selection of rules on why the rules were initiated, how long they took to  complete, and whether they were challenged in court. To help identify  factors that may contribute to dockets and rulemakings remaining open,  we selected four rulemakings for case studies from a list of ongoing  rulemakings that FCC publishes in the Federal Register every 6 months.  We selected these cases from the three bureaus and one office that  conducted the most rulemakings during the 5-year period from 2002  through 2006. We also selected these rules to include rules that were  initiated in different ways and had been open for different lengths of time.  For all case studies, we reviewed and analyzed the rulemaking records and  interviewed FCC officials and stakeholders involved in the rulemakings.  The findings in our case studies cannot be generalized to all FCC  rulemakings. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for  our review.

Instead, they rely mostly on external  stakeholders to submit this information into the public record, and FCC  staff analyze the information. In addition, stakeholders can critique each  other\u2019s data that are in the public record. On more technical issues, FCC\u2019s  Office of Engineering and Technology may conduct analyses for the public  record, and information FCC routinely collects, such as data on broadband  use, may be placed in a docket if it is relevant to a rulemaking. Also, while  FCC officials said that they do not typically identify and reach out to  parties to participate in rulemakings, they may contact a particular  stakeholder and request additional information for the public record or  use publicly available data, such as data from the U.S. Census, to augment  the public record. For example, officials from the Wireline Competition  Bureau told us they contact rulemaking participants if they need an  additional level of detail in the public record to adequately support a rule.  In some cases, FCC also holds field hearings, such as the current series of  hearings on media ownership, to solicit comment for the public record on  specific rulemaking issues.", "Using information contained in the public record as support, bureau staff  draft proposed final rules for the commission to vote on.

FCC officials said that they consider all types of comments  filed in ECFS to support rulemakings; however, they said that specific  comments on contentious rulemaking issues are more helpful than general  comments that express support or opposition to a rule. FCC officials told  us that they may also consider comments from stakeholders with a vested  interest in an issue more seriously than those from other parties. FCC\u2019s  Office of General Counsel and Office of Managing Director provide  rulemaking guidance to bureaus and review rules to determine whether  the bureaus followed the steps required by various rulemaking laws.

According to FCC officials, while it is not  possible to vote on every rulemaking at a public meeting, items that are  controversial or have a broad impact on the industry are more likely to be  voted on during a public meeting. Of the 240 recent rules, 101 were  adopted on the day the commission held a public meeting, indicating they  may have been voted on at the meeting, while the other 139 appear to have  been adopted by circulation.", "Three weeks before the commission considers an item at a public meeting,  the chairman\u2019s office releases to FCC officials the draft version of the  proposed rules the commission expects to vote on at the public meeting.  These drafts are internal, nonpublic documents. FCC officials told us they  do not release information to the public about what items the commission  is planning to vote on at public meetings or items being circulated by the  commission for adoption. FCC\u2019s written rulemaking guidance states that  such information is nonpublic and may not be disclosed in any format,  including via paper, electronic, or oral means, unless the chairman  authorizes its disclosure.", "For items to be voted on during a public meeting, the Office of Managing  Director releases the Sunshine Agenda no later than 1 week before the  meeting. The agenda includes a list of items the commission intends to  vote on at the meeting and notifies the public that it may not contact the  commission about those items during the week before the vote, the period  known as the Sunshine Period. Items voted on through circulation do not  usually appear on the Sunshine Agenda and, therefore, are not subject to  the contact prohibition. According to FCC officials, at the chairman\u2019s  discretion, the commission could adopt items included on the Sunshine  Agenda by circulation in advance of the public meeting. No more than two  commissioners may meet to deliberate on rulemaking matters outside of  an official public meeting, according to a requirement of the Sunshine Act.  Some FCC commissioners have said that this requirement should be  changed because it creates logistical complications and transfers the daily  discussion of rules down from the commissioners to their staff. We did not  evaluate these claims.", "Once the commission adopts a rule, the originating bureau often makes  technical corrections to it and may also make substantive changes. Each  commissioner is given the final rule before it is released and can decide if  the rule has undergone substantive changes. Any substantive changes are  approved by the commissioners, and the rule goes through a final internal  review before FCC releases the rule and submits it to the Federal Register  for publication. FCC may adopt and release some rules on the same day,  while other rules may require months of revision because the commission  may vote on a particular issue or policy position and not the precise  wording of the rule. When this occurs, the final wording of the rule is  approved by all commissioners before the order is released.", "It is difficult to determine time frames for FCC rules because FCC tracks  which dockets are open, and many rules are in dockets that have been  open for a long time. These dockets may include other rules or may have  remaining issues to address. For example, one docket that has been open  since 1980 includes several NPRMs and rules. A recent rule in this docket,  issued in 2006, was attached to a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,  and was published in the Federal Register as an \u201cinterim rule,\u201d indicating  the issue is ongoing even though FCC has released several rules in the  docket. Documents that are both an NPRM and a rule can be difficult to  find in FCC\u2019s database because the database allows a document to have  only one document-type label, even if the document serves multiple  purposes. As a result, if a document is filed as a rule and it also includes an  NPRM, when searching for NPRMs this document would not be found.", "FCC may also develop rules on the basis of comments solicited from  notices other than a docket\u2019s first NPRM. For example, a 2005 rule from a  docket that began in 1997 was supported by an analysis of comments  solicited in 2000 and 2003. FCC officials told us that some dockets\u2014 particularly those that address complex issues\u2014contain multiple  rulemakings. Specifically, a docket may contain different NPRMs and rules  that are issued at different times. Therefore, a rule may be made in a  docket to address a long-standing issue, but relate specifically to an NPRM  that was not released until years after the docket was established.  Consequently, some rules could be considered to have shorter time frames  because they address issues primarily raised in subsequent NPRMs  released in the same docket. FCC officials told us that they do not track  the time it takes to complete a rulemaking and generally are not required  by statute to complete rules within certain time frames. The time it takes  to complete rules may vary because of the unique nature of each  rulemaking. Certain factors, such as the technical complexity of the issue  being address and the priority of the rulemaking in comparison to other  issues, can also affect rulemaking time frames. We also reviewed  rulemaking at the Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Trade  Commission, but we could not compare their time frames with FCC\u2019s  because of differences in their rulemaking processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reconsideration and Appeal", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders unsatisfied with an FCC rule may file a petition for  reconsideration with the commission or petition for federal judicial  review.

Some  stakeholders told us that it is much easier to comment on an NPRM that  includes a proposed rule. According to these stakeholders, it is easier to  comment on a specific proposal instead of trying to comment on an entire  subject or a range of proposals. However, there is no requirement that an  NPRM include a proposed rule.", "One NPRM that we reviewed contained an error, but that error did not  appear to substantially affect the rulemaking. Specifically, the NPRM for  the rulemaking on cable boxes incorrectly stated that the rulemaking was  not bound by ex parte rules. FCC officials told us that this error occurred  because language was inadvertently carried over from an earlier drafting  of a notice of inquiry on cable boxes. FCC later decided to issue an NPRM  instead of a notice of inquiry, but accidentally left in the language that the  proceeding was not bound by ex parte rules. FCC officials told us that this  mistake had no bearing on the rulemaking because stakeholders submitted  ex parte filings anyway. Our review of the docket confirmed that  stakeholders submitted ex parte filings in this rulemaking.", "In each case study, numerous stakeholders participated in rule  development, both during and after the comment period. Specifically, the  case studies had between 42 comments (for the cable boxes rule) and   273 comments (for the public safety interference rule) filed during the  comment period. In addition, FCC received between 8 (for the amateur  radio service rule) and 2,237 (for the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier  (ILEC) unbundling rule) ex parte filings and comments in the docket after  the formal comment period ended. These filings and comments, which  were filed through FCC\u2019s Web site, either reflect a meeting between FCC  officials and stakeholders or are written comments that stakeholders  submitted after the formal comment period had ended. The comments  range from lengthy studies to one-page, mass-produced e-mails. In  formulating a rule, FCC must consider all comments that are filed during  the comment period and may consider comments that are filed after the  comment period. Each filed comment is placed in a docket that is publicly  accessible through FCC\u2019s Web site. Generally, FCC does not produce its  own studies to develop a rule. Rather, FCC relies on stakeholders to  submit information and analysis that is then placed in the docket so that  FCC and other stakeholders can critique the information. According to  FCC officials, this results in both transparency and quality information  because each stakeholder has had an opportunity to review and comment  on all of the information in the docket.", "In addition to submitting comments, stakeholders often meet with FCC  staff to discuss issues. Stakeholders involved in our studies told us that  they were able to meet with FCC officials when they requested meetings.  Other stakeholders with whom we spoke who were not involved in these  case studies but regularly comment on FCC rulemakings also told us that  they were able to meet with FCC officials. A few of these stakeholders told  us that, while FCC officials were always willing to meet with them, they  were sometimes unsure if FCC officials were currently focused on the  rulemaking that was being discussed. FCC officials told us that they meet  with stakeholders who request a meeting, even if the stakeholders have no  new information to present.", "We found that most of the hundreds of ex parte filings in the four case  studies appeared to meet the requirements, but several did not appear to  be sufficient. These filings, which publicly document when stakeholders  meet with FCC officials, generally detailed who attended the meeting or  what arguments were raised. However, in the cable boxes rulemaking, one  filing did not reveal which organization was represented at the meeting or  what was discussed. Another filing discussed new information that was  supported by a research report, but the report was not included with the  ex parte filing. If the information is not filed in the public record with the  ex parte filing, then it cannot be used to support a rulemaking. Therefore,  stakeholders have an incentive to file complete ex parte disclosures. We  also found some ex parte comments in three of the four case studies that  do not describe the discussion at the meeting, but refer to comments  already in the docket. While such filings may comply with ex parte rules,  the effect of this type of filing is mixed. Since the ex parte filing did not  explain those positions, it may not be very helpful to other stakeholders  because other stakeholders would have to go to the docket and look up  the party\u2019s filed comments. Some stakeholders told us that there is nothing  wrong with these kinds of ex parte filings. According to these  stakeholders, they already know the other stakeholders and what their  arguments are. As a result, these stakeholders are not concerned about the  adequacy of ex parte filings. In contrast, a few stakeholders told us that  they do not have the time or the resources to monitor each docket and,  therefore, such ex parte filings are not helpful. FCC officials told us that,  generally, bureau staff both remind stakeholders to submit ex parte filings  and review them for accuracy. If a filing is not accurate or complete, the  staff member asks the stakeholder to resubmit the filing. Stakeholders  may file a complaint with FCC if they believe that other stakeholders have  not provided complete ex parte filings. However, according to FCC  officials, very few complaints have been filed.", "We found that FCC followed its Sunshine Period rule that prohibits  unauthorized contact with FCC. In reviewing dockets and meeting with  stakeholders and FCC officials, we found no evidence of any prohibited  contact during the Sunshine Period. According to FCC officials and  numerous stakeholders, the rules are well known and stakeholders do not  generally request meetings or submit comments during this time. FCC  officials told us that, if stakeholders do try to contact FCC or submit  comments during the Sunshine Period, then FCC takes steps to ensure that  the comments are not seen by the FCC staff working on the rulemaking. In  the ILEC unbundling rulemaking, we found that several stakeholders  submitted comments to FCC during the Sunshine Period. We also found  that those comments were prominently marked in FCC\u2019s ECFS as  comments that were submitted during the Sunshine Period and were not  to be viewed by FCC staff working on the rulemaking.", "The ILEC unbundling case study took a number of months to be released  after the commission voted to approve it. The rule was adopted at a public  meeting in February 2003, but was not released until August 2003.  According to FCC officials, this delay was necessary because the final  order was approximately 800 pages and the actual wording of the order  was not voted on during the public meeting. Rather, the meeting included  votes on the policy positions and issues associated with the order but not  on the actual language. After the rule was adopted by the commission,  Wireline Competition Bureau staff worked with relevant offices to draft  the precise wording of the order, and then there were multiple  discussions, comments, and revisions as the order went through each  commissioner\u2019s office and each substantive change was approved by the  commissioners.", "The rules in our four case studies took between 1.0 and 4.5 years to  complete from the time the related NPRM was issued. Generally, however,  stakeholders told us that they are not concerned about the time it takes to  conduct a rulemaking. Stakeholders told us that, if they support a  rulemaking, they would like it to be completed more quickly. However,  these same stakeholders said they may oppose another rulemaking and  would like that rulemaking to proceed slowly or not be completed at all. In  contrast, another stakeholder told us that they always support quick  rulemakings because the businesses they represent prefer a stable  regulatory market, and ongoing rulemakings create uncertainty for some  businesses and their investors.", "Three of the four rulemakings we reviewed were challenged in court. Both  the public safety interference and the cable boxes rules were upheld by  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In the ILEC unbundling  rulemaking, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the rule in part, which  means that part of the rule was struck down, part of the rule was returned  to FCC for reconsideration, and part of the rule was upheld. In response  to the court\u2019s ruling, in August 2004, FCC issued another rule and NPRM  soliciting comment on alternatives that would be consistent with the  court\u2019s ruling, as well as a rule implementing a 12-month plan to stabilize  the telecommunications market while the new rules were being written.  Six months later, FCC issued a rule that the commission said was  consistent with the court\u2019s guidance. This rule was also challenged and  upheld by the D.C. Circuit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Stakeholders May Have an Advantage Because They Are Given Nonpublic Information", "paragraphs": ["Several stakeholders told us that they learn which items FCC is about to  vote on even though that information is not supposed to be released  outside of FCC. FCC circulates information internally approximately 3  weeks before a public meeting to inform FCC staff of what is scheduled to  be voted on at the public meeting. FCC rules prohibit the disclosure of this  information to anyone outside of FCC. Specifically, the information is  considered nonpublic information and cannot be released by any FCC  employee without authorization from the FCC chairman. FCC officials in  the units responsible for the case study rules and FCC officials in the units  that conducted most of the rulemakings between 2002 and 2006 all told us  that this is nonpublic information, and that they do not release it outside  of FCC.", "However, nine stakeholders\u2014both those involved in the case studies we  reviewed and other stakeholders with whom we spoke who regularly  participate in FCC rulemakings\u2014told us that they hear this information  from both FCC bureau staff and commissioner staff. One stakeholder\u2014 representing a large organization that is involved in numerous  rulemakings\u2014told us that FCC staff call them and tell them what items are  scheduled for a vote.", "In contrast, a number of other stakeholders told us that they do not learn  this information and do not know which items are scheduled for a vote.  These stakeholders, who generally represent consumer and public-interest  groups, told us that they do not know when FCC is about to vote on a  rulemaking or when it would be best to meet with FCC staff to make their  arguments. In contrast, stakeholders who know which items have been  scheduled for a vote know when to schedule a meeting with FCC  commissioners and staff because they know when FCC is about to vote on  a rulemaking.", "FCC officials told us that, for stakeholders to successfully make their case  before FCC, \u201ctiming is everything.\u201d Specifically, if a stakeholder knows  that a proposed rule has been scheduled for a vote and may be voted on in  3 weeks, that stakeholder can schedule a meeting with FCC officials  before the rule is voted on. In contrast, a stakeholder who does not know  that the rule is scheduled for a vote may not learn that the rule will be  voted on until the agenda is announced 1 week before the public meeting.  However, once the agenda has been announced, the Sunshine Period  begins, and no one can lobby FCC officials about the proposed rule. As a  result, the stakeholder who learns that a rule has been scheduled for a  vote 3 weeks before the vote can have a distinct advantage over a  stakeholder who learns about an upcoming vote through the public  agenda. Our case study reviews and discussions with multiple  stakeholders showed that some stakeholders know this nonpublic  information and, as a result, these stakeholders may have an advantage in  the rulemaking process.", "Even though advance knowledge that a rule is scheduled for a vote is  nonpublic information, it has been reported by news agencies in the past.  Specifically, in the cable boxes rulemaking, an industry newspaper  published a story stating that the proposed rule would likely be circulated  among the commissioners for a vote within the next few weeks. The  newspaper attributed this information to unnamed \u201cFCC sources.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several Factors May Contribute to Dockets and Rulemakings Remaining Open", "paragraphs": ["The complexity and number of issues within a docket and the priority the  commission places on an issue may all factor into how long dockets, and  the rulemakings within these dockets, remain open. FCC tracks open  dockets, which may contain one or more rulemakings. The commission  determines which rulemakings are a priority and when to open and close a  docket; therefore, the commission determines how a rulemaking and a  docket progress. Specifically, a docket may remain open because it is  broad and is intended to include multiple rulemakings or because the  commission has not voted to close the docket even though the docket  includes completed rulemakings. Some rulemakings may remain open  because they involve complex, technical issues or because competing  priorities can force FCC officials to work on one rulemaking as opposed to  another.", "As of December 2006, FCC had 133 open dockets on the Unified Agenda,  99 of which originated from three bureaus\u2014Media, Wireless  Telecommunications, or Wireline Competition\u2014and one office\u2014 Engineering and Technology. These four units had the most dockets  during the period of our analysis. These dockets remain open for a variety  of reasons. According to FCC officials, rulemakings may be completed  within a docket even if the docket remains open. As we have previously  discussed, one docket that has remained open since 1980 includes a  number of NPRMs and rulemakings that were issued.", "We selected four open dockets as case studies, each of which originated in  a different FCC unit and had been open for a different length of time.  Table 2 provides an overview of these dockets.", "According to FCC officials, there is no way to determine exactly why a  docket or a rulemaking remains open. While the chairman sets the FCC\u2019s  agenda, the commission decides when to open and close dockets and  when action will be taken on specific rulemakings, so whether or not a  docket and rulemaking remain open is ultimately a commission decision.  However, certain factors may contribute to dockets and rulemakings  remaining open, including the following:    Broad dockets. Some dockets may remain open because FCC designed  them to be broad with multiple rulemakings. For example, FCC officials  involved in the Internet protocol services case study told us that this  docket was created to encompass a variety of issues related to this topic.  Specifically, the commission wanted to initiate a rulemaking that looked at  a number of issues related to Internet protocol services and anticipated  that the docket would be open for years and would include a broad NPRM  followed by a number of rules. FCC has already completed four rules  within this open docket, including rules related to 911 service and voice- over-Internet-protocol service.", "Housekeeping. Some dockets may remain open even though the issue(s)  within the docket has been addressed by a rulemaking. For example, in  the airport terminal use case study, the docket remains open even though  the issue raised in the NPRM has been addressed with a rule. FCC officials  told us that the commission must vote to formally close a docket, and the  commission will generally wait until after stakeholders have had a chance  to file a petition for reconsideration or challenge the rulemaking in court.  As a result, dockets often remain open for a time after a rule has been  issued. FCC officials also told us that an open docket is a \u201chousekeeping\u201d  issue, and that there is no harm in having dockets remain open.  Stakeholders generally agreed that having dockets remain open is not an  issue.", "Complex/Technical issues. Within open dockets, some rulemakings may  remain open for many years because they involve complex, technical  issues. For example, the satellite coordination case study involves the  technical properties of different types of satellites and involves worldwide  coordination and complex decisions about a satellite\u2019s potential  interference with another satellite. FCC officials also told us that satellite  issues take a long time to resolve in part because of the nature of  satellites, which require a worldwide frequency, a number of different  applications, and millions of dollars. In the distributed transmission  systems (DTS) case study, FCC officials and stakeholders told us that the  issue involves complex new technology. Specifically, DTS technology  would allow broadcasters to place towers around urban areas to more  easily transmit digital programming. Within the rulemaking, stakeholders  have submitted items such as proposed geographic locations for siting the  towers to implement DTS, proposed criteria for determining if the towers  are interfering with other broadcasts, and procedures to allow for  potential additional transmitters without interference with adjacent  channels.", "Competing priorities. Some rulemakings may remain open because other  rulemakings take precedence and the number of staff available to work on  rulemakings is limited. For example, FCC officials told us that they  worked on some rulemakings that are more important to the transition to  digital television instead of the DTS rulemaking because Congress has set  a deadline for the end of the digital television transition. FCC officials  decided to focus their staff resources on more important rulemakings,  especially since only a few companies have applied to use DTS since FCC  adopted the interim DTS policy. All of the stakeholders involved in the  DTS rulemaking with whom we spoke agreed with FCC officials and told  us that other issues related to digital television are more important than  establishing permanent DTS rules. FCC officials also told us that the issues  in the DTS case study are similar to other rulemakings on the transition to  digital television. Since the staff with expertise in digital television cannot  work on every rulemaking, FCC officials have to prioritize the rulemakings  on which they work. As a result, some rulemakings, such as DTS, remain  open.", "Stakeholders generally told us that they are not concerned about the  number of open dockets. According to these stakeholders, an open docket  is not important; what matters is whether the rulemaking has been  addressed. However, as we have previously discussed, stakeholders also  told us that their views on the length of the rulemaking process could  change depending on whether or not they favor the proposed rule.  Specifically, supporters of an issue generally prefer a quick rulemaking,  while opponents are likely to favor a lengthy rulemaking process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As a regulatory agency, FCC is routinely lobbied by stakeholders with a  vested interest in the issues FCC regulates. It is critical that FCC maintain  an environment in which all stakeholders have an equal opportunity to  participate in the rulemaking process and that the process is perceived as  fair and transparent. Situations where some, but not all, stakeholders  know what FCC is considering for an upcoming vote undermine the  fairness and transparency of the process and constitute a violation of  FCC\u2019s rules. Since the success of lobbying for a particular issue can be  highly dependent on whether an issue is being actively considered, FCC  staff who disclose nonpublic information about when an issue will be  considered could be providing an advantage to some stakeholders,  allowing them to time their lobbying efforts to maximize their impact. As a  result, FCC may not hear from all sides of the issue during an important  part of the rulemaking process.

We interviewed FCC officials from the Offices of General Counsel,  Managing Director, and Engineering and Technology and the Wireline  Competition, Wireless Telecommunications, Media, and Public Safety and  Homeland Security Bureaus to determine how FCC generally conducts  rulemaking. Because we wanted to focus our review on FCC rulemaking  as it applies to regulating telecommunications and media in the United  States, we excluded rulemaking by FCC\u2019s International Bureau from the  scope of this study. We also interviewed organizations that represent a  number of industries regulated by FCC as well as public-interest  organizations to determine how these organizations participate in FCC  rulemaking. Table 3 is a list of the organizations we interviewed and the  principal sectors they represent.", "We also gathered and analyzed available data on FCC rulemaking orders  published in the Federal Register between 2002 and 2006. While each  rulemaking order may contain one or more rules, each order is generally  referred to as a rule. Therefore, throughout the report, we referred to each  rulemaking order as a rule. We used the GAO online rules database to  identify FCC rules published in the Federal Register between January 1,  2002, and December 31, 2006, and compiled a list of those rules contained  in the database as of February 1, 2007, which we refer to as \u201crecent rules.\u201d  We compiled only those rules FCC had identified as  \u201csignificant/substantive\u201d and excluded rules labeled as  \u201croutine/info./other.\u201d We then used the Federal Register to identify each  rule\u2019s FCC document number and the number of its associated docket.  With those numbers, we were able to use FCC\u2019s Web-based document  databases\u2014the Electronic Comment Filing System and the Electronic  Document Management System\u2014to retrieve FCC rulemaking documents,  such as Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), reports and orders  (R&O), and comments and ex parte filings from public participants.  NPRMs and R&Os include the dates they were adopted and released.  Using these sources, for each recent rule, we were generally able to  determine the rule\u2019s docket; the originating bureau; the dates the rule was  adopted, released, and published in the Federal Register; and the dates the  first NPRM was released in the rule\u2019s associated docket. Although some  dockets contain multiple NPRMs, we did not analyze each rule to attempt  to determine which specific NPRM(s) the rule was associated with, as it  was not always clearly stated in the rules and a content comparison  between each rule and each NPRM could not have been completed within  the time frame for this study. We analyzed these NPRMs to determine  generally why FCC initiated rulemaking.", "We reviewed selected U.S. Courts of Appeals opinions that addressed  challenges to these rules. We identified appeals court opinions published  between January 1, 2002, and June 1, 2007, using legal research databases,  FCC\u2019s Web site, and the Web site for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.  Circuit. Using citations in these cases, we identified which cases were  related to the \u201crecent rules\u201d we have previously identified. We then  gathered and analyzed the published opinions related to those recent rules  and identified the court\u2019s decision in each case. We also obtained from  FCC a list of ongoing court challenges to their rules.", "To determine the extent to which FCC followed its rulemaking process,  we selected for case study four rules that were completed between   2002 and 2006. Of the 240 rules FCC completed during that time, 190 rules  originated in the Media, Wireless Telecommunications, or Wireline  Competition Bureaus or in the Office of Engineering and Technology. We  selected one rule from each of these units. We also based our selection of  rules on why the rules were initiated, how long they took to complete, and  whether they were challenged in court. For each rule, we reviewed and  analyzed the rulemaking records and interviewed FCC officials and  stakeholders involved in the rulemakings. We used information from these  case studies to illustrate examples of FCC rulemaking; however, the  findings in our case studies cannot be generalized to all FCC rulemakings.  In addition to these case studies, we interviewed stakeholders who  represented different sectors of the telecommunications field, including  wireless providers, satellite providers, and public safety and consumer  groups. We also interviewed FCC officials in each of the four units to  obtain information on general experiences with the FCC rulemaking  process.", "To identify the factors that contributed to dockets and rulemakings  remaining open, we reviewed FCC\u2019s list of dockets in the December 2006  Federal Register\u2019s Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and  Deregulatory Actions.
