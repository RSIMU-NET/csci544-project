CWB benefits from: (1) the Canadian government's subsidies to cover CWB's periodic operational deficits, (2) monopoly over both the domestic human consumption and export wheat and barley markets which may allow for cross-subsidization, and (3) pricing flexibility through delayed producer payments. Canada's elimination of transportation subsidies in 1995 has reduced some of the indirect government support going to its wheat and barley producers, and ongoing Canadian reviews of its agricultural policies may reduce the control of CWB in the future. AWB has not received direct government subsidies in several years but enjoys a government guarantee on its payments to producers. It also enjoys indirect subsidies in the form of favorable interest rates and an authority to collect from producers for investment. The deregulation of Australia's domestic grain trade and the decline of direct government assistance have lessened the possibile trade-distorting policies of AWB. Recent studies have challenged the premise behind a single selling authority, but AWB's monopoly over wheat exports still provides it with a sure source of supply. NZDB is relatively subsidy free but benefits from its monopoly over New Zealand dairy exports and its extensive subsidiary structure worldwide. NZDB's size and exclusive purchasing authority for export also translate into market power for NZDB in certain world dairy markets. Its subsidiaries allow it to keep profits from foreign sales within the organization and take advantage of the difference between world prices and those of the country in which it is selling the goods, such as the United States. NZDB's potential to distort trade due to direct government subsidies was eliminated during the 1980s when New Zealand deregulated the domestic dairy market and stopped offering dairy farmers direct government subsidies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you requested, we have reviewed state trading enterprises in three countries: Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

Since the start of GATT, member countries have noted STEs\u2019 unique role and potential to distort world trade and have thus required them to operate in accordance with commercial considerations. STEs have been important players in the world agriculture market, particularly in wheat and dairy products. Since 1980, 16 GATT member countries have reported to the GATT secretariat that they operate STEs in their wheat sector, while 14 countries have reported STEs in their dairy sector.

However, the original drafters of GATT also understood how governments with a dual role as market regulator and market participant can engage in activities that protect domestic producers and place foreign producers at a disadvantage. A separate GATT article was established to monitor STEs and ensure they operate within GATT disciplines. Article XVII establishes a number of guidelines and requirements with respect to the activities of STEs and the obligations of member countries. In addition to holding STEs to the same disciplines as other trading entities, such as making purchases or sales in accordance with commercial considerations and allowing enterprises from other countries the opportunity to compete, the article requires periodic reporting by member countries to the GATT/WTO secretariat.", "In an August 1995 report, we commented on the disciplines placed on STEs by both article XVII and other GATT provisions. Among other things, our report noted that GATT member countries\u2019 compliance with the  article XVII reporting requirement between 1980 and 1994 had been poor. In addition, although state trading was not a major issue during the Uruguay Round negotiations, members established a definition of STEs and new measures to improve reporting compliance. Our report also highlighted the Uruguay Round\u2019s Agreement on Agriculture, which requires all countries trading in agricultural goods, including those with STEs, to observe new trade-liberalizing disciplines (the agreement is defined in the next section). Finally, our report emphasized that the effectiveness of article XVII is especially important given the potential for increases in STEs if countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (China), Russia, and Ukraine join GATT/WTO.", "Attempts to understand the role of STEs are complicated by the various measures that STEs use to control either a country\u2019s production, imports, and/or exports. As we reported in August 1995, STEs\u2019 practices to control commodities have included placing levies on production and/or imports, requiring licenses for exports, giving government guarantees, and providing export subsidies. Some STEs have justified their controls by emphasizing the needs for such things as protection against low-priced imports and safeguarding national security. governmental and nongovernmental enterprises, including marketing boards, which have been granted exclusive or special rights or privileges, including statutory or constitutional powers, in the exercise of which they influence through their purchases or sales the level or direction of imports or exports.", "As we stated in our 1995 report, it is still too early to determine the impact of the STE definition and additional measures to improve the reporting compliance of member countries. These new measures include the creation of a working party to review STE notifications. Although some GATT/WTO member countries have stated that article XVII should require that STEs report more information, such as detailed data about transaction prices, other member countries consider this information to be confidential and related to an STE\u2019s commercial interests. The absence of this information is expected to hinder those member countries concerned about the role of STEs from obtaining the type of information they say is needed to fully determine whether STEs are adhering to GATT disciplines.", "According to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials, the working group on STEs has met twice since August 1995.

Under the export subsidy commitment, countries are required to reduce their budgetary expenditures on export subsidies and their quantity of subsidized exports. Member countries are also expected to reduce their aggregate measure of selected internal support policies. These internal support policies include budgetary expenditures and revenue forgone by governments or their agents. These reductions are expected to have the effect of liberalizing trade in agricultural products, thereby increasing the flow of these products between GATT/WTO member countries. STEs are subject to these reductions.", "The United States is expected to experience economic benefits as a result of the new trade discipline in agriculture. As we reported in 1994, USDA estimated that as a result of the Uruguay Round, U.S. annual agricultural exports are likely to increase between $1.6 billion and $4.7 billion by 2000, and between $4.7 billion and $8.7 billion by 2005. Higher world income, as well as reduced tariffs and export subsidies among U.S. trade partners, is also expected to raise U.S. exports of coarse grains, cotton, dairy, meat, oilseeds and oilseed products, rice, specialty crops such as fruits and nuts, and wheat.U.S. subsidies on some agricultural products will also be reduced, most likely shrinking government support for dairy, coarse grains, meat, oilseed products, and wheat.", "Nonetheless, even with projected gains for U.S. agriculture, some U.S. producers are concerned that countries with STEs have not taken the same steps to reduce trade-distorting activities. For example, the United States developed its agricultural export subsidies to counteract those of other countries, such as members of the European Union (EU). These export subsidies were subsequently used to counteract STE practices as well.

We have already published reports on state trading, including (1) a July 1995 report that provides a summary of trade remedy laws available to investigate and respond to activities of entities trading with the United States, including STEs; (2) a report on the GATT/WTO disciplines that apply to STEs and the effectiveness of those disciplines to date; and (3) a correspondence report describing the impact of the Uruguay Round on U.S. cheese quotas and importer licensing process, as well as the operations of the New Zealand Dairy Board (NZDB) in the United States.", "Eighteen Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate have also asked us to provide more information on how STEs operate in an open, competitive marketplace. Members noted the role of state trading in the wheat and dairy sectors, saying that any trade problems in these sectors could be representative of potential problems that may affect U.S. producers, processors, exporters, and importers. We were asked to describe (1) the potential capability of export-oriented agricultural STEs to distort trade and (2) the specific potential of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), the Australian Wheat Board (AWB), and NZDB to engage in trade-distorting activities, based on their status as STEs. We agreed to review the three export STEs based upon their considerable role in international trade and not due to any assumption of trade distortion.", "To create a framework for understanding export STEs, we reviewed various trade practices and trade agreements; reviewed related literature; interviewed U.S., GATT/WTO member country and GATT/WTO secretariat officials; and utilized information from STE and national government officials in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Our purpose in establishing a framework was to (1) facilitate data collection in the three countries, (2) allow for various STE characteristics to be reported in a consistent and organized manner, and (3) determine the relevant relationships maintained by STEs and thereby come to some conclusion about whether or not an STE is able to distort international trade. We used the framework as a tool to try to partially overcome the transparency (openness) problem found in international trade in both the dairy and wheat sectors. The absence of transaction-level data, protected as commercial practice by both STE and private sector traders, necessitated another way of evaluating STEs\u2019 influence on the market. However, foreign countries\u2019 STEs and private firms are under no obligation to provide these data, since we have no audit authority over them. Even with this information, such an extensive analysis would require additional data regarding production costs. As such, definitive conclusions regarding STEs\u2019 trade-distorting activities cannot be reached, given the complexity of the overall task. The framework underwent a peer review by economists at WTO, USDA\u2019s FAS and Economic Research Service (ERS), the Congressional Research Service, and a private sector agricultural organization. We made changes in the framework where appropriate.", "To obtain information about STE operations in Canada, we interviewed officials from CWB, Agriculture Canada, the Canadian Grain Commission, the Canadian International Grains Institute, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, private sector grain traders, and provincial grain associations.

This diversity makes it hard to generalize about the effects of STE operations on particular markets or on the world trading system. This is true even among CWB, AWB, and NZDB, which are the subject of this report. As a result, it is necessary to consider STEs on a case-by-case basis to understand their potential effects. We developed our framework for reference to incorporate information from a variety of sources that we believe should be considered in an analysis of the potential effects of individual export STEs. In subsequent chapters, we use this framework in reviewing three specific export STEs.", "Using this framework, we divided the relationships of export STEs into three groups: the relationship of the STE to domestic producers, the relationship of the STE to the government, and the relationship of the STE to foreign buyers. (See fig. 2.1)", "Using such a framework provided advantages in the collection, reporting, and interpretation of information on STE operations. First, it should aid in the collection of a consistent and comprehensive set of information about the operations of these entities. Similarly, it facilitated reporting about STE characteristics since the material can be described in an organized manner. Finally, the framework helped in the interpretation of the information about STEs since it distinguished between important characteristics and those that are less important. In each of the relationships, we considered the advantages and disadvantages the STE might have in relation to its private sector counterparts. In particular, we highlighted those characteristics that might provide a unique advantage in international markets, especially those that have the potential to distort trade. We also included material on a number of practices that are common to both private firms and STEs, even if they are not trade distorting. Some of these practices have been the cause of concern among industry observers.", "We developed this framework based on our own expertise in reviewing various trade practices and trade agreements, our review of related literature, and our discussions with STEs and officials with national governments and international organizations that deal with STE issues. We circulated a draft of this framework among agency officials and solicited their comments. The discussion of the framework in this chapter draws upon examples from CWB, AWB, and NZDB. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 provide more detailed descriptions of those boards using the framework set forth in this chapter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "STE Relationship With Domestic Producers", "paragraphs": ["One of the relationships that is central to the discussion of export STEs is the relationship between the STE and the domestic producers. Two aspects of this relationship are important: (1) the ownership and management of the STE by the domestic producers and (2) the requirement that domestic producers sell to the STE."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Producers Can Play Management and Ownership Roles in STEs", "paragraphs": ["The ownership and management structure can vary significantly across STEs: these characteristics may provide insights into the goals of the enterprises. For example, STEs can be owned and managed entirely by producers, where all of the returns from the sales are given back to the producers in the form of profits. In these cases, we might expect the organization to try to maximize its own returns by selling at the highest prices possible. The stated objectives of the three STEs we assessed suggest that they are all producer oriented (see app. I for the three STEs\u2019 objectives and other information). In each case, these enterprises seem to be operated on behalf of farmers. For example, the CWB annual report for 1993-94 states: \u201cThe CWB focuses on maximizing performance for prairie farmers,\u201d while the AWB literature says that its mission is to \u201cmaximize long-term returns to Australian grain growers.\u201d", "Alternatively, if the STE is owned or managed by some group other than the producers, it is possible that it might have a different goal, such as maximizing domestic political benefits. In these cases, the STE might choose to sell the commodity at prices that are advantageous to certain domestic groups. In this situation, the STE might be able to use its monopoly authority to lower the returns to producers. This would allow the STE to sell at a lower price in either the domestic or the international market. However, if the STE is successful in lowering returns to producers, this will make those sales less attractive, eventually drive marginal producers from the market, and decrease supply.", "The management of the STE could also make other changes in the terms, such as pooling the returns of producers. For example, the STE may choose to pay the producers the same return regardless of the time of delivery during the marketing year. For example, CWB describes price pooling efforts as \u201csomething which smooths out the seasonal fluctuations in prices and reflects the values that are achieved over the course of a marketing year.\u201d This might make it easier for some producers to secure commercial financing by reducing the volatility of the returns to producers. However, these practices may also have disadvantages, since this feature would remove some of the incentive for the individual producers to try to be responsive to world markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of STE Control Over Producers\u2019 Sales Can Vary", "paragraphs": ["One of the central elements of an export STE is the relationship of the STE to the domestic producers. As part of their status as government-related entities, STEs often have some control over the sales of particular commodities. However, the extent of this control can vary. In some cases, the STE may have exclusive rights to acquire a commodity destined for export from producers in designated regions, as in the case of CWB, or from the nation, as in the case of NZDB. Under this authority, NZDB typically handles the export transactions, and sometimes licenses private firms to do the exporting. This type of authority might provide certain advantages in terms of size over individual producers or groups of producers who attempt to export on their own behalf.", "Exclusive purchasing authority can provide the STE with a more secure source of supply than would be the case for a private exporter. Depending upon the size of the domestic market and the extent of the purchasing authority, an STE can count on a certain level of supply for its export sales. This may increase its willingness to enter into long-term supply relationships. However, the success of the STE over a period of years depends more upon its ability to charge high prices and generate high returns for producers. These high returns keep the marginal suppliers in business and induce others to increase their production for the STE. These pressures are similar to those facing private exporters.", "A somewhat different situation exists when the STE has exclusive authority to purchase all production of a particular commodity, whether destined for domestic or export markets. Although none of the three enterprises we reviewed has control over all exports and all domestic sales, CWB does have control over all wheat and barley sales for human consumption from the western provinces. This additional authority over domestic sales could provide the STE with the ability to charge different prices in the domestic and export market. For example, if the STE\u2019s goal were to increase consumption in the domestic market, it could charge higher prices abroad in order to subsidize the domestic price. On the other hand, if the STE\u2019s goal were to maximize exports, it might charge higher prices to domestic consumers and use the profits to lower the export price. When the export prices are below the cost of production, these actions are referred to as \u201ccross-subsidization,\u201d and are potentially trade distorting.", "Two factors are important in considering the ability of an STE to engage in this type of cross-subsidy. One is the openness of the STE\u2019s domestic market to imports. If the domestic market is open to shipments from abroad, the ability of the STE to raise the domestic price would be limited by the availability of imports from the world market. On the other hand, if the market is closed to imports, this would create at least the potential for the STE to raise prices above the level of the world price. For example, AWB must compete with both domestic wheat sellers and foreign wheat sellers for a share of the Australian domestic wheat market. As a result, an STE with both domestic market and export authority that operates from a closed market has more potential for trade distortion than an STE with only two of those factors. None of the STEs that we reviewed has all these capabilities.", "Finally, the extent to which this type of cross-subsidization is possible depends in part upon the relative size of the domestic and the export markets. For example, the fact that CWB exports more than 85 percent of the wheat under its control limits its ability to cross-subsidize. Domestic prices would have to be raised significantly in order to collect enough funds to lower the export price in any meaningful way."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Government Can Provide Financial Advantages to the STE", "paragraphs": ["Certain types of relationships between the STE and the government could provide financial benefits to the STE that would not be available to private firms. For example, direct subsidies could provide advantages for the STE over its competitors in the international market. Other government actions may also provide benefits for the STE, but these may or may not be related to the fact that the exporter in a particular industry happens to be organized as an STE."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Direct Subsidies Could Enable the STE to Lower Prices", "paragraphs": ["The most obvious type of advantage a government can provide is direct subsidies paid out from general revenues to STEs. These funds could be used to reduce the prices of exports to gain an advantage in the international market. If these subsidies are used in an isolated case, they could have the effect of protecting the producers from unusually low prices. For example, the Canadian government provided financial assistance in the 1990-91 marketing year to CWB during a year when market prices were low, thus diminishing the impact of the low prices on producers. If these subsidies were provided on a regular basis, the higher returns to subsidized producers would likely lead to an increase in the supply of the commodity and reduce the sales and profits of other producers in the world market. These kinds of changes are generally considered trade distorting in the international markets.", "There are other ways in which a government could provide financial assistance to the STE. For example, a special tax advantage for an STE could reduce the amount of taxes for an STE or its domestic suppliers. Alternatively, if the STE is allocated tariff revenues on imports of the commodities, these revenues could be used to lower the price of its exports. In each of these cases, the potential exists for government assistance to be used to lower the prices of the STE to increase sales without lowering the prices received by producers. These actions have the potential to distort trade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indirect Subsidies May Also Provide Benefits to an STE", "paragraphs": ["In addition, there are a number of ways in which a government might provide indirect advantages to an STE. One of these indirect benefits is the interest rate advantage that might accrue to those firms that are associated with the government. Because the perceived risk of lending to governments is usually lower than the risk of lending to private entities, the costs of borrowing money are typically lower for governments than for private organizations. Because of their association with the government, STEs might thus have a lower cost of borrowing than a private organization with the same characteristics.", "The extent of this advantage would be difficult to estimate but would depend upon the amount of borrowing and the difference between the borrowing rate of the STE and the rate of a private entity with similar characteristics but without the government association. In cases where the government has actually stepped in to provide funds when the STE was in danger of default, the difference would tend to be the highest. On the other hand, in situations where the government has not provided funds since the inception of the STE, the difference would tend to be the lowest.", "There are other situations in which the STE may not pay the full cost of services provided. One example is a transportation subsidy where the stated cost of transporting commodities has been held significantly below the true cost, although these subsidies may or may not be related to the STE. For example, in the case of a transportation subsidy, it could be that the STE happens to be operating in an industry where this type of subsidy exists. While the STE might benefit from the subsidy, the potential for trade distortion comes from the indirect subsidy itself, whether it is a transportation subsidy or some other type of subsidy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "STE Relationship to Foreign Buyers Depends Upon Other Factors", "paragraphs": ["It is also useful to examine the relationship between the STE and the foreign buyers to determine whether there is any unique advantage to operating as an STE in foreign markets. For example, as single sellers from export markets, STEs may have certain advantages in terms of spreading costs and achieving unity among producers. Some of these STE characteristics appear to be especially important in selling to foreign markets restricted by import quotas. In other situations, however, STEs appear to rely chiefly on practices that are also available to commercial exporters."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "STE as Single Seller May Provide Certain Advantages", "paragraphs": ["An STE might provide certain advantages in terms of size and experience over individual producers acting on their own behalf. The costs of operating an office with specialized expertise in exports is likely to be considerable, and the larger scale of operations of an STE might enable these costs to be spread over a much greater volume of sales. NZDB officials noted that individual farmers or cooperatives would have a difficult time marketing dairy products on their own; thus, NZDB provides a mechanism through which the New Zealand dairy farmer can compete in a global marketplace. Multinational firms may not have the captive source of supply, but can achieve economies of scale through efficient operations and establishing relationships with producers in various countries and in various commodities.", "The establishment of an STE can also lead to a reduction in the number of exporters and an increase in the market power of the remaining participants. This might allow the STE to be more effective in certain situations in acting as a cartel to maintain higher prices than a collection of private firms. The distinction between the STE and the producers who sell to an exporter or participate in a cooperative is that the STE can prevent its producers from selling at a discount. Private firms and cooperatives would generally rely on voluntary cooperation and would therefore have the ability to offer discounts from the prices set by the cooperative. To the extent that STEs can extend their control over supply through collusion with other exporters, their ability to influence the market would increase. However, the exercise of market power over more than one year depends on the response of other suppliers to those higher prices. If those higher prices result in greater production by other nations, the STE may face additional competition in the market in the following years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "STEs May Have an Advantage in Controlled Import Markets", "paragraphs": ["There are other ways in which STEs might have an advantage in exporting to controlled import markets. One reason is that the importing nation may be more responsive to export promotion efforts when they are government affiliated, such as an STE. STEs with control over the exports of a commodity may also have an advantage in selling into a market that is protected by a quota. In this case, the STE is better able to capture the full difference between the lower world price and the higher price in the protected market through the establishment of a subsidiary in the importing nation. For example, NZDB has set up a wholly owned subsidiary for importing quota cheese products into the United States. As a sole exporter selling to a subsidiary in the protected market, NZDB has been able to capture more of the return than would have been possible in selling to an independent agent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "STEs May Use Commercial Practices in Dealing With Foreign Buyers", "paragraphs": ["There may also be differences in the way that STEs deal with foreign buyers. However, our ability to analyze sales practices is somewhat limited by the lack of transaction-level price information for either STEs or private firms. Recognizing this limitation, nevertheless it is useful to identify certain practices of firms and STEs in international markets and ask whether the status of the STE offers any particular advantages.", "Price discrimination is the practice of distinguishing between buyers of a particular good or service in order to charge a higher price to some buyers and a lower price to others. With the right combination of market characteristics, some sellers may be able to increase their profits because the lower-priced sales do not affect their sales to premium customers. STEs may be able to lower the price to certain importing countries without affecting the prices to its other customers. However, the important part of price discrimination is to be able to charge a higher price to premium customers. If there are other sellers willing to sell at a known world price, as there are in many commodity markets, it is not obvious why any buyer would ever be willing to pay a higher price to the STE. As a result, the success of the price discrimination would depend upon the existence of other producers willing to sell at the world price, rather than the fact that one seller happens to be an STE.", "One particular type of price discrimination is \u201cpredatory pricing,\u201d where a seller or group of sellers lowers prices for the purpose of driving other sellers from a market by using higher prices from one market to lower prices in a second market. If successful, the remaining seller(s) can raise prices once the competition has been eliminated. However, we did not examine data to determine whether STEs practice predatory pricing, or how STEs might provide any unique advantage in this area. Successful predatory pricing would depend upon the existence of barriers to entry in the agricultural commodity markets, which would prevent new competitors from taking the place of those eliminated from the market. Predatory pricing implies a certain size in relation to the available market. In these cases, the important issue is whether the STE or the multinational firms have that type of market power.", "STEs might use other practices such as engaging in long-term supply arrangements or emphasizing quality to differentiate its products and services from those of other sellers. For example, STEs might be able to set some uniform grading standards for the producers; in fact, AWB sets standards for its wheat for export and further classifies the wheat based on quality and variety. Similarly, CWB has emphasized the high quality of the grain as a marketing strategy, but in some cases may have provided a higher quality than the customer required, potentially reducing the returns to the Canadian farmers. The success of these efforts in raising returns to producers would depend upon whether the STE is more responsive to the demands of world markets than a private firm. In these cases, it is useful to ask whether the practices are somehow unique to STEs or could be equally\u2014or perhaps more effectively\u2014practiced by any seller in the market.
