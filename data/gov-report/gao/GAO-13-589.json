In 2011, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) reported that DOD assessments often lacked sufficiently detailed narratives. Section 806 of the NDAA for 2012 required DOD to develop a strategy to ensure that contractor performance assessments are complete, timely, and accurate. Section 806 also required GAO to report on DOD's actions and their effectiveness. GAO (1) identified actions taken by DOD to improve the quality and timeliness of past performance information and implement provisions of the act, and (2) assessed the effectiveness of those actions. GAO reviewed DOD policy and guidance, and interviewed DOD and OFPP officials. GAO also reviewed available data on compliance with reporting requirements from 2011-2013 and timeliness data for fiscal years 2010-2012.

The number of personnel trained more than doubled since 2010 to more than 7,000, and DOD oversight officials now have the ability to track compliance with reporting requirements down to the level of individual contracting offices. DOD continues to utilize existing past performance guidance, which generally aligns with requirements specified in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2012.", "Compliance metrics show that the submission of required assessments has increased. Specifically, the percentage of required assessments submitted increased from 56 to 74 percent from October 2011 to April 2013. Officials at DOD said the ability to track completion of assessments has greatly improved oversight and accountability. Despite this progress, DOD faces challenges completing assessments on time.", "DOD officials attribute the lack of timeliness to acquisition workforce shortages, turnover, and the difficulty in obtaining needed information. DOD is working with other agencies on a regulatory change, consistent with a requirement in the NDAA for 2012, that would reduce the time allowed for contractors to submit comments on draft assessments. This change should help officials submit final assessments on a more timely basis."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on thousands of contractors to  perform a broad array of activities needed to meet its mission. Therefore,  complete and timely information regarding contractor\u2019s past performance  is critical to ensuring that the government does business with companies  that deliver quality goods and services on time and within budget. The  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to document  contractor performance on contracts that exceed certain dollar thresholds  and to make such information available to other agencies through a  shared government-wide database. We reported in 2009, however, that  the DOD components had completed assessments for less than half of  the fiscal year 2007 contracts that required such an assessment. Agency  officials noted at the time that a low priority for completing assessments  and a lack of system tools and metrics to monitor compliance made it  difficult for managers to ensure timely completion of contractor  performance assessments. The need to improve both the quantity and  quality of past performance information also was highlighted in a 2011  Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) report that found that DOD  and other federal agency contractor assessments often lacked quality  narrative information, such as sufficient details about how the contractor  exceeded expectations or corrected poor performance, to support the  assessment. According to OFPP, some of the deficiencies identified were  likely due to staff shortages and the lack of training.", "Section 806 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2012 required DOD to develop a strategy for ensuring that  contractor past performance assessments are complete, timely, and  accurate. Section 806 outlines several requirements related to  documenting contractor performance and obtaining contractor comments  on performance assessments. In addition, section 806 also requires the  Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to be  revised to require that contractor assessments be posted to the  databases used for making source selection decisions no later than 14  days after delivery of the performance assessment to the contractor. The  act also mandates us to report on DOD\u2019s actions to implement the  required provisions. For this report, we (1) identified the actions taken by  DOD to improve the quality and timeliness of past performance  information and implement provisions of the act, and (2) assessed the  effectiveness of those actions.", "To identify DOD\u2019s actions to improve the timeliness and quality of  contractor past performance information and implement provisions of the  act, we reviewed DOD policy and guidance related to contractor  assessments. We also interviewed DOD officials responsible for  contractor past performance information at the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the three  DOD components\u2014the Air Force, Army, and Navy\u2014 which account for  more than 90 percent of DOD\u2019s required assessments; and the  Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and  Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) program offices  to discuss actions taken or planned. We also interviewed DOD and  OFPP officials to discuss the status of implementing the requirement to  submit contractor assessments to the past performance database within  14 days. To assess the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s past performance efforts,  we reviewed data for calendar years 2011 to 2013 for compliance with  contractor assessment requirements. To assess the reliability of these  data, we reviewed system information and tested the processes and  found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report. In  addition, we obtained data for fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012 on the  number of DOD contracting officials that received training on contractor  past performance reporting and the timeliness of performance  assessments. We also reviewed an OFPP report on compliance with  reporting requirements and quality of assessments.

During the source selection process, contracting officials often rely on  various sources of past performance information, such as the prospective  contractor\u2019s prior government or industry contracts for efforts similar to  the government\u2019s requirements, and the past performance information  housed in the government-wide PPIRS database.", "Once a contract is awarded, the agency should monitor the contractor\u2019s  performance throughout the performance period. At the time the work is  completed, the FAR requires agencies to prepare an assessment of the  contractor\u2019s performance for contracts or orders that exceed the simplified  acquisition threshold. DOD has dollar thresholds that are generally  higher than the simplified acquisition threshold for contractor  assessments, which vary based on business sector.", "To document and manage contractor performance information internally,  DOD has used CPARS since 2004. The system, which was developed by  the Navy, incorporates processes and procedures for drafting and  finalizing assessments, which are described in the CPARS Guide. The  assessing official rates the contractor based on various elements such as  quality of product or service, schedule, cost control, business relations,  small business utilization, and management of key personnel. For each  applicable rating element, the assessing official determines a rating  based on definitions in the CPARS Guide that generally relates to how  well the contractor met the contract requirements and responded to  problems. In addition, for each rating element, a narrative is required to  provide examples and support for the assessment.", "Once draft assessments are completed by the assessing official, the  contractor is notified that the assessment is available for their review and  comment through CPARS.

For example, contracting managers can identify overall compliance  for their office and identify specific non-compliant contracts with this new  tracking tool.", "Officials at DOD components told us that having the ability to track  completion of required assessments through PPIRS has greatly improved  the ability to effectively oversee and manage compliance, and has also  improved accountability for completing assessments. In an effort to  increase accountability, the Director of Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy issues quarterly compliance reports to senior  procurement executives.

However, the majority  of assessments completed each year exceeded the 120-day standard for  timeliness.
