This approach has limited NASA's ability to mitigate technical risks early in development and precludes the orderly ramp up of workforce and developmental activities. In response to these gaps, NASA delayed the date of its first crewed-flight and changed its acquisition strategy for the Orion project. NASA acknowledges that funding shortfalls reduce the agency's flexibility in resolving technical challenges. The program's risk management system warned of planned work not being completed to support schedules and milestones. Consequently, NASA is now focused on providing the capability to service the International Space Station and has deferred the capabilities needed for flights to the moon. Though these changes to the overarching requirements are likely to increase the confidence level associated with a March 2015 first crewed flight, these actions do not guarantee that the program will successfully meet that deadline. Nevertheless, NASA estimates that Ares I and Orion represent up to $49 billion of the over $97 billion estimated to be spent on the Constellation program through 2020.

While the fact that the review is taking place does not  guarantee wholesale changes to the current approach, it does implicitly  recognize the challenges facing the Constellation program. We believe this  review is appropriate as it presents an opportunity to reassess both  requirements and resources for Constellation as well as alternative ways  for meeting requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of NASA\u2019s final plans for moving forward, the agency faces  daunting challenges developing human rated spacecraft for use after the  Space Shuttle is retired, and it is important that the agency lay out an  acquisition strategy grounded in knowledge-based principles that is  executable with acceptable levels of risk within the program\u2019s available  budget. As NASA addresses the findings and recommendations of the  Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee, we recommend  that the new NASA Administrator direct the Constellation program, or its  successor, to develop a sound business case\u2014supported by firm  requirements, mature technologies, a preliminary design, a realistic cost  estimate, and sufficient funding and time\u2014before proceeding into  implementation, and, if necessary, delay the preliminary design review  until a sound business case demonstrating the program\u2019s readiness to  move forward into implementation is in hand."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report (see app. II), NASA  concurred with our recommendation. NASA acknowledged that, while  substantial work has been completed, the Constellation program faces  knowledge gaps concerning requirements, technologies, funding,  schedule, and other resources.  NASA stated that it is working to close  these gaps before committing to significant, long-term investments in the  Constellation program. NASA stated that the Constellation program  manager is required to demonstrate at the preliminary design review that  the program and its projects meet all system requirements with acceptable  risk and within cost and schedule constraints, and that the program has  established a sound business case for proceeding into the implementation  phase. At this point, the NASA Agency Program Management Council will  review the Constellation program and determine the program\u2019s readiness  to proceed into the implementation phase and begin detailed design.  Separately, NASA provided technical comments, which have been  addressed in the report, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you announce its contents earlier, we  will not distribute this report further until 30 days from its date.

We interviewed and  received briefings from officials associated with the Constellation program  office, including Exploration Systems Mission Directorate officials at  NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C.; Orion project and Constellation  program officials at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas; and,  Ares I and J-2X officials at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,  Alabama, regarding the program and projects\u2019 risk areas and test strategy,  technical challenges, the status of requirements, acquisition strategy and  the status of awarded contracts.", "We also conducted interviews and received briefings from NASA  contractors on heritage hardware and design changes, and top risks and  testing strategy, for the J-2X engine, Ares I First Stage, Ares I Upper Stage,  Launch Abort System, and Orion vehicle. We analyzed risk documented  through the Constellation program\u2019s Integrated Risk Management  Application and followed up with project officials for clarification and  updates to these risks. We also attended the Constellation Program\u2019s  Quarterly Risk Review at the Johnson Space Center.", "In addition, we interviewed Constellation program officials from Johnson  Space Center about program risks, requirements, and the impact of budget  reductions. We also spoke with NASA headquarters officials from the  Exploration Systems Mission Directorate\u2019s Resources Management Office  in Washington, D.C., to gain insight into the program\u2019s top risks and the  basis for fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2010 budget requests as well  as the funding strategy employed by the Constellation program.  Furthermore, we reviewed NASA\u2019s program and project management  directives and systems engineering directives. Our review and analysis of  these documents focused on requirements and goals set for spaceflight  systems. We compared examples of the centers\u2019 implementation of the  directives and specific criteria included in these directives with our best  practices work on system acquisition.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2008 through  August 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
