About 36,000 labs that perform certain complex tests must be surveyed biennially by either a state or one of six private accrediting organizations. CMS oversees implementation of CLIA requirements and the activities of survey organizations. GAO was asked to examine (1) the quality of lab testing; (2) the effectiveness of surveys, complaint investigations, and enforcement actions in detecting and addressing lab problems; and (3) the adequacy of CMS's CLIA oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Because of limited comparable data from CMS and survey organizations, too little is known about the quality of lab testing. For example, a standardized assessment of lab quality across survey organizations is not possible because of different definitions of what constitutes a serious quality problem. One survey organization had no systematic way of identifying the problematic labs it inspects. However, GAO's analysis of an indicator that measures a lab's ability to consistently produce accurate test results suggests that lab quality may not have improved at hospital labs in recent years. Based on an analysis of available data and interviews with CMS and survey organizations, real and potential lab quality problems are masked by survey, complaint, and enforcement weaknesses. Because most survey organizations announce the timing of biennial surveys, allowing labs to prepare for inspections, surveys may not provide a realistic picture of lab quality. Although two survey organizations that generally inspect hospital labs plan to begin unannounced surveys in 2006, they may not be possible at physician office labs that have irregular hours. Survey organizations that typically inspect such labs, however, provide more advance notice about upcoming inspections than CMS allows states to provide. Several other factors suggest that surveys and complaints do not present a realistic picture of lab quality. Interviews with officials from a sample of states confirmed that some survey organizations do not cite all serious deficiencies, as evidenced by variability in the limited available lab survey data. Officials said that surveyors may be reluctant to cite deficiencies because they view their role as educational, not regulatory; moreover, CMS has instructed state surveyors not to cite some deficiencies for over 2 years after implementing new lab requirements. Finally, lab workers may file complaints infrequently because of concern about retaliation and a lack of understanding about how to file a complaint. CMS rarely imposes sanctions, even for labs with the same repeat deficiencies, a reflection of the educational focus of the CLIA program. CMS does not require labs to participate in a key quality assurance test as frequently as CLIA requires. Although funded by lab fees, CMS officials indicated that the program has not been allowed to hire sufficient staff to carry out the agency's oversight responsibilities. Moreover, CMS's principal oversight tool, intended to determine if all serious deficiencies were identified, lacks independence because many oversight reviews are conducted simultaneously with survey organizations. CMS's presence may make surveyors more attentive to survey tasks than when they are not being observed. Compared to independent reviews, simultaneous reviews rarely identify missed deficiencies. Furthermore, CMS does not collect and analyze data on serious deficiencies identified by each survey organization and thus, is unable to assess whether lab quality is improving or declining. Nor does CMS effectively analyze other key data such as the use of sanctions. To improve oversight, CMS is establishing a nationwide complaints database. CMS is also instituting annual survey organization performance reviews."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Clinical lab tests are one of the most frequently billed Medicare  procedures and, according to the American Clinical Laboratory  Association, affect an estimated 70 percent of medical decisions. To  improve oversight of clinical labs, Congress passed legislation in 1967;  renewed concerns about quality, including errors in Pap smear tests used  to diagnose cervical cancer, resulted in enactment of the Clinical  Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). In recent years,  despite CLIA, lab quality problems in several states have raised questions  about the adequacy of lab oversight. Lab oversight is critical because  inaccurate or unreliable lab tests may lead to improper treatment,  unnecessary mental and physical anguish for patients, and higher health  care costs.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for  overseeing compliance with CLIA requirements. As of December 2005,  there were approximately 193,000 labs nationwide, ranging from very  small physician office labs that conduct fewer than 2,000 tests annually to  hospital labs that conduct millions of tests each year. Most clinical labs  regulated under CLIA must obtain a certificate from CMS but only about  19 percent\u2014those that conduct moderate- to high-complexity tests\u2014 undergo biennial inspections, which are also referred to as surveys. The  surveys assess lab compliance with mandated personnel and testing  standards. In addition, surveyed labs must participate in proficiency  testing, a program that requires them to test samples with unknown  characteristics that are then graded by an external party. Labs with serious  deficiencies may be sanctioned, e.g., required to cease testing. Labs have a  choice of being surveyed by (1) their state survey agency, under contract  with CMS; (2) their state CLIA-exempt program for labs in New York and  Washington; or (3) one of six private accrediting organizations. State  survey agency inspections use CLIA requirements that are intended to help  ensure valid and reliable lab tests; the two state CLIA-exempt programs  and six accrediting organizations survey labs using their own requirements  that CMS has determined to be at least equivalent to CLIA\u2019s. Each survey  organization is also responsible for investigating complaints about lab  quality. Because of the critical importance of accurate lab test results and  oversight, you asked us to conduct a nationwide assessment of (1) the  quality of lab testing; (2) the effectiveness of surveys, complaint  investigations, and enforcement actions in detecting problems and  ensuring compliance; and (3) the adequacy of CMS oversight of the CLIA  program.", "To determine what is known about the quality of lab testing, we analyzed  data on serious deficiencies identified during surveys by state survey  agencies using CMS\u2019s On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting system  (OSCAR). The CLIA program inspection requirements are classified as  either \u201cstandard-\u201d or \u201ccondition-\u201d level. Similarly, deficiencies are also  characterized as standard- or condition-level, based on the requirement in  which the deficiency occurs. Because condition-level requirements  generally consist of one or more standard-level requirements, a deficiency  at the condition-level denotes a serious or systematic problem. We  requested comparable data on serious deficiencies from state CLIA- exempt programs and the three largest accrediting organizations\u2014the  College of American Pathologists (CAP), COLA, and the Joint Commission  on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)\u2014which together  survey about 97 percent of accredited labs. CAP, COLA, JCAHO, and  exempt-state programs each maintain their own separate databases. We  also analyzed proficiency testing data\u2014another indicator of a lab\u2019s ability  to produce accurate test results. CMS officials generally recognize OSCAR  and proficiency testing data to be reliable. We discussed the OSCAR  database with CMS officials and tailored our analysis to ensure the  accuracy of our findings. Because exempt states and accrediting  organizations survey labs using their own requirements, we worked with  them to develop data comparable to OSCAR deficiency data. We discussed  our analyses with CMS and each of the survey organizations to ensure that  we had interpreted the data correctly. Based on discussions with officials  from the three accrediting organizations, we determined that they take  appropriate steps to ensure the reliability of their data. Because it was not  practical to independently test the reliability of accrediting organization  data, we present these data as reported by those organizations.", "To assess the effectiveness of lab surveys, complaint investigations, and  enforcement mechanisms in detecting problems and securing compliance,  we reviewed the processes used to ensure the quality of clinical lab testing  and analyzed available data related to these issues. We also conducted  structured interviews with officials from (1) CMS, (2) three CMS regional   offices, (3) 10 state survey agencies, (4) the New York and Washington  CLIA-exempt programs, and (5) the three accrediting organizations. We  judgmentally selected the 10 state survey agencies to include a mixture of  states whose lab inspections identified a range of serious deficiencies from  few to many. We also discussed the quality problems discovered at a  Maryland hospital lab with a Maryland state survey agency official and  interviewed 9 of the 36 CAP surveyors who participated in surveys of this  lab from 1999 through 2003 to obtain a firsthand perspective on the CAP  survey process. Based on our review and discussions with CMS and  survey organization officials, we focused on several key issues, including  the rationale for announced surveys, the ability of lab surveys to identify  serious deficiencies, the balance struck between the regulatory and  educational goals of lab surveys, the implications of CAP\u2019s use of  volunteer surveyors from neighboring labs to conduct inspections, how  survey organizations facilitate the filing of complaints, and the use of  sanctions to encourage compliance. We analyzed data on the number of  complaints received by each survey organization from 2002 through 2004  and discussed CAP\u2019s initiatives to encourage the filing of complaints. In  addition, we determined the extent to which labs had the same serious  problems on consecutive surveys and discussed with CMS the steps the  agency had taken to deter an inconsistent pattern of compliance.", "To assess the effectiveness of CMS oversight of the CLIA program, we  analyzed the laws and regulations that define CMS\u2019s role and authority. We  also reviewed CMS\u2019s process for determining that the survey requirements  and procedures of state CLIA-exempt programs and accrediting  organizations are at least equivalent to those of CLIA. We analyzed the  results of validation reviews that federal surveyors from CMS regional  offices conducted for state survey agency lab inspections and that state  survey agency staff conducted for accrediting organization inspections  from 1999 through 2003. We also examined other mechanisms that CMS  uses to hold survey organizations accountable for their performance:   (1) the collection and analysis of data on surveys, complaints, and  enforcement actions, including steps taken to address communication and  coordination issues that became evident during a complaint investigation  at a Maryland hospital lab; and (2) recently developed annual reviews that  measure state survey agency compliance with CLIA program  requirements, such as the timeliness of surveys.

For example, CLIA strengthened personnel  requirements for lab workers, strengthened proficiency testing that  evaluates the accuracy of lab testing between surveys, and created a range  of sanctions to enforce compliance.", "Most clinical labs regulated under CLIA must obtain a certificate from  CMS and pay fees every 2 years to cover the costs of administering the  CLIA program, including surveys and other oversight activities. The fees  vary based on the complexity and volume of testing performed. Lab tests  are categorized as waived, moderate, or high complexity. Approximately  81 percent of all labs (about 157,000) are not subject to routine biennial  surveys because they perform (1) \u201cwaived\u201d tests, which are examinations  and procedures that have an insignificant risk of erroneous results,  including those approved for home use or determined to employ  methodologies so simple or accurate that the likelihood of erroneous  results is negligible; or (2) tests performed during the course of a patient  visit with a microscope on specimens that are not easily transportable."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Surveyed Labs", "paragraphs": ["CLIA establishes more stringent requirements for the 19 percent (about  36,000) of labs performing moderate- or high-complexity testing, including  the requirement for a survey and participation in routine proficiency  testing.

Surveys examine lab compliance with CLIA  program requirements in several areas including: personnel qualifications,  proficiency testing, quality control, quality assurance, and recordkeeping.", "Personnel: CLIA sets minimum qualifications for all persons performing or  supervising moderate- or high-complexity lab tests and specifies  responsibilities for each position.", "Proficiency testing: Surveyed labs must participate in an approved  external proficiency testing program, which evaluates the accuracy of  laboratory testing. Under this requirement, labs purchase samples with  unknown characteristics several times each year from an approved  proficiency testing provider. The lab is required to test the samples with  its routine patient testing, and the results are returned to the testing  provider to be graded. A proficiency testing failure is defined as  unsatisfactory performance on two consecutive or two out of three testing  events. The results of proficiency testing for all inspected labs are  transmitted to CMS and maintained in a database.", "Quality control: Labs must have a process for routinely monitoring  personnel, testing equipment, and the testing environment to ensure  proper operation and accurate results.", "Quality assurance: Labs must follow their plan to monitor the overall  operation of the laboratory on an ongoing basis and must resolve  identified problems that affect the quality of their testing.", "Recordkeeping: Labs must maintain an audit trail of testing that  documents specimen integrity and test performance for all phases of the  test process from the test order to the test report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Organizations", "paragraphs": ["In general, labs have a choice of who conducts their surveys\u2014state survey  agencies using CLIA inspection requirements or other survey  organizations that use requirements CMS has determined to be at least  equivalent to CLIA\u2019s. CMS contracts with state survey agencies in most  states to inspect labs against CLIA requirements. CLIA established an  approval process to allow states and private accrediting organizations to  use their own requirements to survey labs. As noted earlier, New York  and Washington operate CLIA-exempt programs and CMS has approved  six private, nonprofit accrediting organizations to survey labs\u2014the  American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Osteopathic  Association (AOA), the American Society of Histocompatibility and  Immunogenetics (ASHI), CAP, COLA, and JCAHO. The requirements of  both state CLIA-exempt programs and accrediting organizations must be  reviewed by CMS at least every 6 years to ensure CLIA equivalency, but  may be more stringent than those of CLIA. For example, when inspecting  labs engaged in moderate- and high-complexity testing, New York and  some accrediting organizations also look at the labs\u2019 procedures for  conducting \u201cwaived\u201d tests, which is not required under CLIA.

Surveys are typically conducted by former or current lab  workers, who assess lab compliance with CLIA or CLIA-equivalent  requirements. Most lab inspections are announced, that is, the lab has  advance notice of when the survey will occur. Generally, surveyors verify  that lab personnel are appropriately qualified to conduct testing, evaluate  proficiency test records, check equipment and calibration to ensure that  appropriate quality control measures are in place, and determine whether  the lab has a quality assurance plan and uses it to, among other things,  appropriately identify and resolve problems affecting testing quality.  Surveys also include an educational component to assist labs in  understanding how to comply with CLIA requirements. The duration of a  survey generally depends on the size\u2014in terms of the number of tests  conducted\u2014and complexity of a lab as well as the number of surveyors.  Thus, a survey conducted at a small lab may only take a few hours to  complete, while a survey at a large hospital lab may take a survey team a  full week or more.", "In addition to inspections, survey organizations are responsible for  determining the seriousness of and investigating all complaints. For those  complaints that are determined to pose immediate jeopardy\u2014an imminent  and serious threat to patient health and a significant hazard to public  health\u2014CMS requires that the investigation be initiated within 2 working  days. Complaints may be investigated on-site or through communications  between the survey organization and the lab. Complaint investigations for  all survey organizations are unannounced.", "Lab survey requirements are classified as either \u201cstandard-\u201d or \u201ccondition-\u201d  level. Generally, condition-level requirements are made up of one or more  related standard-level requirements. For example, the condition-level  requirement on enrollment and testing of samples through a proficiency  testing program has two related standard-level requirements:   (1) enrollment, which includes requirements for the lab to provide the  name of the program it has enrolled in to the Department of Health and  Human Services and authorize the release of testing data to the  department; and (2) testing, which specifies that the samples must be  tested in the same manner as any specimen and prohibits referring the test  samples to another lab for analysis.", "Deficiencies are also characterized as standard- or condition-level based  on the requirement in which the deficiency occurs. Deficiencies in  standard-level requirements, that is, standard-level deficiencies, denote  problems that generally are not serious, while condition-level deficiencies  are cited when the problems are serious or systemic in nature. A serious  problem is defined as an inadequacy in a lab\u2019s quality of services that  adversely affects, or has the potential to adversely affect, the accuracy and  reliability of patient test results. When deficiencies are found during  surveys or complaint investigations, labs are required to submit a plan of  correction, detailing how and when they will address the deficiencies.  Additionally, CMS can impose principal or alternative sanctions, or both.  Principal sanctions include revocation of a CLIA certificate, cancellation  of the right to receive Medicare payments, or limits on testing. Revocation  of a CLIA certificate is equivalent to termination from the CLIA program.  Alternative sanctions are less severe and include civil money penalties or  on-site monitoring. For condition-level deficiencies that do not involve  immediate jeopardy, labs have an opportunity to correct the deficiencies,  which we refer to as a grace period, before the sanctions are imposed.

Federal surveyors in CMS regional offices  are responsible for conducting validation reviews of state survey agency  and exempt-state program inspections, but state survey agency staff  conduct the validation reviews of accrediting organization inspections.  An objective of these reviews is to determine if all condition-level  deficiencies were identified. These reviews are conducted within 60 days  of a state\u2019s or 90 days of an accrediting organization\u2019s survey of a lab.  Starting in 1999, CMS required that at least one validation review be  conducted simultaneously with an accrediting organization\u2019s survey, a step  intended to encourage an exchange of ideas and approaches among  surveyors.

Many state survey agency  officials we interviewed also told us that their surveyors play a major  educational role. As noted earlier, surveyors from one state survey agency  do not cite condition-level deficiencies when lab workers are new but  prefer to educate the new staff. Because CMS revised its OSCAR database  in 2004, it is not possible to identify states that have consistently not cited  condition-level deficiencies, data that would help to quantify the extent to  which an educational role is substituting for appropriate regulation of  labs.", "An inappropriate balance between the educational and regulatory role is  also evident in some accrediting organization practices. One of the CAP  surveyors we interviewed with over 30 years of lab experience estimated  that the majority of pathologists\u2014individuals who generally serve as CAP  survey team leaders\u2014view surveys as educational, rather than as  assessments of compliance with lab requirements. Another surveyor told  us that CAP\u2019s survey process focuses heavily on education, and that some  survey team leaders emphasize education more than others. For COLA, the  process of educating labs begins even prior to a survey. For example,  COLA encourages labs to submit a self-assessment for review prior to the  scheduled survey so that the labs can identify COLA requirements with  which they are not in compliance. About 20 percent of all labs surveyed  during 2004 submitted a self-assessment (616 labs) and, compared to labs  that did not submit a self-assessment, fewer deficiencies were identified at  these labs during on-site surveys.", "CMS appears to be inappropriately stressing education over regulation in  its implementation of (1) 2003 lab quality control requirements for the  CLIA program and (2) proficiency testing for lab technicians who interpret  Pap smears, a test for cervical cancer. When state surveyors began  assessing compliance with new lab quality control requirements in January  2004, they were instructed to note deficiencies on a cover letter to labs  rather than on the survey report itself for a period of 2 years. Thus, such  deficiencies are not recorded in the OSCAR database. In part because of a  lack of lab \u201cbuy-in\u201d for some of the new policies and procedures, CMS  officials have extended the educational period for about another 2 years.  CMS has taken a similar educational approach to Pap smear proficiency  testing, which began in 2005. CMS will not cite deficiencies or impose  sanctions against labs in which staff fail the new Pap smear proficiency  testing in 2005 or 2006, as long as the labs and individuals involved  complete such testing, including following the regulatory protocol for  subsequent testing in the case of an initial failure. According to CMS, this  educational focus allows labs and their staff to become familiar with the  proficiency testing program and to prepare themselves for such testing,  since there was about a 13-year time lag between the 1992 regulations that  implemented CLIA and the 2005 implementation of Pap smear proficiency  testing. This educational approach seems questionable given CMS\u2019s  concern about some of the high initial proficiency test failure rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Volunteer Surveyors by CAP Raises Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Although state survey agencies, exempt-state programs, COLA, and  JCAHO employ dedicated staff surveyors, CAP relies primarily on  volunteer teams consisting of lab workers from other CAP-inspected labs  to conduct surveys. In contrast to the mandatory training and continuing  education programs in place for the staff surveyors of other survey  organizations, training for CAP\u2019s volunteer surveyors is currently optional.  CAP plans to establish a mandatory training program beginning in mid- 2006. As a condition of accreditation, labs inspected by CAP must survey  another CAP-accredited lab of similar size and composition at least once  every 2 years. According to data provided by CAP, two-thirds of volunteer  surveyors who had recently participated in a survey had no formal training  in the 3 to 5 years preceding the survey. Two CAP surveyors we  interviewed told us that they had not completed any training because it  was optional. Two other surveyors told us that they had never been  notified about the existence of optional CAP training. While full-time  surveyors employed by other survey organizations conduct from 30 to  about 200 surveys per year, CAP volunteer surveyors have much less  experience conducting surveys because they only survey about one lab  each year.", "Three of the nine CAP surveyors we interviewed stated that they believed  that mandatory training was important, but some surveyors wondered  when lab workers would have time to complete the courses because of  their demanding work schedules. According to CAP officials, however, the  required training will take only 1 to 2 days and surveyors will have a  choice of live seminars and workshops or e-learning completed at their  own computers. For ongoing training requirements, CAP plans to give  surveyors a choice of taking additional training or passing a competency  evaluation. CAP will track compliance with its new training requirements  to ensure that surveyors successfully complete training and demonstrate  competency within 2 years of participating in a survey. CAP\u2019s required  training is less extensive than that required by other survey organizations.  For example, state survey agency inspectors must complete 5 days of  basic training and periodic advanced courses afterwards while COLA staff  inspectors participate in a 5-week orientation program and an annual   20 hours of continuing education.", "The use of volunteer inspectors by CAP also raises concerns about the  appearance of a conflict of interest. These concerns arise because of the  way CAP survey teams are structured. CAP\u2019s Commission on Laboratory  Accreditation policy manual specifies that the inspection team leader is  the individual responsible for the conduct of an ongoing site inspection,  and must not be in a business, professional, or personal relationship that  would preclude an objective inspection. Furthermore, the manual states  that the inspection team leader is usually responsible for determining the  size of, and assembling, the inspection team. However, until April 2006,  CAP policy did not preclude competing labs from surveying one another or  lab survey team members from soliciting business, such as referrals, from  a lab at the conclusion of the survey. The policy was also silent about  survey team members\u2019 business, professional, or personal relationships  that could cloud their independence. Typically, inspection team leaders  are pathologists who direct other labs in the community, and the  inspection team is comprised of several employees from the team leader\u2019s  lab.", "We believe that the use of volunteers, including those from nearby labs,  and the personal and professional relationships that may exist among lab  staff and survey team members, creates the appearance of a conflict of  interest and could undermine the integrity of the survey process.  Comments from some CAP surveyors we interviewed raise a concern  about having survey team leaders who are also the day-to-day supervisors  of team members. For example, lack of agreement about the seriousness  of a deficiency could result in the team leader instructing the team to  downgrade the deficiency to a recommendation, a less serious finding that  does not appear in the inspection report. Team members who are  subordinates to the team leader may feel that they have no other recourse  than to follow the team leader\u2019s instructions. Recognizing that team  members\u2019 objectivity may be compromised in this situation, CAP\u2019s revised  conflict of interest policy instructs all parties to be cautious to retain  objectivity in fact finding throughout the inspection process.", "In discussing these findings with CAP officials, they told us that they plan  to institute a number of initiatives to help ensure survey objectivity,  including (1) resurveying the same lab by an independent team to assess  the consistency of inspections, (2) centralizing survey team assignments  performed by CAP staff, (3) not announcing surveys, and (4) not notifying  labs of the survey team composition prior to the survey."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lab Workers Who File Complaints About Quality Problems in Lab Testing Not Afforded Whistle- blower Protections", "paragraphs": ["Some lab workers may not be filing complaints about quality problems at  their labs because of anonymity concerns or because they may not be  familiar with filing procedures. Complaints about labs can come from a  variety of sources, including lab workers. Complaints are an important  tool in detecting quality problems between lab surveys. For example,  complaints about testing at a hospital lab were crucial because  information had been concealed, complicating the detection of quality  problems during the lab\u2019s surveys. As a result of a complaint, surveyors  were able to substantiate inadequate calibration of testing equipment that  could adversely affect patient care.", "Based on OSCAR data and data obtained from exempt-state programs and  accrediting organizations for 2002 through 2004, few complaints were  received about lab testing relative to the number of labs\u2014significantly less  than one complaint per lab per year. The low volume of lab complaints  may be related to complainants\u2019 concerns about anonymity and fear of  retaliation for filing a complaint. It may be easy for a lab to determine the  source of a complaint filed by a lab worker. For example, in some cases,  either the nature of the complaint or the piece of testing equipment in  question could narrow the list of possible complainants. Two CAP  surveyors we interviewed commented that, in their opinion, it would be  easy to determine the identity of a complainant. During congressional  hearings in 2004, a Maryland hospital lab worker testified that she and her  colleagues feared losing their jobs because of the complaints they filed.", "Because of the difficulty of protecting the anonymity of lab workers who  file complaints, whistle-blower protections for such individuals are  particularly important. Two of the three accrediting organizations we  interviewed have whistle-blower protections\u2014CAP and JCAHO. For  example, CAP implemented a comprehensive whistle-blower protection  policy in July 2004 that includes revocation of accreditation or other  appropriate action for any lab that directly or indirectly threatens,  intimidates, or retaliates against a lab worker. While officials from New  York and Washington\u2019s exempt-state programs told us that whistle-blower  laws in their states provide some protection for lab workers who file  complaints, officials in most of the other 10 states we interviewed told us  that they did not have any whistle-blower protections or were unable to  identify specific protections that applied to lab workers in their state.  Currently, there are no federal whistle-blower protections specifically for  workers in labs covered by CLIA. In 2005, legislation was introduced to  provide whistle-blower protections to workers in labs covered by CLIA.", "We also found that lab workers may not know how to file a complaint.  CAP experienced a significant increase in the number of complaints it  received since October 2004, when it began requiring CAP-inspected labs  to display posters on how to file complaints. Specifically, from October  through December 2004, CAP received an average of 22 complaints per  month, compared to an average of 11 complaints per month in the   9 months preceding the poster requirement. As a result, the number of  complaints about the quality of lab testing more than doubled in 2004 and  the number substantiated increased by more than 40 percent\u2014even  though the poster was only displayed for the last 3 months of 2004 (see  table 3). In September 2005, COLA also began requiring labs to display a  complaints poster similar to CAP\u2019s. It is too early, however, to determine  the impact of COLA\u2019s new complaints poster on the number, type, and  substantiation rate of complaints. Neither CMS nor JCAHO plans to  require a similar complaints poster."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lab Sanctions Are Rarely Imposed", "paragraphs": ["Few labs were sanctioned by CMS from 1998 through 2004\u2014even those  with the same condition-level deficiencies on consecutive surveys\u2014 because many proposed sanctions are never imposed. Our analysis of CMS  enforcement data from 1998 through 2004 found that 501 labs were  sanctioned, which equates to less than 3 percent of labs inspected by state  survey agencies. The most common were principal sanctions, which may  result in suspension or limitation of testing or termination from the CLIA  program; few labs were subjected to alternative sanctions, such as  directed plans of correction or civil monetary penalties (see table 4).  Appendix III shows the number of labs surveyed by state survey agencies  and the number of sanctioned labs from 1998 through 2004.", "Although few labs were sanctioned from 1998 through 2004, over 9,000  labs had sanctions proposed during that same time period. Before  sanctions go into effect, labs are given a grace period to correct condition- level deficiencies, unless the deficiencies involve immediate jeopardy, that  is, an imminent threat to patient health and significant hazard to public  health. Most labs correct the deficiencies within the grace period. CMS  officials told us that it was appropriate to give labs an opportunity to  correct such deficiencies within a prescribed time frame and thus avoid  sanctions. However, a principal objective of the enforcement process\u2014 one reflected in CMS guidance\u2014is to motivate labs to comply with CLIA  requirements, thereby helping to ensure the provision of accurate and  reliable test results. Based on the large number of labs with proposed  sanctions that were never imposed, it is unclear how effective the  enforcement process is at motivating labs to consistently comply with  CLIA requirements.", "The number of labs with the same repeat condition-level deficiencies from  one survey to the next also raises questions about the overall effectiveness  of the CLIA enforcement process. From 1998 through 2004, 274 labs  surveyed by state survey agencies had the same condition-level deficiency  cited on consecutive surveys and 24 of these labs had the same condition- level deficiency cited on more than two surveys. This analysis may  understate the percentage of labs with repeat condition-level deficiencies  because OSCAR data prior to 2004 no longer reflect about two-thirds of  condition-level requirements and associated deficiencies at the time of  those surveys. We found that only 30 of the 274 labs with repeat condition- level deficiencies had sanctions imposed\u2014either principal, alternative, or  both. According to the CLIA legislative history, congressional concern  about labs with repeat deficiencies led to alternative sanctions to provide  an enforcement option short of principal sanctions to encourage  compliance.", "From 1998 through 2004, less than 1 percent of accredited labs (81) lost  their accreditation; few of these labs were subsequently sanctioned by  CMS and many still participate in the CLIA program. Our analysis of CMS  reports on sanctioned labs found that only 9 of the 81 labs had either  principal and/or alternative sanctions imposed and that 1 of the 9 still  performs moderate- to high-complexity testing. Based on a review of its  CLIA certificate database, CMS officials told us that about half of the 81  labs still perform moderate- to high-complexity testing but could not  describe the actions taken by CMS regional offices in response to the loss  of accreditation. We contacted state survey agencies or CMS regional  office officials to determine why 3 labs that COLA concluded had cheated  on proficiency testing by referring the samples to another lab to be tested  had no sanctions imposed. The purpose of proficiency testing is to provide  an objective, external evaluation of the accuracy of a lab\u2019s test results,  which is negated when another lab analyzes the sample. By statute, the  intentional referral of samples to another lab for proficiency testing is a  serious deficiency that should result in automatic revocation of a lab\u2019s  CLIA certificate for at least 1 year. Based on our interviews, we found  that the 3 labs were allowed to continue testing because they had initiated  corrective actions; in effect, these labs were given an opportunity to  correct a deficiency that appears to have required a loss of their CLIA  certificate for at least 1 year. A fourth lab was ultimately sanctioned for  proficiency testing cheating by CMS but was allowed to continue testing  for almost 2 years after having its accreditation revoked.", "We also attempted to analyze data on other actions, short of revoking  accreditation, used by accrediting organizations to encourage lab  compliance and, in particular, how they respond to labs with serious  repeat deficiencies. According to CMS, this information is dispersed  across CMS regional offices. CAP officials told us that they could initiate  four intermediate actions including probation (lab is closely watched to  ensure correction of problems), accreditation with conditions (nonroutine  inspection to be scheduled), suspension of a lab section, and cessation of  a specific type of testing; suspension and probation were instituted in  2004. According to CAP, in 2005, 28 labs were on probation, 106 labs were  accredited with conditions, 1 lab was suspended, and 7 labs were required  to cease a specific type of test. In 2004, JCAHO awarded conditional  accreditation to 3 percent of the labs it inspects because they were not in  substantial compliance with its survey requirements, as evidenced by the  number of requirements not met; JCAHO conducts an on-site follow-up  survey at such labs.

CMS also lacks a complaints database, and therefore was  unable to assess the impact of CAP\u2019s decision to require labs to  prominently display a poster on how to file a complaint.

First implemented in 2004, the annual CLIA state performance reviews  evaluate each survey agency\u2019s ability to accomplish its lab oversight  responsibilities. The reviews, conducted on-site by CMS regional office  staff, measure performance in 13 areas, such as the timely conduct of  surveys and the appropriate documentation of any deficiencies identified.  According to CMS, the reviews are based on the performance- improvement model that characterizes much of the administration of the  CLIA program. Consequently, the primary role of regional offices in  conducting the reviews is to provide education and support for state  survey agency improvement.  For the 2004 reviews, 38 states were  required to submit corrective action plans to their respective CMS regional  offices in at least 1 of the 13 areas examined. Three areas required the  most corrective action plans: principles of documentation, proficiency  testing desk reviews, and survey time frames.", "Principles of documentation. CMS found that some state survey agencies  lacked the supervisory personnel to conduct internal reviews intended to  ensure the appropriate documentation of deficiencies. It also found that  some state survey agencies did not follow the protocol instructions on  how to quantify such reviews.", "Proficiency testing desk reviews. Because of personnel shortages, some  state survey agencies were unable to perform proficiency testing desk  reviews between surveys, waiting instead until the next on-site survey to  address unsuccessful proficiency testing. CMS plans to provide additional  surveyor training on desk review requirements.", "Survey time frames. CMS regional office staff were inconsistent in scoring  whether state survey agencies met the established time frames for initial  surveys. While some regions were lenient if a state missed the time frame  by just 1 day or provided a reasonable explanation\u2014such as staff turnover  or illness\u2014other regions were more stringent in scoring states against the  standard.", "However, it is not yet clear to what extent the 2004 scores represent state  survey agency shortcomings or a learning curve for the states in  understanding the performance review protocols.", "In partnership with the accrediting organizations, CMS is developing  performance standards comparable to, but different from, those  implemented in 2004 for state survey agencies. For example, both the state  survey agency review protocols and those proposed for accrediting  organizations measure the timeliness of the surveys, but those proposed  for the latter would also focus on several areas that are unique to  accrediting organizations. The performance standards would include   (1) timely and consistent information sharing and (2) alerting CMS about  decisions to limit or remove accreditation in a timely manner. According  to a CMS official, the agency plans to phase in the performance standards,  starting with a standard on complaints. For example, if the CLIA  complaints database is activated in March 2006, CMS could begin to  monitor accrediting organization responsiveness to, and outcomes of,  complaints. Because the database will contain national lab complaint data,  CMS will be able to compare the volume and outcome of complaints  across survey organizations. According to CMS, implementation of the  accrediting organization performance standards will be a central\u2014not  regional\u2014office responsibility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Clinical labs play a pivotal role in the nation\u2019s health care system by  diagnosing many diseases, including potentially life-threatening diseases,  so that individuals receive appropriate medical care. Given this important  role, lab tests must be accurate and reliable. CMS and survey organization  oversight is intended to ensure that labs produce reliable test results, a key  objective of CLIA. Our work demonstrated that the oversight of clinical  labs needs to be strengthened in several areas.", "Determining the quality of lab testing is difficult because it is virtually  impossible to crosswalk inspection requirements across survey  organizations. Without standardized survey findings across all survey  organizations, CMS cannot tell whether the quality of lab testing has  improved or worsened over time or whether deficiencies are being  appropriately identified.", "Lab oversight has weaknesses that make it difficult to determine the  quality of lab testing because they mask quality problems. To help surveys  provide a realistic picture of day-to-day operations, CAP and JCAHO began  unannounced surveys of the labs they survey\u2014generally hospital labs\u2014in  2006. While unannounced surveys at physician office labs may not be  practical, Washington\u2019s exempt program and COLA currently give such  labs more advance notice than the 2 weeks CMS prescribes for labs  inspected by state survey agencies. Similarly, the greater weight that CMS  and survey organizations sometimes place on their educational, as  opposed to their regulatory role may lead to survey findings that do not  accurately reflect lab quality. Educating labs to ensure high-quality testing  should complement but not replace the enforcement of CLIA inspection  requirements. The low number of lab complaints may be the result of a  lack of information about how to file a complaint and lab workers\u2019 fear of  retaliation. Because protecting the anonymity of lab workers who file  complaints is difficult, whistle-blower protections for such individuals are  particularly important. Finally, labs with the same serious deficiencies on  consecutive surveys often escape sanctions, even though Congress  authorized alternative sanctions to give CMS more flexibility to achieve  lab compliance. Without the threat of real consequences, labs may not be  sufficiently motivated to comply with CLIA inspection requirements.", "CMS\u2019s oversight is not adequate to enforce CLIA requirements. The agency  is not requiring labs to participate in proficiency testing on a quarterly  basis, as required by CLIA. Furthermore CMS is not conducting CLIA- equivalency determinations within the time frames it established for such  reviews, nor has it always reviewed changes to exempt-state and  accrediting organizations\u2019 inspection requirements before their  implementation, even though it requires their submission to ensure  continued CLIA equivalency of their requirements. Although the CLIA  program has generated funds, CMS agencywide staffing limitations have  prevented the program from hiring sufficient staff to complete equivalency  reviews in a timely manner. Many validation reviews are conducted at the  same time a survey organization conducts its survey, and such  simultaneous reviews may not provide a true assessment of surveyor  performance. Independent validation reviews of accrediting organization  surveys are critical because CMS has not conducted equivalency reviews  within the time frames it established. We also found that few validation  reviews of state survey agency lab inspections are conducted each year  and that none occurred in some states. Because state surveyors conduct  validation reviews of accrediting organizations to ensure the continuing  CLIA equivalency of their inspection requirements, conducting an  appropriate number of validation reviews of state survey agency lab  inspections is critical. CMS also has not yet taken the lead in ensuring the  availability and use of data from survey organizations to help it monitor  their performance\u2014particularly the consistency with which surveys are  conducted.

Overall, CMS concurred with 11 of our 13  recommendations. Despite this endorsement, however, CMS (1) provided  an alternative assessment of lab quality, (2) disagreed that the phase-in of  certain CLIA requirements inappropriately stressed education as opposed  to regulation, (3) expressed concern about how to identify and sanction  labs with repeat condition level deficiencies, (4) disagreed with our  recommendation regarding the frequency of proficiency testing, and   (5) stated that it was already meeting our recommendation to conduct  almost all validation reviews of each accrediting organization  independently. We continue to believe that implementation of these  recommendations is necessary for the effective oversight of labs. (CMS\u2019s  comments are reproduced in app. IV.) CAP indicated that it took seriously  our findings and recommendations and intended to determine if there  were additional measures it could take to strengthen its own oversight.  COLA said that our recommendations to improve CMS oversight of survey  organizations had merit. Nonetheless, CAP, COLA, and JCAHO disagreed  with some of our findings and recommendations to CMS.

In particular, CMS pointed to the substantial decline\u2014 from about 80 percent to about 42 percent\u2014in the percentage of labs  nationwide with deficiencies between 1994 and 2004. It is important to  note that CMS\u2019s data (1) do not distinguish between serious condition- level deficiencies and less serious standard-level deficiencies, (2) include  the early start-up period when physician office labs were first regulated,  and (3) exclude deficiency data on the substantial number of labs  surveyed by accrediting organizations and state CLIA-exempt programs.  Due to these shortcomings, we do not believe that CMS\u2019s data provide an  accurate assessment of lab quality nationwide.", "Based on the limited data available on state survey agency inspections of  labs since 1998 and the lack of any comparable data on accrediting  organization and exempt-state program survey findings, we concluded that  insufficient data existed to identify the extent of serious quality problems  at labs. CMS did not retain backup files of pre-2004 data on deficiencies  identified by state survey agencies. Although CMS has determined that  accrediting organization and exempt-state program lab requirements are at  least equivalent to CLIA\u2019s, there is no agreement across survey  organizations on how to distinguish serious from less serious deficiencies.  While CMS concurred with our recommendation to standardize the  categorization and reporting of survey findings in a way that tracks to  CLIA and allows meaningful comparisons across survey organizations, it  noted that a straightforward linkage of requirements is limited by CMS\u2019s  authority under the statute\u2014that is, survey organizations are permitted by  statute to have different requirements\u2014and that it will approach  implementation of our recommendation cautiously. JCAHO said that it  agreed with the need for a common, agreed upon, taxonomy that could be  used by all survey organizations to track serious deficiencies, but  commented that it thought CMS\u2019s implementation of our recommendation  would require a revamping of JCAHO\u2019s accreditation system. That was not  the intent of our recommendation and it is clear from CMS\u2019s comments  that its implementation of our recommendation would not require an  overhaul of accrediting organizations\u2019 systems. CAP acknowledged the  complexity and inherent challenges in measuring the quality of lab testing,  but noted that it is committed to working to develop better systems to  detect labs with serious quality problems\u2014those that impact patient care.", "The statutory authority that permits standards different from CMS\u2019s  (provided they are at least as stringent) does not impair the ability to  develop a crosswalk that allows for meaningful comparisons across survey  organizations\u2014such as an analysis of trends in the citation of condition- level deficiencies. In fact, CMS regulations already require accrediting  organizations and exempt-state programs to submit a crosswalk\u2014detailed  comparisons of their individual accreditation or licensure approval  requirements with comparable CLIA condition-level requirements\u2014when  they apply and reapply for approval from CMS. Such a comparison is  possible because CMS already identifies instances when accrediting  organizations have missed condition-level requirements during validation  reviews. For example, CMS should require survey organizations to   (1) indicate which of their requirements relate to each CLIA condition- level requirement, and (2) explain which deficiencies in their  requirements, if cited, should be considered equivalent to CLIA condition- level deficiencies.", "CMS also pointed to the steady increase in successful proficiency testing  across all labs as an indication of improvements in lab quality. Our  analysis of proficiency testing results suggested that lab quality had not  improved at hospital labs in recent years. CMS correctly noted that the  overall proportion of labs with no test failures increased from about   88 percent in 1998 to about 93 percent in 2003\u2014that is, fewer labs failed  proficiency testing. However, by focusing on overall proficiency testing  results, CMS data mask trends in failure rates for subsets of labs such as  hospital labs. For example, from 1999 through 2003, the percentage of  CAP-surveyed labs with proficiency testing failures increased from   4.1 percent to 6.8 percent; CAP generally inspects hospital labs. CMS also  commented that the overall improvement cannot be dismissed as a result  of some labs being granted waived status because the more dramatic  improvements predated the recent increase in the number of waived labs.  It further commented that removing waived labs from the data would not  result in improved performance rates. First, the number of waived labs\u2014 those performing waived tests or provider-performed microscopy\u2014 increased by about 26,600 from 1993 though 1998 and then increased by  another approximately 33,700 labs from 1998 through 2004. Second, CMS\u2019s  comment suggested that it had conducted an analysis of the impact of  removing waived labs from the proficiency testing data. However, it did  not provide any data analysis when we subsequently asked to see the  evidence behind its assertion. COLA also addressed this issue, and did not  challenge our conclusion that the decrease in proficiency testing failures  for physician office labs might not represent an actual improvement in lab  quality, but instead could reflect the fact that some problematic labs are  no longer surveyed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Educational Focus of CLIA", "paragraphs": ["CMS agreed that it was important to maintain an appropriate balance  between its regulatory and educational approaches to CLIA  implementation. While CMS noted that objective review and feedback are  the bedrock of education, it emphasized that the educational approach  does not preclude surveyors from identifying lab deficiencies. CAP and  COLA offered similar comments. However, we found evidence that the  goal of educating lab workers sometimes takes precedence over, or  precludes, the identification and reporting of deficiencies and  recommended that CMS take steps to ensure that regulation remains the  primary goal of surveys. To address this problem, CMS stated that it will  provide additional state agency surveyor training, improve guidance,  develop an action plan to promote greater consistency among surveyors,  and institute periodic performance and consistency reviews. CMS\u2019s  comments did not address evidence we presented that an educational  emphasis may also prevent fulfillment of regulatory responsibilities by  some accrediting organizations.", "CMS disagreed that the extended phase-in periods for new quality control  requirements and proficiency testing for lab technicians who interpret Pap  smears were inappropriate. COLA noted that federal requirements in many  regulated industries are phased in to allow them time to understand and  effectively implement the requirements. CMS reaffirmed that, in the case  of significant new requirements and for the time period specified by CMS,  the educational approach may result in identified deficiencies being  communicated to laboratories without a concomitant citation, as is the  case with quality control and Pap smear testing requirements. As  discussed in the report, we believe that CMS\u2019s educational phase-in  periods are excessive. We found that the phase-in period for new quality  control requirements was extended from 2 years to about 4 years, in part  because of the lack of lab \u201cbuy-in\u201d for some of the new policies and  procedures. Similarly, the phase-in period for Pap smear proficiency  testing is 2 years, despite (1) CMS\u2019s concern about some of the high initial  test failure rates, (2) the consequences of inaccurate test results on  patients\u2019 diagnoses and treatment, and (3) the approximately 13-year time  lag between the 1992 implementation of the CLIA regulations and the  commencement of Pap smear proficiency testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sanctioning Labs with Serious, Repeat Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on our recommendation to appropriately sanction labs  with repeat condition-level deficiencies, CMS acknowledged the need to  carefully monitor repeat deficiencies but expressed concern that focusing  on the condition cited may not indicate a true repeat deficiency because  the underlying failures could have been different in the two consecutive  surveys for those labs. CMS\u2019s assertion is inconsistent with its own policy  on serious, repeat deficiencies for other providers, such as nursing homes.  In general, immediate sanctions must be imposed on nursing homes with  consecutive serious deficiencies, regardless of whether the deficiencies  are in the same care area. As we have previously reported, allowing  providers to avoid sanctions by correcting serious deficiencies contributes  to an up-and-down pattern of compliance and undermines the deterrent  effect of sanctions.

In addition, such dedicated surveyors conduct from 30 to  about 200 surveys per year compared to CAP\u2019s lab professionals who  volunteer to perform about 1 survey per year.

For example, lack of agreement about the  seriousness of a deficiency could result in the team leader instructing the  team to downgrade the deficiency to a recommendation, a less serious  finding that does not appear in the inspection report. Team members who  are subordinates to the team leader may feel that they have no other  recourse than to follow the team leader\u2019s instructions. CAP recently  revised its conflict-of-interest policy which now instructs all parties to be  cautious to retain objectivity in fact finding throughout the inspection  process.

We acknowledged that unannounced  surveys of the physician office labs typically surveyed by COLA and state  survey agencies were not practical given the unpredictable operating  hours of such labs and need to minimize disruptions to patient care.  However, we recommended that the advanced notice be limited to the   2 weeks permitted by CMS for state survey agencies. COLA currently  provides up to 12 weeks advanced notice. COLA contends that providing  up to 6 months of advanced notice before a survey would only improve the  lab\u2019s operation more quickly if the lab took that opportunity to review  COLA\u2019s self assessment questions and correct any missing or incorrect  processes or documentation. We believe that COLA\u2019s example  underscores the importance of our recommendation; such actions should  be an ongoing process at labs\u2014not a reaction to an upcoming inspections.", "Additional JCAHO comments.

JCAHO did not explain how implementing our  recommendation would limit other initiatives. In fact, CMS\u2019s comments  identified a number of promising approaches that it believed could  supplement posters. JCAHO also said that our analysis of the increase in  CAP complaints after it required posters in the labs it inspects failed to  recognize a broad national trend. JCAHO indicated that it also experienced  a dramatic increase in lab complaints between 2004 and 2005 without the  use of posters. This increase may be related to JCAHO\u2019s July 2005  requirement for labs to educate staff on how to report concerns. CAP told  us that during the 3 months after they required a poster to be displayed  they observed an immediate increase in the number of complaints.
