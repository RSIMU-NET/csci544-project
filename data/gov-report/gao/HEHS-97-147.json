Created to protect consumers from \u201cunreasonable risk of injury,\u201d the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) oversees these and about 15,000 other consumer products ranging from kitchen appliances and children\u2019s toys to hot tubs and garage door openers. With a budget of about $42.5 million, CPSC carries out its mission by (1) enforcing federal consumer product regulations (by recalling products from store shelves, for example) and (2) conducting projects to address products with potential hazards not covered by existing regulations. These projects may result in CPSC issuing new regulations concerning specific products, assisting in the development of voluntary industry standards, or providing information to consumers about how to use the products safely.", "Contending that the agency is ineffectively allocating its resources, CPSC\u2019s critics have voiced dissatisfaction with the selection of certain agency projects and have questioned the validity of CPSC\u2019s risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses supporting those projects. In addition, congressional and interest group critics have questioned the agency\u2019s procedures for ensuring the accuracy of manufacturer-specific information before releasing it to the public, contending that such releases can mar the reputation of responsible corporate citizens.", "In light of these concerns, you asked us to review CPSC\u2019s project selection, use of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, and information release procedures. Specifically, this report (1) identifies the criteria CPSC uses to select projects and reviews the information it relies upon in making these choices, (2) assesses the information CPSC draws on to perform risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses and evaluates the agency\u2019s methodology for conducting cost-benefit analyses, and (3) describes CPSC\u2019s procedures for releasing manufacturer-specific information to the public and reports whether evidence exists that CPSC violated its statutory requirements concerning the release of such information.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed internal CPSC documents, relevant legislation and regulations, and the literature on cost-benefit analysis and on consumer product safety issues. We interviewed CPSC commissioners and staff, four former commissioners, consumer advocates, industry representatives, and outside experts to obtain their perspectives on CPSC\u2019s work. We identified CPSC projects by compiling from various agency documents a list of 115 potential product hazards examined by the agency from January 1990 to September 30, 1996, and we reviewed available agency documentation on each of these projects. We examined the agency\u2019s internal databases to obtain project information and to assess the agency\u2019s information on product hazards. In reviewing CPSC\u2019s cost-benefit analyses, we consulted with experts to develop objective criteria that reflected elements commonly used in the evaluation of cost-benefit analyses. These evaluation questions were designed to elicit whether CPSC conducted comprehensive analyses and reported them in sufficient detail. However, they do not make up a complete measure of the quality of a cost-benefit analysis; for example, our evaluation assessed whether these elements were included but not how well they were measured or incorporated. We reviewed CPSC\u2019s internal procedures concerning information clearance and release, and we examined relevant legal cases in this area. For more detailed information on our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["CPSC was created in 1972 under the Consumer Product Safety Act (P.L. 92-573) to regulate consumer products that pose an unreasonable risk of injury, to assist consumers in using products safely, and to promote research and investigation into product-related deaths, injuries, and illnesses. CPSC currently has three commissioners, who are responsible for establishing agency policy. One of these commissioners is designated the chairman; the chairman directs all the executive and administrative functions of the agency.", "The Consumer Product Safety Act consolidated federal safety regulatory activity relating to consumer products within CPSC. As a result, in addition to its responsibilities for protecting against product hazards in general, CPSC also administers four laws that authorize various performance standards for specific consumer products. These laws are the Flammable Fabrics Act (June 3, 1953, c.164), which authorizes flammability standards for clothing, upholstery, and other fabrics; the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (P.L. 86-613), which authorizes the regulation of substances that are toxic, corrosive, combustible, or otherwise hazardous; the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-601), which authorizes requirements for child-resistant packaging for certain drugs and other household substances; and the Refrigerator Safety Act of 1956 (Aug. 2, 1956, c.890), which establishes safety standards for household refrigerators.", "In fiscal year 1997, CPSC carries out this broad mission with a budget of about $42.5 million and a full-time-equivalent staff of 480. As figure 1 shows, after adjusting for inflation, the agency\u2019s budget has decreased by about 60 percent since 1974. Similarly, CPSC\u2019s current staffing level represents 43 percent fewer positions as compared with the agency\u2019s 1974 staff.", "CPSC uses a number of regulatory and nonregulatory tools to reduce injuries and deaths associated with consumer products. Under several of the acts that it administers, CPSC has the authority to issue regulations that establish performance or labeling standards for consumer products. For example, in 1993, CPSC issued regulations under the Consumer Product Safety Act requiring disposable cigarette lighters to be child-resistant. If CPSC determines that there is no feasible standard that would sufficiently address the danger, CPSC may issue regulations to ban the manufacture and distribution of the product. In addition, under the Consumer Product Safety Act, if a product violates a safety regulation or presents a \u201csubstantial hazard,\u201d CPSC may order a product recall, in which the item is removed from store shelves and consumers are alerted to return the item for repair, replacement, or refund. CPSC can also impose civil penalties for violations of federal safety standards.", "Although CPSC has these broad regulatory powers, much of the agency\u2019s efforts are carried out using nonregulatory methods. In addition to federally mandated product safety standards, many consumer products are covered by voluntary standards. These voluntary standards, which are often established by private standard-setting groups, do not have the force of law. However, many voluntary standards are widely accepted by industry. The 1981 amendments to the Consumer Product Safety Act require CPSC to defer to a voluntary standard\u2014rather than issue a mandatory regulation\u2014if CPSC determines that the voluntary standard adequately addresses the hazard and that there is likely to be substantial compliance with the voluntary standard. As a result, voluntary standards development is an important tool in CPSC\u2019s hazard-reduction efforts. For example, in 1996 CPSC helped a private group develop a voluntary standard to address the risk of children getting their heads stuck between the slats of toddler beds, and in 1995 CPSC assisted a standard-setting group in upgrading safety standards to prevent fires associated with Christmas tree lights.", "CPSC also addresses product hazards by providing information to consumers on safety practices that can help prevent product-related accidents. For example, to encourage consumers to use electricity safely\u2014and particularly to promote the use of ground fault circuit interrupters\u2014CPSC conducted a far-reaching publicity campaign that included radio public service announcements, messages printed on carryout bags for hardware stores, a joint press conference with industry representatives, presentations on television\u2019s Home Shopping Network, and promotional letters to real estate and home inspection associations. In addition to its own active efforts to disseminate information, CPSC provides considerable amounts of information in response to requests from the public. Like other federal agencies, CPSC must comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) when responding to requests from the public for information. A notable feature of FOIA is its presumption in favor of disclosure: any person has the right to inspect and copy any government records unless the documents requested fall within one of the exemptions to the act (for example, disclosure of trade secrets). FOIA requests may come to CPSC from regulated industries, the press, consumer groups, or individuals. During calendar year 1995, CPSC responded to 16,424 formal requests made under FOIA.", "CPSC\u2019s resource base and extensive jurisdiction require the agency to select among potential product hazards. New initiatives may come to CPSC in several ways. First, any person may file a petition asking CPSC to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation. Petitions, which can be as simple as a letter or as formal and detailed as a legal brief, have come to CPSC from doctors and nurses, consumers and advocacy groups, and industry representatives. CPSC may grant or deny a petition either in full or in part. Even when CPSC denies a petition and declines to issue a regulation, it may still begin a project to address the hazard by promoting a voluntary standard or conducting a consumer education campaign. For example, a project on heat tapes (heated wraps for exposed pipes) originated with a petition from a concerned consumer. CPSC denied the petition for a mandatory standard, but conducted a research study and review of the existing voluntary standard for heat tapes.", "Second, CPSC receives some product hazard projects from the Congress. The Congress may require CPSC to study a wide-ranging product area. For example, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990 resulted in a large body of work on products affecting indoor air quality, including wood stoves, kerosene heaters, and carpets. The Congress may also direct CPSC to impose a specific regulation, such as when it directed CPSC to require additional labeling on toys intended for children aged 3 to 6 warning parents of possible choking hazards when the toy is used by children under age 3.", "Finally, CPSC commissioners and agency staff may initiate projects or suggest areas to address. CPSC gathers death and injury information to help identify potential product hazards and also obtains input from the public. The agency maintains a toll-free hot line and an Internet site that the public can use to notify agency staff of a possible product hazard. In addition, CPSC holds public meetings to get input on possible hazards to address and on which hazards should receive priority. For example, CPSC increased its efforts to remove drawstrings from children\u2019s clothing after receiving a letter from a woman whose daughter was strangled when her jacket string caught on a playground slide.", "The selection of projects to address new product hazards takes place at different levels of the agency throughout the year. For a petition, the commissioners decide whether the product hazard warrants further agency involvement, and the commissioners vote on whether to grant or deny the petition. If a project is believed to have a high potential for regulatory action or involve a substantial amount of agency resources, the commissioners decide whether to pursue it. Projects of this caliber are often noted in the agency\u2019s annual budget and operating plan, which must also be approved by commissioner vote. Staff request a decision on such a project by preparing a briefing package about the product hazard for the commissioners, who vote to begin the regulatory process, take some other action, or terminate the project. Agency staff generally may decide to initiate projects that are unlikely to result in regulation, and no briefing package is sent to the commissioners for a vote. (Of the 115 CPSC projects we identified, 80 (70 percent) were detailed in briefing packages.)", "The scope of the agency\u2019s projects varies greatly, and CPSC has no standard definition of what constitutes a project. A project might cover general product areas, such as fire hazards, or address only a specific product, like cigarette lighters. A project might require undertaking an extensive research study or providing technical assistance to a group that is developing a voluntary standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CPSC Has Limited Information Available to Assist in Project Selection", "paragraphs": ["The bulk of CPSC\u2019s workload is made up of projects selected by the agency rather than by the Congress. CPSC has established criteria to help in project selection, such as the numbers of deaths and injuries associated with a product. However, CPSC is unable to accurately measure these criteria because its data on potential hazards are incomplete. In addition, CPSC does not maintain systematic information on past and ongoing projects, which makes it difficult to assess and prioritize the need for new projects in different hazard areas. The lack of comprehensive data on individual product hazards and on agency initiatives raises questions about CPSC\u2019s ability to evaluate its own effectiveness\u2014which it is now required to do under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Has Considerable Discretion in Project Selection", "paragraphs": ["CPSC has wide latitude over which potential product hazards it targets for regulatory and nonregulatory action. Although it has little or no discretion over projects mandated by the Congress, CPSC can choose to accept or reject suggestions that are submitted by petition or proposed by the agency staff. As shown in figure 2, 59 percent of CPSC projects were initiated by CPSC, 30 percent originated from a petition, and about 11 percent resulted from congressional mandates. Of the 115 projects the agency worked on from January 1, 1990, to September 30, 1996, 97 (about 90 percent) were chosen by the agency. Data were unavailable to assess the extent to which staff suggestions for projects were accepted or rejected. Of the petitions filed with CPSC between January 1, 1990, and September 30, 1996, 60 percent resulted in projects (32 percent by granting the petition in whole or in part, and 27 percent by denying the petition to establish a mandatory regulation but creating a nonregulatory project). In 27 percent of cases, CPSC decided that no action was needed or that existing actions or standards were sufficient to address the issue raised by the petition. In the remaining cases, a decision is still pending or the petition was withdrawn before a decision was rendered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CPSC Project Selection Criteria Open to Differences in Emphasis and Interpretation", "paragraphs": ["CPSC has established criteria for setting agency priorities and selecting potential hazards to address.

For example, the regulations do not specify whether any criterion should be given more weight than the others, nor must all criteria be applied to every potential project. Indeed, our interviews with present and former commissioners and our review of CPSC briefing packages revealed a pattern in which three criteria\u2014the numbers of deaths and injuries, the causality of injuries, and the vulnerability of the population at risk\u2014were more strongly emphasized than the others. In addition, each of the commissioners we interviewed identified some criteria as being more important than others for project selection. For example, one commissioner indicated that the number of deaths and injuries was most important, while another commissioner included awareness of the hazard in a list of several criteria she believed were most important. However, there was considerable agreement among the commissioners about the importance of several criteria. The commissioners cited two criteria\u2014vulnerability of population and number of deaths and injuries\u2014as especially important for project selection. In addition, several\u2014but not all\u2014commissioners emphasized causality of injuries. None of the other criteria was emphasized by more than one or two commissioners.", "Because the commissioners use their judgment in applying these criteria, there is no systematic checklist or scoring system that would enable us to determine which factors were considered most important for a particular product. However, information related to some or all of these criteria is sometimes contained in briefing packages and other documents. Our review of CPSC project documentation showed that information on vulnerable populations and the numbers of deaths and injuries associated with the product was likely to be compiled at some time during the project, but information associated with other criteria was less likely to be documented. For example, of the 115 projects we reviewed, death and injury information was available in 97 cases. However, only 26 cases included information on exposure to the hazard, a less-emphasized criterion.", "Although data were insufficient to compare the universe of possible projects with the ones selected by CPSC, the characteristics of CPSC projects appear generally consistent with the stronger emphasis on death and injury data and on vulnerable populations expressed by the current and former commissioners. For example, while 76 of the 115 projects we examined were directed at least partially at a vulnerable population group, only 13 projects mentioned chronic illness. However, although the number of deaths and injuries associated with product hazards was almost always available in project documentation, there was no pattern of only those projects with high numbers of injuries or deaths being selected. Of the 97 projects that had death and injury statistics, 19 showed fewer than 50 injuries and/or deaths associated with the product. The estimated number of annual injuries associated with product hazards ranged from 1 to 162,100 (for baseball injuries), and the estimated number of deaths associated with product hazards ranged from zero to a high of 3,600 annually (for smoke detectors). This wide range is consistent with CPSC staff\u2019s statement that there is no threshold for the number of deaths and injuries that would require acceptance or rejection of a project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commissioners Interpret Some Selection Criteria Differently", "paragraphs": ["Although the commissioners and former commissioners we interviewed generally agreed on the criteria they emphasized for project selection, they expressed very different views on how some of these criteria should be interpreted. For example, several commissioners viewed vulnerable populations as focusing on children, while others highlighted additional segments of the population that they considered vulnerable. One commissioner also listed low-income and poorly educated consumers as vulnerable populations, and another expressed concern that the elderly were especially vulnerable to injury from product hazards. Project documentation focused on children more frequently than on other population segments thought to be at special risk. Many projects we examined contained no information in the documentation that indicated a particular population was being considered vulnerable. However, of the 76 projects for which information was available on special populations, 69 (91 percent) mentioned children.", "Industry observers, consumer advocates, current and former commissioners, and others expressed widely diverging views on how to apply causality of injuries in selecting projects. All seven commissioners we interviewed mentioned this as an important criterion, and several stressed causal factors. A major issue surrounding the application of causality is determining the appropriate level of protection the agency should provide when a product hazard results, at least in part, from consumer behavior. For example, a consumer advocate stated that regulatory action may be necessary whatever the cause of the incident if children who were incapable of protecting themselves get hurt. Similarly, another individual told us that CPSC should deal with potential hazards on the basis of the behavior that actually took place, not the behavior that might be expected or considered reasonable. However, other individuals asserted that CPSC should address only those hazards that result from products that are defective\u2014that is, products that create a hazard even when used as intended by the manufacturer. Some industry representatives stated that it was inappropriate for CPSC to take action concerning a product if the product was \u201cmisused\u201d by the consumer.", "Complicating this debate is the difficulty of defining misuse of the product or negligence of the consumer. For example, the appropriate degree of parental supervision is frequently an issue with children\u2019s products. One of the agency\u2019s more controversial projects illustrates this point. CPSC staff conducted a project to investigate the deaths of children using baby bath seats or rings. In these incidents, infants slipped out of the seat and drowned in the bathtub when the parent or caregiver stepped out of the room and left the child unsupervised, despite warning signs on the seats not to leave children unattended. The Commission disagreed on the proper course of action, largely because of differing views on causality. In 1994, the staff recommended that the Commission issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), the first step in the regulatory process. The staff argued (and one commissioner agreed) that some parents will leave a young child alone in the bathtub regardless of a warning not to. However, in voting against issuing an ANPR, the other two commissioners stated that they believed regulation was not appropriate because the lack of supervision, not the product, caused the tragedies.", "CPSC staff have also encountered other instances in which the behavior of consumers might be viewed as inappropriate. For example, the role of alcohol and drug use in accidents can also raise questions about the appropriate level of regulatory protection. In addition, a 1991 CPSC study found that at least 33 percent of bicycle accidents involved behaviors such as performing stunts and going too fast. Similarly, a 1991 CPSC study of fires associated with heat tapes found that at least 38 percent of the heat tapes had been installed improperly. In each of these cases, no regulatory action was taken; in the case of bicycles, the staff did recommend increasing efforts to encourage consumers to take safety precautions such as using lights at night and wearing helmets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Systems Provide Insufficient Information to Measure Selection Criteria, Monitor All Projects, or Evaluate Results", "paragraphs": ["CPSC uses data from internal management systems and from external sources to assist in project selection. CPSC collects information on product-related deaths and injuries to provide information for project selection as well as to perform risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses. Furthermore, the agency maintains a computerized management information system (MIS) that contains information on some of its major activities and is used by the agency to develop its annual budget. Both these internal and external data are of limited value. The inadequacy of the information raises questions about CPSC\u2019s ability to make informed project selection decisions so that agency resources are being spent efficiently."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Significant Gaps Exist in CPSC\u2019s Data on Product-Related Injuries and Deaths", "paragraphs": ["CPSC has developed a patchwork of independent data systems to provide information on deaths and injuries associated with consumer products. To obtain estimates of the number of injuries associated with specific consumer products, CPSC relies on its National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). NEISS gathers information from the emergency room records of a nationally representative sample of 101 hospitals. CPSC also obtains information on fatalities by purchasing a selected group of death certificates from the states. It supplements this information with anecdotal reports from individual consumers and with data from private organizations such as fire-prevention groups and poison control centers.", "Because neither NEISS nor death certificate data provide detailed information on hazard patterns or injury causes, CPSC investigates selected incidents to obtain more detailed information. In addition, CPSC sometimes uses mathematical modeling techniques or conducts special surveys to obtain information on product exposure. (For more information on CPSC\u2019s data sources, see app. V.)", "CPSC\u2019s data give the agency only limited assistance in applying its project selection criteria. (These criteria, the measures used for each, and major data limitations are given in table 1.) CPSC\u2019s injury and death data allow the agency to piece together at best an incomplete view of the incidents that result from consumer product hazards. Product-related injuries may be treated in a variety of ways\u2014in an emergency room, in a physician\u2019s office, or through an outpatient clinic, for example. As figure 3 illustrates, CPSC obtains systematic surveillance information only on deaths and on injuries treated in the emergency room; injuries treated in other settings (such as physicians\u2019 offices) are not represented in CPSC\u2019s surveillance data.", "Partially Covered Covered Not Covered A \u201cnear miss\u201d refers to an incident in which a product-related injury nearly occurred but was narrowly averted. In its regulations that address priority-setting, CPSC states that such incidents can be as important as actual injuries in identifying potential hazards.", "CPSC staff identified the lack of data on injuries treated in physicians\u2019 offices and other settings as a key concern. Because CPSC\u2019s data sets reveal only a portion of the injury picture, the agency underestimates the total numbers of deaths and injuries associated with any given consumer product. The extent of this undercount is unknown. For example, researchers report widely varying estimates of the percentage of injuries that are treated in emergency rooms as opposed to other medical settings. For example, a 1991 study by researchers at RAND found that approximately 65 percent of injuries were treated in the emergency room. However, recent data indicate that the number of injury-related visits to physicians\u2019 offices alone were more than double the number of injury-related visits to the emergency room. CPSC\u2019s estimates of product-related deaths are also undercounted, for two reasons. First, for budgetary reasons, the agency purchases only a subset of the total number of death certificates from states. Second, CPSC death counts include only those cases in which product involvement can be inferred from the information on the death certificate, and in some cases, product-related information is not recorded.", "Even if a reliable figure was available to determine the exact percentage of product-related injuries that were treated in emergency rooms, this percentage would not necessarily apply to any specific type of product-related injury. For example, even if it was established that 40 percent of all product-related injuries were treated in emergency rooms, the percentage of bunk bed injuries treated in emergency rooms might be much larger or smaller. The setting in which injuries are treated depends on a wide array of factors that vary among individuals, across geographic regions, and among different types of injuries. Research indicates that African Americans are more likely to use the emergency room than Caucasians are. Access to the emergency room or to a physician also depends on the type of medical insurance a person has. For example, health maintenance organizations (HMO) often place restrictions on reimbursement for emergency room care, and HMO membership as a percentage of the total population varies widely from state to state. In addition, injuries that occur at night, when most physicians\u2019 offices are closed, may be more likely to be treated in the emergency room. As a result, it is unlikely that CPSC could approximate the number of injuries associated with a specific product by using data that apply to all consumer products as a group.", "The incompleteness of CPSC\u2019s injury information also hampers its ability to reliably discern long-term trends in injuries, which is not only a criterion for project selection but also an important factor for evaluating the success of CPSC\u2019s injury-reduction efforts and determining the need for follow-up actions. The relative sizes of the pieces of the injury puzzle in figure 3 are unknown but appear to change over time. For example, hospitalizations decreased by 5 percent on a per capita basis between 1982 and 1994, while between 1983 and 1993, hospital outpatient clinics saw a 53-percent increase in visits on a per capita basis. As a result, it is impossible to determine whether any change in the number of emergency room visits represents a true change in injuries or a shift to other medical settings.", "According to CPSC staff, identifying chronic illnesses associated with consumer products is nearly impossible. CPSC staff stated that little is known about many chronic illness hazards that may be associated with potentially dangerous substances, and even less information is available about which consumer products may contain these substances. Chronic illnesses are especially likely to be underestimated in CPSC\u2019s NEISS data because they are underrepresented among emergency room visits and because product involvement is more difficult to ascertain. Similarly, consumer product involvement is very seldom recorded on death certificates in cases of chronic illnesses.", "CPSC\u2019s surveillance data also give an incomplete picture of the severity of incidents. Although the data capture many relatively severe injuries\u2014that is, those that result in death or require treatment in an emergency medical facility\u2014data are missing for individuals who are admitted to the hospital through their physician rather than through the emergency room. Potentially less severe cases\u2014for example, those treated in physicians\u2019 offices, walk-in medical centers, or hospital outpatient clinics\u2014are not represented at all in CPSC\u2019s systematic surveillance data systems, and consequently, CPSC has no data on some consumer product problems that may result in numerous but potentially less severe injuries.", "Sketchy information about accident victims also limits CPSC\u2019s ability to assess which consumer product hazards have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. NEISS and death certificates provide only the age of the victim; no systematic or comprehensive information is available to determine whether a given hazard has a special impact on other vulnerable populations, such as persons with disabilities. A former commissioner told us that the lack of other demographic information such as race, income, and disability status made it difficult for her to know which subpopulations were predominantly affected by a particular hazard. Another commissioner echoed this concern, and said that such information would be useful in targeting public information campaigns on certain hazards to those groups that needed the information most.", "CPSC staff identified the need for additional exposure data as a major concern. However, they also told us that obtaining information on exposure to products and establishing causation requires special efforts that can be time consuming and costly. Although CPSC\u2019s priority-setting criteria include exposure to the hazard, exposure data are generally not included in CPSC\u2019s ongoing data collection efforts. As a result, exposure is assessed either not at all or further along in the project, precluding the use of exposure as an effective criterion for project selection. Similarly, CPSC\u2019s emergency room and death certificate data provide little information on the circumstances surrounding the incident. As a result, CPSC staff perform follow-up investigations of selected incidents to obtain additional detail. These investigations may include detailed interviews with victims and/or witnesses, police or fire reports, photographs of the product and/or accident site, laboratory testing of the product, or recreations of the incident. As with exposure data, these investigations are not conducted for every project and are completed only after a project is well under way.

For example, CPSC estimated that the risk of death from an accident involving an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) was about 1 death for every 10,000 ATVs in use in 1994. Cost-benefit analysis details and compares the expected effects of a proposed regulation or policy, including both the positive results (benefits) and the negative consequences (costs). Although cost-benefit analysis may not be applicable to every decision and may not be the only factor appropriately considered in a decision, it can be a useful decision-making tool. The Congress requires CPSC to perform cost-benefit analysis before issuing certain regulations, and CPSC has conducted cost-benefit analysis for these regulations and in other situations in which it was not required. Although perfectly complete and accurate data are rarely available for any analysis, CPSC\u2019s data are frequently inadequate to support detailed, thorough, and careful risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis.

The Congress has required CPSC to perform and publish a cost-benefit analysis when issuing a regulation (such as a mandatory standard or product ban) under the Consumer Product Safety Act. In addition, CPSC is also required to conduct cost-benefit analyses before issuing regulations under the authority of portions of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (specified labeling provisions are exempt from this requirement) and the Flammable Fabrics Act.", "Because most of the agency\u2019s projects do not involve mandatory regulation, relatively few CPSC projects conducted between January 1, 1990, and September 30, 1996, were subject to these requirements.

Similarly, when CPSC performed a risk assessment to examine the risk of contracting cancer from dioxin traces in common paper products, the agency used information from laboratory studies on dioxin\u2019s link to cancer and also incorporated data on exposure to paper products. Because cost-benefit analysis includes a comprehensive delineation of the expected effects of a given proposal, a careful and thorough cost-benefit analysis will also be very data intensive and rich with detail.", "CPSC\u2019s data systems are frequently unable to adequately meet the extensive demands for information posed by risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. As a result, the agency\u2019s estimates of risks, costs, and benefits are less accurate because they reflect the substantial limitations of the underlying data. Available information does not permit us to determine the potential impact of better data on the results of CPSC\u2019s cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments. Some of these data weaknesses tend to make product hazard risks seem larger, and other problems tend to make the same risks appear smaller. For example, because CPSC\u2019s data undercount the deaths and injuries associated with particular consumer products, estimates of risk\u2014and the potential benefits of reducing that risk\u2014appear smaller. However, CPSC\u2019s surveillance data provide information only on whether a product was involved in an accident, not on whether the product caused the accident. At least at the initial stages of a project, this can make the risks assessed by CPSC\u2014and the benefits of reducing those risks\u2014appear larger.", "For risk assessment, CPSC must also obtain information on exposure to the hazard. For example, to assess the risk associated with aluminum ladders, CPSC obtained estimates of the number of ladders available for use and on the number of times each year the ladder was used. Obtaining exposure data presents special challenges for CPSC. Because the product definition that relates to a particular hazard is often relatively narrow, existing data sources frequently offer insufficient detail. For example, CPSC was unable to use Census sources to determine the number of saunas in the United States because saunas were included in a broader classification of products when government data were collected. In addition, CPSC staff told us that it is often difficult to find accurate information on the number of products that are in households and available for use.", "CPSC sometimes responds to these challenges by using mathematical modeling techniques or easier-to-obtain proxy measures (such as population) to estimate product exposure. In addition, for a few large-scale projects, CPSC has incurred the substantial expenses necessary to conduct its own detailed exposure survey. For example, CPSC conducted a survey of households that asked detailed questions on matches and disposable cigarette lighters\u2014the number purchased, where they are generally kept, how they are used, and other details. However, for the majority of the projects we reviewed, CPSC did not gather any data on exposure. Of the 80 projects we reviewed for which briefing packages were prepared, only 26 included information on exposure to the hazard, and CPSC\u2019s risk assessments were confined to 24 cases between 1990 and 1996\u2014approximately 21 percent of all projects conducted over that time period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CPSC Cost-Benefit Analyses Are Often Not Comprehensive and Not Reported in Sufficient Detail", "paragraphs": ["The methodology used to conduct a cost-benefit analysis will frequently depend on the circumstances and the context of the analysis. For this reason, there is no complete set of standards for evaluating the quality of an individual cost-benefit analysis. However, the professional literature offers some guidance for analysts, and certain specific elements are frequently mentioned as essential for cost-benefit analysis. For example, because cost-benefit analysis is meant to be a complete delineation of the expected effects of a proposed action, all potential impacts (even those that cannot be quantified) should be discussed. To ensure that the reader is able to make an informed judgment, it is important to be explicit about the underlying data, methodology, and assumptions. Accordingly, the literature suggests that all methodological choices and assumptions should be detailed, all limitations pertaining to the data should be revealed, and measures of uncertainty should be provided to allow the reader to take into account the precision of the underlying data. Similarly, the literature calls for sensitivity analysis, which enables the reader to determine which assumptions, values, and parameters of the cost-benefit analysis are most important to the conclusions.", "On the basis of our review of the cost-benefit literature, we developed a list of the elements that are frequently used in evaluating cost-benefit analysis. This list, and a description of all the factors we examined, is in appendix IV. Although we compared each of these elements with each of CPSC\u2019s analyses, not all elements were applicable to each case. For example, in some cases, the circumstances indicated by a given element\u2014such as reliance on statistical data\u2014were not found, and those cases were treated as not applicable to that element. In addition, for some elements it was not always possible to determine whether CPSC\u2019s analysis was consistent with the element. For these reasons, and to emphasize those areas that we viewed as most critical, we reported only the evaluation results that relate to key elements, applied to the majority of CPSC\u2019s analyses, and for which a determination was possible in all or nearly all cases.", "Our review of all the cost-benefit analyses that CPSC conducted between January 1, 1990, and October 31, 1996, showed that for many\u2014but not all\u2014elements, CPSC\u2019s analyses were not comprehensive and not reported in sufficient detail (see table 2). For example, CPSC provided descriptive information on proposals and also provided information on a variety of reasonable alternatives in almost 100 percent of cases. However, CPSC analyses generally did not provide measures of uncertainty for the underlying data. Estimates derived from samples are subject to sampling error, which can be especially large when the estimates are projected from relatively fewer cases. In only 17 percent of its analyses did CPSC provide any statistical information on the precision of the underlying estimates. Similarly, when estimates are based on a relatively small sample size, projections are generally not considered reliable. CPSC analysts cautioned the reader against making conclusions based on small sample data only 45 percent of the time. In addition, some of CPSC\u2019s data sets have a known upward or downward bias because of the way the data were constructed. For example, CPSC\u2019s estimates of deaths based on CPSC\u2019s death certificate database will be understated, and when estimates of incidents are based only on investigated or reported cases (such as cases reported to CPSC\u2019s hot line), two potential biases are likely to be introduced into the analysis: (1) the estimates are likely to be biased downward by nonreporting and (2) the incidents reported tend to be the more severe ones. In only 53 percent of applicable cases did CPSC\u2019s analysis inform the reader of known limitations inherent in the data being used for cost-benefit analysis.", "We identified several other areas in which CPSC analyses could benefit from improvement. For example, researchers agree that sensitivity analysis\u2014a technique that enables the reader to determine which assumptions, data limitations, or parameters are most important to the conclusions\u2014should be incorporated in cost-benefit analyses. CPSC usually did not provide sensitivity analysis information. For example, agency briefing packages did not include any information on how CPSC\u2019s injury cost estimates were derived or what factors were the largest components of injury costs. CPSC applies a statistical model to injury estimates to derive a figure for injury cost. The model that computed injury cost estimates accounts for a number of components, including medical costs, forgone wages, and pain and suffering. With only one exception, CPSC briefing packages provided only the total cost, without any information on the derivation of those costs or the individual components. In addition, CPSC provided only an average injury cost, not a range of injury cost estimates. For situations in which injuries differ in severity, or for projects in which severity is probably overstated or understated in the data, the reader would find such information useful.", "Forty-six percent of CPSC analyses did not consider the full range of costs and benefits likely to result from regulation. For example, CPSC analysts frequently omitted mentioning intangible costs and/or benefits (costs or benefits that are difficult to quantify, such as loss of consumer enjoyment) or potential indirect effects (such as changes in the prices of related goods). In addition, CPSC frequently excluded risk-risk considerations from its evaluation of the costs and benefits of potential actions. Sometimes actions taken to reduce one risk can have the unintended effect of increasing that or another risk. Individuals may take more or fewer precautions in response to a change in a product\u2019s safety features, and this behavior can result in an increase in the risk the intervention was designed to mitigate. For example, in establishing a standard for child-resistant packaging that was also \u201csenior-friendly,\u201d CPSC considered that because child-resistant medicine bottles can be difficult to open, a grandparent may leave the cap off the bottle, creating an even greater risk than would be the case with the original cap. Although CPSC considered such factors in some cases, only 49 percent of its analyses reflected potential risk-risk trade-offs.", "CPSC has not established internal procedures that require analysts to conduct comprehensive analyses and report them in sufficient detail. For example, according to CPSC staff, the agency has little written guidance about what factors should be included in cost-benefit analyses, what methodology should be used to incorporate these factors, and how the results should be presented.

Agency procedures require staff to send a written description of each incident back to the person who reported it with a request that he or she review it and state if any information needs to be corrected or supplemented.

Before CPSC releases information in response to an FOIA request, an information specialist determines whether a manufacturer could be readily identified. CPSC staff said that agency policy is to clearly and narrowly identify hazardous products (including by manufacturer) whenever possible, in order to prevent the person receiving the information from confusing safe products with unsafe products of the same type. However, if an information request is broad, like \u201call bicycle accidents,\u201d names of manufacturers are removed before the information is released, according to CPSC staff. If the requested information could identify a manufacturer, then staff review the information for appropriate exemptions (such as trade secrets), and delete portions as appropriate. The manufacturer is given 20 calendar days in which to review and comment on a summary of the information CPSC plans to release.Because CPSC often receives multiple requests for the same information, the agency informs manufacturers that it will not send them copies of subsequent requests for the same information unless specifically requested to do so. However, according to CPSC staff, more than 80 percent of the manufacturers that submit 6(b) comments routinely request such notification. In calendar year 1993 (the most recent year for which data were available), CPSC sent out 487 notices to manufacturers and received 154 responses (32 percent).

If CPSC chooses to disclose information over a manufacturer\u2019s objection, it must release the manufacturer\u2019s comments along with the other information, unless the manufacturer requests otherwise. In addition, if CPSC decides to release information and the manufacturer objects, the manufacturer has 10 working days to go to court and seek to enjoin CPSC from disclosing the information.

The lack of sufficient data, combined with methodological problems, also makes CPSC\u2019s cost-benefit analyses less useful than they could be. With more detailed information on both internal resources and external product hazards, CPSC would be better able to assure the Congress and taxpayers that its resources are expended wisely.", "We identified several key areas where CPSC management could improve its collection and analysis of external data. For example, CPSC would be better able to make informed decisions on potential agency projects if it had additional statistically reliable and timely data in several areas, including (1) injuries treated outside of hospital emergency rooms; (2) exposure to consumer products and product-related hazards; (3) chronic illnesses related to consumer products; and (4) hazards that disproportionately affect certain vulnerable populations, such as low-income individuals and consumers with disabilities.", "In addition, project selection and implementation could be improved if commissioners and staff had tracking information on CPSC projects, such as starting and ending dates, project origin, project costs (including staff days and contract costs), and agency actions taken to address the potential hazard. Such information could assist the commissioners in monitoring ongoing projects, targeting new efforts on the basis of previous work, and assessing the allocation of resources across current projects and among major hazard areas.", "CPSC could also benefit from an improved methodology for cost-benefit analysis. A stronger methodological base for CPSC\u2019s cost-benefit analyses, including more complete documentation, would promote sound regulatory decision-making and could improve the quality of the input and comment CPSC receives during the regulatory process.", "Without these improved data, CPSC will remain unable to accurately apply measurable criteria in choosing projects or to rigorously assess relative risks among potential hazards. Some of this necessary information\u2014the need for more representative and complete injury and exposure data, for example\u2014may require a significant investment of resources, so CPSC may need to prioritize these data needs. In doing so, is important for CPSC to draw on the insight of individuals outside the agency to ensure that all available alternatives for obtaining these data are explored. Some of the other information CPSC needs, however, could be compiled internally at relatively little additional cost and effort.

Although we described the criteria used by the agency, we did not make judgments about the merit of individual criteria or about whether any criterion was appropriately applied in any specific case. We compiled a list of agency projects on the basis of the documents we reviewed. We included not only major regulatory efforts but also smaller-scale projects. We gathered information on the characteristics of these projects; for example, we obtained information on how the projects originated, what action CPSC took, and (for most) how many deaths and injuries were associated with the hazard. CPSC officials examined our list and provided some information that was not readily available in agency documents. However, because CPSC\u2019s internal data management system does not track agency projects, neither we nor CPSC were able to verify the accuracy and comprehensiveness of this information. We also reviewed agency documentation and the technical literature and interviewed outside experts to obtain information on CPSC\u2019s data-gathering systems.", "To examine CPSC\u2019s cost benefit analysis, we reviewed the technical literature and developed a set of objective evaluation questions to elicit descriptions of and to evaluate the analytical work. These evaluation questions were designed to indicate only whether CPSC\u2019s cost benefit analyses were consistent with elements that are commonly used to evaluate whether cost-benefit analyses are comprehensive and reported in sufficient detail. Our review did not assess whether CPSC\u2019s analyses were the best that could be done on any particular topic. We reviewed these evaluation questions with two leading experts in the field of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis: Professor John Mendeloff of the University of Pittsburgh and Professor John Graham of Harvard University. Then we examined all CPSC\u2019s cost-benefit analyses from January 1990 through September 1996 to see how they measured up against these evaluation questions. In making these assessments, we reviewed all the information available to the commissioners in the written record; that is, we did not confine our analysis to the portion of the briefing packages that dealt explicitly with cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment, and we examined all the briefing packages that pertained to that particular project. Although we evaluated CPSC\u2019s cost-benefit analyses using a wide-ranging set of evaluation questions, we reported results of our analysis only for those questions where: (1) the question was applicable to the majority of the CPSC analyses we reviewed; and (2) we were able to make a determination of whether the analyses were consistent with the evaluation question in applicable cases.", "To review CPSC\u2019s information release process, we reviewed internal agency procedures, discussed the information release requirements with agency officials and industry representatives, and reviewed the relevant legal cases.

This was not always clear. For example, in three cases, a petition was submitted and subsequently denied, but the issue was later mandated by the Congress as a project the agency must address. For example, a petition concerning the safety of bicycle helmets submitted in 1990 was denied.

To construct this framework, researchers approach a policy question needing considerable information about the potential remedy. Because cost-benefit analysis requires an inclusive approach to evaluating a proposal\u2019s impact, the proposal itself must be well defined, and some information must be known about its impact. Once the expected benefits and costs of the proposal are thoroughly identified and delineated, the next step is to place a value on each benefit or cost. Frequently, these expected costs and benefits are expressed in numerical or monetary terms to facilitate a comparison of the aggregate costs and benefits. If all relevant factors can be translated into monetary terms, the decision rule suggested by this proceeding is to accept the proposal if its aggregate benefits exceed its aggregate costs.", "Although at first the concept behind cost-benefit analysis seems relatively straightforward, the application of cost-benefit analysis is not. The practical difficulties associated with measuring effects, quantifying results, and accounting for uncertainty (to name only a few issues) can create a gap between the way cost-benefit analysis is described in theory and the way it is implemented in practice. For this reason, experts generally agree that analysts should be comprehensive in including all important factors and be explicit in their description of the underlying data, methodology, and assumptions.", "This appendix describes many of the major methodological issues that often arise in cost-benefit analysis and outlines specific elements that are frequently used to evaluate cost-benefit analyses. The methodology used to conduct a cost-benefit analysis frequently varies depending on the circumstances and the context of the analysis. For this reason, there is no complete set of standards for evaluating the quality of an individual cost-benefit analysis. However, the professional literature offers some guidance for analysts, and certain specific elements are frequently used to determine whether a given analysis meets a minimum threshold of comprehensiveness and openness. These elements are necessary, but not sufficient, for a quality analysis.", "From the extensive cost-benefit literature, we developed objective evaluation questions to evaluate cost-benefit analyses performed by CPSC.

At the same time, by providing a framework to convert dissimilar effects to a common measurement, cost-benefit analysis can allow this information to be weighed and aggregated to help make a decision. A well-constructed cost-benefit analysis can highlight crucial factors, expose possible biases, and perhaps expand the openness of the decision-making process by clarifying the factors on which the decision was based\u2014whether these factors are purely economic criteria or include other social factors. A key advantage of carefully built cost-benefit analysis is that it promotes explicit rather than implicit decision-making, even when it is impossible to monetize or even quantify all the potential effects of a given regulatory proposal.", "Despite the value of this analytical tool, in some situations using cost-benefit analysis as the sole basis for decision-making may be inappropriate. For example, alternatives that would eliminate basic human rights or dramatically increase income inequality may be viewed as morally unacceptable. Similarly, when uncertainty about possible effects is so pervasive that attempting to identify potential costs and benefits would amount to nothing more than uninformed speculation, cost-benefit analysis probably has little to offer. In addition, for minor decisions it may not be necessary to employ a rigorous, time- and resource-consuming decision-making process, and a less detailed cost-benefit analysis\u2014or none at all\u2014may be more appropriate. Virtually all observers agree that the appropriate role for cost-benefit analysis\u2014sole decision-making rule, input into decision-making, or not done at all\u2014will depend on the context in which the particular decision is being considered.", "To some individuals, application of an abstract analytical technique such as cost-benefit analysis is especially unpalatable in certain situations. For example, the idea of applying a value to \u201csaving life\u201d may be distasteful, because we regard our own lives as \u201cpriceless\u201d or of infinite value. However, although our lives may be priceless, avoiding risks often means forgoing time, convenience, enjoyment, or other opportunities\u2014all of which do have a price. Thus, policy interventions that can affect life expectancy pose an unavoidable problem\u2014to refuse to consider the value of potentially lifesaving interventions is to implicitly value them at zero, and to consider any potentially lifesaving activity as infinitely valuable implies that individuals would never take any action that involves risk (driving a car, for example). The literature on cost-benefit analysis makes a key distinction in this area. For ethical reasons, most practitioners consider it inappropriate to use cost-benefit analysis to evaluate alternatives that would (with certainty) affect the life expectancy of a given, known individual. But government policy does not usually involve making such decisions. Instead, policy questions typically center on actions that may bring about small changes in the statistical life expectancy of anonymous members of a large group. For example, when CPSC considered imposing a mandatory regulation on large, multiple-tube fireworks, the agency estimated that such a standard could reduce the number of individuals that die in related accidents by one anonymous consumer over a 3-year period. On a daily basis, each of us makes such trade-offs between perfect safety and other things we value, such as the convenience of driving a car or the excitement of skiing down a mountain. Such assessments, which place a value on reductions in risk, are viewed as appropriate, whereas valuing a given person\u2019s life may be viewed as less reasonable.", "Similarly, a decision to surrender basic rights\u2014such as liberty\u2014may be unacceptable on moral grounds, and so cost-benefit analysis might not be applicable in a situation involving such rights. In addition, some individuals object to cost-benefit analysis in circumstances in which other species may be affected adversely. For example, one individual objected to a proposal that would allow increased pollution in a particular river because the proposal would adversely affect the fish and other species in the river. Cost-benefit analysis would probably be unable to address this objection because there is no accepted method to place a value on the losses suffered by the fish."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conceptual, Analytical, and Technical Issues Arise When Applying COST-BENEFIT Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 3 decades, a substantial economic literature has explored the conceptual, analytical, and technical issues posed by the application of cost-benefit analysis.

However, these intangible effects would be very difficult to measure and even more difficult to quantify.Some individuals have criticized certain individual practitioners of cost-benefit analysis for ignoring or de-emphasizing aspects of proposed changes that cannot be easily quantified. Although it is necessary for such effects to be described and emphasized appropriately, the existence of such intangibles does not necessarily limit the value of the analysis. For example, in the discussion of mental health programs, the researchers found that patients in the experimental program experienced higher satisfaction and reported having a greater number of social relationships. These qualitative benefits were important to the analysis even though they could not be valued in dollars. In addition, if it can be shown explicitly that the value of the intangibles would be unlikely to change the conclusion, then cost-benefit analysis has played a valuable role by considering intangible effects explicitly, even if it is not possible to consider them quantitatively.

Similarly, a medical treatment that prolongs life can be expected to have a secondary effect on health care costs as individuals live longer.", "A researcher who wants to include such secondary impacts will frequently find a measurement challenge, because determining the magnitude (or perhaps even the existence) of many secondary effects involves answering a \u201cwhat if?\u201d type of question, and frequently without relevant historical experience. For example, individuals who receive improved treatment for hypertension may contract more prolonged or costly illnesses in the future. Any attempt to measure the impact of these indirect future costs would require the researcher to predict the future health status and health care costs of the patient group in the event that the treatment had or had not been available. In addition, the existence of some secondary effects is dependent on one or more key assumptions. For example, an economic multiplier effect is generally thought to take place only in an economy operating below its productive capacity. A researcher who wants to include such an effect must thus determine whether or not this assumption holds, and then decide how large an effect should be included.", "Secondary impacts may be considered part of the cost-benefit analysis or extraneous to it. The proper choice in each circumstance probably depends on the likelihood that the secondary effects in fact exist, their probable importance, and the ability to measure them. However, like intangible effects, potential secondary or indirect effects should be detailed even if they are not included quantitatively.

If these constraints are not incorporated into the analysis, the results could be \u201cpie in the sky\u201d recommendations that would be of little use of the decisionmaker.

For the properties of economic efficiency to hold, cost-benefit analysis must take what economists call a marginal or incremental approach\u2014that is, it must consider only the changes that would result from the proposed intervention. For example, a proposal to renovate a museum should be evaluated, for cost-benefit purposes, on the basis of the incremental cost of the renovation, not on the basis of the original cost of constructing the entire museum.

As a result, cost-benefit analysis is \u201cneutral\u201d with respect to the distribution of gains and losses.

For example, if a proposal would involve redistributing income, the loss of one dollar to a wealthy person may be viewed as less consequential than the gain of one dollar to a poor person. In order to address such an issue, the researcher or decisionmaker can consider issues of distribution inside or outside the cost-benefit context. One method of examining such issues might be to analyze the distributional impact of a proposal separately, and consider fairness issues\u2014along with the cost-benefit calculation\u2014as another factor in the decision-making process. Under these circumstances, if the proposal is viewed as having negative distributional consequences, and it would be costly or difficult to redistribute the gains and losses, then the proposal might be rejected even though it would otherwise meet a cost-benefit test.", "Occasionally a researcher who wants to consider distributional issues explicitly chooses to incorporate distributional consequences into the mathematics of the cost-benefit calculation. Instead of simply adding up the costs and benefits accruing to each individual, the researcher uses a mathematical formula that applies different weights to different individuals. These weights could be based on a number of factors, depending on the characteristics of the \u201cfairness\u201d issues being addressed. For example, if the proposal would affect income directly, weights could be based on income (with greater weight being applied to gains in income experienced by low-income individuals). Weights could also be based on other circumstances; for example, greater weight could be placed on vulnerable populations or on future generations. Similarly, if a change was proposed in a given program, greater weight could be applied to the smaller number of program participants (who would be more significantly affected) than the rest of society (who would be affected only indirectly). A weighting scheme would be most helpful to decisionmakers and outside observers, however, if the formula was detailed explicitly and the analysis was accompanied by a sensitivity analysis, so the effect of the distributional weights was clear to the reader.

Manufacturers used a chemical called Tris to meet these standards, but later it was discovered that Tris posed a cancer risk. Changes in individual behavior can also create uncertainty in predicting the level of risk because valuations of costs and benefits of a proposed action are often based on historical behavior. For example, valuations of a proposed new highway may be based on the number of individuals currently traveling the route, their commuting times, and other factors. However, once the new highway is built, some people may make extra trips in the area (shopping in different stores, for example) than they did before. Some people who had driven at off-hours to avoid congestion on the old road may now travel at peak hours on the new one.

In early cost-benefit analysis, the human capital approach was used, largely because lost wages and medical costs were relatively easy to measure. However, this approach is not preferred today because of a number of shortcomings. First, if this approach were taken literally to apply to individuals, then persons who do not produce output in the marketplace\u2014such as the elderly or homemakers\u2014are not valued\u2014an assumption that is clearly ethically and economically inappropriate. In addition, the human capital approach is unable to take into account costs to the individual of death or injury such as pain and suffering. Also, it is difficult to apply an \u201caverage\u201d value based on human capital calculations to a statistically anonymous member of a large group. Finally, we are all more valuable than the sum of what we produce, and these amounts could not be included in a human-capital-based formulation.

These calculations have been done several ways. Some approaches attempt to glean willingness-to-pay measures from observed behavior in the marketplace. For example, one approach examines pay differentials for jobs with different risks. Another approach looks at the payoff to consumers who purchase safety devices, such as smoke detectors and air bags in automobiles. These measures have the advantage of being based on actual observed behavior in the marketplace rather than on an artificial experimental situation. However, the validity of such measures is based on the questionable assumption that workers and consumers are sufficiently knowledgeable about the risks they face and potential of different occupations or safety devices to alleviate those risks. For many purposes, practitioners of cost-benefit analysis can select an appropriate value from the range of research already done in this field without performing the actual analysis themselves. However, for other analyses, especially those involving unique risk-taking situations, it may be wiser to gather new data to construct an estimate that is based on circumstances as close as possible to those being studied.", "Another common method for valuing risks is known as contingent valuation, in which such values are elicited by observing responses or behavior on a survey or in a controlled experiment.

For example, one measure of exposure might be the number of products in use, while another measure might be the number of hours a person spends using the product, and another measure might take into account the intensity with which a product is used. If a product is for one-time use only and is usually used soon after it is sold (such as fireworks), number of products sold might be a reasonable proxy for exposure. However, when a product is more durable, and used for a longer period, and often \u201chanded down\u201d to another user, such as a baby high chair, it would probably be more reasonable to base estimates of exposure on the number of products in use. In cases where the potential hazard is especially ubiquitous (like air pollution, for example), population measures (the number living near the source or the number of children under 5, for example) may be reasonable. For some hazards, it may be important to account for the intensity of use. For example, the probability of developing cancer from exposure to a wood stove may depend on how often the stove is used, how large a space it heats, and how many times the stove door is opened to add wood. Similarly, bicycles could be used very frequently and very intensely (every day in urban traffic) or infrequently and not intensely (once a season on the bike path in the park); thus, a good exposure measure would take such factors into account.", "CPSC does not conduct a formal, numerical risk assessment for each project it undertakes.

For example, the bicycle survey included questions on the number of hours spent biking, the ages, education, and income of household members, whether riding was done most often on streets, sidewalks, or bike paths, and whether riders used helmets.", "Where special surveys are not practical\u2014because of time, resource, or other limitations\u2014CPSC sometimes uses mathematical modeling techniques to estimate the number of products in use. These models can take sales information and information on the life of the product to estimate the number of units in use. For example, CPSC used such a model to estimate how many of the portable heaters made before a 1991 revision to a voluntary standard were still in use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CPSC Obtains Some Information Under Reporting Requirements for Manufacturers and Other Businesses", "paragraphs": ["CPSC may also receive information about potential product hazards through industry reporting requirements. Although this information is used mostly for identifying and addressing compliance problems, it may also help identify new hazards. Companies are legally obligated to report to CPSC information they receive that indicates a consumer product they distribute is potentially hazardous. Under section 15 of the Consumer Product Safety Act, manufacturers (including importers), distributors, and retailers of consumer products must notify CPSC if they obtain information that a product (1) fails to comply with a consumer product safety regulation or a voluntary consumer product safety standard, (2) contains a defect that could create a substantial product hazard, or (3) creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.", "In addition to these reporting requirements, manufacturers and importers of a consumer product must report to CPSC if (1) a particular model of a consumer product is the subject of at least three civil actions that have been filed in federal or state court, (2) each suit alleges the involvement of that model in death or grievous bodily injury, and (3) within a specified 2-year period at least three of the actions resulted in a final settlement involving the manufacturer or importer or in a judgment for the plaintiff.

As we discuss in the report, CPSC relies on a number of different sources for injury incident data. (Descriptive information on all CPSC\u2019s data sources is provided in app. V.) However, only one source\u2014the NEISS system\u2014is capable of providing statistically reliable, representative information, and the NEISS system covers only those injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms. Although CPSC obtains information from other sources, these data are anecdotal and thus their usefulness is very limited in estimating injury prevalence. As a result, we have recommended that CPSC consult with experts both inside and outside the agency to prioritize its additional data needs and to explore the feasibility of options for obtaining these data. Changes over the past decade in the health care market, including the growth of ambulatory care, changes in reimbursement procedures, and improved health services research have the potential to make such additional data collection more feasible and less costly than it was a decade ago when some of these assessments were last made. 2. Figure 3 correctly states that CPSC does not obtain systematic surveillance data on injuries treated outside the emergency room. In the text of the report, we state that the number of injuries treated in each setting is unknown. We added a similar statement to the figure to emphasize this point. 3. In several places in their comments, Chairman Brown and Commissioner Moore refer to CPSC\u2019s investigations of selected incidents to obtain more information. We discussed these investigations in our report. We believe that these investigations provide valuable information on causation, characteristics of accident victims, and hazard patterns, and we agree that some information gleaned from investigations is not obtainable from surveillance data. However, according to CPSC staff, this information is available to the agency only after a project is well under way, not at the initial stage of project selection. As a result, CPSC has little information on these important factors to assist in project selection, and evaluation of these criteria at the project selection stage is thus unavoidably speculative. 4. Descriptive information on this source of information was provided on in appendix V. 5. For reasons we discussed in the report, relying on aggregate data (data not specific to a particular consumer product) to address the limitations of CPSC\u2019s surveillance data is problematic. In addition, in the briefing packages we reviewed, the estimates of injury incidents usually referred only to NEISS cases and were not extended with modeling techniques; because these techniques were used so infrequently for this purpose, we did not assess their application in this report. 6. In referring to the agency\u2019s monitoring of other aggregated sources of injury data, Chairman Brown and Commissioner Moore state that \u201cTracking of this type is sufficient to assure the adequacy of our data, as we use it.\u201d We disagree. Examining trend information from other sources (without a rigorous application to CPSC\u2019s own specific needs) is not sufficient to compensate for (or even measure the magnitude of) the limitations of CPSC\u2019s injury surveillance data. 7. We believe this comment may reflect a misunderstanding of our point. We do not mean to suggest that CPSC incorrectly relies on NEISS to provide information on chronic illnesses. Rather, we are pointing out that CPSC has virtually no systematic data on chronic illnesses. As we stated in the report, on page 20, we agree with Chairman Brown and Commissioner Moore (and with the CPSC staff we interviewed) that such data are often difficult to obtain. However, chronic illness is listed as a criterion for CPSC project selection, and CPSC has little information to assist in applying this criterion. Accordingly, we are pleased with the statement by Brown and Moore that CPSC will consider additional surveillance methods to obtain more information on chronic illnesses. 8. We acknowledge in the report that CPSC uses other sources to supplement its death certificate data. However, our interviews with CPSC staff and our review of agency documents confirmed that death certificates are the most important source of death data for CPSC. In the briefing packages we reviewed, 80 percent of the calculations for numbers of deaths were based in whole or in large part on death certificate data, and death certificates were the sole source of death information in 36 percent of all CPSC briefing packages (a far greater percentage than for any other single source). Death data were usually reported in CPSC briefing packages with a lag of 2 or more years, especially when death certificates were the sole source of data. 9. We agree with Chairman Brown and Commissioner Moore that there is no single mold or perfect set of criteria for evaluating a cost-benefit analysis, and we have revised the report to further emphasize this point. We believe that Chairman Brown and Commissioner Moore may have misunderstood the purpose of our evaluation questions. We did not \u201cderive a particular methodology\u201d for cost-benefit analysis, nor do we mean to suggest that CPSC should follow some \u201cformula\u201d for conducting analyses that does not leave room for competent professional judgment. However, to say that there is no perfect \u201cformula\u201d for cost-benefit analysis does not imply that all methodological choices are equally consistent with rigorous and comprehensive professional work. Although no litmus test exists for a \u201cgood\u201d analysis, the professional literature offers some basic, minimum elements that are commonly used in evaluating cost-benefit analyses. These elements, which are based on the principles of transparency and completeness, are generally considered necessary, although not sufficient, for a good analysis. Although flexibility may be sometimes necessary in the assumptions or models underlying a cost-benefit analysis, the elements we used\u2014including full disclosure of data limitations, sensitivity analysis, and incorporating all important costs and benefits\u2014are appropriate to a wide range of situations. 10. Chairman Brown and Commissioner Moore are correct in stating that we evaluated 29 CPSC cost-benefit analyses that were completed between January 1, 1990, and September 30, 1996. We identified these 29 analyses as complete on the basis of CPSC\u2019s statements\u2014specifically, we considered a cost-benefit analysis to be complete only if an explicit comparison was made between aggregate costs and benefits. In addition, although the analyses may have been prepared at different stages of the project, we based our review on all available documentation on the project, and we reported results only for the evaluation questions that applied to the majority of cases and for which a clear determination could be made. We did not report results separately for the eight regulatory analyses that were required by law, because there were relatively few of these. However, we found no substantial differences between these 8 and the remaining 21 in terms of how they performed, compared with commonly used elements of evaluation of cost-benefit analysis. Therefore, we are confident that our results present an accurate assessment of CPSC\u2019s cost-benefit analyses, and we recommend that the agency implement changes to ensure that its analyses are comprehensive and reported in sufficient detail. 11. We believe that, as now constructed, CPSC\u2019s method for tracking projects operates at too high a level of generality and provides too little information to give a comprehensive, accurate picture of the agency\u2019s activities either at a given point or over a longer period. CPSC staff told us, and our review of agency documentation confirmed, that the Management Information System (MIS) usually tracks most agency activities only at a very general level. For example, CPSC\u2019s 1996 year-end MIS report lists some specific projects such as \u201cupholstered furniture\u201d and \u201crange fires,\u201d but most projects are accounted for under either broad umbrella codes such as \u201csports and recreation\u201d or \u201cchildren\u2019s projects,\u201d or under activity codes such as \u201cinvestigations,\u201d \u201cproduct safety assessment,\u201d or \u201cemerging problems.\u201d In addition, CPSC staff told us that reliable inferences on resources spent cannot be drawn from MIS data because of limitations in the computer system and because no consistent rule exists about how staff time in different directorates is recorded to project codes. As a result, CPSC staff were unable to generate a comprehensive list of projects or to provide accurate information about resources allocated to those projects. We recommend an improved tracking system that would provide enough information to monitor the projects selected and resources spent for each specific consumer product hazard. We believe that as CPSC develops its planned accounting system, it should attempt to make it as compatible as practicable with the recommended tracking system. Nevertheless, we believe that whether or not it implements its planned accounting system, CPSC can and should improve its ability to track projects. 12. Our interviews with present and former commissioners revealed a pattern by which certain of CPSC\u2019s regulatory criteria have historically been given greater emphasis in CPSC\u2019s project selection process. Our objective was to describe the process as it was related to us; we have not taken a position on whether this process is appropriate.

We have added a statement to our methodology section to emphasize this point. 2. Commissioner Gall states that we did not analyze the relative importance of the deficiencies we found in CPSC\u2019s data and methodology. However, as we stated in the report, available information does not permit us to determine the impact of better-quality data on the decisions CPSC made. The limitations we found in CPSC\u2019s data have a variety of potentially conflicting impacts, precluding us from determining exactly how the results of the analysis might change if improved data were available. For example, because CPSC\u2019s injury estimates are often confined to injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms, CPSC\u2019s estimates will generally understate the actual number of injuries associated with a consumer product. However, CPSC\u2019s systematic injury and death data can generally tell only whether a product was involved in an accident\u2014not whether the product caused or contributed to the accident. As a result, this can make the risks assessed by CPSC appear larger than they might actually be. Similarly, we cannot determine how improved exposure data would change the relative importance of the risks assessed by CPSC. We agree with Commissioner Gall that not all projects will merit the same level of data or analysis. However, our review of CPSC raises questions about the agency\u2019s ability to obtain and analyze data necessary to support rigorous analysis of important agency projects. 3. We agree with Commissioner Gall that resource considerations should enter into CPSC\u2019s decisions to undertake new data collection. For this reason, we recommended an overall feasibility study for CPSC to prioritize among its data needs and investigate new options for obtaining additional information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following individuals made important contributions to this report: Sheila A.
