For example, a contract for one system at EPA specifically required  the contractor to comply with the EPA information security policy. Two  of the six agencies (DOT and State) did not always communicate  security and privacy requirements to contractors in the contracts for  agency systems. NIST guidance states that security requirements  should be stated explicitly or by reference in contracts. However,  while State\u2019s departmental policies include references regarding  contractor requirements for protecting personally identifiable  information and system authorization, the contract for one system that  we reviewed did not contain language that communicated these  requirements.

For example, for both systems  we reviewed at OPM, the agency used a different contractor to assess  the system and system officials took steps to verify that the assessor  was independent. However, one agency, State, did not ensure that  the assessors used for both systems we reviewed were independent.  State officials allowed the contractor to select the assessor for both  systems we reviewed and did not take steps to verify the assessor\u2019s  independence. State officials stated that they believe it was not their  responsibility to ensure the independence of the assessors for the  particular systems. As a result, the agency has reduced assurance  that assessments were complete and unbiased.", "Develop a test plan. Five of the six agencies adequately documented  test plans for the assessments of the two systems we reviewed at  each agency. These plans documented the controls to be tested and  appropriate assessment procedures. NIST Special Publication 800- 53A states that test plans are to document the objectives for the  security control assessment and provide a detailed road map of how  the assessors are to test the information security and privacy controls  for the system. One of the six agencies (DOE) did not document  which controls from the system security plan were to be tested and  the assessment procedures that were to be followed for one system  as the officials could not locate the system test plan. DOE officials  stated that the computer housing the information became corrupted  and the detailed test plan could therefore not be provided.stated that, in response to our audit, they now plan to expedite the  development of a test plan to be executed this year. Without a  detailed test plan, agency officials have reduced assurance that the  selected controls were tested and that the correct tests were  executed.", "Execute the test plan.

For both of  its systems, the controls from the test plan, were effectively tested,  and for areas such as background investigation and contingency plan  training evidence was provided showing that all of the contractors  operating the system had received an investigation or training. NIST  guidance calls for agencies to ensure that the test plan is  appropriately executed during the assessment process.", "However, the system assessments that were performed by five of the  six agencies (DOE, DOT, EPA, OPM, and State) were not always  effective. For example, DOT and State did not always ensure that  system assessments evaluated the extent to which background  investigations had been conducted for contractor employees. Instead,  the agencies relied on agency-wide testing of personnel security as a  common control. However, agency-wide testing was not  comprehensive enough to identify lapses that we found regarding  background investigationssystems. Specifically, for one of the DOT systems we reviewed,   for contractor personnel working on these  department officials responsible for system testing had not evaluated  whether the seven contractor employees working on the system had  the required background investigation. When they did so in response  to our audit, they found that three of them did not. Officials stated that  they subsequently removed system access rights for the three  contractor employees until their background investigations had been  completed. For the department\u2019s other selected system, DOT  officials did not have evidence that 44 of 133 contractor employees  had undergone a current background investigation.", "For the two State systems we reviewed, department officials  responsible for these systems stated that they did not believe that it  was necessary for them to check whether contractor employees had  undergone a background investigation. However, the system security  plans for both State systems had documented the selection of  background investigations as applicable security controls, therefore  calling for them to be included in the scope of testing. By not testing  that all contractor employees operating a system have had an  appropriate background investigation completed, agency officials lack  assurance that contractor employees can be trusted with access to  government information and systems.", "Furthermore, for 8 of the 12 systems that we reviewed, the agencies  did not always ensure that system assessments accurately evaluated  the extent to which contractor employees had completed contingency  plan training as required. NIST guidance states that anyone with  responsibilities for implementing the contingency plan should receive  regular training on their role. However, DOE, DOT, EPA, OPM and  State officials were unable to demonstrate that contractor employees  had received the necessary training despite assessment results that  stated they had. Additionally, DOT officials were unable to identify  whether several staff members listed in the contingency plan of one  system were federal employees or contractor personnel. Overseeing  that key contractor staff had taken or completed the contingency plan  training would provide increased assurance that contractor employees  are familiar with their roles and responsibilities under the contingency  plan.", "Recommend remediation actions. All 12 of the system assessments  that we reviewed produced a report showing recommendations from  the assessor. NIST states that, since results of the security control  assessment ultimately influence the content of the system security  plan and the plan of action and milestones, agency officials should  review the security assessment report to determine the appropriate  steps required to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified  during the assessment. Furthermore, assessors\u2019 recommendations in  the security assessment report are an important input into agency  officials\u2019 risk-based decisions on addressing weaknesses.

However, three of the six  agencies (DOT, DOE, and State) did not adequately review the  assessment results. For one system at DOT, DOE, and State,  documentation provided by agency officials showed that a thorough  review had not occurred by the authorizing official. NIST states that  the systems authorizing official or designated representative is to  assess the current security state of the system or the common  controls inherited by the system. For the system at DOT, the test  evidence for the media protection and physical security controls (25  total controls) that was documented, reviewed, and accepted was  from a different DOT system. DOT officials confirmed that these  controls had not been sufficiently tested and that they would test them  as part of their next system assessment. At DOE, officials were able  to provide the executive summary of the test results but could not  show that the full test results had been reviewed. Agency officials  stated that the computer housing the information became corrupted  and the detailed test results could not be provided. In addition, at  State, a system security control assessment did not document that 69  of the systems\u2019 controls were tested, and the assessment showed that  the results were reviewed and accepted.

However, three of the six agencies (DOT, State, and EPA) did not  always complete or update POA&Ms for their contractor-operated  systems. Specifically, the POA&Ms for one of the two systems we  reviewed at State and DOT were missing information such as  estimated completion dates and resources that were assigned to  resolution. Additionally, State did not include all of the weaknesses  identified in the assessment report within the POA&M for the second  system we reviewed. State officials stated that those weaknesses  should have been captured in the POA&M. EPA could not provide an  updated POA&M for one of the two systems we reviewed.

Consequently, agencies are not reporting all of their contractor-operated  systems in their FISMA submissions, the information is not complete  enough to provide OMB with an accurate representation of the number of  contractor-operated systems within the government, and OMB\u2019s report to  Congress on the implementation of FISMA is not complete.

It has produced  numerous information security standards and guidelines and has updated  existing information security publications to assist agencies in developing  and implementing an information security program that manages risks,  including those risks incurred through the use of contractors. For  example, in April 2013, NIST released its fourth update of a key federal  government computer security control guide, Special Publication 800-53:  Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations, which contains an external service providers section that  has requirements for agencies to ensure that contractors meet the same  requirements that agencies adhere to and recommends that agencies  incorporate oversight controls such as establishing personnel security  requirements, requiring third-party providers to notify the agency of  personnel transfers, and monitoring provider compliance. Further, the  guide includes an appendix on identifying and implementing controls for  protecting privacy within an organization, including contractors.", "Further, NIST officials stated that the risks incurred from utilizing  contractors should be addressed by incorporating the risk management  framework as part of the terms and conditions of the contract and that  agencies can specify the security controls for which the contractor must  implement and require appropriate evidence to demonstrate that they  effectively implemented the specified controls. The risk management  framework, specified in NIST Special Publication 800-37, provides a  process that integrates information security and risk management  activities into the system development life cycle.", "GSA, in meeting its responsibilities under OMB Circular A-130 issued  guidance, templates, and established pre-negotiated contracts for  agencies using contractors to maintain agency information and systems.", "GSA has also published an acquisition manual to assist agencies when  they choose to create their own contracts.", "Additionally, GSA has negotiated contracts for products and services to  assist agencies transitioning to cloud computing services. Cloud  computing services are being managed through FedRAMP, a  government-wide program to provide joint authorization and continuous  security monitoring services for all federal agencies.

The agencies generally had established security and privacy  requirements for contractors to follow and prepared for assessments to  determine the effectiveness of contractor implementation of controls.  However, oversight of the execution and review of assessments of  contractor-operated systems was not consistent at five of the six agencies  we reviewed. Specifically, agencies did not always prepare, execute, and  review assessments of their contractor-operated systems. A contributing  reason for these shortfalls is that agencies had not documented  procedures for officials to follow in order to perform such oversight of  contractors effectively. Until these agencies develop, document and  implement specific procedures for overseeing contractors, they will have  reduced assurance that the contractors are adequately securing and  protecting agency information, including of the extent to which contractors  have undergone background investigations.", "OMB, NIST, and GSA have provided agencies guidance to assist in  implementing privacy and security controls for contractor-operated  systems. In addition, OMB and DHS are taking actions to assist agencies  in planning to improve their cybersecurity posture. However, the lack of  clear instructions to agencies for reporting contractor-operated systems  has contributed to incomplete information regarding the number of  contractor-operated systems within the government.

We selected two systems at each agency  using a non-generalizable random sample from a list of agency provided  contractor-operated systems that were identified as having personally  identifiable information and as either government-owned and contractor- operated and contractor-owned and contractor-operated. We examined  whether the agencies for each selected system implemented oversight  over key elements of federal requirements and guidance such as the  FAR; FISMA; the Privacy Act, and NIST and Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) guidance. The key elements were communicating  requirements to contractors, selecting and documenting security controls,  selecting an independent assessor, developing a test plan, executing the  test plan, recommending remediation actions, reviewing results, and  developing a plan of action and milestones.
