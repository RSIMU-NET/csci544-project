The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) noted the potential human health risks of dioxins in the 1970s when animal studies showed them to be among the most potent cancer-causing chemicals. EPA derived its estimates of human dietary exposure to dioxins in the United States from (1) chemically analyzed samples of 10 food types, (2) toxicity estimates of levels of individual dioxins in these foods, and (3) estimates of the quantities of these foods consumed by Americans. To develop more reliable national estimates of dietary exposure, EPA incorporated into its analysis some food studies that were nationally representative. Although both EPA and the WHO have assessed the human health risks of dioxins during the last decade, some of their objectives and processes have differed. Nonetheless, the analytical methods used and the conclusions reached have much in common. A major difference in the assessments is whether there are threshold levels below which exposure to dioxins would pose a negligible risk of cancer. EPA assumed there is no safe threshold level for cancer effects, but the WHO assumed there is. EPA's draft reassessment report reflects the recommendations and suggestions provided to the agency by the two most recent independent peer review panels. The panels, one consisting of 12 independent reviewers and the other convened by EPA's Science Advisory Board, concurred with many key assumptions and approaches that EPA used."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Some dioxins, which are chemical compounds that share certain structural and biological characteristics, have been linked to adverse human health effects, including cancer. Often the byproducts of combustion and industrial processes, complex mixtures of dioxins enter the food chain and human diet through emissions into the air that settle on soil, plants, and water. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other entities, such as the World Health Organization, began assessing the potential human health risks of dioxins in the 1970s, when animal studies on one of them\u20142,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD\u2014showed it to be the most potent cancer-causing chemical studied to date. EPA\u2019s initial assessment of dioxins was published in 1985. Since that time, there have been major advances in the scientific understanding of dioxin toxicity and significant new studies on dioxins\u2019 potential adverse health effects. As a result, in 1991 EPA decided to conduct a reassessment of the health risks of exposure to dioxins. A draft of this reassessment was reviewed by a scientific peer review panel in 1995, and three panels reviewed key segments of later drafts in 1997 and 2000.", "EPA plans to release its comprehensive reassessment report on the health risks of dioxins this year. According to EPA officials, the report will conclude that dioxins may adversely affect human health at lower exposure levels than previously thought and that most exposure to dioxins occurs from eating such American dietary staples as meats, fish, and dairy products, which contain minute traces of dioxins. These foods contain dioxins because animals eat plants and commercial feed, and drink water, contaminated with dioxins, which then accumulate in animals\u2019 fatty tissue. EPA plans to use its reassessment of the risks posed by dioxins to develop a risk management strategy to address the health risks identified and to determine whether the nation\u2019s current air, water, and hazardous waste cleanup programs need to be changed to protect the public health. EPA\u2019s reassessment will be considered by the National Academies in an ongoing study of the implications of dioxin in the food supply, which is examining, among other things, options to reduce dietary exposure to dioxins.", "Of the several hundred known dioxins, 29 are considered toxic to varying degrees. TCDD is the most widely studied dioxin and one of the most toxic. EPA\u2019s reassessment report on the human health risks posed by dietary exposure to dioxins evaluates the health effects of TCDD and the 28 other compounds with similar structural and biological characteristics and varying toxic effects. According to EPA, its evaluation of the effects of these compounds is sufficient to characterize the effects of environmental dioxins in general.", "Concerned about the potentially significant impact that EPA\u2019s dioxin risk assessment report could have on consumers and on the food and agriculture industries, you asked us to examine several aspects of EPA\u2019s reassessment of dioxins. As agreed with your offices, this report describes (1) the data EPA used to estimate human dietary exposure to dioxins in the United States; (2) how EPA\u2019s reassessment objectives, processes, analytical methods, and conclusions on the health risks posed by dioxins compare with those of the World Health Organization; and (3) the extent to which the draft dioxin reassessment report reflects the views of independent peer review panels that reviewed key aspects of the reassessment. Also as agreed with your offices, our report provides information on the relevant scientific issues but does not render an opinion on the scientific merits of the reassessment. This report is based primarily on EPA\u2019s draft reassessment report dated October 2001, which EPA circulated for internal agency review, and on the two most recent peer reviews of key segments of the draft reassessment in 2000."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Dioxins persist for a long time in the environment because they do not dissolve in water and are relatively immobile in soil and sediment. When animals consume plants, feed, and water contaminated with dioxins, they accumulate in the animals\u2019 fatty tissue. Similarly, when humans consume these animals, the dioxins then accumulate in human fatty tissue. According to EPA, because dioxins also persist in the body for years, recent significant reductions in dioxin emissions into the air are unlikely to reduce human health risks in the near term.", "While EPA estimates that most exposure to dioxins occurs from eating commonly consumed foods, the draft reassessment report also estimates that limited exposure to dioxins results from breathing air containing trace amounts of dioxins; inadvertently ingesting soil containing dioxins; and absorbing through the skin minute levels of dioxins present in the soil. Some people may experience higher exposure levels than the general population as a result of food contamination incidents; workplace exposures; industrial accidents; or consuming unusually high levels of fish, meat, or dairy products. When calculating human exposures, dioxins are measured in picograms\u2014that is, trillionths (0.000000000001) of a gram. Highly sophisticated measurement techniques and technologies are required to test foods for the presence of the 29 dioxins identified as having toxic effects.", "The several hundred known dioxin compounds can be placed in one of three closely related families: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDD), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (CDF), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). CDDs and CDFs are byproducts of combustion and some industrial processes. According to EPA, U.S. emissions of CDDs and CDFs into the environment declined by 75 percent between 1987 and 1995 primarily as a result of reductions in emissions from municipal and medical waste incinerators. Some PCBs share certain characteristics with CDDs and CDFs and therefore are identified as \u201cdioxin-like.\u201d PCBs were at one time manufactured for use in products such as lubricants and industrial transformers but have not been made in the United States since 1977. However, because dioxins break down so slowly, past emissions remain in the environment for years\u2014even decades\u2014before they diminish. Consequently, a large part of humans\u2019 current exposure to dioxins is due to releases of dioxins that were stored in soil and sediment, and to a lesser extent in vegetation and the atmosphere.  These sources are called \u201creservoir sources.\u201d EPA believes that with the reduction in current emissions from combustion and incineration, these reservoir sources have taken on more significance.", "According to EPA, dioxins always occur in the environment and in humans as complex mixtures of individual compounds. However, the complex nature of the dioxin mixtures to which people are exposed (through foods or other sources) complicates evaluation of the health risks such mixtures might pose. Scientists therefore developed the concept of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) to facilitate risk assessment of exposure to these mixtures. Because TCDD is the best-understood dioxin, it is used as a frame of reference for estimating the toxicity of the other dioxins, and its TEF is set at 1.0. Only 1 of the other 28 dioxins included in EPA\u2019s reassessment has a TEF of 1.0; most of the others have TEFs of 0.1 or less, meaning that they are considered less toxic to humans than TCDD. International experts review and periodically update the TEFs based on new data. For its reassessment of dioxins, EPA used the latest revisions that were made at an expert meeting organized by the World Health Organization in 1997.", "Since 1991, EPA has been updating its initial 1985 report assessing the health risks of dioxins. The October 2001 draft reassessment report exceeds 3,000 pages. Part I of the draft report provides information on exposure to dioxins, including chapters on dietary intake; part II addresses health assessment methodologies and specific health effects; and part III, the Integrated Summary highlights information in parts I and II on exposure and health effects and provides a risk characterization\u2014a statement summarizing EPA\u2019s assessment of the health risks associated with dioxins. In the reassessment, EPA studied the risks of cancer as well as noncancer health effects, such as neurological and reproductive impairments.", "Founded in 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations, with 191 member states. WHO\u2019s functions include giving worldwide guidance in the field of health and setting global standards for health. WHO carries out these functions through a variety of offices and programs that often collaborate with each other and with other public health entities of WHO\u2019s member states and nongovernmental organizations. The principal contributors to the WHO reassessments of dioxin risks that are discussed in this report have been (1) the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which coordinates and conducts both epidemiological and laboratory research into the causes of cancer; (2) the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, which coordinates comprehensive efforts, in collaboration with the International Programme on Chemical Safety, to evaluate the possible health risks of dioxins as well as methods of prevention and control of environmental exposure of the general population to these chemicals; and (3) the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization and WHO, which provides scientific evaluations as a basis for the development of food standards by the Codex Alimentarius (food code) Commission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Used Data on the Presence of Dioxins, Toxicity, and Food Consumption to Estimate Human Dietary Exposure", "paragraphs": ["To estimate dietary exposure to dioxins, EPA obtained and reviewed information on (1) the dioxins present in 10 types of foods with high fat content, (2) the toxicity of individual dioxins contained in these food types, and (3) the quantities of these foods that people in the United States typically eat. EPA has incorporated new studies following improvements in analytical capabilities to detect dioxins in food during the 1990s. However, in its draft reassessment report, EPA identified a number of limitations with the food data used to estimate dietary exposure that add uncertainty to the agency\u2019s overall estimate of current average daily dietary exposure to dioxins. For example, in some cases, the studies available on the presence of dioxins in foods were not designed to estimate national averages. Further, while EPA used the accepted method for estimating the toxicity of the dioxins found in the 10 food types, EPA and others acknowledge that the method has limitations. Finally, EPA estimated the quantities of these foods consumed using U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data on U.S. adults\u2019 food consumption based on surveys made between 1989 and 1991; however, EPA believes the dietary habits of Americans have changed very little over the course of the past decade."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA Estimates That Most Human Exposure to Dioxins Occurs from Eating Certain Types of Foods", "paragraphs": ["A body of scientific research on foods in Europe, North America, and other locations indicates that the primary source of human exposure to dioxins is the dietary intake of foods, especially those containing animal fat. According to EPA\u2019s October 2001 draft reassessment report, the average adult in the United States receives about 95 percent of his or her exposure to dioxins by eating commonly consumed foods, such as beef, pork, and poultry; fish; and dairy products. (EPA estimated small exposures to dioxins from the air and soil as well.)", "The 10 types of foods EPA analyzed for its reassessment are beef; pork; poultry; other meats, such as lamb and baloney; eggs; milk; dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt; freshwater fish and shellfish; marine fish and shellfish; and vegetable fat, such as corn and olive oils and margarine. These foods, only one of which is not of animal origin, are believed to be the major contributors to dietary exposure to dioxins. Even though vegetable fat products are estimated to contain low levels of dioxins, EPA included these foods in its analysis because they are high in fat and common in the American diet. EPA excluded fruits and vegetables from its analysis because data on dioxins in U.S. fruit and vegetable products, which generally contain little or no fat, are extremely limited. The existing data indicate that typically these products contain low levels of dioxins, which generally stem from residues\u2014deposits on outer layers with little penetration to inner portions.", "Until recently, chemical analyses of dioxins in foods have focused primarily on two of the families of dioxins, the CDDs and CDFs, with less attention on identifying and measuring specific PCBs. The draft reassessment report includes an evaluation of PCB levels in the 10 food types. The draft report identifies estimated exposures to CDDs and CDFs together and identifies the estimated exposure to PCBs separately. This approach provides information that can inform potential regulatory approaches, among other things, because CDDs and CDFs result primarily from combustion and industrial processes, whereas PCBs, which persist in the environment from the 1970s and earlier, are no longer being manufactured.", "As shown in table 1, EPA estimated that the average adult in the United States is exposed daily to about 63 picograms of dioxins through dietary intake, with the highest exposure coming from beef and freshwater fish and shellfish. According to EPA, this exposure level is close to the level that has caused adverse noncancer effects in animals, such as effects on the development of reproductive systems. It is important to note that EPA\u2019s dietary exposure estimates are averages, and they do not apply to adults with additional or unusual exposure to dioxins\u2014for example, from diets unusually high in fat content or diets of foods high in dioxin content."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Food Samples EPA Studied to Identify the Presence of Dioxins Had a Variety of Limitations", "paragraphs": ["To estimate any population\u2019s dietary intake of dioxins, the specific dioxins present in the various foods must be identified and measured through chemical analyses of the foods. However, reliable estimates of the average concentrations of dioxins in specific foods nationwide have only recently begun to be available. In the past, data were available only from studies of dioxin concentrations in a specific food product or products in a specific location or a few locations, and these data were not sufficient to reliably estimate average national exposure. During the 1990s, as analytical capabilities to detect dioxins at parts-per-trillion levels were developed, new studies of foods in the United States, some with broader scope than the earlier studies, became available. EPA has incorporated new studies into its analysis of dietary exposure to dioxins to try to develop more reliable national estimates of such exposure. As a result, the estimates presented in the October 2001 draft reassessment report are based on more food data than the drafts developed just a few years ago.", "Nevertheless, in its October 2001 draft reassessment report, EPA said that the amount and the representativeness of the food data it used to estimate the average U.S. adult\u2019s dietary exposure to dioxins vary.  Further, EPA officials acknowledged that some of the available studies were not designed to estimate national average exposures. As discussed below, the food sample data are limited in part by the timing of the sampling, variations in the methods used to collect the samples, and the types of samples collected and analyzed.  In commenting on a draft of this report, EPA officials said that these food data limitations do not represent major weaknesses in its estimates of dietary exposure to dioxins.", "As reported in the draft reassessment, most of the food samples were collected between 5 and 8 years ago. Current samples would be expected to have lower dioxin levels because emissions containing dioxins declined by about 75 percent from 1987 to 1995, and EPA believes the downward trend is continuing. Nevertheless, EPA believes that the exposure estimates based on food data from the mid-1990s are representative of current dietary exposure for several reasons.  First, EPA believes that because most of the food samples the agency used for its reassessment were collected after the 75-percent decrease in emissions, much of the decrease should already be reflected in the foods\u2019 dioxin concentration numbers.  Second, EPA said that, because most municipal and medical waste incinerators are located far from and downwind of concentrated meat and dairy production areas, the impact of any emission reductions since 1995 on the commercial food supply should be proportionately less than on the environment in general.  Third, EPA said that because reservoir sources of dioxins account for half or more of current exposure, and because some sources of dioxins are unknown, it is unlikely that emission reductions that occurred after most of the food samples were taken would significantly affect the current estimate of general population exposure from the commercial food supply.", "According to EPA, while its analyses of some of the foods are based on national samples collected from food processing or food monitoring locations, such as federal slaughtering establishments, other analyses are based on limited \u201cmarket basket surveys\u201d\u2014random purchases of selected products, such as eggs, direct from grocery stores\u2014in a small number of U.S. and Canadian cities. Depending on their design, national surveys would generally be more representative of average dietary exposures to dioxins than limited surveys.", "Some of the analyses of the foods were derived from individual food samples, while others were from composite samples. Using composites is more economical than using individual samples, and EPA believes they are appropriate for use in analyzing dioxin concentrations to establish average, or mean, exposure estimates. However, EPA acknowledges that data on the variability or range of results from individual samples typically are not available from studies analyzing composite samples. As a result, information that can provide insight into the reliability of the estimates is not available. Table 2 shows the number(s), type(s), and date(s) of the samples EPA used for each of the 10 food categories.", "According to the draft reassessment report, data from some of the food studies were sufficient to estimate exposure to total dioxins\u2014the CDDs, CDFs, and PCBs. However, the report shows that in other cases, the data only provided support for estimating exposure to CDDs and CDFs. As a result, for four food categories, different studies are used for estimating exposure to CDDs and CDFs than those used for PCBs. As reported in the draft reassessment, these studies analyzed fewer samples, a number of which were collected 14 or more years ago and therefore provide data on dioxins that may not reflect current levels. Table 3 shows information on the four foods for which EPA used different samples to estimate exposure to PCBs than those used to estimate CDDs and CDFs.", "As EPA acknowledges in the draft report, its analyses of dioxins present in foods are based on uncooked foods, even though dioxin levels can be different in cooked and uncooked foods. According to EPA, while many studies indicate that foods have similar dioxin concentrations whether they are cooked or uncooked, the studies show that some foods have lower concentrations of dioxins when they are cooked, while others have higher levels when they are cooked. These differences reflect, in part, the fact that different cooking methods (frying, boiling, grilling, etc.) may have different effects on dioxin levels. On the basis of the available data, which it believes are not conclusive, EPA states in the draft reassessment report that uncooked food is a reasonable surrogate to use for identifying and quantifying dioxin concentrations in cooked food.", "Because the primary focus of EPA\u2019s exposure assessment was on foods produced and consumed in the United States, EPA\u2019s analysis does not address imported food products that may vary from domestic sources in dioxin content.", "Despite these limitations, the data on dioxin levels in foods supporting the October 2001 draft report reflect a significant improvement compared with the data EPA had available for use in its 1994 draft reassessment report, which was peer reviewed in 1995 by EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board. Specifically, in the 1994 draft, EPA provided estimates of levels of CDDs and CDFs for seven food types; the October 2001 draft provided estimates for ten food types. With the exception of an estimate for fish that was based on 60 samples, the 1994 draft estimates were developed from samples ranging in number from 2 to 14; as table 2 shows, the number of samples used for the 2001 draft is greater. In addition, while EPA recognized that PCBs were being identified in foods, the agency did not have sufficient data at that time to develop estimates of the levels of specific PCBs in foods; the 2001 draft does include estimates of PCB levels in foods.", "The following sections describe in greater detail the samples EPA used to identify the level of dioxins in 9 of the 10 foods studied\u2014beef, pork, and poultry; freshwater and marine fish; milk, dairy, and eggs; and vegetable fat\u2014and any associated limitations or uncertainties. (The draft reassessment report does not provide any information supporting EPA\u2019s estimate of the types and amounts of dioxins in other meats, the tenth food type. In commenting on a draft of our report, EPA said that information on other meats would be provided in its final report.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Beef, Pork, and Poultry", "paragraphs": ["In estimating exposure to dioxins from beef, pork, and poultry, EPA used data from the first statistically designed national surveys of dioxin levels in these foods sponsored by EPA and USDA. These surveys were designed to be representative of all U.S. regions and all classes of animals slaughtered in federally inspected slaughtering establishments. EPA believes the three surveys provide reasonable estimates of the average national concentrations of dioxins in beef, pork, and poultry. Nonetheless, information EPA provided in the draft reassessment report about these samples identifies some limitations and uncertainties about these studies.", "The samples are now between 6 and 8 years old and therefore may not reflect current exposures. To address this data gap, EPA and USDA are conducting a follow-up study on dioxin levels in beef, pork, and poultry that will commence in 2002 and provide updated information. However, EPA officials said the results of this survey will likely not be available for incorporation into the dioxin reassessment report that EPA plans to publish this year.", "The animal samples for beef, pork, and poultry were not meat products sold in grocery stores but rather were cuts of fat generally not consumed\u2014either back fat, abdominal fat, or belly fat from slaughtering establishments. Some uncertainty therefore surrounds the accuracy of EPA\u2019s estimates of dietary intake of dioxins because of comparability concerns. EPA used this approach because USDA federal inspectors could obtain the samples with little disruption to the slaughtering establishments and because the samples\u2019 high fat content would enable more accurate measurement of dioxins, since the analysis would be of highly concentrated fat samples. However, this approach assumes that edible meat products sold in grocery stores contain the same types and amounts of dioxins as the fat samples (adjusted for differences in percentages of fat). According to EPA, this assumption is supported by a well-developed understanding of the manner in which dioxins distribute across fat reservoirs in vertebrates.  Therefore, EPA concluded that the fat samples for all three foods were comparable to the edible meat samples. EPA also based its conclusion on its analysis of beef samples\u2014comparing five back fat samples with other cattle parts, including muscle tissue, which could be representative of edible beef products. For the five samples, the ratios of CDDs and CDFs in muscle fat to CDDs and CDFs in back fat varied by up to 300 percent, ranging from 0.58 to 1.7; and the ratios for PCBs varied by up to 50 percent, from 1.0 to 1.5. Although some of the variation may result from imprecision inherent in measuring picograms, this limited analysis indicates that using fat samples may overstate or understate to some extent the dioxin levels in beef, pork, and poultry products.", "EPA reported that it excluded 2 of the 80 samples of abdominal fat from poultry because they had significantly higher concentrations of certain dioxins than the other samples. EPA, USDA, and the Food and Drug Administration investigated the cause of these elevated dioxin levels and determined that it stemmed from contaminated animal feed that had been distributed to poultry, fish, hog, and cattle producers in several southern and southwestern states. EPA considered the two poultry fat samples inappropriate for the dioxins study, which was aimed at identifying typical exposures to dioxins. However, it is not clear that the poultry samples with high concentrations of dioxins were anomalies because the incidence of dioxin contamination in animal feeds is not known.  For example, this instance of contaminated animal feed was discovered by the first national poultry sample, which tested only 80 samples nationwide. In response to suggestions from a peer review panel, when the data were sufficient to do so, EPA presented a standard deviation\u2014the typical amount of variability around the mean\u2014on its estimates of the average levels of dioxins in the foods, as well as the range of the levels of dioxins identified in the samples. For beef, pork, and poultry, EPA was able to provide this information for the CDDs and CDFs. These data indicated considerable variability in the levels of CDDs and CDFs in the foods. For example, the estimated level of 0.28 picograms of dioxins in a gram of pork has a standard deviation of plus or minus 0.28. In other words, the standard deviation is equal to or greater than the mean. Accordingly, the estimated dioxin level is subject to a wide range of uncertainty.", "Because EPA did not have sufficient information to develop a standard deviation for PCBs, the agency could not develop a standard deviation for total dioxins (the combination of CDDs, CDFs, PCBs) in beef, pork, and poultry. As a result, EPA could not state with any degree of certainty that exposure to total dioxins or to PCBs would fall within specified levels. EPA believes this limitation is a minor one because it considers the average exposure level, rather than the more limited extreme exposures, to be of greater public health interest. Nonetheless, this additional analysis, if available, would enable policymakers, scientific peer reviewers, and other users to better evaluate the extent to which the data may be representative of average national exposures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Freshwater and Marine Fish and Shellfish", "paragraphs": ["Though EPA analyzed more fish samples for the current reassessment draft than for earlier drafts, the current draft report acknowledges that the levels of dioxins in fish are more uncertain than those in the other foods for two reasons. First, the data lack the \u201cgeographic coverage and statistical power\u201d of the other food surveys. That is, while the sample sizes for CDDs and CDFs in fish are considerably larger than those used for the analyses of other foods, they do not provide data that are nationally representative because of the diversity of fish and bodies of water. Specifically, there are a significant number and variety of freshwater and marine fish species living in numerous bodies of water that contain differing types and levels of dioxins. Moreover, fish consumed in the United States include both farm-raised and wild fish. Second, EPA based its estimates for levels of PCBs in fish on a much smaller data set than it used for CDDs and CDFs. EPA used 222 samples to estimate the levels of CDDs and CDFs in freshwater fish and shellfish and 158 samples for marine fish and shellfish compared with 7 and 6 composite samples for PCBs for freshwater and marine fish, respectively. Further, most of the samples for PCBs were from Canadian rather than U.S. cities, and the analyses of levels of PCBs in them did not evaluate all of the PCBs identified as being toxic. For example, according to the report, only one of the composite samples for marine fish and shellfish, collected between 1984 and 1986, was analyzed for the presence of the most common and toxic PCB, referred to as PCB-126. For these reasons, EPA acknowledges in the draft report that the resulting estimates are not representative of the level of dioxins in fish nationally. We note that the limitations of the data used to estimate the levels of PCBs in fish are particularly significant because in the report, EPA estimates that freshwater fish contains the highest levels of PCBs (and total dioxins) of all the foods studied.", "The samples EPA used to estimate the levels of dioxins in fish were derived from EPA\u2019s National Bioaccumulation Study and three market basket surveys in the United States and Canada. Samples for the bioaccumulation study were collected between 1986 and 1989, whereas the samples for the market basket surveys were collected about a decade later, between 1995 and 1999. Some of the limitations and uncertainties associated with these samples that EPA acknowledged in the draft report are highlighted below.", "Most of the fish samples used for the reassessment draft were collected 5 or more years ago; some are between 13 and 16 years old.", "EPA did not have sufficient data to estimate exposure to PCBs from eating freshwater or marine shellfish.", "Some of the estimates for freshwater fish, such as trout, are based on samples from the bioaccumulation study that may be more representative of wild fish (i.e., fish caught in recreational fishing) than fish typically purchased by the general population at grocery stores, which is largely farm-raised. Specifically, in cases in which EPA did not have data on farm- raised freshwater fish or fish purchased in grocery stores, the agency used the concentration of CDDs and CDFs from samples of wild caught fish from the bioaccumulation study. This use of older data on wild fish increases the uncertainty about the representativeness of EPA\u2019s exposure estimate.", "For some fish species, such as mullet and mackerel, estimates were based entirely on samples collected in the Mississippi area and therefore may not be representative of levels seen in other locations.", "EPA did not have sufficient data to estimate a standard deviation for the average levels of dioxins in freshwater or marine fish.

For each of the types of foods, EPA multiplied the measured types and amounts of the dioxins present by the related TEFs to arrive at a \u201cdioxin toxic equivalence value\u201d for that particular food category/dioxin combination. For each food category, the total dioxin toxic equivalency is the sum of these products\u2014that is, the sum of the toxic equivalence values for (1) CDDs and CDFs and (2) PCBs. This provides an indicator of the relative toxic concentration of dioxins in each food category. As table 4 shows, EPA estimated that freshwater fish and shellfish had the largest per-gram concentration of dioxins with toxic effects.", "The toxic equivalence approach using TEFs has evolved over the last 20 years and is the internationally accepted scientific approach for risk assessments of dioxins. This approach has been formally adopted by several countries and as guidance by international organizations, such as WHO. TEFs are used to decrease the overall uncertainty in assessing the health risks of dioxins because they provide a framework for addressing the complex mixtures of dioxins to which people are most often exposed. Nonetheless, a number of uncertainties are involved in the use of the TEF concept. As a result of these uncertainties, estimates of the concentrations of dioxins in foods based on this approach may be overstated or understated.", "The draft reassessment report acknowledges that there are still many questions about the use of the TEF method and the validity of some of the underlying assumptions. The report states that many assumptions are necessary because of lack of data. Specifically, the derivation of TEFs is limited by the amount of available data on the relative potency of different dioxins compared with TCDD. For many dioxins, the available data on relative potency may be limited to only a few experimentally observed effects. Some of these effects may not be considered toxic by themselves, but they still might provide evidence that exposure to dioxins led to biological or chemical effects in experimental subjects. For example, EPA noted that only TCDD and one mixture of certain dioxins have been tested for carcinogenicity. Therefore, in order to develop a TEF that estimates the cancer potency of a mixture including other dioxins, scientists have assumed that the relative potencies observed for noncancer effects approximate those for cancer. In other words, once derived, TEFs apply to all effects, not just those for which relative potency data were available.", "Nonetheless, after considering a number of the uncertainties and limitations of this approach, the international experts who derived the current TEFs concluded that the TEF concept is still the most plausible and feasible approach for risk assessment of dioxins. Furthermore, the TEF values for individual dioxins are reevaluated and updated periodically to reflect the available evidence. When WHO established the most recent TEFs in 1998, it suggested that the toxic equivalency scheme be reevaluated every 5 years and that the TEFs and their application to risk assessment be reanalyzed to account for emerging scientific information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Daily Dietary Intake Estimates Are Primarily Based on Food Surveys of U.S. Adults Administered Between 1989 and 1991", "paragraphs": ["To develop its estimate of the daily dietary intake of dioxins by the average adult in the United States, EPA needed to calculate the amount of food containing dioxins that Americans typically eat.

In these surveys, individuals generally provided detailed information on food consumption for 2 days. The surveys used statistical sampling to ensure that all seasons, geographic regions of the United States, and demographic and socio- demographic groups were represented. EPA\u2019s analysis of these data tabulated intake rates for the major foods, as well as for individual food items. The total quantity of each food eaten by the survey population in a survey day was tabulated and weighted to represent the quantity eaten by the entire U.S. population in a typical day.

Specifically, the draft reassessment report derived its estimates of the daily dietary intake of beef, pork, poultry, milk, dairy products, vegetable fats, and eggs from USDA\u2019s Continuing Survey Food Intake By Individuals conducted from 1989 through 1991. In contrast, the daily dietary intake of freshwater and marine fish and shellfish were derived from a March 2000 report on the consumption of fish prepared by EPA\u2019s Office of Water. This report used data from USDA\u2019s Continuing Survey of Food Intakes By Individuals conducted in 1994, 1995, and 1996. In this report, EPA weighted its estimates of exposure to dioxins from fish by the species-specific concentrations according to species-specific fish consumption rates for the U.S. population. However, in cases where species-specific concentration data were not available, EPA used default values. For example, EPA used data from the bioaccumulation study as the default for certain freshwater fish. The use of various default assumptions adds uncertainty to the exposure estimates.", "EPA officials said that EPA did not use more current dietary intake data from USDA in the October 2001 draft reassessment because EPA has not yet fully reviewed surveys subsequent to the 1989-91 surveys that it uses in its Exposure Factors Handbook. EPA officials told us that they did not believe it was necessary to use more current data because the dietary habits of Americans have changed very little over the course of the past decade.

Specifically, both EPA and WHO reviewed available scientific data from many studies of humans and animals covering a variety of effects potentially associated with exposure to dioxins;   continued to consider cancer risks, as in the original dioxin risk assessments, but also paid increasing attention to noncancer health effects, such as changes in reproductive and developmental functions and the immune and nervous systems, as well as other health problems, such as chloracne (a chronic and disfiguring skin disease) and alterations in liver enzyme levels; reviewed evidence regarding other biochemical, molecular, or cellular effects that have been observed in various studies, agreeing that these effects might be precursors to subsequent adverse effects; and   considered a range of analytical methods, models, and approaches to assess the dose-response relationships for exposure to dioxins.", "EPA and WHO also used some analytical concepts and methods that they agreed were more appropriate to the analysis of dioxins than those that are often used for risk assessments of other chemicals. For example, both entities used body burden\u2014the concentration of dioxins in the body\u2014 instead of other dose measures, such as daily intake, to compare risks between humans and animals and determine doses that would be of equivalent risk in humans and animals. The organizations also concurred that the concept of toxic equivalency should be used to facilitate risk assessment of dioxins and complex mixtures of dioxins. Furthermore, in contrast to chemical risk assessments in general, EPA and WHO often had sufficient data to focus on the dose level associated with a 1-percent increase in a particular effect (rather than being limited to the level associated with a 10-percent increase) and seldom had to extrapolate outside the observed doses or exposures from the studies that they used to prepare the reassessments.", "Much of the scientific data available to EPA and WHO on the potential effects of exposure to dioxins came from animal studies, mainly studies of TCDD on a variety of species.

However, EPA\u2019s and WHO\u2019s recent reassessment efforts also benefited from the increasing quantity and quality of data on the effects of dioxins in humans that became available during their reassessments. Among the sources of these human data were studies of occupational exposure of people who produce and apply herbicides; residents in a contaminated area of Seveso, Italy (where an accident at a chemical factory had released a cloud of toxic chemicals, including dioxins, in 1976); and noncancer effects in infants and children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA and WHO Had Similar Overall Conclusions but Differed on Some Important Issues", "paragraphs": ["The conclusions EPA and WHO reached on the basis of their respective dioxin reassessments were frequently similar, but some significant differences also emerged.

In contrast, WHO concluded that there is a threshold for all adverse effects, including cancer. Specifically, WHO concluded that dioxins do not initiate cancer through a direct effect on genetic material (that is, they are non-genotoxic carcinogens) and, therefore, do not warrant a linear (no threshold) assessment of risk. WHO also concluded that noncancer health effects occurred at lower body burdens (concentrations) of dioxins than the body burdens at which cancer occurred in animals. Accordingly, WHO determined that establishing a tolerable intake based on estimated thresholds for noncancer effects would also address any cancer risks (that is, if the intake were set to avoid appreciable noncancer health consequences, it should also avoid appreciable consequences concerning cancer)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimating a \u201cTolerable\u201d Dose or One Without Appreciable Risk", "paragraphs": ["WHO programs estimated a tolerable daily intake for dioxins in 1998 and a tolerable monthly intake in 2001.

EPA\u2019s related (but not identical) measure is the reference dose, which would estimate a daily exposure to the human population, including sensitive subgroups, that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. EPA, however, chose not to calculate a reference dose for dioxins, as it generally does for noncancer health assessments of other substances. According to EPA, it did not do so because any reference dose that it would recommend for dioxins would likely be below (perhaps considerably below) the current background intake levels and body burdens of the U.S. population. EPA pointed out that reference doses are typically calculated to address the risks of incremental exposures over background exposure. In the case of dioxins, however, background exposure is a significant component of total exposure. Therefore, in EPA\u2019s opinion, a reference dose would be uninformative to risk managers for safety assessment. EPA also noted that, if it were to set a reference dose, its estimate likely would be more stringent than the tolerable intake levels for dioxins proposed by WHO because EPA\u2019s traditional approach for setting a reference dose gives more weight to scientific uncertainties than the approach WHO used in setting its tolerable intake level.", "EPA chose instead to use an alternative approach, the margin of exposure, to characterize noncancer risks. The margin of exposure is a ratio that shows how far the actual (or estimated) total human exposure to a particular substance is from levels at which adverse effects have been demonstrated to occur in human or animal studies. The margin of exposure is an alternative way of characterizing the likelihood that noncancer effects may be occurring in the human population at environmental exposure levels. A reference dose, on the other hand, estimates a level of exposure below which EPA considers it unlikely that any adverse effects will occur. EPA generally considers margins of exposure of 100 or more as adequate to rule out the likelihood of significant effects occurring in humans.

EPA\u2019s reassessment also states that the vast majority of the population is expected to have less risk per unit of exposure and some may have zero risk. WHO did not carry out such a quantitative assessment of the general population\u2019s cancer risk for two main reasons. First, calculations of population risk are beyond the scope of WHO\u2019s IARC cancer monographs, which evaluate whether and under what circumstances particular substances could pose a cancer risk to humans but generally do not provide quantitative risk estimates.

For example, while the July 2000 panel agreed that TCDD is clearly a potent carcinogen in many species of animals, most of the panel thought that human epidemiology studies were too limited, and the results not consistent enough, to serve as a basis for showing increased cancer mortality. As a result, the majority felt that the characterization of TCDD as a known human carcinogen was not justified. Similarly, the Board panel also noted limitations in the scientific data, questioning the epidemiological data that indicated dioxins are carcinogens in humans, as well as the data that supported similar modes of action occurring in both animals and humans. Almost one-half of the Board did not support classification of TCDD as a known human carcinogen for various reasons.

At the same time, however, these and earlier studies that EPA relied on became less current with the passage of time. Overall, while EPA\u2019s draft reassessment report has advanced the state of knowledge on dietary exposure to dioxins in the United States, the extent to which the estimate accurately reflects current average daily exposure is not known.  EPA acknowledges the need for additional research on dietary intake, identifying a number of data limitations associated with the estimates it developed in its October 2001 draft report. Future efforts could eliminate most of the food data limitations of the reassessment. Such efforts could include periodic, comprehensive food surveys that analyze samples of the most commonly eaten food products in each type of food studied, with samples collected within the same time frames and analyses performed using standardized methodologies.  Further, when they become available, the results of the ongoing EPA/USDA follow-up study on dioxin levels in beef, pork, and poultry should provide quantitative information on the changes, if any, in dioxin levels in these foods from the mid-1990\u2019s to the present."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["We provided EPA with a draft of this report for its review and comment and the draft segment comparing EPA\u2019s and WHO\u2019s assessments of dioxins to WHO.

The discrepancies we identify between the Integrated Summary and supporting chapters appear in the October 2001 reassessment documents that EPA distributed for internal agency review.  We identified them primarily to inform readers of our report of the source of the information we cite.  For example, a reader of the Integrated Summary would find (outdated) information on 9 food types, whereas we are citing information on 10 food types that is provided in the supporting chapters of EPA\u2019s reassessment documents and that EPA officials told us is correct. 2. Throughout the section of our report on EPA\u2019s estimate of dietary exposure to dioxins, we attribute the identification of the limitations to EPA\u2019s draft reassessment report. 3. Our report did not characterize the significance of the limitations EPA identified in its reassessment documents.  We have added to the report EPA\u2019s opinion that these limitations do not represent major weaknesses in its estimates of dietary exposure to dioxins. 4. The statement in our report that that the available studies generally were not designed to estimate national exposures is derived from page 76 of EPA\u2019s October 2001 Integrated Summary draft.  In this document EPA says:  \u201cThe amount and representativeness of the data vary, but in general these data were derived from studies that were not designed to estimate national background means.\u201d  In its written comments, EPA says that most of the dietary exposure it estimated was derived from studies specifically designed to estimate national exposures.  In support of this point, EPA says that 66 percent of the estimated exposure to dioxins is from eating beef, pork, poultry, milk, and dairy products, and that these studies were designed to estimate national exposures.  (We note that these studies cover 5 of the 10 food types on which EPA based its exposure estimates.) Importantly, our draft report stated that the studies on beef, pork, and poultry were based on the first statistically designed national surveys of dioxin levels in these foods and that the milk samples upon which both the milk and dairy estimates were based came from a national survey with samples collected from sampling stations in a majority of the states. However, while our review of EPA\u2019s milk survey design plan indicated the milk samples were intended to assess the levels of dioxins in the general milk supply of the United States, the survey design document also stated that (1) the milk would be collected from dairy plants around the United States that represent approximately 20 percent of the nation\u2019s milk supply and (2) the survey was not designed to be statistically rigorous\u2014that is, it was not intended to randomly sample milk in such a way that the results could be generalized to the full milk supply with a known degree of precision.  Thus, we concluded that EPA\u2019s statement in the Integrated Summary\u2014that the studies covering the 10 food types generally were not designed to estimate national exposures\u2014was accurate.  In light of EPA\u2019s comments and the fact that the milk samples used to estimate milk and dairy exposures did have national coverage, we have revised the report to indicate that EPA acknowledges that some of the available studies were not designed to estimate national average exposures. 5. We revised the description of the fat samples from \u201cinedible fat samples\u201d to cuts of fat, such as back fat on cattle, that generally are not consumed by the U.S. public. 6. We understand that there is variability associated with measurements at the picogram level.  Nonetheless, we continue to believe that the variability identified among the five samples studied indicates that using fat samples not consumed by the public may overstate or understate to some extent dioxin levels in beef, pork, and poultry products sold to the public. 7. In its comments, EPA stated that it believes that sufficient information is available to support a conclusion that, in spite of the emission reduction of the late 1990s, the exposure estimates of the draft reassessment are a reasonable characterization of contemporary exposure.  We have revised the report to include EPA\u2019s opinion and the reasons it cited in support of its view that the emission reduction in the late 1990s does not significantly affect the current estimate of general population exposure.  However, because EPA does not have data on dioxin emissions after 1995, we cannot evaluate EPA\u2019s conclusion. 8. EPA stated that it plans to delete information on the variability in dairy concentration data from the reassessment report, and we have therefore deleted this point from our report. 9. We understand that the contamination of the two samples eliminated from EPA\u2019s estimate was found to stem from a localized ball clay contamination.  However, we continue to believe that because of the lack of information on the incidence of dioxin contamination in animal feeds as well as on the potential sources of such contamination, it is not clear that the poultry samples with high concentrations of dioxins were anomalies. For example, this animal feed contamination problem was identified as a result of the first national survey of only 80 poultry fat samples.  We acknowledge that a decision to exclude apparently anomalous information entails professional judgment.  However, because the incidence of contamination of animal feed is unknown, we believe that it is important for users of the dioxin reassessment to understand the judgments EPA made in estimating dietary exposure. 10. In the draft report, EPA does not provide information on the assumptions and analyses used to estimate the average fat percentages for pork and poultry.  However, EPA does provide some information on how it estimated the fat percentage for beef.  The fat percentage estimates affect the exposure estimates, and we believe this information should be included in the reassessment report.  In its comments to us, EPA stated that the agency is considering adding information about the pork and poultry estimates to the report.  We are therefore deleting references to this point in our report. 11. We deleted the phrase \u201cassembled by EPA\u201d to be consistent with information we provide in the body of the report that the peer review panelists were selected by an independent contractor. 12. We have revised this statement to reflect the fact that most (rather than all) of the other dioxins have TEFs of 0.1 or lower. 13. We clarified that TEFs apply to all effects, not just those for which relative potency data were available."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Other key contributors to this report include Timothy Bober, Greg Carroll, Nancy Crothers, Greg Wilmoth, and Carrie Wheeler."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
