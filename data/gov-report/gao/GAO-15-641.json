In July 2013, FMCSA began to enforce three new provisions of its HOS rule. GAO was asked to review a 2014 FMCSA study on the rule, as well as the rule's assumptions and effects. This report (1) compares the study to generally accepted research standards, and (2) identifies the assumptions used to estimate the rule's costs and benefits and the rule's driver-operation, economic, safety, and health effects.", "GAO identified research standards that professional associations, academics, and GAO's prior work have used. GAO evaluated the 2014 FMCSA study against these standards. GAO also compared FMCSA's assumptions about how drivers would be affected by the HOS rule against actual drivers' schedule data from 16 for-hire carriers that cover the years 2012 through 2014. These data include information on over 15,000 drivers per year, but are not generalizable to the motor carrier industry as a whole."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the January 2014 study issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to examine the efficacy of its hours of service (HOS) rule\u2014a regulation that governs how many hours truck drivers transporting freight can work\u2014followed most generally accepted research standards. However, FMCSA did not completely meet certain research standards such as reporting limitations and linking the conclusions to the results. For example, by not adhering to these standards, FMCSA's conclusion in the study about the extent to which crash risk is reduced by the HOS rule may be overstated. GAO found that FMCSA has not adopted guidance on the most appropriate methods for designing, analyzing, and reporting the results of scientific research. Without such guidance, FMCSA may be at risk for excluding critical elements in research it undertakes to evaluate the safety of its rules, leaving itself open to criticism.", "FMCSA made several assumptions and anticipated certain effects of the HOS rule in the regulatory impact analysis. Specifically, to estimate the economic costs of the rule, FMCSA assumed that some drivers would lose a certain amount of driving and on-duty time and then estimated the amount and cost of the work time lost. Further, FMCSA assumed that reduced work time could increase a driver's opportunity to sleep, leading to safety and health benefits. Assessing the effectiveness of the HOS rule is difficult because of the limited availability of representative driver schedule data (i.e., records of drivers' work hours). Nevertheless, GAO's analysis of a limited sample of available data provides some insight into the rule's effects and the extent to which they aligned with FMCSA's assumptions and estimates. For example, according to GAO's analysis, some drivers at a sample of 16 for-hire carriers who worked the longest hours (over 65 hours per work week) reduced their work hours after the rule went into effect, a finding consistent with FMCSA's assumptions that drivers working over 65 hours were more likely to be affected. However, GAO's analysis found that drivers who worked less than 65 hours per work week also changed their schedules after the rule went into effect, a result not anticipated by FMCSA.", "The ability of FMCSA and others to assess the effects of rules, such as the 2011 HOS rule, is impacted by the limited availability of representative driver schedule data. No organization collects or maintains a centralized database with such data that can be generalized to the motor carrier industry as a whole. Collecting schedule data has historically been difficult, but a recent statutory change that requires carriers to electronically record and store these data provides a potential data source for the future. However, before these data can be used for research purposes several challenges would have to be addressed. First, there are statutory limits on the use of these data for purposes other than enforcing motor carrier safety regulations. Additionally, privacy and cost concerns must be resolved before these data could be made available for analysis. According to FMCSA officials, they do not plan to study how to use these data in a way that will address privacy and cost concerns, in part, because of the statutory limits. Given the potential value of these data to future regulatory analysis, it may be important to provide Congress with information on how these data can be extracted, stored, and analyzed while addressing any privacy and cost concerns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FMCSA adopt guidance outlining agency research standards.

For example, FMCSA  increased the daily driving limit from 10 to 11 hours, but also extended the  amount of time drivers must spend off-duty following time spent driving or  working from 8 to 10 hours. The 2003 final rule led to a decade of legal  challenges from organizations representing motor carriers, which believed  the HOS rule would negatively impact economic productivity, and from  safety advocacy organizations, which believed that the rule did not  sufficiently protect safety and health. In an effort to address these  concerns, FMCSA revised the HOS rule three more times between 2005  and 2011, publishing a final rule on December 27, 2011.

We also conducted a  literature review of scholarly peer reviewed materials, government  reports, and conference papers that discussed the validity and reliability  of the fatigue measures used in the field study, as well as assessed the  relationships between these measures and on-the-road safety outcomes  (e.g., crashes).", "To identify key assumptions FMCSA used to estimate the effects of the  2011 HOS rule, we first identified those assumptions that likely had an  important effect on estimated costs and benefits. We then categorized  these assumptions into five areas: which drivers were affected, how  drivers were affected, economic costs, safety benefits, and health  benefits. FMCSA officials confirmed that our characterization of key  assumptions was accurate. To evaluate what is known about the  economic, safety, and health effects of the 2011 HOS rule, we conducted  a comprehensive search for existing databases with information on motor  carrier operations and asked officials from FMCSA and other  stakeholders for recommendations of databases we could use to analyze  the effects of the rule. Through this process we identified three relevant  data sources suitable for analysis: (1) driver logbook data from the  American Transportation Research Institute that covers the years 2012,  2013, and 2014 and includes information on over 15,000 drivers from 16  for-hire carriers; (2) vehicle count data from the Federal Highway  Administration that covers the years 2012 and 2013 and includes data on  non-commodity-carrying (including passenger) vehicles, and commodity- carrying (i.e., commercial) vehicles from select locations in 14 states; and  (3) FMCSA data on all reported crashes involving commercial motor  vehicles in the United States that covers the years 2008 through 2014.  We reviewed the reliability of these data by examining documentation,  talking with knowledgeable officials, and checking the data for  completeness and reasonableness and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the specific purposes of our data analysis. We  analyzed data from each of these sources to identify any possible  changes in motor carrier behavior and safety outcomes as a result of the  HOS rule. While these were the best data available, the results of the  analysis of driver logbook data cannot be generalized to the entire motor  carrier industry. In addition, we used a biomathematical fatigue model that  estimates human alertness based on working schedules to determine  possible fatigue levels for drivers before and after the 2011 HOS rule  went into effect in July 2013. We also reviewed provisions in the Moving  Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) requiring motor  carriers to electronically record drivers\u2019 schedules and compared  FMCSA\u2019s lack of such schedule data to data collection practices of other  DOT agencies that regulate hours of service.", "We also spoke with FMCSA officials, the authors of the field study, and  other selected experts and stakeholders, including fatigue experts,  organizations representing motor carriers, safety advocacy organizations,  motor carrier companies, commercial vehicle drivers, and customers of  the motor carrier industry (e.g., companies that ship freight). We selected  fatigue experts based on academic articles they published related to the  fatigue measures used in the field study, as well as our prior work on  fatigue science. We selected organizations representing motor carriers,  safety advocacy organizations, and shipping companies to interview  based on our prior work on commercial motor carrier safety and  recommendations from various stakeholders. We selected motor carrier  companies to speak with based on several criteria, including how they  operated (i.e., the distance they traveled), their fleet size, and the cargo  they transported. Motor carrier companies we spoke with also put us in  contact with drivers whom we interviewed to understand how the 2011  rule had impacted them. The views and information collected from  interviews of these stakeholders are not generalizable to other motor  carrier stakeholders.

As of December 2013, FMCSA estimates that there were more than  539,000 active motor carriers and 5.6 million commercial drivers  operating in the United States that transport freight and move people,  numbers that fluctuate over time due to the tens of thousands of carriers  that enter and leave the market annually. Truck carriers are responsible  for transporting approximately 13 billion tons of cargo annually,  representing 67 percent of all cargo weight that was shipped in 2012.", "The United States\u2019 commercial motor-carrier industry represents a range  of businesses, including private and for-hire freight transportation, passenger carriers, and specialized transporters of hazardous materials.  These carriers can be small and involve a single vehicle that is owned  and operated by a single individual, or large corporations that own tens of  thousands of vehicles. Similarly, commercial motor-vehicle operations  differ greatly, including whether a carrier operates locally, regionally, or  across the country (i.e., \u201cover-the-road\u201d), as well as the time of day when  a driver operates. In addition, some carriers move goods as part of a  single shipment to one destination (called \u201ctruckload\u201d operations), while  other carriers make numerous deliveries to many different destinations  (called \u201cless-than-truckload\u201d operations).", "Private carriers run an internal trucking operation to support a primary business in  another industry, such as a retail store chain, while for-hire carriers sell their trucking  services on the open market. vehicle. FMCSA has reported that the most commonly cited driver-related  factor in a fatal truck crash in 2012 was speeding. That same year,  driver impairment, including by fatigue, was the fourth most commonly  cited factor.", "Research indicates fatigue can lead to a state of diminished capacity,  which can have ramifications for humans such as having more difficulty  maintaining attention, becoming less communicative, and having reduced  situational awareness. People are then at greater risk of committing  errors in their work, which can ultimately lead to more crashes. Managing  fatigue is particularly critical for tasks that require constant attention, such  as driving a commercial vehicle.", "FMCSA is responsible for overseeing the large and diverse commercial  motor-vehicle industry. To do so, FMCSA establishes safety standards for  interstate motor carriers as well as intrastate hazardous-material carriers  operating in the United States. To enforce compliance with these  standards, FMCSA partners with state agencies to perform roadside  inspections of vehicles and investigations of carriers. In fiscal year 2014,  FMCSA had a budget of approximately $572 million and almost 1,100  FMCSA staff members located at headquarters, four regional service  centers, and 52 division offices.", "Drivers of commercial motor vehicles in the United States have been  subject to driving and working hour restrictions for almost 80 years. In 1937, the entity that previously carried out certain of FMCSA\u2019s current  functions\u2014the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2014adopted the first HOS  rule. While the specific requirements in several of the provisions of that  rule have changed over time, there are three general requirements that  are still in place today:", "Daily off-duty period: Drivers must be off-duty\u2014not working or  driving\u2014a minimum number of hours per day.", "Daily driving limit: Drivers can only drive a maximum number of  hours per day.", "60/70 hour on-duty limit: Drivers are restricted from driving when  they reach a total of 60 or 70 hours of on-duty time over a rolling 7-  or 8-day period, respectively.", "Because the 60/70 hour on-duty limit is a rolling period, drivers must  calculate these hours by looking back over the prior 7- or 8-day period.  For example, according to the schedule below, the driver has  accumulated 68 hours in the 8-day rolling period from Thursday to  Thursday, and 72 hours of on-duty time from Friday to Friday (see fig. 1).  In this example, the driver worked under 70 hours (68 hours total) and is  in compliance with the 60/70 hour on-duty limit from Thursday to  Thursday, but not from Friday to Friday when he worked more than 70  hours (72 hours total) over an 8 day period.", "In 2003, FMCSA altered the HOS rule for drivers transporting freight in  several significant ways:", "Created a 14-hour \u201cdriving window\u201d that restricts driving beyond the  14th consecutive hour after a driver comes on-duty.", "Increased the daily driving limit (from 10 to 11 hours).", "Increased the off-duty period (from 8 to 10 hours).", "Collectively these provisions allow drivers to operate a commercial motor  vehicle for 11 hours a day and be on-duty or work up to 14 hours per day,  but also require drivers not to work or drive for at least 10 hours per day.", "FMCSA retained the 60/70 hour on duty limit, but allowed drivers  transporting freight to \u201crestart,\u201d or begin at zero, their on-duty hours  following an off-duty period of 34 hours or longer. Drivers are not required  to take this 34-hour break, but may choose to do so to increase their  scheduling flexibility, among other reasons. The provision, according to  FMCSA, was adopted because it would provide drivers experiencing  sleep loss or significant sleep debt with an opportunity to recover and,  therefore, prevent a significant number of fatigue-related crashes.", "To understand the restart provision, consider the example depicted below  in which a driver does not have any on-duty hours for Saturday and  Sunday (48 hours). Prior to the restart provision, this driver would have  reported working 72 hours from Friday through Friday and would be out of  compliance with the HOS rule. Under the restart provision, the driver may  now reset his/her total accumulated hours to zero on Monday because  the driver was not driving or working over the weekend, a period greater  than 34 hours. Therefore, while the driver was not in compliance with the  60/70 hour on-duty limit under the prior rule, he/she would be in  compliance using the new restart provision, having accumulated only 60  hours for the 8 day period from Friday to Friday. (See figure 2).", "As previously discussed, in 2011 FMCSA made several significant  changes to the HOS rule, including the restart provision. Specifically, the  rule added the following provisions:", "Two-night provision: For the 34-hour off-duty period to count as a  restart, it must include two nighttime periods from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.", "168-hour limit: Drivers can only take a 34-hour restart every 168  hours (once per week).", "30-minute rest break: Drivers must take a 30-minute, off-duty break  during the first 8 hours of their work day in order to continue to drive.", "According to FMCSA, the 2011 changes were made for several reasons.  Specifically, the two-night requirement was intended to allow drivers more  nighttime rest, which is more restorative than daytime rest because it  better accords with the body\u2019s circadian rhythms. The 168-hour limit was  put into place to reduce fatigue by limiting the ability of drivers to work  close to the maximum number of on-duty hours permitted on a continuing  basis. For example, prior to the 2011 rule changes drivers who used a  restart could work more than 80 hours in an average week. By limiting  use of the restart to once every 168 hours, drivers could work no more  than 70 hours in an average week. Lastly, the rest break requirement was  designed to alleviate fatigue and fatigue-related performance  degradation.", "FMCSA asserted that, while the 2011 rule would result in some economic  costs, the changes would affect only a small percentage of drivers who  regularly work long hours and that the safety and health benefits would  outweigh any loss in productivity. Several organizations that represent  motor carriers, however, have stated that the rule negatively impacted a  larger portion of the trucking industry than was anticipated by FMCSA and  that the rule had several unintended consequences, such as forcing a  large amount of commercial vehicle traffic onto the roads during  congested periods of the day.", "In July 2012, FMCSA was required by federal law to conduct a study  examining the efficacy of the restart rule, which was to be completed by  March of 2013. The study was to include statistically valid analysis and  data on drivers in real world conditions affected by the maximum driving- time requirements. FMCSA was required to develop a methodology  consistent with prior research examining the two-night provision that was  conducted in a laboratory. Based on these requirements, FMCSA  completed a field study (i.e., looking at drivers in real world conditions)  that focused on the two-night provision, but did not examine the other two  new HOS provisions: the 168-hour limit and the 30-minute rest break. To  complete the field study, FMCSA contracted with Washington State  University and Pulsar Informatics\u2014a technology development and  research company.amounts of data from 106 commercial vehicle drivers during two duty  cycles that included two different restarts of at least 34 hours or longer.  Data collected included information on sleeping and activity patterns,  caffeine use, and three fatigue measures:   Researchers from these institutions collected large  the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), which was the primary outcome  measure of the study and measured a driver\u2019s ability to react to visual  stimuli, e.g., flashing lights, on a smart phone within a specific amount  of time;  the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) that includes a subjective self- assessment of how tired a driver was at a specific point in time; and  lane deviation, which measured lateral vehicle movements within a  driving lane.", "Researchers used these data to compare fatigue levels for drivers taking  a restart that included one-nighttime period versus drivers taking a restart  that included two-or-more nighttime periods. Based on this evidence, the  study concluded that a restart with two-nighttime breaks helps to mitigate  fatigue and provides support of the efficacy of the new restart rule. The  final report was submitted to FMCSA in September 2013 and issued  publicly in January 2014.", "In December 2014\u2014approximately 18 months after the HOS rule went  into effect\u2014congressional action resulted in the suspension of two  provisions: the 168-hour limit and the two-night provision. These  provisions are suspended until September 30, 2015, or FMCSA  completes a new, naturalistic study\u2014currently underway\u2014examining the  operational, safety, health, and fatigue impacts of the restart provisions in  the HOS rule, whichever comes later. While similar in many respects to  the prior field study, the new study is required to include more robust data  and examine several issues not discussed as part of the prior field study.  For example, both studies collected or will collect PVT data to assess  driver fatigue. However, the new study will collect data over a significantly  longer time period (approximately two weeks of data for each driver for  the prior field study versus 5 months of data for the new study) and will  examine crash and driver health data that were not considered as part of  the field study.

The field study partially met the  standards of using a methodology that supports the study\u2019s objectives  and reporting conclusions that are linked to the results. The field study did  not meet the standard of reporting methodological limitations and their  impacts.", "The primary fatigue measure used in the field study is valid and reliable  and supported by two secondary measures: According to our literature  review and interviews with fatigue experts, the primary fatigue measure  used in the field study\u2014the PVT\u2014is a reliable and valid measure of  fatigue and is widely used in fatigue science research.

Specifically, FMCSA officials stated, and we agree, that using multiple  measures with different strengths and weaknesses can help to reinforce  findings. In the case of the field study, each of these three measures  independently supported the finding that drivers taking a one-night restart  were more fatigued than those taking a two-or-more night restart.", "The field study included controls to identify data inconsistencies and  errors: Specifically, the field study involved a visual data check that  compared data for each driver across nine variables, including activity\u2014 as recorded by a wrist monitor, test results on the PVT and KSS, and  GPS location. Researchers used this data check to identify any obvious  errors and possible contradictions in the data, such as instances when  the data might indicate a driver was coded as driving and sleeping  simultaneously. Researchers also debriefed the study participants at the  end of the study to discuss inconsistencies, mistakes, or missed entries  as well as any outliers on the fatigue measures. This approach allowed  researchers to account for incomplete or obviously biased data. Based on  our review of the data and statistical coding, we believe that these quality  controls were sufficient to ensure the data used in the field study are  reliable.", "The results and analysis reported in the study are supported by the data:  To assess whether the results and analysis were supported by the data,  we replicated several aspects of the study. First, we acquired the raw  data and the computer programs used in the field study to process the  data and run statistical analyses. As a check on the reliability of the  computer programs, we applied the programs to the data for one driver  and verified that the results were consistent with numbers reported in the  field study. Because the same computer program was applied to all  drivers by the authors of the field study, this check provided assurance  that the analysis for all drivers was reliable. Second, using data files  provided by the authors, we replicated demographic information reported  in the study, including average age, years of experience, and sex of the  driver, among others. Similarly, using data files provided by the authors,  we replicated the main study results. For example, our replication showed  that the study accurately reported the number of reaction time errors or  \u201clapses\u201d on a PVT test for drivers following a one-night restart and a two- or-more night restart.", "The methodology used in the field study partially supports the study\u2019s  objectives: The field study examined drivers in a naturalistic environment,  driving their normal routes, and collected fatigue related data in a way  that was consistent with the study\u2019s objectives. The study collected data  on sleep patterns, fatigue, and driving behavior using wrist monitors,  smartphones, and sensors attached to truck equipment. These methods  did not require drivers to interact repeatedly with researchers or change  their driving behaviors in response to study requirements, which  otherwise might have biased measurements or prevented the results from  applying to real world conditions. In addition, we determined the statistical  method used to evaluate the study\u2019s findings\u2014mixed-effects regression  modeling\u2014was appropriate. Mixed effects modeling is an accepted  method of analyzing longitudinal data, which, in this study, involved the  same drivers taking the PVT at various times of day over several weeks.  In addition, the models reasonably allowed for the possibility that the  rule\u2019s effects could vary according to the time of day and period of  observation.", "However, we did find one area in which the methodology used did not  support the study\u2019s objectives. Specifically, the purpose of the study was  to examine the efficacy of the 2011 HOS rule, which required drivers  choosing to take a restart include two-nighttime periods (from 1 a.m. to 5  a.m.). This rule was expected to reduce fatigue for drivers that previously  took restarts with one-nighttime period as part of their restart. Therefore,  the study should have been designed to compare the ability of drivers to  perform fatigue tests, e.g., the PVT, after a one-night or a two-night  restart. However, the field study actually compared drivers with one-night  restart breaks to those with two or more nights of rest. One concern with  including drivers taking more than two nights rest is the possibility of  biasing the results. For example, drivers with more rest could be less  fatigued and have fewer lapses on a PVT test. Thus, including such  drivers does not directly support the objective of the study to determine  the impact of the changes to the restart provision from a one-night to a  two-night restart. According to FMCSA officials, the decision to include  drivers taking more-than-two night restarts was a judgment call made by  researchers, and was likely due to the timeframe mandated by law for  completing the study.", "Following the study\u2019s issuance FMCSA officials stated that they  conducted additional analysis and determined that the inclusion of drivers  with a two-or-more night restart did not influence the results. We  conducted a similar analysis and also found that the inclusion of drivers  with two-or-more night restarts did not bias the results.

As discussed above, our review of relevant research and discussions  with fatigue experts shows that the primary measure used in the field  study\u2014the PVT\u2014is a reliable and valid measure of fatigue and is  supported by the KSS and lane deviation, which are widely used in  fatigue science.

As we discuss later in this report, while there is evidence that fatigue and  crashes are generally related, we found little research that attempted to  quantify this relationship using any of the fatigue measures in the field  study. In particular, through our review of literature and conversations  with fatigue experts, it was uncertain the extent to which, if any, a  difference of 0.3 or 0.8 lapses on the PVT might be related to on-road  safety outcomes.directly link results to crash risk due to challenges associated with   According to FMCSA officials, its study does not  performing such a study. Instead, FMCSA used lane deviation as a proxy  measure for crashes and driving performance. In addition, FMCSA  officials stated that, since fatigue is connected to crash risk, increases in  fatigue, such as those shown in the field study, are associated with crash  risk. While we agree that evidence generally supports that fatigue and  crash risk are related, we are uncertain how fatigue differences of the size  reported in the field study would be associated with crash risk. Thus, the  safety implications and policy importance of the study\u2019s estimated effects  on fatigue may be overstated.", "The field study did not report all of its methodological limitations, including  how these limitations might have affected the results: As with any  research effort, FMCSA made methodological choices to achieve the  goals of the study under the requirements outlined in MAP-21. For  example, according to FMCSA, many of the decisions on recruiting  drivers to participate were dictated by the short time frame under which  FMCSA was required to complete the study\u2014approximately 9 months\u2014 and the availability of resources. After considering several of these  methodological choices that we reviewed, such as the sample size used,  they appear to be reasonable given these constraints.

One of these motor carriers  was selected because of a prior relationship it had with FMCSA and  the other two carriers were chosen after being identified as relatively  safety conscious. A third-party data provider used logbook data from  these carriers to identify drivers that met several criteria\u2014including  working near the maximum allowable weekly hours\u2014which FMCSA  used to identify specific operating locations that were likely to employ  drivers meeting the study\u2019s requirements. By not including information  on the recruiting process in the field study, FMCSA\u2019s study prevents  readers from assessing potential bias in the collection of data and  invites skepticism of the recruitment process. For example, FMCSA  did not disclose that it recruited a substantial proportion of its sample  of drivers with a one-night restart from a single, large U.S. city,  according to one of the carriers selected to participate in the field  study. Because these drivers likely operate in a similar environment,  such a sample raises questions about whether these drivers\u2019  measured fatigue levels after one-night restarts might have been  related to other factors with that location. Such other factors might  include characteristics of the local traffic or trucking operations.  According to FMCSA officials, they recruited drivers in this manner  because they needed to complete the work in a relatively short time  frame\u2014approximately 9 months\u2014and had difficultly identifying drivers  likely to take a one-night restart. While this method of recruiting  drivers does not necessarily bias the study\u2019s results, it has the  potential to do so and should have been reported by FMCSA.", "The field study did not report the implications of its sample size. The  field study collected data on a sample of drivers that produced  statistically significant results. However, the sample size was not  sufficient to address questions that have been raised about how the  restart provision affects the diverse commercial-trucking industry.  Several stakeholders we spoke with said that the restart provision  likely has different effects across industry segments, including local,  regional, and over-the-road drivers. These stakeholders said that the  restart provision may more successfully reduce fatigue for over-the- road drivers who are away from home for weeks at a time than for  drivers who operate locally and sleep in their own beds every night.", "We analyzed the study\u2019s data to assess the implications of its sample  size.

As was discussed above, the field study compared drivers  with one- versus two-or-more night restart breaks. According to  accepted research standards, FMCSA should have reported why  drivers taking a more than two-night restart were included in the  study, even though the rule should have been designed to compare  ability of drivers to perform fatigue tests, e.g., the PVT, after a one- night or a two-night restart. Furthermore, FMCSA should have  reported the potential for this decision to bias the results and, in  particular, to exaggerate the difference in fatigue between the two  groups of drivers.", "According to FMCSA officials, researchers followed several standards  when developing and conducting the field study, including Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) guidelines on the use of independent  peer review panels and the DOT Scientific Integrity Policy.

The results from our analysis of schedule data from 16 for-hire carriers is  consistent with FMCSA\u2019s assumption that drivers working more than 65  hours per work week would be more likely to reduce their work hours. We  also found support for FMCSA\u2019s assumption that certain schedule  changes could reduce driver fatigue and while total crashes, and crashes  with injuries did not appear to change, crashes involving fatalities may  have declined after the rule went into effect. However, we were unable to  assess, due to a lack of data, FMCSA\u2019s assumptions on economic and  health effects. All of the data and analyses we used had limitations,  including the extent to which the data are representative of the motor  carrier industry and the extent to which we can attribute observed  differences to the rule change.

Our analysis also found that the percentage of  drivers working between 55 and 65 hours per 8-day work week  decreased from 33 percent to 29 percent. In contrast, the percent of  drivers working 35 to 55 hours per 8-day work week increased from 48  percent to 57 percent after the rule went into effect. (See figure 4).  However, the driver schedule data used in our analysis are not  representative of the entire motor carrier industry and do not include any  information on drivers who work in some segments of the trucking  industry, such as private motor carriers. Therefore, our findings cannot be  generalized to the motor carrier industry as a whole.", "In addition, our interviews with representatives from 20 motor carriers  suggest that a wide variety of motor carrier operations were potentially  affected by the HOS rule. Specifically, 13 motor carriers we spoke with,  including 10 for-hire carriers and three private carriers, stated they were  affected by the rule. These carriers described themselves as truckload  carriers, less-than-truckload carriers or a combination of both and  employed drivers working both more than and less than 65 hours per  week.

Specifically, as shown above in figure  4, these schedule data show that fewer drivers were working more than  55 hours per 8-day work week after the rule went into effect in July 2013.", "We also estimated that drivers, on average, worked approximately 1 to 2  fewer hours per work week after the rule went into effect. In addition, the  number of restarts drivers took per calendar week (168 hours) generally  declined after the rule went into effect, including for drivers working more  than 65 hours per 8-day work week (see fig. 5). We also found that  drivers took approximately 6 percent fewer restarts per week, on average,  after the rule went into effect.", "We also found evidence supporting a shift in traffic volume from night  time hours to other parts of the day following the effective date of the  HOS rule. These shifts cannot be directly attributed to the rule change  and the data we analyzed from the Federal Highway Administration were  limited to 14 states. Our analysis showed that commodity carrying, i.e.,  commercial, motor vehicle traffic volume increased by 2.6 percent  between November and December 2012 and November and December  2013. However, as figure 6 shows, this increase was not consistent  across the time of day. Specifically, commodity carrying motor vehicle  traffic mostly increased during daytime hours (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and  decreased during evening and nighttime hours (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.), relative  to the increase in overall commodity carrying vehicle traffic. The largest  differences from the growth in traffic volume occurred in the middle of the  night (11 p.m. to 4 a.m.), when volume declined or remained flat despite  an increase in commodity carrying vehicle traffic overall and in the mid- morning hours (7 a.m. to 10 a.m.) when volume grew faster than the  overall growth rate.", "Consistent with our data analysis, representatives from 13 of the 20 motor  carriers we interviewed reported a range of operational effects or changes  they attributed partially or entirely to the 2011 HOS rule. The other seven  motor carrier representatives did not report any operational effects due to  the rule. For example, motor carriers reported a decrease in driving hours  per driver (10 carriers), less frequent restart use (10 carriers), more  driving during periods of traffic congestion (8 carriers), hiring more drivers  (6 carriers), and an overall decrease in operational flexibility (10 carriers).  Several of these operational changes, such as a decrease in driving  hours per driver and subsequent hiring of more drivers to make up for  reduced driver productivity, could lead to more commercial vehicles on  the road.", "Economic Costs: We interviewed motor carriers and industry  stakeholders about the economic impacts of the 2011 HOS rule but did  not find a data source that would allow us to reliably analyze these  impacts for the industry. Representatives of 11 out of the 20 motor  carriers we interviewed mentioned negative economic impacts due to the  2011 HOS rule. Ten motor carriers reported a productivity loss, six  reported a decrease in delivery timeliness, six reported less profitability,  and four reported an increase in driver turnover. The other nine motor  carriers we interviewed reported no negative economic effects. In  addition, four of the eight drivers we spoke with reported a decrease in  their income due to the 2011 HOS rule. These drivers reported that  reduced work time\u2014fewer or shorter work shifts\u2014was the reason for their  loss in income. The four drivers that reported no decrease in pay either  did not have a schedule change or were working more hours per week to  compensate for schedule changes due to the rule. Other industry  stakeholders we interviewed, including 12 out of 13 associations  representing segments of the motor carrier industry, shippers, and  warehouse operators, also reported negative economic impacts on their  respective industries due to the 2011 HOS rule, such as reduced  productivity.

Fatigue, as a result of  being awake for long periods of time or insufficient sleep, can have a  negative impact on driver performance and can lead to safety critical  events, including crashes. However, the literature is less clear on which  HOS interventions (e.g., rest breaks and limiting driving and on-duty time)  best minimize fatigue and reduce crash risk. For example, research has  found that crash risk is higher when drivers start their shifts or after taking  an extended break; but research also shows that drivers who do not take  breaks have a higher crash risk than drivers who do take breaks.", "Our analysis suggests that drivers\u2019 operating after the HOS rule went into  effect on July 1, 2013, could have a lower risk of fatigue.  To assess the  extent to which the 2011 HOS rule might affect driver fatigue, we  conducted two separate analyses using a biomathematical fatigue  model. First, we used the model to compare hypothetical driver  schedules that complied with two of the 2011 HOS rule provisions\u2014the  168-hour limit and the two-night provision\u2014to similar schedules that did  not comply with the rule but were in compliance with the previous HOS  rule.the rule went into effect would result in lower fatigue scores and,   We found that some schedule changes that would be required after  therefore, a lower risk of driver fatigue.schedules we modelled that had to change after July 1, 2013, in order to  comply with the rule were:", "Maximum Allowed-Hours Day and Night schedules: 14-hour shifts  over 5 consecutive days or nights. Drivers following a daytime  schedule of 14-hour shifts would have to modify their schedules to  comply with the 168-hour limit. Specifically, they could no longer take  a restart with less than 168 hours (7 days) between when they began  their last restart period and the beginning of the next restart period. To  comply with the 168-hour limit, drivers following this daytime schedule  must take 2 days off instead of one day off between work cycles. For  night drivers working 14-hour shifts, working 5 consecutive days with  one day off for a restart would not comply with either the 168-hour  limit or the two-night provision. These drivers must also take 2 days  off instead of one day off between work cycles. The longer restart  period (2 days versus one day) taken by these hypothetical day and  nighttime drivers working the maximum hours allowed each day  results in lower fatigue scores and, therefore, lower risk of driver  fatigue over the five day work cycle.", "Sixty- and 70-Hour Night Schedules: 10- to 12-hour shifts over six  consecutive nights. Drivers working through the night but working less  than the maximum allowed 14 hours each day would also have to  change their schedules after July 1, 2013. Specifically, these drivers  would have to take 2 days off between work cycles in order to comply  with the two-night provision. Again, the longer restart period (2 days  versus one day) results in the hypothetical driver having lower fatigue  scores and, therefore, a lower risk of fatigue over the 6-day work  cycle.", "Our second analysis using the biomathematical fatigue model estimated  possible fatigue effects of the 2011 HOS rule based on information  provided by motor carriers, industry stakeholders, and drivers we  interviewed. We found that some of the real world schedule changes  described by motor carriers resulted in a lower risk of driver fatigue, while  other schedule changes showed a higher risk of driver fatigue. For  example, a motor carrier told us that, to comply with the two-night  provision, several of its nighttime drivers switched from a 6-day schedule  to a 5-day schedule. Our analysis of this schedule change shows that  drivers under this schedule have a lower risk of fatigue after the rule went  into effect. In contrast, a different motor carrier told us that, to comply with  the 168-hour limit, several of its nighttime drivers switched from a 4-day  schedule with 3 days off to an alternating schedule of 5 days working and  2 days off and then 5 days working and 3 days off. Our analysis of this  schedule change shows that these drivers have a higher risk of fatigue on  certain days in their schedule after the rule went into effect. This may be  due to more work time and less off-duty time for drivers following the  schedule that complies with the 2011 HOS rule.", "We also collected data on crashes involving commercial trucks from 2008  to 2014. As shown in figure 7, the monthly incidence of truck crashes and  crashes involving fatalities varies considerably over time. To assess  whether the rule had any discernable effect on crashes, we conducted  two types of analyses. We examined (1) whether the rule affected the  number of monthly crashes and (2) whether the rule resulted in any shift  in the time of day in which crashes occurred.", "Trend in crashes over time: Many factors influence the number of crashes  over time. For example, as the economy grows, typically there will be  more trucks on the highways moving freight and this would be expected  to be correlated with a higher incidence of crashes, all other things being  equal. We used a statistical model to examine how the rule\u2019s  implementation may have affected the number of monthly crashes,  crashes with injuries, and fatal crashes, while controlling for other factors  that affect the incidence of crashes, such as a proxy for trucking volume  and seasonal variation. Our analysis showed a strong correlation  between our measure of trucking volume and crashes\u2014crashes occurred  with more frequency when the industry was moving more freight\u2014which  is consistent with other previous work.found a positive statistical association between the implementation of the  rule and the number of all crashes, suggesting that crashes rose\u2014holding  other factors constant\u2014after the rule when into effect. However, our  discussions with industry participants indicated that the winter of 2013 to  2014 was unusually harsh and made operations very difficult for the  industry. These weather conditions may have been a contributing factor,  irrespective of the rule change, to a short-term rise in crashes in  December 2013 through February 2014. When we used statistical  methods to control for these months in a second iteration of our analysis,  we no longer found a statistically significant increase in the number of  crashes after implementation of the rule. That is, the incidence of crashes  would appear to not have changed due to the rule in this scenario. Our  analysis of crashes with injuries and crashes with fatalities was similarly  structured\u2014we included variables to account for truck volume, seasonal  variation, and in a second iteration of the model, the unusual 3 months of  weather during the winter of 2013 to 2014. We found that the  implementation of the rule was not associated with any change in the  incidence of crashes with injuries, whether or not we statistically  controlled for the winter of 2013 to 2014. However, our analysis does  indicate that crashes involving fatalities may have become less frequent  after the implementation of the HOS rule.", "In addition, our initial analysis  Time of day shifts in crashes: Some stakeholders told us that the two- night provision of the HOS rule would potentially result in an increase in  crashes involving commercial trucks during morning rush hours (i.e., 5  a.m. to 9 a.m.). They believed that some truckers who might have  previously driven during the middle-of-the-night hours would be shifted to  the early and mid-morning timeframe due to provisions of the new HOS  rule. To test this possibility, we developed statistical models to examine  whether, conditional on the number of crashes that occurred, there was a  change in the likelihood of truck crashes occurring between 5 a.m. and 9  a.m. after the HOS rule went into effect. Our analysis found no statistically significant change in this likelihood associated with the  implementation of the rule.", "An important caveat to our statistical analyses of crash data is that there  are only 15 months of available data following the implementation of the  rule. These limited data, which have non-trivial variation month to month,  may not suffice to discern trends in the incidence of crashes. For  example, as we explained above, our post-rule time frame covers only  one winter\u2014a time when crashes tend to rise\u2014and we were told that this  was an unusually difficult winter for the industry. These data limitations  affect the ability to draw empirical inferences on the effects on crashes of  the rule\u2019s implementation.", "The 20 motor carriers we interviewed said they believed the rule had no  noticeable effect or a negative impact on safety. Of the eight drivers we  interviewed, one said the rule had no effect on safety, and seven said  they had seen a negative impact on safety. For example, drivers  mentioned that the time pressures they stated were associated with the  2011 HOS rule\u2014particularly the 30 minute rest break\u2014had resulted in  more speeding. Drivers said that speeding occurs as drivers try to make  deliveries or mileage goals before taking a 30-minute rest break. Safety  groups we interviewed generally supported the 2011 HOS rule and  thought it could improve safety for certain segments of the industry, but  had concerns about ensuring compliance with the rule.", "Health Benefits: Academic literature we reviewed indicates that  insufficient amounts of sleep have negative health impacts. These effects  include obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.  However, we did not find a data source that would allow us to assess  health impacts of the rule. According to FMCSA officials and other  stakeholders we spoke with, it could take years to identify health impacts  following an intervention, such as the HOS rule. In addition,  representatives from 16 of the 20 motor carriers we interviewed said they  believed the 2011 HOS rule had no noticeable health effects. The other  four motor carriers said they either noticed negative health effects\u2014 due  to increased stress or fatigue as drivers tried to make up for lost income,  among other reasons\u2014or had no way to measure health impacts. In  addition, of the eight drivers we interviewed, six said their health was  negatively impacted by the 2011 HOS rule, and two said there has been  no impact. Those reporting a negative health impact cited, for example,  being more stressed as they adjust to new schedules or try to make up  for lost income.

No organization,  including FMCSA, collects or maintains a centralized database with  representative driver schedule data that can be generalized to the entire  motor-carrier industry. For example, while we obtained and analyzed  drivers\u2019 schedule data from a private research organization that includes  over 15,000 usable driver records from 16 for-hire trucking companies,  findings from that dataset cannot be generalized to the estimated 539,000  active motor carriers and 5.6 million drivers who operate in the United  States. As a result it is not possible to determine the extent to which  different types of commercial motor carriers, such as private carriers or  drivers who own and operate their own vehicle, were affected by the rule  because they are not included in the dataset. Similarly, FMCSA does not  collect or use representative driver schedule data. Instead it uses  roadside inspection, compliance review, and safety audit data as well as  special studies to analyze motor carrier and drivers\u2019 safety behaviors.", "Collecting representative schedule data is well recognized as a valuable  analytical resource. Other DOT agencies that regulate the hours of  service for transportation operators have demonstrated the importance of  using representative schedule data. For example, the Federal Railroad  Administration has collected logbook data from a representative sample  of rail employees to examine fatigue and safety concerns since 2001. The  Federal Aviation Administration also has access to electronic flight data  on aircraft operations that is used to identify and analyze national trends,  target agency resources, and identify and reduce or eliminate safety risks.  In addition, FMCSA itself has cited the need to evaluate the actual  impacts of its regulations, including the 2011 HOS rule, in order to meet  executive requirements on regulatory review. We have also found that  sufficient and appropriate data are critical for rulemaking, decision  making, and assessing the effects of regulations and programs. As we  have previously found, using data is especially critical for FMCSA, which  has limited resources to oversee a large and diverse industry.", "Collecting these types of data has historically been difficult, but a recent  statutory change to how driver schedule data will be collected provides a  potential opportunity to do so. Many carriers use paper logbooks, a  practice that makes collecting and analyzing schedule data  administratively unmanageable. MAP-21 required FMCSA to develop a  rule that will require motor carriers to stop using paper logbooks and  instead, install electronic devices on individual vehicles to record and  store drivers\u2019 schedule data. This shift to electronic data will provide a  potential source of representative data that could more easily be  accessed and analyzed. However, FMCSA officials said that they do not  currently plan to collect and use such data for research purposes  because MAP-21 limits their use to the enforcement of laws.", "As we have shown, representative data on the motor carrier industry\u2014 specifically the number of drivers nationwide, the amount they drive, and  how they use the restart provision\u2014would provide critical information to  FMCSA about the operations of the industry it oversees. Access to this  type of data would also support data-driven rulemaking efforts and  regulations. According to FMCSA officials, access to driver schedule data  would enhance program evaluation, rulemaking, and the analysis of  existing rules, including the HOS rule. We recognize, however, that there  are concerns to collecting, storing, and analyzing these data, for example:", "Privacy: MAP-21 put protections in place to ensure driver privacy,  including provisions to limit the harassment of drivers, protect  personally identifiable information, and preserving the confidentiality  of any personal data. Additionally, as we have previously found,  collecting motor vehicle data raises concerns about sharing data with  third parties, tracking drivers\u2019 movements, and vehicles\u2019 speed and  location.", "Cost: FMCSA officials expressed concerns about the costs to the  agency and industry to collect, store, and analyze representative  schedule data. For example, FMCSA officials believe that obtaining,  standardizing, and depersonalizing data for millions of drivers would  pose substantial costs on the agency, motor carriers, and drivers.", "There may be ways of mitigating these privacy and cost concerns, but  FMCSA has not examined the costs and benefits of collecting electronic  driver-schedule data on a large-scale and currently does not plan to do  so. For example, to address privacy concerns, information can be \u201cde- identified\u201d for the purposes of analyzing data. Specifically, the Federal  Aviation Administration uses de-identified electronic flight data to identify  and reduce or eliminate safety risks. In addition, our analysis of the  effects of the HOS rule used schedule data from several thousand  drivers, which we analyzed without any personally identifiable driver or  motor carrier information. Cost concerns could potentially be addressed  by collecting a nationally representative sample of the data\u2014rather than  from the entire universe of drivers. Sampling is a commonly used social  science practice that allows researchers to apply conclusions drawn from  a subset of a population to the entire population. Although FMCSA  officials told us that they have no plans to examine the possibility of  collecting, storing, and analyzing electronic driver schedule data because  of the MAP-21 provision, they thought privacy concerns, for example,  could be addressed through stripping raw data of drivers\u2019 personally  identifiable information before being shared with the agency or others.  Until FMCSA evaluates the potential for collecting, storing, and analyzing  data; the potential benefits of using the data; and privacy and cost  concerns as well as the potential for FMCSA to mitigate them, the  agency\u2019s ability to use electronic schedule data in the future will remain  unknown."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The HOS rule has now been debated for over a decade with supporters  and critics arguing over the extent to which it improves safety and health  outcomes and negatively impacts the economy. FMCSA has attempted to  quantify these effects through research efforts, but many continue to  question the results. This is why it is critical for FMCSA to evaluate  potential effects of rules, such as the HOS rule that has a heightened  public profile, using established research standards and representative  schedule data. FMCSA\u2019s field study demonstrated that the agency did a  reasonable job in designing the study and analyzing data. However,  because the agency did not use guidance outlining specific standards for  conducting and reporting the results of scientific research, the field study  fell short in reporting several limitations and did not fully link the results to  its overall conclusions. These shortcomings leave the agency open to  criticism over the integrity of the study and invite skepticism about the  results.", "Similarly, by not having access to and analyzing representative driver  schedule data, FMCSA may continue to face challenges to the credibility  of its rules. The lack of representative schedule data required FMCSA to  make a number of assumptions about how the motor carrier industry  would be affected by the HOS rule. Due to current data limitations, it is  not possible to fully evaluate the rule\u2019s impact. For example, our analysis  suggests that the rule may have affected a larger population of drivers  than FMCSA anticipated, but without representative data there is no way  to be certain this is universally the case. Understanding the population of  drivers affected by the HOS rule is critical for determining the associated  economic costs and safety and health benefits. While electronically  collected, representative schedule data that will soon be available to  FMCSA would allow it to assess the impact of its rules, MAP-21 places  limitations on the use of this data for purposes other than enforcing laws.", "Further, collecting, storing, and analyzing the data would require  mitigating privacy and cost concerns. Given the potential value of such  data for evaluating the impact of future regulatory rules, Congress may  benefit from information on how the electronic data to be collected in  response to the MAP-21 requirements could be extracted, stored, and  analyzed and how privacy and cost concerns associated with the use of  these data could be addressed.

We  selected stakeholders and shipping organizations to interview based on  our prior work on commercial motor-carrier safety and recommendations  from these stakeholders. We used FMCSA\u2019s Motor Carrier Information  Management System to select active, U.S.-based motor carrier  companies subject to the hours of service rule.

We developed schedules with different work periods (day and night)  and different shift lengths (e.g. 14-hour shifts to simulate the  maximum allowed daily on-duty hours).We then created different  scenarios based on whether a schedule would need to change to  comply with the two restart provisions in the 2011 HOS rule. For  example, we used the FAID model to compare driver fatigue levels for  a driver working 14-hour night shifts 5 days a week with one-night off  (not in compliance with the two restart provisions in the 2011 HOS  rule) to a driver working the same 14-hour night shifts 5 days a week  with two-nights off (in compliance with the two restart provisions in the  2011 HOS rule).  2.  We analyzed real world schedules described to us by motor carrier  operators and drivers we interviewed regarding how they had  changed schedules due to the new rule.

For drivers working more  than 75 hours per 8-day work week, restart use per calendar week  appears to increase by almost 1. However, before the rule there were 69  drivers in this category and after the rule there were 15 drivers, therefore  the change observed in Table 20 is based on a relatively small number of  drivers. For drivers working 55 hours or less per 8-day work week, restart  use per calendar week appears to decrease after the 2011 HOS rule went  into effect.", "We analyzed the length of restart periods to understand how many off- duty hours drivers in our dataset took.

As a  percentage of all restarts taken in each season, restarts with lengths of 34  to 37 hours decreased after the rule went into effect. The percentage of  restarts with a length between 45 to 72.99 hours increased after the rule  went into effect. As our dataset did not contain the start and end times of  a driver\u2019s schedule or restarts, we are not able to analyze the extent to  which there was a change in restarts with one- or two-night periods. For  example, a driver working during daytime hours could take a 34 hour off- duty period that contains two nighttime periods (1 a.m. to 5 a.m.). In  contrast, a driver working during nighttime hours may not have two  nighttime periods (1 a.m. to 5 a.m.) when taking a 34-hour off-duty period.  Therefore, we cannot determine the change in actual nights taken off-duty  by looking at the length of a restart period on its own.", "Analysis of Data before and after the HOS Rule  We also analyzed the data by dividing driver records into two periods: (1)  before the rule went into effect\u2014January 1, 2012, to June 15, 2013\u2014and  (2) after the rule went into effect\u2014July 15, 2013, to December 15, 2014.  As with the analysis by seasonal datasets, we applied filters to each year  of data. To avoid double-counting drivers who appear across multiple  years of data, we used the driver identification number to connect driver  records with data in multiple years. The weekly on-duty hour average is  calculated using the weeks that we have data for a driver. If a driver is  only present in the 2012 data set, then that driver\u2019s average weekly on- duty hours are calculated based on only 2012 data. If a driver is present  in both the 2012 and 2013 datasets, then that driver\u2019s average weekly on- duty hours are calculated using 2012 and 2013 (up to June 15, 2013) on- duty hours.

While this analysis shows similar  trends in the data, there are differences in the number and percentage of  drivers in each weekly on-duty hour group. Specifically, in the seasonal  analysis, before the rule went into effect (winter 2012 through spring  2013) the percentage of drivers in our dataset working more than 65  hours per 8-day work week ranges from about 9 to close to 12 percent.  As shown in table 23, approximately 8 percent of drivers in our dataset  before the rule went into effect are categorized as working more than 65  hours per 8-day work week on average. This difference is likely due to the  time frame over which the average weekly on-duty hours are calculated.", "We also compared the number and percent of weeks before and after the  rule went into effect categorized by total weekly on-duty hours (see table  24). Consistent with the seasonal analysis, the percent of 8-day work  weeks with total on-duty hours of more than 65 also decreased.", "We also analyzed the length of restarts used by drivers\u2019 average weekly  on-duty time. We found that before the rule went into effect the  percentage of 34- to 36.99-hour restarts taken by drivers in our dataset in  each on-duty time category ranges from about 6 to 11-percent (see table  25). After the HOS rule went into effect, the relative distribution of restarts  by length taken in each weekly on-duty category changed. Specifically,  the percentage of restarts lasting 34- to 36.99- hours decreased for all  driver categories.

To assess whether the  implementation of the 2011 HOS rule had an effect on crashes we  developed two ordinary least squares regression models that controlled  for trucking volume and seasonal variation, and in one case also  controlled for the unusual winter weather in December 2013 to February  2014.

The trucking gross output variable had a significant and  positive relationship with the monthly numbers of all three groups of  crashes (all crashes, injury crashes, and fatal crashes), and seasonal  differences, as measured by quarter, were generally significant for total  crashes and fatal crashes, but not for crashes with injuries. In model 1,  the apparent effect of the rule change on crashes was significant and  positive for total crashes, insignificant for crashes with injuries, and  significant and negative for fatal crashes. However, our discussions with  industry participants indicated that the winter from December 2013  through February 2014 was unusually harsh and made operations very  difficult for the industry.

Adding this dummy variable had no effect on our estimate of the  effect of the rule change on crashes with injuries, which remained  insignificant, or in fatal injuries, which remained significant and negative.

Using individual crash data from MCMIS, we also investigated whether,  among all crashes, there was any effect of the rule change on the  likelihood of crashes occurring between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. versus any  other time of the day.

While somewhat different and less  traditional than percentages, the odds have a fairly direct and simple  interpretation\u2014in this case they imply that in both periods there were  roughly 25 crashes in that interval for every 100 that occurred at all other  times of the day. The odds of crashes occurring between 5 a.m. and 9  a.m. are very similar for crashes with injuries and fatal crashes. The odds  ratios in the final column are calculated by taking the odds of crashes  occurring in the designated time frame after the rule change and dividing  by the odds of crashes at that time before the rule change. For total  crashes, for example, the odds ratio is calculated as follows: (.2490 \u00f7  0.2488) = 1.001. This ratio is only slightly different than 1, indicating that  the likelihood of crashes occurring between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. was nearly  identical before and after the rule. The odds ratios for crashes with  injuries and fatal crashes produce similar conclusions.", "One advantage of odds ratios is that unlike percentage differences, they  can be adjusted using multivariate models (logistic regression models) so  that they reflect the net effect of the rule change, after adjusting for other  characteristics that might have differed, in this case, before and after the  rule change. Table 29 shows that results of fitting bivariate (or  unadjusted) logistic regression models (in the first row), and the  multivariate regression models (in the remaining rows) to estimate the  effect of the rule change on the likelihood of crashes occurring between 5  a.m. and 9 a.m. for total crashes, crashes with injuries, and fatal crashes.  The bivariate, or unadjusted models, reproduce the same odds ratios we  derived from the observed data in the two-way tables in table 28. We then  fit multivariate models that regressed those same odds on the rule period  variable while simultaneously controlling for a number of potentially  confounding factors, including road, weather, and lighting conditions,  trucking gross volume, and whether the crash occurred during a weekday  or on the weekend. The coefficients for the multivariate model shown in  table 29 are exponentiated odds ratios, which indicate the size and  significance of the differences in the odds on crashes occurring between  5 a.m. and 9 a.m. as opposed to some other time of the day, both as a  result of the rule change and as a result of the factors included in the  model. The multivariate models reveal that a number of the control  variables affected the likelihood of crashes occurring from 5 a.m. to 9  a.m., including different road, weather, and light conditions. Crashes were  more likely to occur between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m., for example, when roads  were icy rather than dry (by factors ranging from 2.2 for total crashes to  3.6 for fatal crashes), when conditions were foggy rather than clear (by  factors ranging from 4.4 for total crashes to 5.0 for crashes with injuries  and fatal crashes), and during dawn rather than daylight hours (by factors  exceeding 40 in all cases). However, even with these factors controlled,  the rule change appeared to have no significant effect on the likelihood of  total crashes occurring between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. Odds ratios in the  multivariate models estimating the differences in the likelihood of crashes  occurring before and after the rule change were very nearly 1.0, and  ranged from 0.999 for total crashes to 1.025 for fatal crashes.", "As previously discussed, there are many potential factors that could  influence the number of crashes in any given month, including weather  and road conditions at the time of a crash. Our analyses take into account  some of these factors by controlling or adjusting for seasonal differences  and freight volume, but there are undoubtedly other potentially  confounding factors, and we would have liked to have had a more direct  measure of the numbers of motor carriers on the road in each month and  at risk of crashing. Moreover, our dataset only included 15 data points, or  months, since the rule went into effect, and neither the significant or  insignificant changes we find in this short term are guaranteed in the  longer term. Without additional data over a longer period of time, we are  unable to robustly determine whether the HOS rule had an impact on  crashes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, H.
