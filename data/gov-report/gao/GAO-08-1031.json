For 2008, GAO estimates that Iraq could generate between $73.5 billion and $86.2 billion in total revenues, with oil exports accounting for between $66.5 billion to $79.2 billion. Projected 2008 oil revenues could be more than twice the average annual amount Iraq generated from 2005 through 2007. These projections are based on actual sales through June 2008 and projections for July to December that assume an average export price from $96.88 to $125.29 per barrel and oil export volumes of 1.89 to 2.01 million barrels per day. From 2005 through 2007, the Iraqi government spent an estimated $67 billion on operating and investment activities. Ninety percent was spent on operating expenses, such as salaries and goods and services, and the remaining 10 percent on investments, such as structures and vehicles. The Iraqi government spent only 1 percent of total expenditures to maintain Iraq- and U.S.-funded investments such as buildings, water and electricity installations, and weapons. While total expenditures grew from 2005 through 2007, Iraq was unable to spend all its budgeted funds. In 2007, Iraq spent 80 percent of its $29 billion operating budget and 28 percent of its $12 billion investment budget. For 2008, GAO estimates that Iraq could spend between $35.3 billion and $35.9 billion of its $49.9 billion budget. As of December 31, 2007, the Iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of $29.4 billion, held in the Development Fund for Iraq and central government deposits at the Central Bank of Iraq and Iraq's commercial banks. This balance is the result, in part, of an estimated cumulative budget surplus of about $29 billion from 2005 to 2007. For 2008, GAO estimates a budget surplus of between $38.2 billion to $50.3 billion. If spent, a proposed Iraqi budget supplemental of $22 billion could reduce this projected surplus. Since fiscal year 2003, the United States appropriated about $48 billion for stabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq; it had obligated about $42 billion of that amount as of June 2008. U.S. agencies spent about $23.2 billion on the critical security, oil, electricity, and water sectors. From 2005 through April 2008, Iraq spent about $3.9 billion on these sectors. U.S. government, coalition, and international officials have identified a number of factors that have affected the Iraqi government's ability to spend more of its revenues on capital investments. These factors included the shortage of trained staff; weak procurement and budgeting systems; and violence and sectarian strife. The United States has funded activities to help build the capacity of key civilian and security ministries to improve Iraq's ability to execute its capital project budget."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Iraq\u2019s large oil reserves coupled with surging oil prices offer the  government of Iraq the potential to contribute to the country\u2019s  reconstruction efforts and thereby enhance essential services to the Iraqi  people.

We also projected total revenues for 2008 by  forecasting export oil revenues and added those to IMF\u2019s forecast of net  revenues from oil-related public enterprises and taxes and other revenues.  We developed six alternative scenarios for export oil revenues. See  appendix III for the underlying assumptions about prices and export  volumes for each scenario.", "To provide detailed information on the Iraqi government\u2019s estimated  expenditures, we reviewed Iraqi official Ministry of Finance monthly and  annual budget and expenditure data for fiscal years 2005 through 2008,  which were provided by Treasury. We used Iraq dinar-dollar exchange  rates to convert dinar budget and expenditure figures to dollars. To  provide a preliminary view of spending trends for the 3-year period 2005- 2007, we calculated annual average growth rates using an ordinary least  squares regression technique. Although we computed these growth rates  for both dollar and dinar denominated spending, we believe that growth  rates in dinars are more informative because actual expenditures are made  in dinars. Using dollar-denominated expenditures inflates the growth rates  due to the 19-percent appreciation of the dinar against the dollar during  this period.", "We did not use special reports developed by the Ministry of Finance  because they include Iraqi commitments to spend as well as actual  expenditures.  We did not use the special reports for our analyses for two  reasons: (1) Treasury Department officials stated in our meeting with them  that the special reports contain unreliable data, and (2) the special reports  do not define commitments, measure them, or describe how or when these  commitments would result in actual expenditures.  In addition, our review  of these special reports show inconsistent use of poorly defined budget  terms, as well as columns and rows that do not add up.", "Beginning in 2007, the government of Iraq adopted a new budget  classification to comply with an IMF requirement. To compare the same  expenditure categories over time, we re-grouped some sub-categories, as  explained in appendix IV. Detailed breakdowns of the goods and services  category are not available for individual ministries beginning in 2007. For  the three sub-categories goods, services, and maintenance, the percentage  shares were calculated for the years 2005 and 2006. Although we included  the latest available 2008 expenditure figures in our tables, we did not use  2008 to calculate growth rates or shares of total expenditures for the 2005  through 2007 period.", "To provide some insight into how well the Iraqi government was able to  implement its intentions and priorities, we constructed an expenditure  ratio: actual expenditures divided by the budgeted amount for that activity  or ministry. This does not capture the quality or effectiveness of  expenditures, but only whether the government was able to spend the  money it had budgeted. Treasury officials informed us that their analysis  indicated that official Ministry of Finance data were sufficiently reliable. In  addition to our interviews of cognizant officials, we examined and  reviewed ministry data and compared monthly and annual data for  internal consistency. Although we did not independently verify the  precision of Iraqi expenditure data for 2005 through 2008, we believe that  they are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. However, we  found that the data for 2004 were not sufficiently reliable and did not use  them in our report.", "To identify Iraqi financial deposits as of the end of 2007, we reviewed IMF  documents and interviewed IMF and Treasury officials. The data for the  DFI balances are based on a July 2008 audited statement by the  International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB). The data on central  government deposits at the CBI and Iraq\u2019s commercial banks come from  the International Financial Statistics, as of July 2008. We determined that  these reported data were sufficiently reliable for our analysis. To estimate  Iraqi government\u2019s cumulative budget surplus from 2005 to 2007 and  projected surplus for 2008, we subtracted estimated total expenditures  from estimated total revenues. The data source for Iraqi spending is Iraq\u2019s  Ministry of Finance. The projected expenditures for 2008 are based on the  assumption that the 2005 through 2007 average budget execution rate of 68  percent will remain the same in 2008.  We selected this approach because  it provided the highest estimate of 2008 expenditures based on recent  historic data and trends for 2005 through 2007 and the approved 2008  budget. We varied total expenditures since the amount of war reparations  varied.  These reparation payments are calculated at 5 percent of the  estimated oil export revenues projected in our six scenarios.", "In addressing the amount of U.S. funds that have been appropriated,  obligated, and disbursed, we collected funding information from the  Departments of Defense and State and relied on prior GAO reporting and  data from the Departments of Defense, State, the Treasury, U.S. Agency  for International Development, and the Coalition Provisional Authority to  update the information where necessary. Although we have not audited  the funding data, we discussed the sources and limitations of the data with  the appropriate officials and checked them, when possible, with other  information sources. We found the data were sufficiently reliable for broad  comparisons in the aggregate and the category descriptions we have made  in this report.", "To update information on factors affecting the Iraqi government\u2019s ability to  spend its revenues, we reviewed DOD, State, and IMF reports and met  with officials from State, Treasury, DOD, and IMF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Estimates of Iraqi Crude Oil Export Revenues from 2005 through 2007", "paragraphs": ["We are providing estimates of Iraq\u2019s crude oil export revenues from three  sources to show how they compare with actual oil export receipt data  reported by the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI).

For the base case, we set prices equal to the June 2008 level. This implies  no growth in prices for the rest of the year. For the optimistic case, we  determined prices by applying a 12.9 percent discount from the average  monthly prices of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a key benchmark  for world crude oil prices forecast by EIA. This implies 1.12 percent  growth in Iraqi crude oil export prices from June to December 2008.  Finally, for the pessimistic case, we set prices equal to the January through  June 2008 average value.
