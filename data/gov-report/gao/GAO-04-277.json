The easiest and most direct way to help protect communities under an IFQ program is to allow the communities themselves to hold quota. Fishery managers can also help communities by adopting rules aimed at protecting certain groups of fishery participants. Methods for facilitating new entry principally fall into three categories: (1) adopting transfer rules on selling or leasing quota that help make quota more available and affordable to new entrants; (2) setting aside quota for new entrants; and (3) providing economic assistance, such as loans and subsidies, to new entrants. In considering methods to protect communities and facilitate new entry into IFQ fisheries, fishery managers face issues of efficiency and fairness, as well as design and implementation. Community protection and new entry methods are designed to achieve social objectives, but realizing these objectives may undermine economic efficiency and raise questions of equity. For example, allowing communities to hold quota may result in a loss of economic efficiency because communities may not have the knowledge and skills to manage the quota effectively. Similarly, rules to protect communities or facilitate new entry may appear to favor one group of fishermen over another. Furthermore, community protection and new entry methods raise a number of design and implementation challenges. For example, according to fishery experts, defining a community can be challenging because communities can be defined in geographic and nongeographic ways. Similarly, loans or grants may help provide new entrants with the capital needed to purchase quota, but they may also contribute to further quota price increases. Given the various issues that fishery managers face in developing community protection and new entry methods, it is unlikely that any single method can protect every type of fishing community or facilitate new entry into every IFQ fishery. Deciding which method(s) to use is made more challenging because fishery managers have not conducted comprehensive evaluations of how IFQ programs protect communities or facilitate new entry. In comparing the key features of IFQ programs and U.S. fishery cooperatives, we found that each approach has advantages and disadvantages in terms of regulatory and management framework, number of participants, quota allocation and transfer, and monitoring and enforcement. Specifically, in terms of regulatory and management framework, IFQ programs have greater stability than cooperatives because they are established by federal regulations, while cooperatives are voluntary contractual arrangements. In terms of quota allocation and transfer, IFQ programs are open in that they allow the transfer of quota to new entrants, whereas cooperatives are exclusive by contractual arrangement among members. In terms of monitoring and enforcement, IFQ programs are viewed as being more difficult to administer, because NMFS must monitor individual participants, while cooperatives are viewed to be simpler for NMFS to administer, because NMFS monitors only one entity--the cooperative. For some fisheries, a combined approach may be beneficial. For example, a cooperative of IFQ quota holders can combine an IFQ program's stability with a cooperative's collaboration to help manage the fishery."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Commercial fishing and fishing-related businesses contributed about   $28 billion to the U.S. gross national product in 2002. However, these  businesses are at risk of decline because about one-third of the U.S. fish  stocks assessed by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are  overfished or approaching overfished conditions. The United States is not  alone in facing this problem. According to the United Nation\u2019s Food and  Agriculture Organization, about 28 percent of the world\u2019s major fish stocks  are reported as overexploited, depleted, or recovering from depletion.  Another 47 percent are fully exploited and are producing catches that have  reached, or are very close to, their maximum sustainable limits. Greater  competition for fewer fish increases the likelihood that stocks will decline  further and catches will decrease. If a fishery\u2014composed of one or more  fish stocks in a geographic area\u2014cannot be sustained, the marine  ecosystem could be transformed, thus threatening the livelihood of  fishermen and the way of life in many communities.", "Concerns about the condition of the world\u2019s fisheries have led to a search  for new management tools to maintain fisheries at sustainable levels. One  such tool is the individual fishing quota (IFQ), which has been used  worldwide since the late 1970s. Today, several nations, including the  United States, use IFQ programs to manage fisheries within their 200-mile  exclusive economic zone, where foreign vessels are generally prohibited  from fishing. Usually, these programs are established by law. The primary  goals of an IFQ program are to conserve the resource and reduce fishing  capacity (e.g., the number and size of boats). Under an IFQ program,  fishery managers set a total allowable catch (TAC) and allocate quota\u2014the  right or privilege to fish a certain portion of the TAC\u2014to eligible vessels,  fishermen, or other recipients. IFQ programs often allow a quota holder to  transfer quota by sale, lease, or other methods. Such transfers are  expected to reduce the number of fishermen and vessels and consolidate  the quota among the more efficient fishermen. In the United States, the  Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson- Stevens Act) established eight regional fishery councils to manage the  nation\u2019s fisheries. These councils develop IFQ programs that are  administered by NMFS.", "IFQ programs have achieved several desired conservation and  management benefits, such as helping to stabilize fisheries and reducing  excess investment in fishing capacity. However, these programs have also  raised concerns about the fairness of initial quota allocations, the  increased costs for fishermen to gain entry, and the loss of employment  and revenues in communities that have historically depended on fishing.  Responding to these concerns, Congress, through the Sustainable  Fisheries Act, placed a moratorium on new IFQ programs in 1996.  Congress later extended the moratorium through September 30, 2002, and  then allowed it to expire. Fishery councils are now free to propose new  IFQ programs. During the moratorium, fishery cooperatives emerged as  alternatives to IFQ management in two fisheries\u2014Pacific whiting in 1997  and Bering Sea pollock in 1998. These cooperatives are voluntary  contractual agreements among fishermen to apportion shares of the catch  among themselves. The Department of Justice, in business review letters  concerning its antitrust enforcement intentions with respect to the  cooperatives, stated that Justice did not anticipate bringing any antitrust  enforcement actions against the cooperatives.", "This report is the second in a series of reports you requested on individual  fishing quotas. In December 2002, we reported on the extent of  consolidation of quota holdings, the extent of foreign holdings of quota,  and the economic effect of IFQ programs on seafood processors. For this  report you asked us to determine (1) the methods available for protecting  the economic viability of fishing communities and facilitating new entry  into IFQ fisheries, (2) the key issues faced by fishery managers in  protecting communities and facilitating new entry, and (3) the  comparative advantages and disadvantages of the IFQ system and the  fishery cooperative approach.", "To conduct this review, we visited domestic fishing communities in Alaska  and Maine, as well as communities in Iceland, New Zealand, and Scotland.  We visited these foreign countries because Iceland and New Zealand have  extensive experience with IFQ programs, and Scotland has developed an  innovative approach for protecting communities and facilitating new  entry. In these locations and elsewhere, we spoke with domestic and  foreign fishery managers, fishery participants, and fishery researchers;  reviewed literature on domestic and foreign quota-based programs; and  reviewed key regulations and studies. We did not evaluate the  effectiveness of the programs in the locations we visited. See appendix I  for additional details on our scope and methodology and appendix II for  descriptions of the programs we reviewed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Magnuson-Stevens Act provides for the conservation and management  of fishery resources in the United States. The act established eight  regional fishery management councils that are responsible for preparing  plans for managing fisheries in federal waters and submitting them to the  Secretary of Commerce for approval. NMFS, within the Department of  Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is  responsible for implementing these plans. The eight councils are New  England, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, Pacific,  North Pacific, and Western Pacific.", "The Magnuson-Stevens Act, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act,  also establishes national standards for fishery conservation and  management. The fishery councils use these standards to develop  appropriate plans for conserving and managing fisheries under their  jurisdiction. For example:    National Standard 1 requires that conservation and management measures  prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum  yield from each fishery;   National Standard 4 requires that conservation and management measures  not discriminate between residents of different states;   National Standard 5 requires that conservation and management  measures, where practicable, consider efficiency in the use of fishery  resources; and   National Standard 8 requires that fishery conservation and management  measures take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing  communities in order to provide for the sustained participation of these  communities in the fishery and, to the extent practicable, minimize  adverse economic impacts on these communities.", "In addition to the national standards, the Magnuson-Stevens Act also  requires that new IFQ programs consider providing opportunities for new  individuals to enter IFQ fisheries.", "The Magnuson-Stevens Act defines a fishing community as one that is  substantially dependent on, or engaged in, harvesting or processing fishery  resources to meet social and economic needs. The definition includes  fishing vessel owners, operators, and crew, and U.S. fish processors based  in such a community. NMFS guidance further defines fishing community  to mean a social or economic group whose members reside in a specific  location.", "At the time of our review, NMFS had implemented three IFQ programs: (1)  the Mid-Atlantic surfclam/ocean quahog program in 1990, (2) the South  Atlantic wreckfish program in 1992, and (3) the Alaskan halibut and  sablefish (black cod) program in 1995. New IFQ programs were being  considered in other commercial fisheries, such as the Bering Sea crab; the  Gulf of Alaska groundfish (e.g., pollock, cod, and sole); and the Gulf of  Mexico red snapper.", "Under IFQ programs, fishery managers set a maximum, or total allowable  catch, in a particular fishery\u2014typically for a year\u2014based on stock  assessments and other indicators of biological productivity, and they  allocate quota\u2014generally expressed as a percentage of the TAC\u2014to  eligible vessels, fishermen, or other recipients, based on initial qualifying  criteria, such as catch history. In the United States, fishery councils can  raise or lower the TAC annually to reflect changes in the fishery\u2019s health.  Fishery managers distribute these changes among the quota holders  proportional to their share. For example, a fisherman who received a 5  percent quota share in a fishery with a TAC of 100 metric tons can catch 5  tons of fish. Should the TAC increase from 100 to 200 metric tons in the  following year, the quota holder with a 5 percent share would be able to  catch 10 tons, or 5 tons more than the previous year. Furthermore, IFQs  are generally transferable, meaning that quota holders can buy, sell, lease,  or otherwise transfer some or all of their shares, depending on how much  or how little they want to participate in the fishery. The nature of the  fishing right varies by country. In New Zealand, for example, an IFQ is an  exclusive property right that can be held in perpetuity, whereas in the  United States, an IFQ represents the privilege to fish a public resource.  While this privilege has an indefinite duration, the government may legally  revoke it at any time.", "IFQ programs arose in response to conditions that resulted in a race for  fish and overfishing and that reduced economic efficiency, safety, and  product quality. For example, before the IFQ program, the Alaskan halibut  fishery had limits on the amount of time allowed for commercial fishing in  an attempt to keep the annual halibut catch within the TAC, but it did not  have limits on the number of boats that could fish. In response, fishermen  increased the number of vessels in their fleets and used larger vessels with  more gear to catch as much fish as they could in the time allowed. As a  result, the halibut season was reduced to a few days. After the IFQ  program was implemented, the fishing season was increased to 8 months.  Fishermen could choose when to fish and they could use more economical  fishing methods, as long as they kept within their quota limits.", "Individual IFQ programs may differ considerably, depending on the  circumstances of the fishery and the objectives of the program. For  example, an IFQ program for a fishery where there are concerns about  overfishing and the consolidation of power among corporate interests may  have different objectives than a program for a fishery where there are  concerns about developing the fishery and attracting new fishermen.  Depending on the fishery, fishery managers may be willing to trade some  potential gains in economic efficiency in exchange for the opportunity to  protect fishing communities or facilitate new entry.", "IFQ programs are largely intended to improve economic efficiency and  conserve the resource. According to the theory underlying IFQ programs,  unrestricted quota trading promotes economic efficiency, because those  willing to pay the highest price for quota would be those expected to use  quota the most profitably, by catching fish at a lower cost or transforming  the fish into a more valuable product. Over time, unrestricted trading  should lead less efficient fishermen to either improve their efficiency or  sell their quota. In contrast, restrictions on quota transfers could be  expected to reduce the economic benefits that would otherwise be  obtained where quota is freely transferable. Another fundamental tenet of  this theory is that quota holders will act in ways to promote the  stewardship of the resource. Specifically, giving fishermen a long-term  interest in the resource is likely to provide incentives to fish in ways that  protect the value of their interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methods Exist for Protecting Fishing Communities and Facilitating New Entry", "paragraphs": ["Several methods are available under IFQ programs for protecting the  economic viability of fishing communities and facilitating new entry.

Many fishery experts and participants are concerned that  individual quota holders will sell their quota outside of the fishing  community or sell their quota to large companies. If this were to occur,  fishing jobs could leave the community and larger companies could  consolidate their quota holdings and dominate the fishery. Fishing  communities that lose fishing jobs may have few alternative employment  options, particularly if they depend primarily on fishing and no other  industry replaces fishing.", "Allowing communities to hold quota is the easiest and most direct way  under an IFQ program to help protect fishing communities. According to  fishery experts and participants, fishery managers can give each  community control over how to use the quota in ways that protect the  community\u2019s economic viability, such as selling or leasing quota to  fishermen who reside in the community. Community quota could be held  by municipalities, regional organizations, or other groups representing the  community\u2014unlike traditional individual fishing quota, which is generally  held by individual boat owners, fishermen, or fishing firms. Of the three  U.S. IFQ programs, only one allows communities to buy and hold quota\u2014 the Alaskan halibut and sablefish program.", "Communities allowed to hold quota can obtain it through allocation when  the program begins or at any time thereafter. For example:    The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (North Pacific Council) is  considering allocating quota to community not-for-profit entities as it  develops a proposal for managing the Gulf of Alaska groundfish fishery.", "New Zealand fishery managers allocated quota to a Chatham Islands  community trust several years after the IFQ program was implemented.  The trust leases out annual fishing privileges to Chatham Islands-based  fishermen to help keep fishing and fishing-related employment in the  community.", "Similarly, fishery managers can incorporate rules into existing IFQ  programs or into the design of new programs to allow communities to  make quota purchases. For example, in 2002, the North Pacific Council  amended the Alaskan halibut and sablefish IFQ program to allow  communities along the Gulf of Alaska to purchase quota. The council is  considering including a similar provision in the proposed plan to manage  the Gulf of Alaska groundfish fishery.", "In addition to allowing communities to hold quota, fishery managers can  establish rules governing who is eligible to hold and trade quota as well as  other rules to manage quota as a means of protecting certain groups of  fishery participants. Specific rules may vary by program and change over  time, depending on which members or groups a council wants to protect.  In terms of eligibility to hold quota, for example, the North Pacific Council  initially restricted allocations of Alaskan halibut and sablefish quota to  individual vessel owners in part to protect the fisheries\u2019 owner-operator  fleet. The council later expanded eligibility to allow crew members to hold  quota without owning a vessel.", "We also identified several different types of quota transfer restrictions  used in foreign IFQ programs that were aimed at protecting communities.  For example:    Prohibiting quota sales. While none of the IFQ programs in the United  States prohibits the transfer of quota through sales, fishery managers in  other countries have done so. For example, Norway\u2019s IFQ program  prohibited all quota sales to protect fishing communities in certain  locations. Alternatively, prohibitions could be used temporarily to help  prevent fishermen from hastily selling their quota. For example, according  to New Zealand fishermen we spoke with, many small boat fishermen did  not initially understand the long-term value of their quota and therefore  sold their quota shortly after the initial allocation. To remedy this  situation, they suggested that fishery managers could prohibit sales for the  first year after a program\u2019s initial allocation to give fishermen time to make  informed decisions about whether to sell their quota.", "Placing geographic restrictions on quota transfers. Iceland and New  Zealand fishery managers have also set limits on where quota can be sold  or leased to protect certain groups, such as local fishermen and the  communities themselves. The Icelandic IFQ program, in which individuals  own vessels with associated quota rather than the quota itself, adopted a  \u201ccommunity right of first refusal\u201d rule to provide communities the  opportunity to buy vessels with their quota before the vessels are sold to  anyone outside of the community. IFQ programs can also regulate quota  leasing to keep fishing in a certain area by establishing rules that limit  leasing or fishing to residents of the community. In terms of leases, New  Zealand\u2019s Chatham Islands community trust has, in effect, used residence  in the Chatham Islands as a requirement to lease its quota.", "Limiting quota leasing. Iceland requires that all quota holders fish at least  50 percent of their quota every other year and prohibits quota holders  from leasing more than 50 percent of their quota each year. Fishery  managers introduced such restrictions, in part, to minimize the number of  \u201cabsentee\u201d quota holders\u2014those who hold quota as a financial asset but  do not fish.", "Finally, according to fishery managers and experts we spoke with, fishery  managers can help protect fishing communities by (1) setting limits on  quota accumulation, (2) establishing separate quota for different sectors of  the fishery, (3) requiring quota holders to be on their vessels when fish are  caught and brought into port, and (4) restricting the ports to which quota  fish can be landed.", "Setting limits on quota accumulation. Fishery managers can place limits  on the total amount of quota an individual can accumulate or hold to  protect certain fishery participants. In the United States, for example, the  North Pacific Council set limits on individual halibut quota holdings that  range from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent, depending on the fishing area, as a  means of protecting the fishery\u2019s owner-operator fleet.", "Establishing separate quota for different sectors of the fishery. To  protect small boat fishermen and local fishing jobs, Iceland developed a  separate quota for small vessels and large vessels and prohibited owners  of small vessels from selling their quota to owners of large vessels. In the  U.S. halibut and sablefish IFQ program, the North Pacific Council  established separate quota categories based on vessel type and length and  placed certain restrictions on transfers among these categories to ensure  that quota would be available to owners of smaller vessels.", "Requiring quota holders to be on their vessels. Some programs require the  owner of the quota to be on board when fish are caught and brought into  port. For example, the North Pacific Council requires fishermen who  entered the Alaskan halibut and sablefish IFQ program by purchasing  certain categories of quota, rather than receiving it as part of the initial  allocation, to abide by this rule. The rule was designed in part to limit  speculative quota trading by individuals who are primarily interested in  quota as a financial asset and not otherwise invested in the fishery.", "Restricting landings. Fishery managers could restrict the ports to which  quota holders or those who lease quota can deliver their catch. For  example, New Zealand\u2019s Chatham Islands trust leases rock lobster quota  to local fishermen who must then land their catch in the Chatham Islands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methods to Facilitate New Entry", "paragraphs": ["IFQ programs have also raised concerns about opportunities for new  entry. As IFQ programs move toward achieving one of their primary goals  of reducing overcapitalization, the number of participants decreases and  consolidation occurs, generally reducing quota availability and increasing  price. As a result, it is harder for new fishermen to enter the fishery,  especially fishermen of limited means, such as owners of smaller boats or  young fishermen who are just beginning their fishing careers. According to  New Zealand officials, quota prices increased dramatically. For example,  the average price of abalone quota increased by more than 50 percent in  the first 6 months of trading\u2014from about NZ$11,000 to NZ$17,000 per  metric ton\u2014and, by 2003, the average price had reached about NZ$300,000  per metric ton, or about 27 times the price at the start of abalone quota  trading in 1988.", "To reduce the barriers to new entry, fishery managers have established  quota transfer rules and set-asides, and/or provided economic assistance,  such as loans or grants. In terms of transfer rules, all domestic and most  foreign IFQ programs allow quota to be sold or leased. Allowing such  transfers provides the opportunity for new entry to those who can find and  afford to buy or lease quota. Since the lease price is generally below the  sales price, leasing quota may help make entry more affordable to  fishermen of limited means, such as small boat fishermen.", "Fishery managers can also make quota available and more affordable to  new entrants by \u201cblocking\u201d small amounts of quota and limiting the  number of \u201cblocks\u201d that any one individual or entity can hold. For  example, the North Pacific Council set up two types of halibut quota at the  initial allocation\u2014unblocked and blocked. Unblocked quota holds no  restrictions. Blocked quota, on the other hand, is an amount of quota that  yielded less than 20,000 pounds of halibut in 1994 and can only be bought  or transferred in its entirety. An individual or entity can hold unblocked  quota and one quota block; an individual who holds no unblocked quota  can hold two quota blocks. A state of Alaska study found that estimated  prices for blocked quota were less per pound than for unblocked quota  over the first 4 years of the Alaskan halibut and sablefish IFQ program and  that estimated prices for smaller blocks were less per pound than for  larger blocks.", "Setting aside a portion of the total quota specifically for new entrants can  also make quota available. Quota could be set aside at the time of the  initial allocation for future distribution to entities that did not initially  qualify for quota. For example, at the start of the Alaskan halibut and  sablefish program, the North Pacific Council set aside a portion of the TAC  for allocation to communities in western Alaska for community  development purposes. According to fishery managers, similar set-asides  could be used for new entrants by establishing the set-aside at the start of  the IFQ program, or by buying or reclaiming, rolling over, or setting aside  quota during the program.", "Buying or reclaiming quota from existing quota holders. Fishery  managers could buy back quota from existing quota holders. For example,  the New Zealand government bought back quota to give to the indigenous  Maori tribes in partial settlement of their claims against the government  over fishing rights. Fishery managers could also obtain quota forfeited by  fishermen who have not complied with program rules; in the New Zealand  IFQ system, for example, quota holders risk forfeiting their quota holdings  if they catch more fish than they have quota for.", "Issuing quota for a fixed period of time and then rolling it over for  distribution to new entrants. Depending on the program, the frequency of  the rollover could range from every few years to annually and the amount  of the rollover could range from some to all of the quota. For example, a  rollover system has been proposed for Australia\u2019s New South Wales  fishery under which fishery managers would issue quota for a finite period  of time (e.g., 30 years) under one set of program rules and, periodically  (e.g., every 10 years), quota holders would have the opportunity to choose  whether to continue to participate in the old system or move their quota  into a new system with different rules for another 30 years.", "Setting aside TAC increases for distribution to new entrants. Foreign  and domestic IFQ programs generally define an individual fishing quota as  a percentage of the overall TAC and distribute any changes in the TAC  among existing quota holders proportional to their share. Alternatively,  fishery managers could distribute TAC increases to new entrants, leaving  existing quota holders fishing the same amount of fish as they did in the  previous year.", "Once fishery managers have set aside quota, they must devise a method  for allowing new entrants to obtain it. According to fishery experts, the  options include:    Selling quota at auction. Fishery managers could auction off quota to the  highest bidder and keep the proceeds. Alternatively, the managers could  serve as an intermediary by auctioning off quota on behalf of existing  quota holders, and the seller would incur all losses or gains. In case the  auction price becomes prohibitive for new entrants, fishery managers  could set aside quota that could be sold at a lower, predetermined price.  Economists generally support the idea of auctioning quota because an  efficient market provides quota to its most profitable users. However, in  the United States, the Magnuson-Stevens Act limits the amount of fees that  may be charged under an IFQ program, which may effectively preclude the  use of auctions.", "Distributing quota by lottery. New entrants could be randomly selected  from a pool of potential entrants, giving persons of limited means an equal  chance to obtain quota. Lotteries might be especially advantageous when  the demand for quota from new entrants is greater than the supply of  quota set aside.", "Distributing quota to individuals who meet certain criteria. Fishery  managers could allocate quota to new entrants using a point system based  on criteria such as fishing experience or completion of an apprenticeship  program.", "Finally, to help make quota affordable, fishery managers and experts told  us that government entities could provide loans or subsidies to potential  entrants who might not otherwise be able to afford the quota. Affordability  is particularly an issue as an IFQ program becomes more successful and  the value of the quota increases.", "Loans. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows NMFS to offer loans. Under this  provision, for example, NMFS has established a low-interest loan program  for new entrants and fishermen who fish from small boats in the halibut  and sablefish fisheries off Alaska. The fishermen can use these loans to  purchase or refinance quota. Since the program\u2019s inception in fiscal year  1998, Alaska has approved 207 loans, totaling nearly $25 million. The  Magnuson-Stevens Act also provides for the creation of a central registry  where owners and lenders can register title to, and security interests (such  as liens) in, IFQs. According to the National Research Council, a registry  would increase lender confidence and provide opportunities for  individuals to obtain financing to enter IFQ fisheries. Although NMFS has  not yet established this registry, its Alaska Region maintains a voluntary  registry where creditors, such as private banks, the state of Alaska, and  private lenders can record liens against quota shares. The Alaska Region  reported that most lending institutions take advantage of this service. The  registry contained 2,581 reported interests in quota share at the end of  2002.", "Grants or other subsidies. Grants or other subsidies could decrease the  costs associated with buying or leasing quota. Since grants do not have to  be repaid, they could give fishermen of limited means the opportunity to  enter the fishery and then build their capital in order to increase their  quota holdings. In addition to grants, fishery managers could establish a  \u201clease-to-own\u201d quota program\u2014new entrants would pay for the quota  while using it. Also, quota could be made available for purchase or lease at  below market prices. Iceland, for example, is considering adopting a  discount program to make quota more affordable. This discounting  scheme would allow crews of small vessels to purchase quota from the  government at 80 percent of its market value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Community Protection and New Entry Methods Raise a Variety of Issues That Require Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In considering methods to protect communities and facilitate new entry  into IFQ fisheries, fishery managers face issues about efficiency, fairness,  and design and implementation.

Moreover,  community protection and new entry methods present a number of design  and implementation challenges. However, given the particular  circumstances of the fishery and the goals of the IFQ program overall, it is  unlikely that any single method can protect every type of fishing  community or facilitate new entry into every IFQ fishery.

For example, according to Icelandic fishery  experts, some communities did not manage their quota effectively and  sold it, reducing the communities\u2019 economic base. In addition, setting  aside quota for new entrants may not be the most efficient use of quota  because experienced fishermen or fishing firms are generally able to fish  the quota more economically than a new entrant. Adopting rules that  constrain the free trade of quota, such as those designed to protect  communities or facilitate new entry, would likely limit the efficiency gains  of the IFQ program. Therefore, fishery managers have to decide how much  economic efficiency they are willing to sacrifice to protect communities or  facilitate new entry.", "Methods to protect communities or facilitate new entry may also raise  concerns about equity. In the United States, certain community quotas or  rules aimed at protecting certain groups may not be approved because  they are not allowed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

A rule that proposes using residence in one state as a  criterion for receiving quota may violate the requirements of National  Standard 4. Furthermore, methods that propose allocating quota to  communities or adopting rules aimed at making quota more available or  affordable to a certain group of fishermen can appear unfair to those who  did not benefit and could result in legal challenges.

Defining community can be challenging because communities  can be defined in many ways. As discussed earlier, the Magnuson-Stevens  Act defines a fishing community as one that substantially depends on, or is  engaged in, harvesting or processing fishery resources to meet social and  economic needs. NMFS guidance further defines fishing community  geographically\u2014that is, a social or economic group whose members  reside in a specific location. Fishery managers and experts told us that  communities with geographically distinct boundaries are easier to define,  such as island communities or remote communities in Alaska. However,  some communities are difficult to define when, for example, some of the  fishermen live away from the areas they fish, as is the case for many  halibut fishermen who reside in other states and fish in the waters off the  coast of Alaska. Moreover, communities can also be defined in  nongeographic ways, such as fishermen who use the same type of fishing  gear (e.g., hook-and-line or nets) for a particular species or people and  businesses involved in a fishery regardless of location. These communities  can include fishermen and fish processors, as well as support services  such as boat repair businesses, cold storage facilities, and fuel providers.", "Once fishery managers define the community, they must then determine  who represents the community and thus who will decide how the quota is  used. More than one organization (e.g., government entity, not-for-profit  organization, private business, or cooperative group) may claim to  represent the interests of the community as a whole. For example, rural  coastal communities in Alaska, which are geographically distinct, could  have several overlapping jurisdictions, including a local native  corporation, a local municipality, and a local borough. Determining who  represents the community is more difficult in communities without  geographically distinct boundaries.", "Fishery managers also need to define what constitutes economic viability,  which is likely to differ by community because the fishery has different  economic significance in each community. Some communities primarily  rely on fishing and fishing-related businesses, while others may have a  more diverse economic base. (See fig. 1.) Consequently, it may be unclear  what type of protection a community needs to ensure its economic  viability. Fishery experts we spoke with agreed that few communities in  the United States primarily depend on fishing as their economic base.  Moreover, the balance of industries making up a community\u2019s economy  may change over time when, for example, the area becomes more  modernized or a new industry enters. For example, the economy of the  Shetland Islands changed dramatically with the development of the oil  industry off the Shetland Islands in the 1970s. This development resulted  in jobs and settlement funds that the community used to enhance its  economic base through community development projects.", "Finally, communities have to decide whether to keep their quota, sell it, or  lease it to others. If they keep their quota, they also have to decide how to  allocate it. Similarly, if they sell or lease their quota, they have to decide  how to allocate the proceeds. Unless communities can decide how to  allocate quota or the proceeds, the community quota may go unused and  thus prevent the community from receiving its benefit. For example, the  quota New Zealand\u2019s Maori people received from the government in 1992  has not been fully allocated to the Maori tribes, largely because the  commission responsible for distributing the quota and the tribes could not  agree on the allocation formula.", "Along with these definitional challenges, fishery managers and  communities have to address other design and implementation issues,  such as whether to establish prohibitions on quota sales or geographic  restrictions on quota transfers.", "Prohibitions on quota sales. Prohibiting quota sales may not allow fishing  communities or businesses to change over time as the fishing industry  changes. According to fishery experts we spoke with, rules that prevent  change essentially freeze fishing communities at one point in time and may  create \u201cmuseum pieces.\u201d For example, prohibitions on quota sales prevent  the fishery from restructuring, thus forcing less efficient quota holders and  fishing businesses to remain in the fishery. Consequently, prohibitions on  quota sales may actually undermine the economic viability of the fishing  communities they were designed to protect. In addition, prohibitions on  quota sales might run counter to an IFQ program\u2019s overall objective of  reducing excess investment in the fishery because such prohibitions act to  prevent fishermen from selling some of their boats or leaving the fishery.", "Geographic restrictions on quota transfers. Protecting communities by  imposing geographic restrictions on quota transfers also raises issues that  must be considered and addressed. According to fishery experts we spoke  with, rules that give communities the right to purchase quota before it is  sold outside the community might be legally avoided. For example,  Icelandic officials told us that in their IFQ program, where individuals own  vessels with associated quota rather than the quota itself, companies  holding quota easily avoided the \u201ccommunity right of first refusal\u201d rule by  selling their companies as a whole to an outside company, rather than just  selling their vessels and associated quota. As a result, communities could  not use this rule to prevent the sale. Furthermore, communities that could  benefit from such a rule may not have the money to purchase the quota,  while those communities that can afford to purchase the quota may not  need the rule\u2019s protection.", "Other program rules aimed at protecting the community also raise  implementation issues that fishery managers must consider:    Accumulation limits. The challenge in setting accumulation limits\u2014the  amount of quota that any one individual or entity can hold\u2014is to set limits  that are high enough to promote economic efficiency and low enough to  prevent any one individual or entity from holding an excessive share.  According to New Zealand fishery managers and experts, for example,  accumulation limits were set at between 10 and 35 percent, depending on  the species, in order to allow individuals to acquire enough quota to be  efficient and competitive while also stemming overcapacity and  overfishing in the inshore fisheries. Furthermore, as quota becomes more  valuable, managers may face pressure from existing quota holders to raise  or eliminate the limits on accumulation. In Iceland, for example, fishery  managers recently increased accumulation limits from 8 percent to 12.5  percent of the total quota because of such pressure. In cases where both  communities and individuals hold quota, fishery managers may want to set  different limits for communities and individuals. Even after managers set  accumulation limits, monitoring and enforcing these limits could be more  difficult when fishermen create subsidiaries and complicated business  relationships that enable them to catch more than the quota limit for an  individual quota holder. To mitigate this problem, the Alaskan halibut and  sablefish program, for example, requires all quota transfer applicants to  identify whether they are individuals or business entities, and requires all  business entities to annually report their ownership interests. NMFS uses  this information to ensure that no halibut and sablefish quota holdings,  whether individually or collectively, exceed the accumulation limits.", "Owner-on-board requirements. According to fishery experts we spoke  with, requiring quota holders to be onboard their vessels could be  impractical, especially for small businesses where the same person would  have to be on board at all times. Furthermore, such a rule would require so  many exceptions, such as for emergencies and illness, that it could  become meaningless.", "Requirements to bring catch into ports in a particular geographic area.", "These requirements may not be healthy for a community\u2019s economy in the  long term. For example, such a requirement may subsidize inefficient local  fish processors that cannot compete on the open market. With reduced  competition, these processors may offer less money for the catch, thus  reducing the fishermen\u2019s income and ultimately harming the community.  According to Shetland Islands fishery managers we spoke with, had  fishermen been required to land their catch in the Shetland Islands, they  would have been forced to sell their catch at a price far below the market  value and the processor would have had no incentive to restructure into  the competitive business it is today.", "Leasing provisions. According to some fishery managers and experts,  leasing reduces stewardship incentives, which may impact the  community\u2019s long-term economic viability. Quota leasing separates the  person holding the quota from the person fishing the quota. In some cases,  quota leasing may diminish stewardship incentives by creating a class of  absentee quota holders who rely on independent fishermen. While owner- on-board rules, such as those in Alaska, may minimize the risk of creating  this class of absentee quota holders, fishermen who lease quota have only  a temporary privilege to catch fish. Thus, they have less interest in the  long-term health of the fishery, especially as the end of their lease term  approaches. Consequently, incentives may exist to catch more fish than  their quota allows and sell this over-quota fish on the black market or to  fish using nonsustainable methods. For example, according to New  Zealand fishery experts, quota holders in the high-value abalone fishery  found that unskilled fishermen who leased quota were jeopardizing the  fish by extracting them in ways that harmed the abalone beds.", "Given the issues raised by quota transfer and other program rules, as well  as the potential loss of economic efficiency resulting from these rules,  some fishery managers and experts view freely transferable quota as being  the best way to maintain economically viable communities and therefore  place few or no restrictions on quota sales or leases. For example, New  Zealand allows free trade in quota on the theory that free trade is needed  to maximize returns from the fishery and enhance stewardship of the  resource. Similarly, the surfclam/ocean quahog IFQ program has relatively  few restrictions on quota transfers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Entry Methods Present Design and Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["As with community protection methods, new entry methods also present a  variety of design and implementation challenges to fishery managers.  Allowing quota to be transferred through sales or leases provides the  opportunity for new entry but quota prices may increase over time,  making quota less affordable. In the New Zealand IFQ program, for  example, the average price per metric ton of rock lobster quota in one  management area skyrocketed from NZ$23,265 to NZ$222,500 over an 8- year period.", "While leasing helps make quota available at prices lower than the sales  price, the lease price may still be unaffordable or unprofitable to fish and  thus not practical for new entrants. For example, according to New  Zealand fishing industry representatives, the lease price for rock lobster in  2003 was about NZ$22.50 per kilo, but fishermen needed to sell the fish for  at least NZ$30 per kilo to cover their costs. To minimize the risk  associated with leasing, the Shetland Islands community quota program  levied fees based on the sales revenue from the quota fished, rather than  setting a fixed lease price that fishermen would have to pay, regardless of  the amount of quota fish caught.", "Set-asides to make quota available for new entrants also raise challenges,  according to fishery experts. In setting aside quota for new entrants,  fishery managers have to decide how much quota to reserve and who  would be eligible to receive it, such as owners of small boats or young  fishermen. If a set-aside occurs when a program is first established,  managers do not have to take quota away from existing quota holders.  However, there are many challenges associated with setting aside quota  after a program is implemented.", "Buying back quota. Buying back quota may not be possible because the  government may not find quota holders willing to sell their quota. For  example, New Zealand funded a buyback program to obtain quota as part  of its settlement with the Maori tribes. However, the government was not  able to obtain the amount of quota it was seeking, and, as a result, had to  give the tribes money in place of some of the quota.", "Issuing quota for a fixed period of time. Issuing quota with expiration  dates could make it less likely that fishermen would accept the IFQ system  or make investments in efficiency. Fishermen could also find it difficult to  invest in boats and gear because banks may be less willing to lend money  and fishermen may be less willing to borrow. Furthermore, as with leasing,  stewardship incentives could decline as the quota expiration date draws  near.", "Setting aside TAC increases. Replenishing quota by using TAC increases  might not always be feasible because quota would not be available to  reserve as a set-aside when the TAC remains the same or declines. Setting  aside TAC increases would also dilute the interests of existing quota  holders, who would hold a smaller percentage of the TAC.", "Fishery managers also face challenges in deciding which new entrants  would be eligible to receive quota from the set-aside. If fishery managers  decide to auction quota to the highest bidder, they cannot be assured that  quota would be affordable to new entrants. Fishery managers could  auction the quota in small amounts, which would make the quota more  affordable and thereby open up opportunities to new entrants. However,  the value of the quota would decrease to reflect the inherent inefficiency  of this distribution mechanism. In addition, while lotteries could provide  potential entrants an equal chance to obtain quota and resolve some of the  equity issues raised by auctions, they would also create more uncertainty  for existing quota holders. Current quota holders would no longer have  control over quota purchases and would have to depend on the luck of the  draw. This uncertainty is a disincentive to invest in boats or gear.", "Economic assistance methods are designed to provide new entrants with  the capital needed to purchase quota and are the most direct method of  helping new entrants. However, they raise the following concerns,  according to fishery experts we spoke with:    The financial assistance may not be sufficient for a potential new entrant  to enter the fishery or buy enough quota to earn a living.", "Providing economic assistance could contribute to an increased demand  for quota and further price increases, thereby defeating the primary  purpose of trying to make quota more affordable.", "Government entities may not be willing or able to fund economic  assistance programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluations of Community Protection and New Entry Methods Would Enable Managers to Determine Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Fishery managers have not conducted comprehensive evaluations of how  IFQ programs protect communities or facilitate new entry, because few  IFQ programs were designed with community protection or new entry as  objectives. This lack of information, combined with the concerns about  economic efficiency and fairness, makes it more difficult to decide which  community protection and new entry methods to use. In order to  determine whether the chosen methods are working or how they should  be improved, fishery managers would have to clearly define community  protection or new entry as an objective, identify data that isolate the  impact of community protection and new entry methods, collect these  data before implementing the program\u2014baseline data\u2014and compare  these data with data collected over the course of the program. This effort  would then allow managers to determine whether their community  protection or new entry methods are accomplishing their objectives and  whether they need adjustments to promote effectiveness or respond to any  unintended consequences.", "Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, fishery managers are required to analyze  the social and economic conditions of the fishery in developing fishery  management plans. These data could be used as a baseline for the social  and economic conditions in a fishing community. In addition to baseline  data, fishery managers need to collect data once the IFQ program is  established. For example, some fishery experts told us that many fishing  communities in Iceland collapsed when quota was sold and left the  community. However, other fishery experts and Icelandic officials said  that these communities would have collapsed regardless of the IFQ, in  part, due to the lack of educational and employment opportunities and the  movement of people to Reykjavik, the capital, as the country modernized  during this time period. This difference in opinion exists partly because  Iceland did not collect the data needed to determine whether the IFQ  program, or other factors, led to the communities\u2019 demise. Recognizing the  need for additional information, Alaskan fishery managers will collect data  each year on the amount of halibut and sablefish quota held in each  community to help assess the effectiveness of its recent amendment  allowing communities to purchase quota. Similar issues arise in trying to  collect data that distinguishes new entrants from existing quota holders.

(See table 1.)", "With respect to their regulatory and management framework and number  of participants, IFQ programs generally have greater stability, take longer  to establish, and manage larger numbers of participants than cooperatives.  IFQ programs have greater stability than fishery cooperatives because  they are established and terminated by federal regulations, while  cooperatives are established and terminated by voluntary contractual  agreements.", "IFQ programs generally take longer to establish than fishery cooperatives  because of the fishery management council process. Fishery councils must  review the IFQ proposal, develop alternatives and options, and analyze  their potential social and economic effects before submitting the proposal  to the Secretary of Commerce for approval. While the secretary is  reviewing the proposal, NMFS must publish draft regulations for public  comment before the secretary makes a final decision and the regulations  are implemented. This process can be quite lengthy; for example, it took 3  years for the North Pacific Council to review, analyze, and adopt the  proposed Alaskan halibut and sablefish IFQ program and another 3 years  to implement the program. In comparison, because fishery cooperatives  are voluntary, agreements can be reached within a shorter period of time.  For example, the contract to form the whiting cooperative was negotiated  in less than a day.", "Finally, IFQ programs can manage larger numbers of diverse participants.  At the end of 2002, for example, the Alaskan halibut and sablefish IFQ  program had about 3,500 participants, ranging from crewmembers on  small boats to owners of large freezer vessels. In contrast, according to  fishery experts, fishery cooperatives work better with fewer and relatively  homogeneous participants because it is difficult for members to reach  agreement where there are many participants with diverse interests. For  example, the whiting cooperative has four participants and the pollock  cooperative has eight participants. In both cooperatives, the participants  are large harvesting and processing companies that own catcher-processor  vessels.", "With respect to allocating and transferring fishing privileges, IFQ programs  provide greater transparency than fishery cooperatives. Under an IFQ  program, NMFS uses widely published criteria established by fishery  councils to allocate quota to individual entities, such as individual  fishermen or fishing firms. Under a fishery cooperative, NMFS allocates  quota to the cooperative, which, through negotiated contract, distributes  the quota among its members. For example, the four companies that  operated catcher-processor vessels in the Pacific whiting fishery  negotiated a private contract to divide up the sector\u2019s quota using catch  history, vessel capacity, and number of vessels.", "When quota can be transferred, IFQ programs are less exclusive than  cooperatives, because they provide entry opportunities for fishermen who  can find and afford to buy or lease quota. In comparison, cooperatives are  exclusive contractual arrangements where quota is transferred among the  members, and potential entrants may have difficulty entering the  cooperative.", "Finally, regarding monitoring and enforcement, IFQ programs are viewed  as being more difficult for NMFS to administer than fishery cooperatives,  because NMFS must monitor individual participants for compliance with  program rules, such as quota accumulation and catch limits.

Because  the IFQ program is set by regulations, it will remain in place even if the  cooperative dissolves. Also, should the cooperative fail to perform, its  management authority and responsibilities would revert to the  government. For example, according to New Zealand fishery managers we  spoke with, the Challenger Scallop Enhancement Company (Scallop  Company) has managed the scallop fisheries effectively, but should it fail  to perform, its responsibilities would return to the government.", "A combined approach can provide a way for large numbers of participants  to organize into smaller groups to help manage their fisheries collectively.

Similarly, a cooperative of  quota holders could agree to stop fishing in certain areas or leave some of  the quota unfished to protect the resource.

New Zealand officials told us that  their government reduced its monitoring costs for its scallop fisheries  because the Scallop Company now performs this function. Because of the  size and common interests of cooperatives, members often create peer  pressure to conform to program rules. Self-regulation might also decrease  overall enforcement costs. Finally, a combined approach would provide  the enforcement mechanisms of an IFQ program should self-regulation fail  and/or should the cooperative fail to perform its other management  responsibilities.
