This report uses a systematic approach to assess overseas workforce size and identifying options for rightsizing, both at the embassy level and for making related decisions worldwide. GAO's framework links staffing levels to the following three critical elements of overseas diplomatic operations: (1) physical/technical security of facilities and employees, (2) mission priorities and requirements, and (3) cost of operations. Unlike an analysis that considers the elements in isolation, GAO's rightsizing framework encourages consideration of a full range of options, along with the security, mission, and cost trade-offs.

The administration showed its support for rightsizing in the President\u2019s Management Agenda by directing all agencies operating overseas to rightsize their presence. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is implementing this rightsizing initiative by analyzing the U.S. overseas presence and reviewing the staffing allocation process. Given the high costs of maintaining more than 60,000 Americans and foreign nationals overseas and the events of September 11, 2001, that highlighted the security vulnerability of Americans worldwide, the administration\u2019s rightsizing initiative aims to reconfigure U.S. government overseas staff to the minimum number necessary to meet U.S. foreign policy goals.", "In May 2002, we presented testimony on a framework for determining the appropriate number of staff to be assigned to a U.S. embassy. As you requested, this report presents the framework discussed in our testimony that outlines the key criteria for evaluating the U.S. overseas presence, along with examples of key questions that may be useful in making rightsizing decisions. We developed the framework by reviewing previous reports on rightsizing and overseas staffing issues, such as the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel (OPAP) report, and interviewing officials from the Department of State, other U.S. agencies operating overseas, and OMB. We tested the framework during our fieldwork at the U.S. embassy in Paris. In each section of this report, we include observations in applying the framework at that embassy.

The costs of maintaining staff overseas vary by agency but in general, as OMB has reported, they are high. The Deputy Director of OMB recently testified that the average annual cost of having one full-time direct-hire American family of four in a U.S. embassy is $339,100.", "Following the 1998 embassy bombings, two high-level independent groups called for the reassessment of overseas staffing levels. The Accountability Review Boards that sent two teams to the region to investigate the bombings concluded that the United States should consider adjusting the size of its overseas presence to reduce security vulnerabilities. Following the Accountability Review Boards\u2019 report, OPAP concluded that some embassies were disproportionately sized and needed staff adjustments to adapt to new foreign policy priorities and reduce security vulnerabilities. The panel recommended creating a permanent interagency committee to develop a methodology to determine the appropriate size and locations of the U.S. overseas presence. OPAP also suggested a series of actions to adjust overseas presence, including relocating some functions to the United States and to regional centers where feasible. However, the State- led interagency committee that was established to respond to OPAP\u2019s recommendations did not produce a standard rightsizing methodology. As we previously reported, the committee did not spend sufficient time at overseas locations to fully assess workload issues or consider alternative ways of doing business. To move the issue forward, in August 2001, the President\u2019s Management Agenda identified rightsizing as one of the administration\u2019s priorities. In addition, the President\u2019s fiscal year 2003 international affairs budget (1) highlighted the importance of making staffing decisions on the basis of mission priorities and costs and (2) directed OMB to analyze agencies\u2019 overseas staffing and operating costs (see app. I for a summary of previous rightsizing initiatives)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of a Rightsizing Framework", "paragraphs": ["Although there is general agreement on the need for rightsizing the U.S. overseas presence, there is no consensus on how to do it.

We identified three critical elements that should be systematically evaluated as part of this framework: (1) physical/technical security of facilities and employees, (2) mission priorities and requirements, and (3) cost of operations. If the evaluation shows problems, such as security risks, decision makers should then consider the feasibility of rightsizing options, including relocating staff or downsizing.

For example, ambassadors could use this framework to ensure that embassy staffing is in line with security concerns, mission priorities and requirements, and cost of operations. At the governmentwide level, State and other agencies could apply the framework to free up resources at oversized posts, reallocate limited staffing resources worldwide, and introduce greater accountability into the staffing process.", "The following sections describe in more detail the three elements of our framework, examples of key questions to consider for each element, and potential rightsizing options.

While chiefs of mission and State have primary responsibility for assessing overseas security needs and allocating security resources, all agencies should consider the risks associated with maintaining staff overseas. The Paris embassy, our case study, illustrates the importance of facility security in determining staffing levels. As at many posts, the facilities in Paris predate current security standards.

Currently it is difficult to assess whether 700 people are needed at the Paris embassy. For example, the fiscal year 2000-2002 MPP includes 15 of State\u2019s 16 strategic goals, and overall priorities are neither identified nor systematically linked to resources. In recent months, State has revised the MPP process to require each embassy to set five top priorities and link staffing and budgetary requirements to fulfilling these priorities.

In 2000, on the basis of a review of six different U.S. embassies, the State-led interagency committee found the perception that Washington\u2019s requirements for reports and other information requests were not prioritized and placed unrealistic demands on staff. We also found this same perception among some offices in Paris. Scrutiny of workload requirements could potentially identify work of low priority such as reporting that has outlived its usefulness. Currently, State monitors and sends incoming requests for reports and inquiries to embassies and consulates, but it rarely refuses requests and leaves the prioritization of workload to the respective embassies and consulates. Washington\u2019s demands on an embassy need to be evaluated in light of how they affect other work requirements and the number of staff needed to meet these requirements.

Thorough staffing criteria are useful for determining and reassessing staffing levels and would allow agencies to better justify the number of overseas staff. We found that the criteria to locate staff in Paris vary significantly by agency. Some agencies use detailed staffing models, but most do not.

This lack of consolidated cost data for individual embassies makes linking costs to staffing levels, embassy priorities, and desired outcomes impossible. This is a long-standing management weakness that, according to the President, needs to be corrected. Our work in Paris demonstrates that this embassy is operating without fundamental knowledge and use of comprehensive cost data. State officials concurred that it is difficult to fully record the cost of all agencies overseas because of inconsistent accounting and budgeting systems. Nevertheless, we were able to document an estimated total cost for all agencies operating in France in fiscal year 2001 at more than $100 million.

Independent analysis of each element can lead to changes. However, all three elements of the framework need to be considered together to make reasonable decisions regarding staff size. For example, if the security element is considered in isolation and existing facilities are deemed highly vulnerable, managers may first consider adding security enhancements to existing buildings; working with host country law enforcement agencies to increase embassy protection; reconfiguring existing space to accommodate more people in secure space; and leasing, purchasing, or constructing new buildings. However, consideration of all elements of the framework may suggest additional means for reducing security vulnerabilities, such as reducing the total number of staff. Our framework encourages consideration of a full range of options along with the security, mission, and cost trade-offs.", "Our framework is consistent with the views of rightsizing experts who have recommended that embassies consider alternative means of fulfilling mission requirements. For example, OPAP concluded that staff reductions should be considered as a means of improving security, and the Chairman of OPAP, in May 2002 testimony, supported elimination of some functions or performing functions from regional centers or the United States.Moreover, President Bush has told U.S. ambassadors that \u201cfunctions that can be performed by personnel in the U.S. or at regional offices overseas should not be performed at a post.\u201d Our analysis highlights five possible rightsizing options to carry out these goals, but this list is not exhaustive. These suggested options include 1.  relocating functions to the United States, 2.  relocating functions to regional centers, 3.  relocating functions to other locations under chief of mission authority where relocation back to the United States or to regional centers is not practical, 4.  purchasing services from the private sector, and 5.  changing business practices.", "Our case study at the Paris embassy illustrates the applicability of these options, which have the potential to reduce the number of vulnerable staff in the embassy buildings. These options may be applicable to as many as 210 positions in Paris. The work of about 120 staff could be relocated to the United States\u2014State already plans to relocate the work of more than 100 of these employees. In addition, the work of about 40 other positions could be handled from other locations in Europe, while more than 50 other positions are commercial in nature and provide services that are available in the private sector. For example:   Some functions at the Paris embassy could be relocated to the United States. State is planning to relocate more than 100 budget and finance positions from the Financial Services Center in Paris to State\u2019s financial center in Charleston, South Carolina, by September 2003. In addition, we identified other agencies that perform similar financial functions and could probably be relocated. For example, four Voice of America staff provide payroll services to correspondent bureaus and freelance reporters around the world and would benefit from collocation with State\u2019s Financial Services Center.", "The Paris embassy could potentially relocate some functions to the regional logistics center in Antwerp, Belgium, and the planned 23-acre secure regional facility in Frankfurt, Germany, which has the capacity for approximately 1,000 people. The Antwerp facility could handle part of the embassy\u2019s extensive warehouse operation, which is currently supported by about 25 people. In addition, some administrative operations at the embassy, such as procurement, could potentially be handled out of the Frankfurt facility. Furthermore, staff at agencies with regional missions could also be moved to Frankfurt. These staff include a National Science Foundation representative who spent approximately 40 percent of his time in 2001 outside of France; four staff who provide budget and finance support to embassies in Africa; and some Secret Service agents who cover eastern Europe, central Asia, and parts of Africa.", "There are additional positions in Paris that may not need to be in the primary embassy buildings where secure space is at a premium. The primary function of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration representative is to act as a liaison to European space partners. Accomplishing this work may not require retaining office space at the embassy. In fact, the American Battle Monuments Commission has already established a precedent for this, housing about 25 staff in separate office space in a suburb of Paris. In addition, a Department of Justice official works in an office at the French Ministry of Justice. However, dispersing staff raises additional security issues that need to be considered.", "Given Paris\u2019s modern transportation and communication links and large private-sector service industry, the embassy may be able to purchase services from the private sector, which would reduce the number of full- time staff at risk at the embassy if the services can be performed from another location. We identified as many as 50 positions at the embassy that officials in Washington and Paris agreed are commercial in nature, including painters, electricians, plumbers, and supply clerks.", "Reengineering business functions could help reduce the size of the Paris embassy. Consolidating inventories at the warehouse could decrease staff workload. For instance, household appliances and furniture are maintained separately by agency with different warehouse staff responsible for different inventories. Purchasing furniture locally for embassies such as Paris could also reduce staffing and other support requirements.", "Advances in technology, increased use of the Internet, and more flights from the United States may reduce the need for certain full-time permanent staff overseas. Moreover, we have identified opportunities to streamline or reengineer embassy functions to improve State\u2019s operations and reduce administrative staffing requirements, particularly in western Europe, through measures that would reduce residential housing and furniture costs. We reported in March 2001 that State has a number of outmoded and inefficient business processes.

Applying our framework in this effort would provide a systematic means of assessing staff levels and considering embassy costs and relocation and other rightsizing options. Furthermore, OMB and State have other initiatives under way that will make it easier to use the framework in the future. For example, to make it easier to consider the costs of the U.S. overseas presence, OMB is gathering data on overseas costs for each agency and the costs of establishing new positions, and is assessing the process by which agencies request funding to assign additional staff overseas. To help assess mission priorities and workload, OMB and State are reviewing how embassies have implemented the revised MPPs, which are designed to more clearly set priorities, and how these plans could be used to determine allocation of embassy resources.

The Overseas Presence Advisory Panel (OPAP) reported that overseas staffing levels had not been adjusted to reflect changing missions and requirements; thus, some embassies were too large and some were too small. OPAP said rightsizing was an essential component of an overall program to upgrade embassy and consulate capabilities, and it recommended that this be a key strategy to improve security by reducing the number of staff at risk. OPAP also viewed rightsizing as a way to decrease operating costs by as much as $380 million annually if a 10 percent worldwide staffing reduction could be achieved. President Clinton directed the Secretary of State to lead an interagency effort to (1) develop a methodology for assessing embassy staffing and (2) recommend adjustments, if necessary, to staffing levels at six pilot study embassies. We reported that the interagency committee was not successful in developing such a methodology.
