MDD is a debilitating mental illness related to reduced quality of life and productivity, and increased risk for suicide. VA also plays a role in suicide prevention.

GAO analyzed VA data, interviewed VA officials, and conducted site visits to six VAMCs selected based on geography and population served. From each of these six VAMCs, GAO also reviewed five randomly selected medical records for veterans diagnosed with MDD and prescribed an antidepressant in 2012, as well as all completed BHAP templates. The results cannot be generalized across VA but provide insights."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's analysis of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) data for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 shows that about 10 percent of veterans who received VA health care services were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is characterized by depressed mood or loss of interest along with other symptoms for 2 weeks or more that represent a change in the way individuals function from their previous behaviors. Because GAO found diagnostic coding discrepancies in 11 of the 30 veterans' medical records it reviewed from six VA medical centers (VAMC), VA's data may understate the prevalence of MDD among veterans being treated through VA, to the extent that such discrepancies may permeate VA's data. One treatment for MDD is the use of medications such as antidepressants. According to GAO's analysis, 94 percent of veterans diagnosed with MDD were prescribed at least one antidepressant.", "VA policy states that antidepressant treatment must be consistent with VA's current clinical practice guideline (CPG); however, GAO's review of 30 veterans' medical records identified deviations from selected MDD CPG recommendations for most veterans reviewed. For example, 26 of the 30 veterans were not assessed using a standardized assessment tool at 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of treatment, as recommended in the CPG. Additionally, 10 veterans did not receive follow up within the time frame recommended in the CPG. GAO found that VA does not have a system-wide process in place to identify and fully assess whether the care provided is consistent with the CPG. As a result, VA does not know the extent to which veterans with MDD who have been prescribed antidepressants are receiving care as recommended in the CPG and whether appropriate actions are taken by VAMCs to mitigate potentially significant risks to veterans.", "The demographic and clinical data that VA collects on veteran suicides were not always complete, accurate, or consistent. VA's Behavioral Health Autopsy Program (BHAP) is a quality initiative to improve VA's suicide prevention efforts by identifying information that VA can use to develop policy and procedures to help prevent future suicides. The BHAP templates are a mechanism by which VA collects suicide data from VAMC's review of veteran medical records. GAO's review of 63 BHAP templates at five VAMCs found that 40 of the templates that VAMCs submitted to VA Central Office had incomplete data. Also, GAO found that the BHAP templates VAMCs submitted contained inaccurate data. For example, 6 BHAP templates included a date of death that was incorrect based on information in the veteran's medical record, and 9 BHAP templates included an incorrect number of outpatient VA mental health visits in the last 30 days. Moreover, GAO found that VAMCs submitted inconsistent information because they interpreted VA's guidance on completing the BHAP templates differently. This situation was further exacerbated because BHAP templates prepared by VAMCs are generally not being reviewed at any level within the Department for completeness, accuracy, and consistency. Lack of complete, accurate, and consistent data and poor oversight can inhibit VA's ability to identify, evaluate, and improve ways to better inform its suicide prevention efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA identify and address MDD coding discrepancies; implement processes to review data and assess deviations from recommended care; and implement processes to improve completeness, accuracy, and consistency of veteran suicide data.

Instead, the clinician coded the encounter as  \u201cdepression not otherwise specified,\u201d a less specific code.

VISN officials and VA  medical center clinicians we interviewed said that clinicians do not place a  lot of importance on selecting a more precise diagnostic code because it  does not significantly change the patient care that is provided or the type  of treatment prescribed. In addition, in the interest of expediency,  clinicians may select a previously used or frequently used diagnostic code  for depression rather than take the time to search for a more precise  code.

Therefore, our analysis  includes a review of documents from five of the six VAMCs we visited.  Through review of the documents, we noted any fields missing data, such  as a field that requires a yes or no answer but neither answer is provided.", "Additionally, using professional judgment, we identified fields in the  documents to review based on whether the field related to aspects of VA  treatment\u2014including treatment for mental health conditions\u2014and the  date of the veteran\u2019s death. We identified these fields because they did  not require clinical judgment to assess. Using the parameters in the  corresponding guide for filling out these documents, including time  frames, we compared these fields to information included in the veteran\u2019s  medical record and noted differences between our answers and the  answers provided by the VAMCs in the documents.", "To ensure that we received the final, submitted versions, we also  requested these documents from VA Central Office for each of the five  VAMCs. We compared these documents to the documents we received  from the VAMCs. We used the documents from the VAMCs as the  starting point; therefore, we only analyzed the templates for veterans  identified by the VAMCs. that the template for these documents had changed over time. If  additional fields were included in the templates obtained from VA Central  Office, but were not originally included in the templates obtained from the  VAMCs, we did not review these fields. We generally used the answer  from the document obtained from VA Central Office, which is the final  submitted version, unless a field originally had an answer in the template  from the VAMC, but was blank or not answered in the template from VA  Central Office. In those cases, we used the answer from the VAMC  document.", "During the course of our review we learned  We provided the VAMCs with the fields where the answers in the VAMC\u2019s  documents did not match our answers based on our review of the medical  record. The VAMCs confirmed our answers or provided additional support  for their original answer. Results from our review of veteran suicide data  can be generalized to the VAMCs we visited, but cannot be generalized  to other VAMCs.", "We received additional templates from VA Central Office, but these were not analyzed  because the VAMC had not provided us with templates for these veterans.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2013 to November  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Indicators that a veteran is at high risk for  suicide include a current verified report or witnessed suicide attempt;  identification of current serious suicidal ideation that requires an  immediate change in the treatment plan, such as hospitalization; and the  presence of any of the following warning signs: threatening to hurt or plan  to kill oneself; looking for specific ways to kill oneself and seeking access  to such means, such as pills or weapons; and talking or writing about  death, dying, or suicide when these actions are out of the ordinary for the  person.", "The Handbook requires each VAMC to have a process for establishing a  patient record flag to help ensure that veterans determined to be at high  risk for suicide are provided with follow up for all missed mental health  and substance abuse appointments. The primary purpose of the patient  record flag is to communicate to staff that a veteran is at high risk for  suicide and VA policy states that the presence of a flag should be  considered when making treatment decisions. Suicide prevention  coordinators are responsible for assessing, in conjunction with the  treating clinician, the risk of suicide in individual veterans, ensuring these  veterans have a \u201cHigh Risk for Suicide\u201d Patient Record Flag on their  medical record, and reviewing the list of high-risk veterans at least every  90 days.", "We interviewed suicide prevention coordinators as part of our site visits  with six VAMCs to obtain information on how they track veterans  determined to be at high risk for suicide. At four of the VAMCs we visited,  suicide prevention coordinators used an electronic spreadsheet to track  information on these veterans. For example, the spreadsheets include  information such as whether the veteran has a patient record flag on their  medical record and when the flag needs to be reviewed, the date for the  veteran\u2019s next scheduled follow-up appointment, whether the veteran has  a safety plan, and the veteran\u2019s assigned psychiatrist. Officials from one  VAMC told us that they maintain the list daily, adding and removing  veterans as necessary. Officials stated that the circumstances under  which a veteran would be removed from the spreadsheet varied, but  veterans are generally removed because their patient record flag has  been removed and the officials no longer consider the veteran to be at  high risk for suicide.", "The two remaining VAMCs use other mechanisms to track veterans at  high risk for suicide. Officials from one VAMC told us that they use the  Suicide Prevention Application Network (SPAN) to query high-risk  patients at the VAMC. The SPAN database contains veteran information,  demographic characteristics, and information on suicide attempts and  completed suicides, among other things. According to officials, the  information for each veteran in SPAN includes the date the veteran was  assessed as being at high risk, as well as the date that the veteran needs  to be seen for follow up, if applicable. After our site visit, officials told us  they plan to periodically pull a list of all veterans with an active high risk  flag in VA\u2019s medical record for the VAMC and cross-reference that list to  veterans being tracked for high suicide risk by the suicide prevention  coordinator in SPAN to ensure all high-risk veterans are tracked.

For example,", "Officials at one VAMC stated that they use the information  collected in SPAN to provide data for performing statistical  analyses on the outreach conducted, to study suicide attempts  and completions across the VAMC catchment area, to understand  the means by which veterans are dying by suicide, and to study  the use of high-risk flags.", "Officials at a VISN explained that through a review of the SPAN  data about a year ago, officials learned that 60 percent of suicides  in the VISN were completed using a gun. After conducting  research on the subject, the VISN began a firearm safety initiative,  which includes notifying veterans by mail that they can receive  four gun locks each upon request, with no questions asked.", "VAMC officials have made programmatic changes to their suicide  prevention efforts based on trends in the suicide data they are  collecting and reviewing. For example,", "At one VAMC, officials told us that they reviewed suicide behavior  reports and, as a result of trends identified in these reports,  drafted a policy for medication restriction for veterans at risk of  overdosing. Specifically, over a 3-year period, five or six veterans  receiving VA care repeatedly attempted suicide by overdose,  typically when they were intoxicated. VAMC officials created a  work group to draft policy that mitigates risk for medication  overdose among high-risk veterans. At the time of our site visit,  the group was exploring creating a patient record flag that would  be included in the veteran\u2019s medical record for overdose risk  indicating that medication supplies should be restricted for these  veterans and the possibility of using automated pill dispensers to  dispense medications to these veterans.", "Through their work reviewing suicide-related information, the  suicide prevention team at another VAMC identified a trend in its  suicide data. In particular, they noted that some veterans were  given a 90-day supply of the same medications that the veteran  recently tried to use to overdose. The suicide prevention team  mentioned this to a clinical pharmacist who had also noticed this  issue. The VAMC is now trying to restrict days of supply for these  types of veterans, but there is no formal policy about this and no  plans to craft such a policy. Additionally, officials from this VAMC  stated that they have added items to the standardized suicide  behavior report template to help them to collect additional useful  information, such as active medications and pain score at the time  of the last visit.", "Officials from one VAMC stated that through a review of medical  records and autopsy reports for veterans who died by suicide,  they found that a vast majority of veterans who died by suicide  were not being seen by a mental health provider. In response,  officials provided education to primary care providers. VAMC  officials also noticed that veterans receiving care for pain were  dying by suicide at a high rate. As a result, the VAMC has started  an initiative with the pain clinic, and, as part of this initiative, the  chief of the pain management clinic consults with psychiatry on  veterans at risk for suicide.", "Officials at a VISN described changes made in response to the  suicide data in fiscal year 2012, which showed that a percentage of  veterans who completed suicide had no ongoing mental health care.", "These veterans mainly received care from VA primary care providers.
