Three medications are currently approved for use in MAT for opioid addiction--methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Methadone and buprenorphine are regulated like other controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) when used to treat pain and have additional requirements that apply when used to treat opioid addiction. The third medication--naltrexone--is not a controlled substance and is therefore not subject to the CSA. Methadone is a Schedule II controlled substance, which indicates a higher risk of abuse. Buprenorphine is a Schedule III controlled substance, with lower risk, and so generally has fewer requirements. For example, when used to treat pain, methadone generally may not be dispensed without a written or electronic prescription. In contrast, buprenorphine may be dispensed based on a written, electronic, or oral (phone) prescription. When used for opioid addiction treatment, the CSA and implementing regulations impose additional requirements for methadone and buprenorphine:", "Methadone may generally only be administered or dispensed within an opioid treatment program (OTP), as prescriptions for methadone cannot be issued when used for opioid addiction treatment.", "Buprenorphine may be administered or dispensed within an OTP and may also be prescribed by a qualifying practitioner who has received a waiver from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

It has a long history of use in treatment of  opioid dependence in adults. It suppresses withdrawal symptoms in  detoxification therapy, which involves stabilizing patients who are  addicted by withdrawing them in a controlled manner. Methadone also  controls the craving for opioids in maintenance therapy, which is  ongoing therapy meant to prevent relapse and increase treatment  retention. It can be administered to patients as an oral solution or in  tablet form. Methadone also carries risk of abuse.", "Buprenorphine: Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, meaning it  binds to opioid receptors and activates them, but not as much as full  opioid agonists. It reduces or eliminates opioid withdrawal symptoms,  including drug cravings, and it may do so without producing the  euphoria or dangerous side effects of heroin and other opioids. It can  be used for detoxification treatment and maintenance therapy. It is  available in tablet form or film for sublingual (under the tongue)  administration both in a stand-alone formulation and in combination  with another agent called naloxone, and as a subdermal (under the  skin) implant. Buprenorphine also carries risk of abuse.", "Naltrexone: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, meaning it binds to  opioid receptors but does not activate them. It is used for relapse  prevention following complete detoxification from opioids. Naltrexone  prevents opioid drugs from binding to and activating opioid receptors,  thus blocking the euphoria the user would normally feel and causing  severe withdrawal symptoms if recent opioid use has occurred.

Therefore, when used for that purpose, methadone  may generally only be administered or dispensed within an OTP.", "Under the CSA, OTPs must be certified by SAMSHA and registered by  DEA. To be eligible for full certification, an OTP must first be accredited  by a SAMHSA-approved accrediting organization. Accreditation is a peer- review process in which an accrediting organization evaluates an OTP by  making site visits and reviewing policies, procedures, and practices.

These factors include (1) the availability of qualified practitioners and their  capacity to meet patient demand for MAT; (2) perceptions of MAT and its  value among patients, practitioners, and in institutions; and (3) financing  issues related to the availability and limits of insurance coverage for MAT.", "Practitioner availability and capacity. According to literature we  reviewed and some stakeholders we interviewed, the number of qualified  practitioners\u2014specifically OTPs and physicians with waivers who can  prescribe buprenorphine\u2014available to offer MAT services for opioid  addiction may affect patients\u2019 access to this treatment. Further, some of  these practitioners may be operating at full capacity, leading to wait lists  that can affect patients\u2019 access to MAT. For example, in March 2016,  SAMHSA reported that there were approximately 1,400 OTPs.  However, a 2014 SAMHSA brief and several stakeholders and articles  stated that opioid-dependent individuals may not be able to access MAT  due to lack of nearby OTPs, which are mostly concentrated in urban  areas. As a result, some stakeholders told us that patients in rural areas  have to travel several hours on a daily basis to seek treatment because  they generally need to be at the OTP every day to take methadone. When  OTPs are accessible, one article estimated that the majority of them are  operating at 80 percent or more capacity, suggesting that they would not  be able to handle a significant number of new patients, and another  article noted that OTPs can have extensive waitlists. Some articles stated  that OTP capacity is limited by factors such as funding limitations and a  variety of state and local requirements.", "In addition, several articles and a 2014 SAMHSA brief highlighted that the  availability of buprenorphine, after FDA approval in 2002, helped to  expand access to MAT for opioid addiction but also noted that patients\u2019  access is impeded by the availability of physicians and the limits on the  number of patients that each physician can treat. In March 2016,  SAMHSA reported that there were approximately 32,000 physicians with  DATA 2000 waivers to prescribe buprenorphine. According to one  article, use of buprenorphine in OTPs has been limited, and another  article noted that, in 2011, 43 percent of counties in the United States had  no physicians with waivers who could prescribe buprenorphine as part of  MAT. In March 2016, SAMHSA also reported that there is substantial  geographic variation in the capacity to prescribe buprenorphine, including  shortages of physicians, primarily in rural areas. Several articles and  stakeholders noted that these patient limits can affect provider capacity  and restrict access to MAT, even after the CSA was amended in 2006 to  increase the maximum number of patients per physician from 30 patients  to 100 patients after the first year. For example, several stakeholders  told us that patients experience waiting lists for treatment when  physicians are treating their maximum number of patients. One article  noted that because there are many areas of the country that have an  insufficient number of physicians, the result is that many people needing  treatment may remain on waitlists for weeks or months. It added that  prolonged waitlists are associated with reduced likelihood of treatment  entry.", "Perceptions of MAT and its value. Several stakeholders, articles, and  documents reported that perceptions of MAT, such as perceived stigma  among patients and questions about its value among practitioners and  institutions, can affect patients\u2019 access to MAT. Eight articles we reviewed  noted that a perceived stigma about the use of MAT\u2014especially  methadone\u2014among patients can make them reluctant to seek treatment,  subsequently leading to social isolation and undermining the chances of  long-term recovery. Another article noted that OTPs experience  discrimination, such as community opposition, because they offer onsite  medical care to people who are dependent on opioids. Another article  stated that because of this perceived stigma, there is a desire among  some patients to avoid OTPs to limit interactions with others who may be  drug users and to avoid daily attendance requirements. This perception  often makes buprenorphine\u2014a MAT medication that can be prescribed in  an office-based setting\u2014a more attractive treatment option to many  patients.", "In addition, some practitioners may be reluctant to provide MAT based on  beliefs about the value of using medications for treating addiction. For  example, some articles and a 2014 SAMHSA report found that despite  science-based evidence regarding the effective use of MAT, some  practitioners do not believe there is a role for medications in the treatment  of addiction disorders. Similarly, according to several articles we reviewed  and stakeholders we interviewed, many practitioners believe in the  efficacy of abstinence-based treatment\u2014when patients are treated  without medication\u2014to treat addiction, even though research indicates  that abstinence fails a large proportion of the time and is generally less  effective than MAT.", "Several documents and the literature we reviewed examined the reasons  why MAT is not used more frequently within the criminal justice system.  For example, a 2011 Legal Action Center report, a 2014 SAMHSA brief,  and two articles cited various reasons why drug courts and other  sentencing officials deny access to MAT. These included a lack of  understanding about the nature of addiction and MAT, such as the belief  that MAT is substituting one addiction for another. In addition, some  judges may view opioid addiction as a social problem that is best  addressed through abstinence. The 2014 SAMHSA brief and some  reports and articles we reviewed show that institutions within the criminal  justice system have policies that limit MAT, and these policies may be  influenced by both negative perceptions of MAT and other factors, such  as concerns over the risk of diversion. For example, some of these  documents noted that some drug courts have policies that prohibit  participants from using any controlled substances, which would include  MAT.", "Some stakeholders, documents, and an article we reviewed highlighted  education as a key mechanism that can help reduce the perceived stigma  of MAT and its value, including among those within the criminal justice  system. For example, some stakeholders told us that they organize town  hall meetings and workshops to educate their communities about the  importance of MAT. The stakeholders explained that these efforts are  opportunities to help educate patients and practitioners about MAT. Also,  some documents and an article we reviewed on MAT and the criminal  justice system noted that peoples\u2019 views about MAT can be addressed  through education.", "Availability and limits of insurance coverage. According to several  stakeholders and articles we reviewed, financing of treatment is a key  factor that can affect patients\u2019 access to MAT. Specifically, these sources  show that the availability and limits of insurance coverage for MAT can  create access challenges for patients who lack insurance, as well as for  those with insurance. For example, patients with no insurance coverage  for MAT may face prohibitive out-of-pocket costs that may limit their  access to it. According to one article, a month\u2019s supply of a daily dose of  sublingual buprenorphine may cost such patients between $200 and $450  per month. According to another article, access to injectable naltrexone  among the uninsured is also limited due to costs that can range from  $750 to $1,200 a month. A third article that reviewed available literature  on MAT found that the monthly cost of injectable naltrexone is  significantly higher than that of the other MAT medications\u2014 buprenorphine and methadone. Because of this, the article noted that  cost is often a factor that practitioners consider when determining whether  to prescribe naltrexone to a patient.", "For individuals with insurance, the benefit coverage for MAT-related  services can vary by insurance plan and by state. According to one  article, some private health insurance plans do not cover buprenorphine  treatment, or they impose limits on the length of treatment with  buprenorphine. Some sources reported that lifetime coverage limits for  buprenorphine can range from 12 months to 36 months, even though  some patients may need access to the medications for the rest of their  lives to prevent relapse. Similarly, a 2014 SAMHSA report found that  although state Medicaid programs reimburse for at least one of the three  MAT medications, most states did not reimburse for all three. In some  cases, state Medicaid programs also limit the length of time that the  medications can be used. Although Medicaid expansion allowed under  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could increase the number  of individuals with coverage for substance abuse treatment, including  MAT, the specific coverage can vary by state. We have previously  examined access to behavioral health treatment\u2014which can include  MAT\u2014in 10 states, and found that officials in 2 of the states that  expanded Medicaid reported that the availability of behavioral health  treatment has generally increased, although some concerns about access  remain.
