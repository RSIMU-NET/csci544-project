This is done by conducting  the following activities: offering \u201ctake-back\u201d programs where patients can safely dispose of  any unused medications, preventing use or abuse by others;  securing information and materials, such as Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) registration numbers and prescription pads,that could prevent bad actors from illegally obtaining prescription  drugs; and developing abuse-resistant drugs that could hamper efforts to abuse  them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detection and Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["We identified nine practices related to the detection and monitoring of  prescription drug fraud, waste, and abuse, as shown in table 2.

Under the recently  issued rule, which established a Medicare enrollment requirement for  prescribers of drugs covered by Part D, CMS can revoke a  physician\u2019s or eligible professional\u2019s Medicare enrollment if the DEA  or a state agency has suspended or revoked the individual\u2019s  prescriber privileges. CMS may also revoke enrollment where it  determines the individual has prescribing patterns or conducts  practices that are abusive or represent a threat to the health and  safety of Medicare beneficiaries, or both. Prior to this new  requirement, CMS could not directly take administrative actions  against a Part D provider. CMS officials also reported that they are  working with OIG on how best to pursue other enforcement options,  such as \u201cpermissive exclusions,\u201d which allow OIG to exclude  providers from federal health programs for certain other actions, such  as misdemeanor convictions for certain offenses.", "CMS is planning to strengthen four practices that it has already  implemented, which correspond to all three categories.", "Prevention: Screening. CMS issued a final rule in May 2014 that is  intended to strengthen Part D prescriber and beneficiary screening.  The rule establishes a Medicare enrollment requirement for  prescribers of drugs covered by Part D, effective June 2015. As a  result, CMS is to screen these prescribers during the Medicare  enrollment process to verify that they meet specific requirements,  such as having current licenses or accreditation and valid Social  Security numbers. Additionally, this final rule authorizes CMS to  revoke a physician\u2019s or eligible professional\u2019s Medicare enrollment for  certain abuses of the program, or based upon a suspension or  revocation of the prescriber\u2019s DEA certificate or state authority to  prescribe drugs. As with fee-for-service providers, CMS will revalidate  enrollment information when changes or updates are submitted and  during a 5-year revalidation process. CMS is still considering whether  to require pharmacies that dispense covered Part D drugs to enroll  into the Medicare program.", "The rule is also intended to strengthen screening of Part D  beneficiaries. Currently, plan sponsors are to verify beneficiaries\u2019 Part D eligibility. While incarcerated or confined beneficiaries are  generally ineligible for Part D coverage, recent OIG reports found that  CMS paid for prescription drugs for such beneficiaries.implements the exclusion of beneficiaries incarcerated for 30 days or  more from receiving Part D benefits starting January 1, 2015, by  removing the facilities where individuals are incarcerated from the  definition of a plan\u2019s service area.", "Detection and Monitoring: Collaboration. CMS is seeking to  strengthen collaboration through a new voluntary web-based system  created by the NBI MEDIC\u2014PLATO\u2014that is intended to allow CMS  and plan sponsors to more easily share information on fraud schemes  and potential bad actors. For example, plan sponsors may use the  system to share information on specific suspect providers so that  other plan sponsors can determine whether they should also  investigate or take actions against those providers. CMS officials said  that they anticipate that PLATO will be accessible to plan sponsors by  the end of 2014. In addition, according to agency officials, CMS is  working with the NBI MEDIC to develop and implement predictive  models in PLATO to help identify potential fraud schemes that can be  shared with plan sponsors, such as a model for identifying prescribers  who provide certain controlled substances to patients without a valid  medical need.", "Detection and Monitoring: Compliance Program. CMS is pursuing  options for improving its oversight of plan sponsors\u2019 compliance  programs. In 2013, among the plan sponsors that it audited, CMS  found weaknesses in the majority of plan sponsors\u2019 compliance  programs for addressing fraud, waste, and abuse. During that year,  CMS audited 29 plan sponsors, representing 14 percent of all plan  sponsors and, of those, nearly all (94 percent) had findings related to  fraud, waste, and abuse activities, according to officials. These  officials also reported that almost all weaknesses were addressed  through a corrective action plan. In January 2014, CMS proposed a  rule that would require, among other things, that plan sponsors hire an  independent auditor to verify that any required corrective action plans  addressed deficiencies found during a program audit. CMS did not  finalize this requirement in the final rule issued in May 2014, and as of  October 2014, CMS officials did not provide a proposed completion  date.", "In addition, CMS officials reported that the agency has an initiative  under way to gather information that could help improve oversight of  plan sponsors\u2019 practices to address fraud, waste, and abuse. As part  of this initiative, CMS interviewed five plan sponsors about how they  use the information CMS provided to them on new fraud schemes and  potentially fraudulent providers. Based on this information, CMS  officials reported that they could change how the agency audits plan  sponsors\u2019 fraud, waste, and abuse activities, or increase the  requirements for sponsors\u2019 activities, in order to improve oversight.However, CMS officials noted that any changes will be based on the  agency\u2019s final assessment of lessons learned from the initiative, which  was still in progress as of August 2014.", "Investigation and Prosecution: Collaboration. CMS is working to  develop a more formal way to share information about fraudulent  providers with relevant state medical boards, CMS officials said, so  that the medical boards can conduct additional investigations to  determine whether the board should impose sanctions on those  providers, such as revoking a provider\u2019s medical license.", "CMS is not pursuing six practices that appear in two categories,  prevention and detection and monitoring, because the agency considers  the practices to be outside the scope of its program integrity activities, is  concerned about limiting beneficiaries\u2019 access to services, or for other  reasons.", "Prevention, and Detection and Monitoring: Clinical Guidelines. While  CMS uses clinical guidelines to review plan sponsors\u2019 formularies to  ensure access to certain drugs, CMS does not require plan sponsors  to carry out activities within these program integrity practices, such as  filling only the prescriptions for the lowest effective dose, promoting  alternatives to opioids, or screening their patients for potential drug  abuse. However, CMS provides training materials to providers on  such topics to promote patient safety, and other parts of Medicare  cover screening for drug abuse under certain conditions.", "Prevention: Health Information Technology. CMS does not use health  information technology for program integrity purposes, but  encourages its use by, for example, providing information to Medicare  beneficiaries on the benefits of electronic health records.", "Prevention: PDMPs. CMS guidance to physicians has encouraged  prescribers to check their states\u2019 PDMP prior to prescribing certain  drugs; however, variations in state practices regarding access to  PDMPs means that not all prescribers may be able to conduct checks,  according to CMS officials.", "Prevention: Limit the Supply of Abused Drugs. CMS officials told us  that the agency does not conduct activities to limit the supply of  abused drugs because this practice is beyond the scope of Part D  program integrity efforts. For example, CMS does not operate \u201ctake  back\u201d days where beneficiaries can dispose of any unneeded  prescription drugs, since, until recently, DEA required a law  enforcement presence at such events, which CMS cannot provide.CMS also does not address the supply of abuse-resistant drugs,  officials said, since that is the responsibility of the Food and Drug  Administration and pharmaceutical manufacturers.", "Detection and Monitoring: Lock-ins. CMS does not monitor Medicare  beneficiaries through a \u201clock-in\u201d or restricted recipient program. We  previously recommended that CMS consider a restricted recipient  program for Medicare Part D that would limit certain beneficiaries to  one prescriber, one pharmacy, or both for receiving prescriptions, and  that the agency should seek congressional authority, as appropriate,  to do so.  CMS, in responding to our recommendation, stated that it  did not agree that a restricted recipient program was necessarily the  appropriate control for the Part D program, and raised concerns about  restricting beneficiaries\u2019 access to services.2014, OIG recommended that CMS restrict certain beneficiaries to a  limited number of pharmacies and prescribers, and CMS concurred   However, in August  with the recommendation, but stated the agency needs\u2014and is  receptive to\u2014legislative authority to \u201clock in\u201d beneficiaries in Part D.", "Currently, the agency requires plan sponsors to review data to identify  beneficiaries potentially at risk for overutilization of certain drugs,  including opioids, and to monitor those beneficiaries. Monitoring  may include notifying their prescribers of the overutilization, case  management, and point-of-sale edits, which are beneficiary-specific  edits that can vary based on the situation. For example, the edits may  prevent a beneficiary from receiving certain types of prescription  drugs or an excessive amount of a particular drug.", "See appendix I for the status of all 23 program integrity practices we  identified and whether CMS and its contractors have implemented,  planned to implement, or are not pursuing them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) for comment and HHS provided written comments, which  are reprinted in appendix II.
