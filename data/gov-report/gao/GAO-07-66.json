VA allocated about $53 million directly to medical centers and certain offices based on proposals submitted for funding and other approaches targeted to specific initiatives. VA solicited proposals from networks for initiatives to be carried out at medical centers through requests for proposals (RFP). In addition, VA headquarters officials said that VA allocated $35 million for plan initiatives through VA's general resource allocation system to its 21 health care networks on a retrospective basis, several months after resources had been provided to the networks though the general resource allocation system. VA did not notify network and medical center officials that these funds were to be used for plan initiatives. Network and medical center officials interviewed told GAO that they were not aware these allocations had been made. As a result, it is likely that some of these funds were not used for plan initiatives. VA did not allocate the approximately $12 million remaining of the $100 million for fiscal year 2005 because, according to VA officials, there was not enough time during the fiscal year to do so. Medical center officials said they used funds allocated for plan initiatives for new services and for enhancement of existing services. For example, two medical centers increased the number of mental health providers at community-based outpatient clinics. However, some medical center officials reported they did not use all funds allocated by the end of the fiscal year, due in part to the time it took to hire staff. In fiscal year 2006, VA headquarters allocated about $158 million of the $200 million above fiscal year 2004 levels intended for mental health strategic plan initiatives directly to medical centers and certain offices. VA allocated about $92 million of these funds to support new initiatives, using RFPs and other targeted funding approaches. VA also allocated about $66 million to support recurring costs of continuing initiatives from the prior fiscal year. About $42 million of the $200 million for fiscal year 2006 was not allocated. Officials from seven medical centers GAO interviewed reported they had used funds for plan initiatives, such as the creation of a new case management program. Officials at some medical centers reported they did not anticipate problems using all of the funds allocated within the fiscal year; however, officials at other medical centers were less certain they would be able to do so. VA tracking of spending for plan initiatives was inadequate. In fiscal year 2005, VA did not track such spending. In fiscal year 2006, VA tracked aspects of plan initiatives but not dollars spent. However, available information indicates that VA spending for plan initiatives was substantially less than planned. In fiscal year 2006, VA medical centers returned to headquarters about $46 million of about $158 million allocated for plan initiatives because they could not spend the funds that year. However, VA cannot determine to what extent the approximately $112 million remaining was spent on plan initiatives because it did not track specifically how these funds were spent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides a range of inpatient and  outpatient mental health services to veterans with conditions such as  depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse  disorders.

This mental health strategic plan was  based on previous VA efforts that identified gaps in the availability and  adequacy of VA mental health services, including services for the  treatment of substance abuse disorders. VA\u2019s mental health strategic plan  was intended to help VA\u2019s leadership identify the actions and resources  needed to begin eliminating the gaps between mental health services VA  provided at the time of the plan\u2019s formulation and those additional  services VA anticipated that would be required to meet future needs.", "VA indicated at a 2005 congressional hearing that it would provide   $100 million above fiscal year 2004 levels for mental health strategic plan  initiatives in fiscal year 2005 from available resources. In addition, in a  2005 executive decision memo, VA indicated its intent to increase its fiscal  year 2006 funding levels to $200 million above fiscal year 2004 levels for  mental health strategic plan initiatives. This $200 million in funds for fiscal  year 2006 was to be composed of $100 million for a continuation of fiscal  year 2005 initiatives plus an additional $100 million included in the  President\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2006, according to the executive  decision memo. These additional funds represented only a portion of the  overall funds available to support VA mental health services in those   2 fiscal years. VA\u2019s appropriation for fiscal year 2006, for example,  included more than $31.5 billion for its medical programs, of which VA  expected to spend more than $2 billion on mental health services.

In recent years, VA\u2019s mental health services  and budget have come under increased scrutiny due to the potential for  increased demand for mental health services from veterans returning from  combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.

We also conducted interviews with VA headquarters  officials with responsibilities related to mental health services, budgeting,  and the allocation of financial resources. We took steps to ensure that the  data VA provided to us on the funding allocated in fiscal years 2005 and  2006 were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We reviewed the data for  internal consistency and compared the data to other VA information as  well as information we obtained through interviews with VA officials. We  did not independently verify the accuracy of the data. Nor did we  independently determine the extent to which legislation regarding VA  health care expressly requires spending or authorizes various types of  mental health services but relied on VA\u2019s determination regarding these  services. To describe how funds were used by selected medical centers, in  May and June 2006, we conducted site visits to 2 of VA\u2019s 21 health care  networks and three medical centers located in those networks, and we  also conducted phone interviews with officials in 2 other networks and  four medical centers located in those networks. We selected these 4  networks because VA had identified them as having gaps in substance  abuse and/or mental health services prior to the implementation of the  mental health strategic plan, and because they received varying levels of  funding\u2014from relatively high to relatively low\u2014in fiscal year 2005 for  mental health strategic plan initiatives. We interviewed clinical and  administrative officials at these networks and medical centers and at three  community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC) associated with these  medical centers and at five Vet Centers. We conducted these interviews in  May and June 2006. The findings from our site visits and phone interviews  with network and medical center officials cannot be generalized to other  medical centers or networks.

We also requested  from VA headquarters information on the amount of funds returned by  medical centers to headquarters when medical centers were unable to  spend all the funds in a fiscal year. In addition, we requested information  from VA headquarters on the amount of funds medical centers spent on  plan initiatives. To gain further insights and perspectives on veterans\u2019  mental health services generally, we reviewed our previous work on VA  health care, including those related to mental health and strategic planning  (see Related GAO Products at the end of this report), and interviewed  officials from selected veterans\u2019 service organizations and professional  and advocacy organizations. We focused on the allocation and use of  funds related to mental health strategic plan initiatives, and did not  evaluate the appropriateness of the mental health strategic plan, VA\u2019s  efforts to implement the initiatives outlined in the plan, or VA\u2019s allocation  and use of funding for mental health services generally.

Although the VERA system is used to allocate funds, it does not designate  funds for specific purposes or prescribe how those funds are to be used.  Medical centers also receive funding for specific purposes, such as  prosthetics, from VA headquarters that is not allocated through the VERA  system.

In July 2003, the Commission released its final report and  recommendations for improving the American mental health care system.  After release of the report, VA\u2019s Under Secretary for Health formed a work  group of mental health and health care professionals charged with  reviewing the Commission\u2019s recommendations to determine if those  recommendations were relevant to VA\u2019s mental health program.", "Following that effort, in July 2004, VA completed its mental health  strategic plan for improving the delivery of mental health services within  its health care system. This plan was formally approved by the Secretary  of VA in November 2004. The mental health strategic plan contained  recommended initiatives for improving VA mental health services by  addressing a range of issues, including, for example, improving awareness  about mental illness and improving access to mental health services.  According to VA officials, the mental health strategic plan was designed to  address gaps in mental health services provided to veterans across the  country. Some of the service gaps identified by the VA were in treating  veterans with serious mental illness, female veterans, and veterans  returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. The implementation of the  mental health strategic plan sought to ensure, for example, that mental  health services are provided in community-based outpatient settings; that  veterans have consistent access to mental health services across the  country; and that acute inpatient mental health services are coordinated  with other inpatient services provided to veterans.", "Within VA, OMHS is responsible for coordinating with the networks and  medical centers on the overall implementation of the mental health  strategic plan. This includes formulating strategies for allocating funds  committed for the plan\u2019s implementation. Such strategies include, for  example, the use of RFPs solicited from networks for specific initiatives to  be carried out at their individual medical centers. In addition to making  these funding decisions, OMHS is also responsible for tracking the use of  funds allocated for implementing the mental health strategic plan.", "While VA initially attempted to develop an estimate of the cost to fully  implement the mental health strategic plan, VA has since decided that a  comprehensive cost estimate is inappropriate. According to VA, a full- implementation cost estimate is inappropriate because the plan is a \u201cliving  document\u201d that will continue to change over time as it is implemented, and  thus, the costs will change as well. VA, working with an actuarial firm that  used certain assumptions provided by VA, developed both a long-term and  a shorter-term \u201cunofficial\u201d estimate of implementation costs for the  initiatives included in the plan because VA wished to have a \u201crough  estimate\u201d of what might be entailed in providing all services that might be  needed if capacity were not a constraint, according to VA officials. VA and  the actuary it used concluded, however, that the methodology used to  develop these estimates was problematic. For example, the estimates used  incorrect projections for utilization of mental health services, in part,  because VA\u2019s population and mental health services are different from  those in the private sector. VA officials said that more current and  accurate data are becoming available for use in projecting the number of  OIF and OEF veterans who would be entering the system and need such  services, and that such data and improvements in projecting demand were  used in development of the President\u2019s budget request for fiscal years 2006  and 2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Allocated about $88 Million of the $100 Million Planned for Mental Health Strategic Plan Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2005, but Officials Reported That Not All Allocated Funds Were Used for Plan Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["VA headquarters allocated about $88 million of the $100 million that VA  officials said would be allocated for VA mental health strategic plan  initiatives in fiscal year 2005 by using several approaches.

In addition, VA  allocated $4 million that was initially planned for CWT programs to VA\u2019s  Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care to support development of a new  nursing home care model. This shift occurred toward the end of the fiscal  year, when it appeared that not all mental health strategic plan funding  would be allocated that year.

VA then allocated funding directly to medical  centers for the mental health strategic plan initiatives beginning in  February 2005 and continuing throughout fiscal year 2005.", "In addition to RFPs, VA also used other approaches targeted to specific  initiatives based on identified needs. For example, VA headquarters  officials used a targeted approach to allocate funding to medical centers to  expand mental health services at CBOCs that had fewer mental health  visits than a standard that VA identified for this purpose. In addition, VA  headquarters allocated funds to support the creation of CWT-supported  employment mentor sites in each network. The medical centers selected at  those sites were expected to provide training and support for existing and  future CWT programs aimed at helping veterans with serious mental  illness find and maintain employment. VA headquarters also used targeted  funding approaches to allocate funds to medical centers to enhance  existing CWT programs through the addition of new staff and to establish  CWT programs at medical centers without such programs.

Officials at two  medical centers noted that they received funding for multiple new  positions, but that it was difficult for the medical center to recruit and hire  for so many positions in a relatively short period of time. In addition, in  some cases the need to locate or renovate space for mental health  programs contributed to delays in using funds.

Further, VA allocated funding  for medical supplies, equipment, and office furniture for Gulf Coast mental  health programs affected by Hurricane Katrina. As in fiscal year 2005, VA  allocated funding to the Employee Education System to support  educational programs. VA also allocated funding to support additional  mental health initiatives such as the development of web-based support  tools for veterans with mental health concerns, infrastructure  improvements at residential rehabilitation treatment facilities, suicide  prevention efforts, and Stand Down events to provide services such as  counseling and health screenings for homeless veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Did Not Allocate about $42 Million for Mental Health Strategic Plan Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["VA did not allocate about $42 million of the $200 million planned for  mental health strategic plan initiatives in fiscal year 2006 by any approach.  The approximately $42 million in unallocated funds were intended for  certain mental health strategic plan initiatives based on an allocation plan  developed by VA. According to VA officials, VA was unable to allocate all  the $200 million, in part, because of the delayed implementation of three  new Centers of Excellence, focusing on veterans\u2019 mental health issues,  including PTSD, for which VA planned allocations totaling $4.5 million.  VA officials also cited the unanticipated length of time required to refine  the processes for implementation of initiatives related to the provision of  mental health services in primary care settings. VA had solicited proposals  related to primary care mental health services through a May 2006 RFP  and had anticipated allocating about $11 million for such services from  funds reserved for emerging needs related to the mental health strategic  plan. In addition, VA officials reported that a portion of the funds were  unallocated for reasons related to the timing of allocations that were made  for plan initiatives through RFPs and other funds targeted to medical  centers. Specifically, some of these allocations were made well into the  fiscal year. VA allocated only the amount of funds through these  approaches for fiscal year 2006 that would fund the projects through the  end of the fiscal year, and not the full 12-month costs, which VA expects to  fund in fiscal year 2007. VA officials said they anticipated that the full   12-month allocation would be available for these projects in fiscal year  2007. Most of the unallocated funds had been planned for initiatives to  provide services that VA identified as not directly in response to legislation  that expressly required spending or authorized such services.

Officials at four of these medical  centers told us that they were using these funds to support expanded  mental health services. For example, officials at several medical centers,  including Bay Pines, Decatur, and the Tennessee Valley Healthcare  System, reported using fiscal year 2006 funding to expand mental health  services in their CBOCs by adding clinical staff. As part of this expansion  of services, the Tampa medical center used funding for a new mental  health intensive case management program. Five medical centers had  received funding for expanded mental health services, but had not yet  used all of the allocated funds. The Albuquerque medical center, for  example, had received funding for a new substance abuse program for  geriatric patients and a new case management program for veterans with  PTSD. As of May 2006, both programs were still being developed and  positions had been advertised but had not yet been filled.", "Officials at two medical centers reported that they did not anticipate  problems using all of the funds they had received in fiscal year 2006.  However, officials at four other medical centers were less certain they  would be able to use all of the funds. Officials at two of these medical  centers were not sure whether they would be able to hire all of their new  staff by the end of the fiscal year. In addition, officials at the Bay Pines and  Phoenix medical centers noted that they had not yet learned whether  proposals they submitted in response to fiscal year 2006 RFPs would be  funded; as a result, officials at those medical centers were uncertain  whether they would be able to use all of their fiscal year 2006 funds for  plan initiatives by the end of the fiscal year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Tracking of Funds Spent for Mental Health Strategic Plan Initiatives Was Inadequate, but Available Information Indicates That Spending for These Initiatives Was Substantially Less Than Planned", "paragraphs": ["VA tracking of spending for mental health strategic plan initiatives was  inadequate for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. In fiscal year 2005, VA  headquarters did not track spending on mental health strategic plan  initiatives. In fiscal year 2006, VA began to track some information on  medical centers\u2019 mental health strategic plan initiatives, but did not track  the amount of allocated funds that was spent for them. VA headquarters  officials used this newly instituted tracking system to gather  implementation information reported by networks and medical centers on  a quarterly basis. The tracked information was primarily related to  positions to be filled, the schedule for filling them, and when they were  filled. Headquarters officials said that this tracking was intended, in part,  to measure medical centers\u2019 progress in implementing plan initiatives.  Officials told us that they believe that tracking of hiring provides  information on how funds were spent because most costs of initiatives are  personnel costs. However, the data on hiring did not include information  on the individual salaries of staff, associated benefits, the portion of the  fiscal year for which staff are employed, equipment, supplies, rent, or  renovation of facilities. As a result the quarterly reports do not allow VA to  determine how much was spent on plan initiatives. In fiscal year 2006, VA  headquarters officials compiled information on the amount of funds  returned to headquarters that medical centers could not spend during the  fiscal year. However, VA does not have information on whether the funds  medical centers retained were spent for plan initiatives.", "Available information indicates that spending of allocations for mental  health strategic plan initiatives was substantially less than planned in both  fiscal years 2005 and 2006. In fiscal year 2005, approximately $12 million of  the planned $100 million for plan initiatives was not allocated for plan  initiatives and thus was not spent on them. Thirty-five million dollars was  allocated through VA\u2019s general resource allocation system, but because VA  headquarters did not specify that these funds were for mental health  strategic plan initiatives, it is likely that portions of this money were not  spent on them, and VA officials said they do not have information on these  funds being spent for plan initiatives. In addition, VA officials told us that  they did not have information on the extent to which the approximately  $53 million in funds that were allocated directly to medical centers and  certain offices was actually spent on plan initiatives. Officials at medical  centers we interviewed told us that they used some of these funds on  mental health activities other than the planned initiatives or carried over  funds until the next fiscal year.", "In fiscal year 2006, available information indicates that the maximum  amount of allocated funds that could have been spent for plan initiatives in  fiscal year 2006 also fell substantially below what was planned. About   $42 million of the $200 million that was planned for allocation to mental  health strategic plan initiatives was never allocated for them, and thus,  never spent for plan initiatives. Additionally, about $46 million of the  approximately $158 million that was allocated was returned by medical  centers to headquarters because it had not been spent for plan initiatives  before the end of the fiscal year. However, all of the remaining  approximately $112 million of funds allocated to and retained by medical  centers and offices was not necessarily spent on plan initiatives as  originally planned. VA officials provided written guidance to medical  centers in August 2006 instructing them to spend funds for other mental  health activities if they could not spend them for the planned initiatives  before the end of the fiscal year. VA officials told us that because they had  provided instructions to spend the funds on mental health activities that  such activities would constitute spending on mental health strategic plan  activities. VA\u2019s guidance, however, did not specify that funds be used for  the plan initiatives or alternative initiatives. Moreover, VA did not track  specifically how these funds were spent. As a consequence, VA cannot  determine how much of the approximately $112 million that was allocated  for plan initiatives and not returned to headquarters was spent on plan  initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["VA allocated additional resources for mental health strategic plan  initiatives in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 to help address identified gaps in  VA\u2019s mental health services for veterans. The allocations that were made  resulted in some new and expanded mental health services for plan  initiatives according to officials at selected medical centers. However, in  fiscal year 2005, lack of adequate time for headquarters to allocate funds  for plan initiatives to medical centers, late-in-the-year allocations that  hampered medical center efforts to bring staff on board during the fiscal  year, and a lack of guidance concerning allocations for plan initiatives  made through VA\u2019s general resource allocation system resulted in  spending on initiatives falling short of what was planned. In fiscal year  2006, a larger amount, approximately $158 million of the planned   $200 million for plan initiatives, was allocated to medical centers and  other offices than in fiscal year 2005. However, at the end of the fiscal year  about $46 million was returned to VA headquarters that had not been  spent on mental health strategic plan initiatives, and some funds that  remained with medical centers and other offices may have been directed  towards mental health activities other than plan initiatives.", "Although available information shows that a substantial portion of the  resources intended for plan initiatives in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 was  not spent on these initiatives, VA does not know the amount of allocated  funds actually spent on them. The extent of spending is unknown because  VA did not track spending of these funds. Although some tracking of  mental health strategic plan initiatives was started in fiscal year 2006, data  were not collected that would allow an assessment of spending. Tracking  the extent to which allocations for plan initiatives are spent for these  initiatives is important as VA continues to allocate resources for future  plan initiatives. This would help to ensure that the money is being spent as  planned, and that VA is in fact addressing gaps that it has identified in  mental health services for veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide information for improved management and oversight of how  funds VA allocates are spent to fill identified gaps in mental health services  for veterans, we recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct  the Under Secretary for Health to take the following action:  Track the extent to which the resources allocated for mental health  strategic plan initiatives are spent for plan initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["VA did not provide agency comments on the contents of this report.
