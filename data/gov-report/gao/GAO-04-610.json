While SBA has made progress in its lender oversight program, its past efforts to develop a loan monitoring system were unsuccessful. In 2003, SBA obtained loan monitoring services from Dun & Bradstreet. GAO evaluated SBA's loan monitoring needs, how well those needs are met by the new service, and the similarities and differences for the purposes of credit risk management between SBA and private sector best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Largely because SBA relies on lenders to make the loans it guarantees, the agency needs a loan and lender monitoring capability that will enable it to efficiently and effectively analyze its overall portfolio of loans, its individual lenders, and their portfolios of loans. SBA, along with Dun & Bradstreet, essentially identified these same needs as they obtained the loan monitoring service. In addition, they identified the importance of applying industry standards and best practices for loan and lender monitoring and the need to identify high-risk lenders. Based on our assessment of best practices, SBA's credit risk management efforts need to include a comprehensive infrastructure, appropriate methodologies, and policies. The loan monitoring service could enable SBA to conduct the type of monitoring and analyses typical of best practices among banks and recommended by financial institution regulators, if SBA develops and implements appropriate policies. SBA's newly obtained service provides a credit risk management infrastructure and methodology that appear to be on par with those of many private sector lenders. For example, the database affords analytical capabilities based on common financial models that are used by major financial institutions. Although SBA obtained a useful service, it does not have comprehensive policies needed to implement best practices and address its needs as an agency with a public mission, especially regarding its need to use enforcement actions to address noncompliance. In addition, SBA does not have a contingency plan in the event the Dun & Bradstreet service is discontinued. SBA, similar to private lenders, must determine the level of risk it will tolerate, but it must do so within the context of its mission and its programs' structures, which may consequently translate into different uses of its Dun & Bradstreet loan monitoring service. Since SBA is a public agency with a public mission, its mission obligations will drive its credit risk management policies. For example, different loan products in the 7(a) program have different levels of guarantees, and guarantees on 504 program loans have a different structure from 7(a) guarantees. These differences influence the mix of loans in SBA's portfolio and, consequently, would impact how SBA manages its credit risk. Furthermore, the structure of SBA's loan guarantee programs may also result in different credit risk management policies between SBA and major lenders. Private sector lenders manage credit risk at the loan level and the portfolio level. Since SBA relies on private lenders to originate and service the majority of the loans it guarantees, it also needs to manage the credit risk in its portfolio at the lender level."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2003, private lenders reportedly made more than 57,000 loans  totaling almost $12 billion to small businesses through the Small Business  Administration\u2019s (SBA) two major loan guarantee programs. These loans  are made to businesses for operating capital and other purposes under  SBA\u2019s 7(a) program and for fixed assets under its 504 program. SBA  guarantees varying portions of these loans, depending on the loan program  and loan product, although the majority (75 percent) was approved by  banks and other private financial entities under authority delegated by  SBA. To efficiently and effectively carry out its mission of maintaining and  strengthening the nation\u2019s economy by guaranteeing loans in an effort to  help small businesses create jobs, SBA must monitor its overall portfolio of  loans, its individual lenders, and their portfolios. At the end of fiscal year  2003, SBA\u2019s portfolio of business loans totaled $45 billion. Our past work  documented that SBA has not had a successful lender monitoring program  or a loan monitoring system. From 1998 to 2001, at a cost of $9.6 million,  SBA attempted to improve its monitoring by independently developing its  own loan monitoring system. These efforts failed in part because the  agency did not plan properly. And in 2003, partly based on congressional  action to cut funding of its loan monitoring system, SBA awarded a  contract to Dun & Bradstreet to enable the agency to better monitor its  portfolio, its individual lenders, and their portfolios. In this report, we refer  to the loan monitoring service provided under the contract with Dun &  Bradstreet as \u201cDun & Bradstreet service\u201d or \u201cloan monitoring service.\u201d", "Due to the importance of acquiring a loan monitoring service and an  effective set of policies for its use, you asked us to review the agency\u2019s  acquisition and use of the new Dun & Bradstreet service. Specifically, you  asked us to determine (1) SBA\u2019s loan portfolio monitoring needs, (2) how  well the newly obtained Dun & Bradstreet service meets SBA\u2019s loan  portfolio monitoring needs, and (3) the major differences and similarities  for the purposes of credit risk management between SBA and private  sector best practices.", "To determine SBA\u2019s loan portfolio monitoring needs, we reviewed and  analyzed agency documents, and discussed related issues with agency and  industry officials and contractor staff. In addition we analyzed SBA\u2019s  intended purposes for the Dun & Bradstreet service. Furthermore, we  identified applicable industry best practices and federal guidance to banks  for loan portfolio monitoring. To determine how well the new Dun &  Bradstreet service meets SBA\u2019s needs, we reviewed and analyzed agency  documents, and conducted interviews with agency officials and contractor  staff. We also analyzed the Dun & Bradstreet deliverables and the  capabilities of the Dun & Bradstreet service, as well as SBA\u2019s use and  planned use of the service. To determine the major similarities and  differences between SBA and private sector best practices for the purposes  of credit risk management, we interviewed selected major small business  lenders and federal banking regulators. We conducted our work in  Washington, D.C., between August 2003 and May 2004 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I contains a  full description of our objectives, scope, and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In pursuing its mission of aiding small businesses, SBA provides small  businesses with access to credit, primarily by guaranteeing loans through  its 7(a) and 504 loan programs. SBA has a total credit portfolio of $45  billion, the majority of which consists of 7(a) and 504 loans. The 7(a) Loan  Program is intended to serve small business borrowers who could not  otherwise obtain credit under suitable terms and conditions from the  private sector without an SBA guarantee. Under the program, SBA provides  guarantees of up to 85 percent on loans made by participating lenders\u2014 often called certified or preferred lenders, which are subject to program oversight by SBA. Loan proceeds can be used for most business purposes,  including working capital, equipment, furniture and fixtures, land and  buildings, leasehold improvements, and debt refinancing. The 504 loan  program provides long-term, fixed-rate financing to small businesses for  expansion or modernization, primarily of real estate. The 504 financing is  delivered through Certified Development Companies (CDC), about 270  typically preexisting private nonprofit corporations, established to  contribute to the economic development of their communities. For a  typical 504 loan project, at least 10 percent of the loan proceeds are  provided by the borrower, at least 50 percent by an unguaranteed third- party lender loan, and the remainder by an SBA-guaranteed debenture  from a CDC. Although SBA\u2019s 7(a) and 504 loan programs serve different  needs, both programs rely on third parties to originate loan guarantees  (participating lenders for 7(a) and CDCs for 504 loans). Because SBA  guarantees up to 85 percent of the 7(a) loans and 40 percent of 504 loan  projects, there is risk to SBA similar to that of a lender if the loans it makes  are not repaid.", "Loan portfolio management (monitoring) is the process by which risks that  are inherent in the credit process (primarily credit risk) are managed and  controlled. Current best practices emphasize an understanding of (1) the  risk posed by each loan and (2) how the risks of individual loans and  portfolios are interrelated. To address individual credit risk, best-practice  lenders focus on controlling the quality of individual loans approved and  carefully monitoring loan performance over time. These efforts encompass  such activities as specifying underwriting criteria, analyzing financial data  at loan origination, maintaining loan documentation, routinely reviewing  loan performance, and monitoring the financial condition of the borrower.  Managing a loan portfolio to consider portfolio concentration risks\u2014which  can result from concentration of loans in, for example, a particular  industry\u2014requires a more holistic view. Here, better technology and  information systems have opened the door to better management methods.  Today\u2019s loan portfolio managers frequently use software tools to identify  interrelationships among loans and rank risk within a portfolio. The goal is  to obtain early indications of increasing risk. Together, these two  conceptual approaches\u2014an individual and an aggregate view of risk\u2014form  the foundation of modern loan portfolio management.", "The Small Business Programs Improvement Act of 1996 required SBA to  establish a risk management database that would provide timely and  accurate information to identify loan underwriting, collections, recovery,  and liquidation problems. In its fiscal year 1998 budget request, SBA  presented plans for increased reliance on lenders to service and liquidate  defaulted small business loans. SBA planned to use the new database to  manage its loan portfolios, identify and effectively mitigate risks incurred  through loans guaranteed by SBA, implement oversight of internal and  external operations, and calculate subsidy rates.", "We reviewed SBA\u2019s plans to develop its loan monitoring system and  reported that SBA had not undertaken the essential planning needed to  develop the proposed system. Congress subsequently enacted provisions in  the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 that directed the agency to  complete certain necessary planning activities that would serve as the basis  for funding the development and implementation of its loan monitoring  system. From 1998 to 2001, SBA\u2019s estimate for implementing the system  grew from $17.3 million to $44.6 million. By 2001, SBA had spent $9.6  million for developmental activities but had never completed the mandated  planning activities or developed a functioning loan monitoring system. We  have periodically reported on SBA\u2019s progress in planning and developing the loan monitoring system since 1997. In 2001, Congress stopped  appropriating funds for the loan monitoring system and instead authorized  SBA to use reprogrammed funds, provided that SBA notify Congress in  advance of SBA\u2019s use of the reprogrammed funds. Congress also directed  SBA to develop a project plan to serve as a basis for future funding and  oversight of the loan monitoring system. As a result, SBA suspended the  loan monitoring system development effort. Of the $32 million  appropriated for the loan monitoring system effort, about $14.7 million  remained and was deposited with the General Services Administration\u2019s  (GSA) Federal Systems Integration and Management Center Program  (FEDSIM). In January 2002, SBA contracted for assistance to identify  alternatives and provide recommendations for further developing a loan  monitoring system. As a result, SBA chartered a loan monitoring system  project management board with overall leadership and responsibility for  the vision, direction, and results of the loan monitoring system effort. This  board subsequently made the decision to no longer pursue the  development of a loan monitoring system, and in February 2003, SBA,  through FEDSIM, prepared a task order request for loan management  services. A contract was awarded to Dun & Bradstreet in April 2003 to  obtain loan management services, including loan and lender monitoring  and evaluation and risk management tools; the contract includes four one- year options at an average cost of approximately $2 million a year.", "Prior to contracting for the Dun & Bradstreet loan monitoring service, SBA  had made progress in developing its lender oversight program for 7(a)  lenders with the establishment of the Office of Lender Oversight (OLO)\u2014 the office within SBA that is charged with ensuring consistent and  appropriate supervision of its lending partners, with the development of  written guidance in the form of \u201cStandard Operating Procedures\u201d and  \u201cLoan Policy and Program Oversight Guide for Lender Reviews,\u201d and  through conducting reviews. However, our 2002 study of SBA\u2019s preferred  lender review process found that it involved only a cursory review of  lenders\u2019 processes rather than a qualitative assessment of their decisions  with regard to borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness and eligibility. Preferred  lender reviews were not designed to evaluate future financial risk.", "SBA\u2019s preferred lender reviews were set up as strict compliance reviews  and were not designed to measure the lenders\u2019 future financial risk. Lender  reviews were based on reviewers\u2019 findings using a questionnaire and a  review checklist. Recent changes related to these reviews are discussed in  this report. As participants in the 7(a) program, SBLCs are subject to the  same review requirements as other 7(a) lenders, in addition to the required  safety and soundness reviews. We have made recommendations calling on  SBA to clarify its supervisory and enforcement powers over 7(a) lenders  since November 2000. Further, CDCs are subject to the same lender  reviews as those required by 7(a) lenders. As with SBLCs, SBA provides the  only oversight currently required for CDCs; therefore, lender oversight for  both SBLCs and CDCs is especially important in order for SBA to monitor  the risk they pose to the agency. In February 2003, SBA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG) recommended that SBA develop separate review  procedures for the oversight of the 504 loan program and that the review  process be both a financial and a compliance review. SBA responded that a  redesigned approach to CDC lender reviews was under way.", "While elements of SBA\u2019s oversight program touched on the financial risk  posed by preferred lenders, including SBLCs, based on historical  information, weaknesses in the program limited SBA\u2019s ability to focus on,  and respond to, current and future financial risk to the lenders\u2019 portfolio. In  the past, neither the lender review process nor SBA\u2019s off-site monitoring  efforts adequately focused on the financial risk posed by preferred lenders  to SBA. Previously, SBA used loan performance benchmarking and ad hoc  portfolio analysis as its primary tools for off-site monitoring. SBA officials  stated that loan performance benchmarks are based on financial risk and  serve as a measure to address a lender\u2019s potential risk to the SBA portfolio."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loan and Lender Monitoring Capability Is Necessary for SBA to Conduct Effective Portfolio and Lender Oversight", "paragraphs": ["As SBA\u2019s reliance on lenders to originate 7(a) and 504 loans has grown, so  has SBA\u2019s need for an effective method to monitor its portfolio and its  individual lenders\u2019 performances.

In April 2003, SBA contracted with Dun & Bradstreet, which  worked in conjunction with Fair Isaac, to obtain such services. In the  interim, SBA collaborated with Dun & Bradstreet to identify more specific  requirements.

Dun &  Bradstreet ranks SBA lenders each quarter based on their risk level. To do  this, Dun & Bradstreet consolidates each lender\u2019s loans and then scores, or  quantifies, the risk by calculating the projected purchase rate (i.e., the price  SBA pays a lender for a loan when a borrower defaults on the loan and SBA  determines the lender has complied with the loan program requirements)  for each loan portfolio against the total SBA dollars at risk.

At SBA, according to OLO officials, agencywide stakeholders meet  periodically to discuss overall portfolio performance trends. These  portfolio reviews, often occurring monthly, incorporate the quarterly Dun  & Bradstreet reports, and according to SBA officials, additional internal  SBA management reporting in their discussions.

Although  selected offices within the agency currently receive monthly portfolio  management reporting and analytics, including quarterly Dun & Bradstreet  reports, stakeholders agencywide do not yet routinely use Dun &  Bradstreet reports to support their mission activities. For example, the  Chief Financial Officer\u2019s (CFO) office, which is one of the offices that does  not routinely use these reports, may benefit from the data and analytic  capabilities provided by the Dun & Bradstreet service in fulfilling its budget  and financial management responsibilities. In addition, other offices might  use performance reports to better inform SBA district office staff about  specific lender activity in order to enhance their outreach efforts to both  businesses and lenders and their technical support services to businesses.  For example, performance reports could be used to monitor lending to  special groups of eligible small businesses like veterans, Native Americans,  women, and disadvantaged businesses.", "Although SBA recognizes that it needs to revise its lender review process, it  has yet to fully implement a review process that enables it to ensure that its  lending partners are complying with agency regulations and policies and  that it has found any prospective financial risks. In 2003, the agency  planned to begin conducting new strategic on-site operational reviews with  those lenders whose risk profiles indicate a high level of financial risk to  the agency. SBA reviewers intend to assess a lender\u2019s SBA origination,  servicing, and liquidation practices. These risk-based reviews should  provide the SBA with better information to both improve lender loan  management processes and SBA loan programs, as well as develop useful  information regarding lender and portfolio risk. In a related effort, the  agency performance plan has a goal to expand its safety and soundness  examinations of certain state-chartered nondepository financial entities.  SBA officials stated that there are only a small number of these entities  making 7(a) loans and that these entities are currently overseen by state  regulators. The SBA Administrator testified in February 2004 that the new  loan monitoring capability, coupled with a redesigned lender review  process, would result in a risk-based approach to oversight, providing the  agency with more meaningful information about SBA\u2019s lenders.   According to the Administrator\u2019s testimony, the approach would also be  more streamlined and efficient, allowing SBA to better deploy resources in  areas where the agency has the most exposure, while being less intrusive to  the lenders. Pilot testing of the new review process began in May 2003.", "Tables 2 and 3 compare SBA\u2019s credit risk management capability to key  elements of best practices. SBA relied solely on Dun & Bradstreet to  provide the infrastructure and methodologies consistent with best  practices. The service, which is owned and operated by Dun & Bradstreet,  provides SBA with many key best-practice elements, including a strong  management information system based on apparent sound statistical and  financial models. Although the Dun & Bradstreet service is consistent with  key elements of best practices associated with infrastructure and  methodologies, without contingency plans SBA would not have the  capability on its own to duplicate the loan monitoring service. SBA officials  shared general ideas about what they might be able to do without the Dun  & Bradstreet service, but they have no specific contingency plans.  Moreover, while SBA has incorporated selected best-practice policies, such  as a functioning internal risk rating system and more frequent and relevant  standardized risk management reporting, the agency has yet to develop a  clear credit strategy and risk profile for its credit portfolio or to define  enforcement actions against its lenders in cases of noncompliance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SBA\u2019s Mission and Loan Program Structure Would Affect Its Use of Credit Risk Management Tools", "paragraphs": ["SBA, similar to private lenders, must determine the level of risk it will  tolerate but do so within the context of the public purposes of its loan  guarantee programs, their budget constraints, and their structures.

For example, different loan products in  the 7(a) program have different levels of guarantees, and guarantees on 504  program loans have a different structure from 7(a) guarantees. These  differences influence the mix of loans in SBA\u2019s portfolio and, consequently,  would impact how SBA manages its credit risk. Accordingly, SBA may  require policies and management reporting that are different from what  lenders require. For example, while lenders manage credit risk by  determining which loans to make and the mix of loans made, SBA, as a  federal agency and advocate for small business, may not be able to manage  its risk in the same ways. SBA\u2019s exclusion of, or imposition of,  concentration limits on selected loan sectors based on risk limits could  conflict with congressional, public, or industry interpretations of its  mission obligations. Similarly, changing underwriting standards for certain  classes of loans could be difficult to implement because it would compel its  lending partners to change their underwriting criteria as needed due to  economic conditions. Additionally, SBA may permit its lenders to offer  greater forbearance (e.g., time to repay the loan) than private lenders  would in the absence of an SBA guarantee. Also, SBA could offer  assistance, such as counseling and technical help, to struggling borrowers  through its partnerships with private entities. These kinds of broad,  mission-related issues may influence the policies and business practices  governing SBA\u2019s use of the Dun & Bradstreet loan monitoring service and  related tools.", "The structures of SBA\u2019s loan guarantee programs may also account for  some of the differences in risk management policies and practices between  SBA and major lenders. This lender-level emphasis contrasts with how  major private sector lenders manage credit risk, which is at the loan level.  Because SBA relies on private lenders to originate and service the majority  of the loans it guarantees, SBA is primarily managing the credit risk in its  portfolio at the lender level. As a result, much of the agency\u2019s risk rating  processes and management reporting\u2014while conceptually similar to the  processes associated with loan-level analysis\u2014focuses on lenders, or a  lender\u2019s portfolio of loans. Here, the Dun & Bradstreet loan monitoring  service supports lender oversight functions, such as SBLC examinations.

The  service provided by Dun & Bradstreet reflects many best practices,  particularly those related to infrastructure and methodology, and can  facilitate a new level of sophistication in SBA\u2019s oversight efforts. It will  afford SBA a means to obtain various measures of financial risk posed by  its lending partners and the opportunities to analyze loans and lending  patterns efficiently and effectively. These functions are important to  managing risk and to strengthening both SBA\u2019s on-site reviews and off-site  monitoring of its lending partners\u2014functions of the Office of Lender  Oversight (OLO). In addition, the Dun & Bradstreet service, its related  tools, and its potential for developing other tools could aid SBA offices  with other responsibilities. These include certifying preferred lenders,  identifying lenders against which enforcement actions might be taken,  ensuring that its lending programs are providing credit to special groups of  eligible small businesses (veterans, disadvantaged businesses, etc.), and  estimating the cost of its loan programs. However, the potential benefits of  the service, for OLO and other offices, cannot be realized without  comprehensive policies that reflect best practices appropriate to SBA\u2019s  responsibilities to guide the use of the loan monitoring service. SBA\u2019s time  line for developing such policies stretches into 2005, more than a year and a  half after the contractor delivered the capability to SBA. Moreover, SBA  officials have not yet begun to explore the potential uses of the service for  purposes other than lender oversight and portfolio monitoring, such as  creating budget projections for its loan programs. Notably, SBA\u2019s continued  risk management capability is solely contingent on the continuation of the  Dun & Bradstreet contract.

For payments not made, Colson is immediately  notified by ACH and contacts the CDCs to collect the payments. For those  late payments, checks or money orders are sent to Colson, and it enters the  payments into its database. Colson electronically sends the payment  information each month to SBA.
