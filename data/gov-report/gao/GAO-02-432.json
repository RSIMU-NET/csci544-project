Forty-one percent of the communities were served by only one airline with size being the most obvious factor for service limitations. However, the level of service also varied by the level of local economic activity. The total number of daily departures from these small communities declined by 19 percent between October 2000 and October 2001. Although carriers had reduced total departure levels at small communities before September 11th, airlines made even more reductions after that date. Because profitability is so critical to airline decisions about what markets to serve and how to serve them, the changes in service levels in small communities can be traced to economic factors.

United Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines each reported losses of more than $1 billion. Delta Air Lines and its passengers experienced a difficult period when the pilots at its regional affiliate Comair went on strike for 89 days, grounding Comair\u2019s 815 daily flights.

To assess changes in air service over time, we compared the schedules that the airlines developed for the week of October 15\u201321, 2000, against two different schedules that the airlines developed for the week of October 15\u201321, 2001. We assessed general changes in scheduled air service by comparing the October 2000 schedules against schedules for the week of October 15\u201321, 2001, that the airlines developed before the September 11 attacks. To account more specifically for how service changed in small communities after the September 11 terrorist attacks, we compared the changes in airline schedules against a second set of schedules for the week of October 15\u201321, 2001, which the airlines developed after the September 11 attacks. We refer to the first as the \u201coriginal\u201d schedules and to the second as the \u201crevised\u201d schedules. As with our previous reports on changes in airfares and service, we analyzed various changes in service that occurred in these communities such as changes in the number of turboprop and jet departures, changes in the number of carriers providing service, and changes in the number of destinations served with nonstop flights. We recognize that airlines make frequent changes to their service schedules, and that service at these communities may have changed since mid-October, 2001. In addition, we developed an Internet-based questionnaire for managers of small airports we included in the study. This questionnaire allowed the managers to comment on the level of service they were receiving and to provide information to assess factors that might affect schedule changes.

Since the deregulation of U.S. commercial aviation in 1978, most major airlines have developed hub-and-spoke systems. For example, Northwest Airlines (Northwest) has hubs in Minneapolis, Detroit, and Memphis. United Airlines (United) has hubs in Chicago (at O\u2019Hare International Airport), Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. (at Dulles International Airport). Major airlines provide nonstop service to many \u201cspoke\u201d cities from their hubs, ranging from large cities like Portland, Oregon, to smaller communities such as Des Moines, Iowa, and Lincoln, Nebraska. Depending on the size of those markets (i.e., the number of passengers flying nonstop between the hub and the \u201cspoke\u201d community), the major airlines may operate their own large jets on those routes or use regional affiliates to provide service to other communities, usually with regional jet and turboprop aircraft.", "The airports in small \u201cspoke\u201d communities are the smallest in the nation\u2019s commercial air system.

At the opposite end of the spectrum are the nonhub airports\u2014the airports for the communities that are the focus of this study. In all, 404 airports were categorized as nonhubs in 1999. As a group, they enplaned only about 3 percent of passengers in 1999. Of those airports, we analyzed 267, which are generally the largest airports within this group.

In 2000, the median population of the 202 nonhub airport communities in our analysis was about 120,000, and the median number of daily passenger enplanements in 1999 was about 150. However, airports typically serve populations and businesses in a larger surrounding area\u2014typically referred to as a \u201ccatchment area.\u201d An airport\u2019s catchment area is the potential geographic area for drawing passengers. The geographic size of a catchment area varies from airport to airport depending on such factors as how close an airport is to other airports and whether the airport is served by a low-fare airline (and, therefore, attractive to passengers from farther away). Catchment area size estimates provided by the airport directors we surveyed showed that these airports potentially serve a total population of about 35 million (about 12 percent of the continental U.S. population).Figure 1 shows the location and catchments areas of the 202 airports in our analysis as estimated by airport directors responding to our survey and our estimates of catchment areas for those who did not respond to the survey.", "The small size of these markets greatly affects the level of service because airlines\u2019 decisions about offering service are motivated primarily by the need to maintain profitability. An airline\u2019s profitability generally depends on its ability to generate revenues in a given market while managing its costs. The airline industry is capital- and labor-intensive and is largely dependent on passenger traffic for its revenues. The airlines use sophisticated computer models to help them identify whether certain markets can be served profitably. The limited amount of passenger traffic from many of these communities limits the number of flights airlines provide. It is also not surprising that turboprops have typically provided most service to these communities, because turboprop aircraft are generally the least expensive type of aircraft to buy and operate.", "The role of size in limiting a small community\u2019s service can be seen by stratifying the small communities into population groups. As part of our analysis, we separated the 202 small communities into three groups\u2014 those smaller than 100,000, those with populations of 100,000 to 249,999, and those with populations of 250,000 and greater.

In our analysis, two such factors stood out. One of these was the level of economic activity. The airline industry is highly sensitive to the business cycle, and its economic performance is strongly correlated with fluctuations in personal disposable income and gross domestic product. When the economy is growing, the demand for air transportation grows, allowing carriers to raise yields (prices) and profitability. When the economy falls into recession, unemployment grows, individuals postpone discretionary travel, and airline yields and profitability decline. In particular, a key element to the profitability of an airline\u2019s operation in a given location is the availability of high-yield passenger traffic\u2014that is, business travelers who are more likely to pay higher airfares than leisure travelers. Communities with greater amounts of local business activity may have more (and different) air service than communities with less economic activity. Of course, the reverse may also be true\u2014that local economic activity cannot improve without enhanced air service. Thus, the presence or absence of air service may also positively or negatively affect local economic activity, rather than local economic activity dictating the amount and type of air service.", "Our analysis showed a statistically valid relationship between the economic characteristics of small communities and the amount of air service that they received. Economic principles led us to expect that passenger demand for air service would be greater in communities with more jobs and higher incomes. Our results were consistent with these expectations. Larger communities with more income and \u201cregional product\u201d had service from more major carriers and had more weekly departures. For example, for every additional 25,000 jobs in a county, a community received 4.3 more jet departures per week and 4.8 more turboprop departures per week. Similarly, for every additional $5,000 in per capita income, a community received 3.3 more jet departures per week and 12.7 more turboprop departures per week. In other words, if two small communities, A and B, were similar except that Community A had $5,000 more in income per capita than Community B, Community A would have had 16 more departures per week than Community B."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variation Is Also Related to Proximity to Larger Airports", "paragraphs": ["A third main factor that stood out as helping to explain the variation in service levels between small communities, in addition to relative size and economic activity, was the community\u2019s relative proximity to larger airports. If a small community is located within relatively close driving distance of another commercial airport, passengers may drive to the other airport, rather than fly to or from the local community airport. This tendency to lose passengers to other airports is referred to as \u201cleakage.\u201d Of the 202 small communities in our study, 94 (47 percent) are within 100 miles of an airport that is served by a low-fare airline or that serves as a hub for a major airline. Figure 3 shows circles with 100-mile radiuses around those hub or low-fare carrier airports, and thus the number of small communities that are within 100 miles of those alternative airports. As figure 3 also shows, the concentration of nonhub airports that are close to larger airports is much greater east of the Mississippi River than west of the river. Over 70 percent of the eastern small communities are within 100 miles of a hub or low-fare airport, compared with 26 percent of the western small communities.", "Our survey of small community airport officials confirmed the likely effect of being close to alternative airports. When asked whether they believed local residents drove to another airport for airline service (prior to September 11), over half of them said that they believed this occurred to a great or very great extent. Eighty-one percent of them attributed the leakage to the availability of lower fares from a major airline at the alternative airport. According to the results of our survey of airport directors, more small community airports that are closer to other larger airports experience a greater extent of passenger leakage than small community airports that are farther away from other larger airports.", "We were not able to obtain and analyze certain key data that might explain in detail why passengers might opt to use different airports rather than their local facility. In particular, we were not able to obtain information on the differences in airfares among competing airports. However, prior GAO reports indicate that fares at small community airports tend to be higher than fares at larger airports. While choosing to drive to other airports in the vicinity that offer service from other airlines may allow passengers to gain the flight options and fares they want or need\u2014a clear benefit to the individual traveler\u2014it likely affects the local community\u2019s ability to attract or retain other competitive air service.

Continental Express was the dominant carrier, providing 40 weekly flights (57 percent of the total capacity, as measured by the number of available seats on departing flights). After September 11, American Eagle discontinued its 27 weekly flights from Lake Charles to Dallas-Fort Worth. Continental Express continued to fly, offering 38 weekly flights (2 fewer) to Houston.

For one thing, the number of carriers providing service to a small community is an imperfect measure of competition. In the airline industry, competition is normally defined in terms of the number of different carriers serving the same city-pair market\u2014that is, the route between the same two cities. Most small communities that received service from two or more carriers had nonstop flights to two or more airlines\u2019 hubs. In the nonstop markets between the small community and those hubs, there was probably little direct competition initially; passengers, therefore, experienced little if any loss of competition on those routes if one of the carriers discontinued service. However, if the passenger\u2019s final destination was not an airline hub city, then different airlines may compete directly in offering connecting service to the same destination city but through their different respective hubs. In such cases, the loss of an airline\u2019s service at a small community means the loss of a competitive choice.

In the latter parts of 2000, monthly airline passenger traffic and revenue were still growing compared with the same periods in 1999. But beginning in February 2001, passenger traffic generally declined. Additionally, reflecting a drop in high-yield business traffic, total passenger revenues decreased at a steeper rate than passenger traffic, as shown in figure 6. For the U.S. airline industry as a whole, data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) indicate that airlines\u2019 net income turned negative in the second quarter of 2001. Simultaneously across the industry, airline costs were rising. Carriers began efforts to control costs, in part by reducing service. As the economy slowed down, industry analysts projected that U.S. commercial airlines would lose over $2 billion in 2001.", "The events of September 11 accelerated and aggravated negative financial trends already evident in the airline industry. In response to significant losses experienced by the carriers stemming from the temporary shutdown of the nation\u2019s airspace and the drop in passenger traffic, the president signed the Air Transportation Safety and Stabilization Act, which provided up to $4.5 billion in emergency assistance to compensate the nation\u2019s passenger air carriers for these losses.  The change in the airlines\u2019 financial condition may be attributable to both the continued deterioration of passenger revenues and the inability of airlines to cut their expenses proportionately. Figure 7 shows the significant drop in passenger traffic after September 11.

These reductions were dramatic. According to data from BTS, carriers flew 20 percent fewer departures in September 2001 than in September 2000. Different airlines approached such cost-cutting in different ways. For example, US Airways retired 111 older aircraft from its fleet, eliminating its Boeing 737-200s, MD-80s, and Fokker F-100s. Some carriers also replaced service from their large mainline jets with smaller aircraft operated by regional affiliates to better match capacity with passenger demand, as United did in some markets. In addition, United reduced the total number of departures in its system from about 2,400 before September 11 to 1,654 by October 31, in part by reducing early morning and late evening flights.

Over 80 percent of the airport managers we surveyed reported that passenger fear (that is, general apprehension related to the events of September 11, 2001) was a key factor in decreased enplanements at their airport since September 11. Airport directors also reported that passenger enplanements dropped because of air carrier service changes (e.g., fewer departures, smaller aircraft, or fewer carriers). In addition, managers indicated that basic economic conditions and post-September 11 airport security requirements reduced enplanements. Thus, the general reductions in service that occurred at small communities can be seen as reflecting airlines\u2019 overall response to these factors.", "Another way that these factors can be seen at work in small communities is in the decisions airlines made to withdraw from a community. In most cases, when an airline withdrew entirely from a community, it was a community in which the airline was competing with other airlines and had only a limited market share. More specifically, of the 36 small communities that lost a carrier between October 2000 and October 2001, there were only six instances in which the carrier that discontinued operations was the largest service provider at the community.", "The effect of these decisions to withdraw from multiple-carrier markets can be seen in one characteristic we observed in the airline schedule data we analyzed: Among the 202 communities we analyzed, service reductions tended to be greater in those communities with populations above 100,000 than in communities with populations below 100,000. This was true across several types of service indicators, such as number of carriers, total number of daily departures, and number of nonstop flights to more than one destination. Across all these indicators, communities with populations below 100,000 typically had lower levels of service than their larger counterparts both in October 2000 and October 2001, but compared with these larger communities, they lost less of that service during the 1-year period we measured. One reason may be that over half of small communities with populations less than 100,000 were served by only one airline, both in October 2000 and in October 2001.

Because small communities generate relatively little passenger traffic (especially high-fare business traffic), they tend to have more limited air service than larger communities. As a result, passengers who use these communities\u2019 airports often have less service: fewer nonstop flights to fewer destinations.", "The declines in air service at small communities in 2001 generally paralleled declines at larger airports. However, because small community airports had much more limited service initially, such decreases may subject passengers to or from those communities to significant effects. For example, when small communities lose a competitive air carrier choice, they may lose access to many destinations through one-stop connecting service. Similarly, although we were unable to analyze how airfares changed when the number of carriers serving a community changed, travelers to or from those communities that lost service from one or more carriers may be more vulnerable to noncompetitive pricing and service patterns.", "The number of communities subject to this vulnerability increased during 2001. Because of the relationship between economic activity and air service, airlines may restore some air service at small communities when local economic conditions improve.

We began by including all nonhub and small hub airports, which various statutes define as small communities. We then narrowed that definition by including only those nonhub and small hub airports included on the Air Carrier Activity Information System (ACAIS) that supports the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP) entitlement activities. The ACAIS database contains data on cargo volume and passenger enplanements submitted by air carriers to the Department of Transportation (DOT).", "The ACAIS database categorizes airports by the number of annual enplanements. According to a DOT official, there are three categories:   Primary: Public airports with scheduled, commercial air service with at least 10,000 annual enplanements. These airports are eligible for a minimum entitlement AIP funding of between $650,000 and $1 million.", "Nonprimary: Public airports with scheduled, commercial air service with annual enplanements between 2,500 and 9,999.

From this list, we eliminated airports that were located in territories, those at which commercial service was subsidized through DOT\u2019s Essential Air Service (EAS) program as of July, 2001,those for which our data indicated that carriers had scheduled no service at any time between June 2001 and July 2002, and those nonhub airports that were located in metropolitan areas with populations of one million or greater (e.g., Meigs Field in Chicago). We eliminated the latter group of airports because travelers in those metropolitan areas are not limited to air service from the small airport; rather, they have a choice of other larger airports in the immediate area.", "We then compared various aspects of air service at the nonhub and small hub airports to see if there was a significant difference between the two. Based on that analysis and agreement with the requesters\u2019 staffs, we defined small communities as those served by nonhub airports that met the above-mentioned conditions. Table 4 summarizes the number of nonhub airports affected by each of these filters.", "As part of our analysis, we also grouped the nonhub airports based on the size of the surrounding areas\u2019 populations. Because many of these airports are within metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), we used those population totals. If an airport was not located within an MSA, we used the county population.", "To determine what overall level of service airlines provided at the nation\u2019s small communities in 2000, we examined air service schedules published by the airlines for the week of October 15\u201321, 2000. As with our previous reports on changes in air fares and service, the types of service we focused our analysis on were: the number of carriers serving the airport, if the airport was dominated by a single carrier, the number of nonstop destinations served out of the airport, the number of hubs served out of the airport, the number of turboprop and jet departures per week out of the airport, and the types of aircraft serving the airport. We determined these air service dimensions using airline flight schedule information submitted by all U.S. airlines that we purchased from the Kiehl Hendrickson Group, an aviation consulting firm. We did not independently assess the reliability of the Kiehl Hendrickson Group\u2019s data, which it purchases from another vendor, Innovata, LLC. According to the Kiehl Hendrickson Group, Innovata employs numerous proprietary quality assurance edit checks to ensure data integrity.", "To determine factors associated with those service levels, we reviewed available literature on air service and local economic development, and we interviewed industry officials, consultants, academic experts, and airport officials. Based on that information, we identified a number of factors that relate air service levels with various aspects of small communities. Among the elements identified were the population of those small communities and the proximity of small community airports to other larger airports, many of which served either as a hub for a major airline or which was served by a low-fare carrier.  We obtained community population data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. In addition, we asked the airport directors at the small community airports to estimate the size of their airport\u2019s \u201ccatchment area.\u201d An airport\u2019s catchment area is the geographic area from which it draws passengers. For those who did not respond to the survey, we estimated the size of their catchment areas based on the average size of the catchment area for other small community airports in the same geographic region. We then calculated the total population living within the catchment areas using 2000 census tract population data. For each small community airport, we also identified the nearest major airline hub facility and nearest airport served by a low-fare carrier and determined the distance between those airports to the small community airport. We statistically analyzed the extent to which some of the identified factors contributed to overall service levels. That analysis is described in greater detail in appendix V.", "To determine how air service has changed at small communities over time, we analyzed changes in scheduled air service for different time periods. We used our analysis of air service for the week of October 15\u201321, 2000 as a baseline for comparison. To minimize the possible effects of seasonality in air service, we then examined air service schedules for the week of October 15\u201321, 2001. To identify the service changes at small community airports that might be separately attributable to the 2001 economic downturn and the September 11 terrorist attacks, we examined two different sets of airline schedule data for October 15\u201321, 2001: those that airlines had published prior to September 11, 2001, and those published by the airlines following September 11, 2001. The first October 2001 schedule dataset reflected the schedule as of August 30, 2001, and is, therefore, not reflective of the airline industry\u2019s reaction to the events of September 11. The second schedule dataset for October 15\u201321 reflected the schedule as of October 12, 2001. Finally, to determine if airlines continued to make substantial changes to their scheduled service, we also analyzed their schedules for the week of November 1-7, 2001. We recognize that airlines make frequent changes to their service schedules, and that service at these communities may have changed since then. We analyzed the same service elements as for the week of October 15\u201321, 2000.", "To determine factors associated with the changes in service at small community airports, we surveyed airport directors at nonhub and small hub airports.
