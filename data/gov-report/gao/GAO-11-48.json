The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) authorized the program's first round (NSP 1), providing $3.92 billion in grant funds to states and local governments. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers the program. HERA mandated that GAO report on whether grantees were using NSP 1 funds in accordance with the act's criteria. For this mandate, GAO examined (1) grantees' progress and challenges in meeting NSP 1 obligation and income-targeting requirements, (2) HUD's actions to mitigate program risks and ensure grantees' compliance with key NSP 1 requirements, and (3) HUD's efforts to collect program data and assess program performance. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed HUD data and the information system used for NSP 1; interviewed HUD officials and representatives of NSP 1 grantees; analyzed HUD's internal control processes; and conducted limited tests of 8 grantees' compliance with key NSP 1 requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to HUD data, the vast majority of the 309 NSP 1 grantees obligated their funds within the required 18-month time frame. As a result, over 99 percent of NSP 1 funds were obligated as of early October 2010. Also, consistent with HERA criteria, most grantees obligated at least 25 percent of their funds for housing for low-income households. Some grantees with whom GAO spoke modified their NSP 1 strategies to meet obligation deadlines and overcome other challenges such as competition from private investors in acquiring foreclosed and abandoned homes. For instance, with HUD approval, some grantees expanded the geographic areas they were targeting. Grantees also participated in banks' \"first look\" programs, which give grantees the chance to bid on bank-owned properties before other potential buyers. HUD provided training, guidance, and technical assistance to grantees to address new requirements and risks posed by NSP 1. Although the grantees GAO spoke with were generally satisfied with HUD's guidance and program support, some said these efforts would have been more useful if provided earlier. HUD officials said that some of the assistance grantees found useful was delivered using funds that HUD received well after the start of NSP 1. HUD also established various internal control processes for NSP 1 and hired additional staff to help oversee the program. HUD field office staff conducted remote monitoring of all grantees and on-site monitoring for 176 grantees that HUD considered to be higher risk. Although HUD is still aggregating the results of its on-site monitoring, available results from the four field offices GAO contacted generally showed compliance with key NSP 1 requirements but also found some financial management deficiencies. HUD is requiring grantees to take corrective actions, where appropriate. GAO's review of records for 32 properties at 8 grantees found no instances of significant noncompliance with key NSP 1 requirements. To collect information on NSP 1, HUD adapted an existing financial and information system--the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system--and provided training and guidance on its use. HUD has used the system to monitor NSP 1 grantees' obligations and summarize program outputs for specific types of activities (rehabilitation and construction, demolition, and homeownership assistance). However, variation in the way grantees entered information into DRGR makes it difficult to summarize outputs for each activity (e.g., housing units acquired) without undercounting, and overall outputs (e.g., total benefiting households) without overcounting. HUD has developed a method for addressing the overcounting problem, but insufficient guidance to grantees and HUD field staff may be contributing to variation in data entry that limits the usefulness of DRGR output information. For example, HUD has not provided grantees with specific written guidance on selecting output measures, which can lead to inconsistency among grantees. HUD is planning an assessment of NSP outcomes that will focus primarily on the program's second round (NSP 2) but will also include NSP 1 in geographic areas where the two phases of the program overlap."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HUD provide additional guidance to NSP grantees and HUD field staff to help ensure that information on output measures is collected in HUD's data system in a more consistent manner.

Such  properties can destabilize neighborhoods by lowering the value of  surrounding homes and attracting crime. They also can impose costs on  communities, for example by reducing property tax revenue and straining  the resources of local police and code enforcement offices. To address  these issues, Congress created the Neighborhood Stabilization Program  (NSP), which provides grants to states and local governments to help  reduce the number of foreclosed and abandoned properties and restore  depressed local housing markets. The first phase of this program, NSP 1,  was authorized by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008  (HERA), which provided $3.92 billion in grant funds. The program is  administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) through its existing Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)  program. In October 2008, HUD allocated NSP 1 funds to 309 CDBG  grantees, including all 50 states. Under NSP 1, state grantees may use  funds directly or reallocate them to local governments within their states.", "HERA defines a variety of \u201celigible uses\u201d of NSP 1 funds to allow grantees  to address issues associated with foreclosed and abandoned properties.  For example, grantees may choose to acquire and rehabilitate properties  for rental or resale, or demolish blighted structures. HERA also imposed  several key requirements governing the use of NSP 1 funds. For example,  grantees must use the funds in \u201careas of greatest need\u201d within 18 months  of receiving them from HUD; for this requirement, HUD interpreted \u201cuse\u201d  to mean obligate. In addition, HERA required that all NSP 1 funds benefit  households with incomes at or below 120 percent of area median income  (AMI), and at least 25 percent of the funds benefit households with  incomes at or below 50 percent of AMI; for the 25 percent requirement,  HUD interpreted \u201cuse\u201d to mean expended.", "HERA mandated that GAO conduct periodic audits of whether NSP 1  funds are being used in a manner consistent with criteria set forth in  HERA.

We also assessed the reliability of the DRGR information we used by  conducting reasonableness checks to identify any missing or erroneous  data and by interviewing knowledgeable HUD officials to ensure we  interpreted the data correctly. For the purpose of this and the first  objective, we concluded that the data we used were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes.

We interviewed a group of 11 grantees selected to  represent different housing markets, grant amounts, and grantee types to  discuss their approaches for using NSP 1 funds, progress they had made,  and challenges they faced in implementing the program. We conducted  site visits at another group of 8 grantees selected to represent a variety of  completed NSP 1 activities, types of grantees, and geographic areas. To  avoid overburdening grantees, we focused our site visits on grantees that,  on the basis of information from HUD, were not receiving extensive  technical assistance or being monitored on-site by HUD staff. At these  sites, we interviewed grantee staff to obtain information on their  processes for complying with NSP 1 requirements and internal control  procedures, and reviewed property-level records of completed NSP 1  activities.

Land banks often  acquire properties through tax foreclosures, intergovernmental transfers,  nonprofit transfers, and open-market purchases but can also acquire them  through foreclosure.", "In addition to these five eligible uses, HERA outlined the following key  requirements for using NSP 1 funds, as follows:  1.  All NSP 1 funds must be used within areas of greatest need as  determined by grantees on the basis of the following factors:   percentage of homes financed by subprime loans, and  likelihood of a significant rise in the rate of foreclosures. 2.  All NSP 1 funds must be used to benefit households with incomes at or  below 120 percent of AMI. 3.  At least 25 percent of NSP 1 funds must benefit households with  incomes at or below 50 percent of AMI.  4.  The sale, rental, or redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes  must remain affordable to the above income groups for the longest  feasible term.  5.

If a property is sold to an individual as a primary residence, the sale  price cannot be more than the total acquisition and redevelopment  costs.", "In October 2008, HUD issued guidance on implementing NSP 1 in a Notice  in the Federal Register. With respect to the requirement that NSP 1 funds  be used within 18 months, HUD stated, \u201cfunds are used when they are  obligated by a state, unit of general local government, or any subrecipient  thereof for a specific NSP activity; for example the acquisition of a specific  property.\u201d According to the Notice, funds are considered to be obligated  for an activity when orders are placed, contracts are awarded, and goods  and services are received. HUD specified that funds are not obligated for  an activity when subawards (for example, grants to subrecipients or units  of local government) are made. The Notice also stated that grantees must  expend their NSP 1 funds within 4 years of receipt. In accordance with  HERA, HUD established a required discount rate that would apply to any  property acquired through NSP 1. Initially, HUD set the discount at 15  percent for grantees\u2019 total acquisition portfolios but subsequently reduced  it to 1 percent per property acquired. HUD reduced the required discount  to provide grantees with more flexibility in acquiring foreclosed properties  and to avoid the potentially adverse impact of discounts on neighborhood  property values. Among other provisions, HUD required that each NSP- assisted homebuyer complete at least 8 hours of homebuyer counseling.", "HUD also required that NSP 1 grantees submit \u201cNSP 1 action plans\u201d in the  form of substantial amendments to their existing CPD consolidated plan.  HUD required grantees to identify in these plans areas of greatest need  within their states or communities, approaches for implementing NSP 1  and expected program outputs, and plans for complying with key  requirements. After grantees submitted these plans and HUD approved  them, HUD executed grant agreements for NSP 1.", "NSP 1 implementation has a tight time frame (see fig. 1). For instance,  HUD had to establish its formula for allocating funds 60 days after the  enactment of HERA. As HERA linked NSP 1 to CDBG, HUD was able to  take advantage of the administrative infrastructure of one of the federal  government\u2019s largest and most flexible community and economic  development programs. Established in 1974, CDBG provides states and  local entitlement communities\u2014eligible metropolitan cities and  counties\u2014with funding to address locally determined community and  economic development priorities.

CPD\u2019s monitoring of the  CDBG program focuses on high-risk recipients. Each year, CPD sets a  formal monitoring goal. For fiscal year 2010, the overall goal for CPD and  each of its field offices was to monitor a minimum of 870 formula and  competitive grant recipients. For each CPD program, field staff analyze  potential risks for grantees in a number of areas, including: financial (size  of grant, financial compliance), physical (physical control of assets),  management (staff capacity), satisfaction (citizen complaints and grantee  responsiveness), and services (meeting program objectives and progress).", "HUD modified the DRGR system for the purposes of collecting and  maintaining information on NSP activities. DRGR is new to NSP 1 grantees  and HUD field staff unless they had prior experience with Disaster  Recovery Assistance grants, another program managed by CPD. In its  NSP 1 Notice, HUD explained that no other reporting system was as  flexible as DRGR and that statutory time frames did not allow sufficient  time to develop a new system or modify an existing one to perfectly fit  NSP. HUD\u2019s key modifications to DRGR included:    adding data fields to collect information specific to NSP, such as land  removing drop-down menu selections for ineligible uses under NSP; and   adaptations to enable grantees to designate whether properties had been  resold or rented or were single- or multifamily.", "DRGR was set up to monitor grantees\u2019 progress in implementing NSP 1 by  tracking budgets, obligations, expenditures, and program outputs. DRGR  also serves as a financial management system through which grantees  obligate and draw down funds. At the beginning of NSP 1, grantees  inputted their NSP 1 action plans into DRGR. In their actions plans in  DRGR, grantees set up their budgets and performance measures for  different DRGR activities that were linked to larger projects. The action  plan serves as a template for required progress reports, or Quarterly  Performance Reports (QPR), that grantees must submit to HUD field staff  on a quarterly basis. QPRs show updated information on NSP 1 progress  for grantees\u2019 projects and activities listed in DRGR.", "For each DRGR activity, NSP 1 grantees complete data fields that include  (1) the projected start date, (2) the national objective (the income group  the activity benefits), (3) the responsible organization (either the grantee  or a subrecipient), and (4) the activity type (e.g., acquisition,  rehabilitation, demolition). For each DRGR activity, grantees must also  include a narrative and output measures\u2014for example, the number of  housing units or properties acquired, rehabilitated, land banked, or  demolished, or the numbers of households or persons benefiting from the  activity. In addition, grantees must list the addresses of properties  benefiting from the activity but are not required to include the amount of  funds spent on each property in DRGR. In a June 2009 report, the HUD  OIG concluded that DRGR was sufficient to collect the basic information  that HUD needed to monitor NSP 1. In a September 2009 report, the HUD  OIG reviewed selected controls within DRGR in order to examine whether  funds were properly safeguarded.

In order  to obligate their funds, grantees had to satisfy certain conditions, including  providing a specific property address and (where applicable) a detailed  scope of work for rehabilitating, constructing, or demolishing a property.  According to HUD guidance, grantees are considered to have obligated  NSP 1 funds once they have placed orders, awarded contracts, received  goods and services, or executed similar transactions that will require  payment by the grantee. For example, funds for acquiring a property are  considered obligated when the property seller accepts the grantee\u2019s  purchase offer.", "Data in DRGR indicate that the vast majority of the 309 NSP 1 grantees  met their deadline for obligating funds. As a result, more than 99 percent  of NSP 1 funds were obligated as of October 1, 2010.

These figures are  preliminary because HUD (1) gave grantees 30 days after their deadlines to  ensure that all obligations prior to the deadline were recorded in DRGR  and (2) is in the process of reviewing whether grantees\u2019 obligated their  NSP 1 funds properly. CPD staff told us that 1 business day after a  grantee\u2019s obligation deadline passes, they are blocking the grantee\u2019s access  to funds and reviewing samples of obligations to ensure they are proper.  As of the end of September, HUD officials told us that field office staff had  reviewed samples for 20 grantees and found no improper obligations. They  plan to review all grantees for compliance with obligation guidance.  Additionally, the OIG is reviewing obligations as part of its compliance  audits of selected NSP 1 grantees. In August 2010, HUD outlined a  process for addressing a grantee\u2019s failure to meet its obligation deadline  and anticipated that many such grantees would face a choice of entering  into an agreement with HUD to use the remaining funds or having their  funds recaptured.", "Figure 4 shows the percentage of grantee obligations that fell under  different NSP 1 activities as of October 1, 2010. NSP 1 grantees obligated  most NSP 1 funds for acquisition and rehabilitation, with smaller amounts  obligated for other activities such as construction of new housing,  demolition, and land banking. \u201cHomeownership assistance\u201d includes various types of homeownership assistance such as down- payment assistance and housing counseling for those applying for down-payment assistance.", "Due to rounding, the percentages in the graphic add up to a total of 101 percent.

States could choose to use funds themselves through state- administered programs or could reallocate funds to local entitlement or  nonentitlement communities within their areas of greatest need. In their  HUD-approved action plans, states had to identify areas of greatest need  using factors that included the following:    percentage of homes financed by subprime loans, and  likelihood of a significant rise in foreclosure rates.", "Our review of NSP 1 action plans for all states (including the District of  Columbia) found that all of the states included these factors among their  criteria for determining their areas of greatest need. Some states also used  factors not listed in HERA in determining their areas of greatest need,  such as unemployment rates or percentages of the population at or below  50 percent of AMI. In their action plans, states had to outline their  methods for reallocating NSP 1 funds or for using the funds themselves to  make the most impact within the areas of greatest need within their state.  HERA also allowed states to allocate their funds to local entitlement  communities that may have already received NSP 1 funds directly from  HUD, as well as to nonentitlement communities. According to HUD data  as of June 2010, of the total NSP 1 funds that HUD allocated to the states,  states reallocated approximately 9 percent, or $176 million, to 57 local  governments in 21 different states that had already received NSP 1 funds  directly from HUD (see fig. 5).", "Once states determined the areas of greatest need, many of them used  competitions to award NSP funds for specific purposes. For example, one  state used a competition for the acquisition and rehabilitation of  multifamily properties, and another state used a competition specifically  to help it meet NSP 1\u2019s 25 percent set-aside requirement to benefit  households with incomes at or below 50 percent of AMI. Eligible  applicants\u2014nonprofits, for-profit developers, and local governments,  among others\u2014often varied by state and by the type of competition. While  some states invited nonprofits and for-profit developers to compete for  funds directly, other states allowed only local jurisdictions to apply or  required nonprofits to get buy-in from their local governments in order to  receive funds.", "Our review of NSP 1 action plans found that states distributed funds using  three main methods: (1) reallocation through competitions, (2)  reallocation on the basis of formulas, and (3) through state-administered  programs. Many state grantees used a combination of methods to  distribute funds, while a smaller number relied on a single method. More  specifically, our review found that 14 states distributed all of their NSP 1  funds by reallocating them on a competitive basis, 7 states used a formula  to reallocate all of their funds, and 1 state used all of the funds itself by  administering the program through its housing finance agency and by  contracting with other entities. In contrast, 26 states used a combination  of two or more of the methods. For example, a number of states with  some of the largest NSP 1 grants, including California and Ohio, used a  formula to allocate funds to areas of greatest need within the state and  then held a competition for the 25 percent set-aside to benefit households  with incomes at or below 50 percent of AMI. Six states utilized all three  distribution methods\u2014competition, formula, and use of funds\u2014through  state-administered programs. A number of states decided to administer  some of their NSP 1 funds themselves through state-administered  programs; for example, 1 state created a new statewide soft second loan  financing program (Arizona) and another state channeled some of its NSP  1 funds into the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program and the  Permanent Supportive Housing Program (Georgia).", "Many states that used competitions to distribute NSP funds used similar  criteria to rank applicants and award funds. For example, on the basis of  our review of their action plans, many states considered applicants\u2019  capacity to carry out projects and project readiness, as well as whether  applicants\u2019 proposals focused on projects that would serve the areas of  greatest need within the state. Other frequently used competitive factors  included applicants\u2019 experience administering NSP-related activities and  ability to leverage other funding sources. A few states ranked applicants  based on green building activities or gave priority to applicants that  proposed projects that would help meet the 25 percent set-aside  requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grantees Employed Various Strategies for Using NSP 1 Funds", "paragraphs": ["NSP 1 grantees with whom we spoke employed various different strategies  for obligating and expending funds for NSP-eligible activities.

An example of a homebuyer-driven  strategy would be one in which a grantee provided homebuyers with  financial assistance\u2014down-payment assistance, closing costs,  rehabilitation costs, or soft second loans\u2014to enable them to acquire a  home within an NSP 1 target area. Another approach grantees used was a  more property-driven strategy in which grantees or their subrecipients\u2014 such as housing authorities, nonprofits, or for-profit developers\u2014directly  acquired, rehabilitated, and resold or rented NSP properties to individuals  or families meeting NSP-specific income requirements. Finally, in some  cases, grantees\u2019 strategies included demolishing blighted structures and  land banking the parcels on which the demolished properties stood for  e demolished properties stood for  future use.  future use.", "NSP 1 grantees we spoke with used different NSP strategies depending on  the particular housing market conditions in their target areas. For  example, one grantee we contacted used a homebuyer-driven strategy in  areas where the generally good condition of the properties could attract  potential purchasers. Under that strategy, qualified homebuyers looked for  properties in NSP 1 target areas and chose NSP-eligible homes that did not  require a lot of rehabilitation. The grantee then conducted the required  due diligence on the home, including having it appraised and inspected,  and completing environmental reviews. After the due diligence had been  completed, the grantee assisted buyers with the acquisition of a property  (at the required discount) and provided some funding for down-payment  assistance and closing costs. The same grantee implemented a more  property-driven strategy in target areas where homes required a higher  level of rehabilitation\u2014a potential deterrent for some homebuyers. Under  this strategy, the grantee worked with nonprofit developers to acquire and  rehabilitate the homes, then resold the homes to NSP-eligible buyers.  Another grantee with whom we spoke used NSP 1 funds for demolition  projects and the removal of blight to help stabilize its communities. Some  of the land on which the demolished properties were located will be land  banked for future use. This strategy made the most sense for this  particular grantee as it did not have a strong housing market for sale or  rental.", "In order to meet the 25 percent set-aside requirement to benefit  households with incomes at or below 50 percent of AMI, most of the  grantees we spoke with employed similar strategies. Several of the  grantees we spoke with planned to acquire, rehabilitate, and rent out  multifamily properties to meet this requirement.

One grantee  said both in-state and out-of-state investors have seized the opportunity to  acquire NSP-eligible properties at low prices, and another grantee  provided an example where a group of investors acquired about 90  properties at one time. One grantee official expressed concern that  investors looking to rent out properties may not be responsible landlords,  which could undermine efforts to stabilize neighborhoods. Finally, private  investors sometimes outbid grantees for NSP-eligible properties, and  because investors may pay with cash and do not have to meet the same  due diligence requirements as NSP 1 grantees, they are able to act more  quickly and have more success acquiring properties.", "Furthermore, a few of the grantees we spoke with that planned to rent out  multifamily properties said they faced challenges meeting the 25 percent  set-aside obligation requirement. Officials from two grantees told us it was  difficult to find foreclosed multifamily rental projects to purchase in NSP 1  target areas. Additionally, one grantee told us that they were facing  neighborhood opposition to a multifamily project because neighbors  feared that affordable housing units would depress home values in the  area.", "A broader study of NSP grantees sponsored by the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System and two Federal Reserve banks cited  challenges similar to those that we identified. For example, the study  highlights competition from private-sector investors, grantees\u2019 difficulties  identifying a potential pool of foreclosed properties to acquire, and the  reluctance of some property holders to work with grantees. The study also  noted that local requirements and practices, such as stringent local  standards for publicly financed rehabilitation, often put NSP grantees at a  competitive disadvantage to investors.", "In order to overcome implementation challenges such as meeting  deadlines or competition from investors, some grantees we spoke with  modified their implementation strategies by    moving away from homebuyer-driven models to directly acquiring    working with banks\u2019 \u201cfirst look programs,\u201d and    working with the National Community Stabilization Trust (NCST).", "To overcome implementation challenges, some grantees had to make  changes to their original program strategies. For example, several grantees  we contacted said it would be difficult to meet the obligation deadline  using their homebuyer-driven strategies. Competition from private  investors and tight obligation time frames required some grantees to move  funds from their homebuyer-driven models towards supporting more  property-driven strategies where they purchased and rehabilitated homes  themselves. Using a more direct strategy allowed some grantees to speed  up the pace of obligations. In addition, one grantee shifted its focus from  homebuyers to renters in order to help it meet the deadline for obligating  funds, as potential homebuyers in its housing market were finding it  difficult to obtain mortgages due to job loss and poor credit.", "Some NSP 1 grantees also expanded their target areas to expedite  property acquisition. With HUD approval, some NSP grantees expanded  their target areas to include more ZIP codes or census tracts in order to  expedite acquisitions and circumvent investor competition. Several  grantees also worked with banks\u2019 \u201cfirst look\u201d programs, which gave them  the opportunity to bid on bank-owned foreclosed properties before other  potential buyers. Grantees also worked with NCST, a national nonprofit  organization to acquire foreclosed properties in their target areas. NCST  facilitates communication between NSP grantees and banks and provides  grantees with listings of NSP-eligible properties from which to choose.  Many grantees with whom we spoke found NCST to be very helpful in  acquiring properties, and one grantee we contacted said working with  NCST helped it acquire 80 percent of the homes on which it had placed  bids. In an effort to standardize the acquisition process for NSP grantees,  HUD recently partnered with NCST to create the \u201cNational First Look  Program\u201d in September 2010. The program gives communities  participating in NSP a \u201cfirst look\u201d or right of first refusal to purchase  foreclosed homes before the properties are made available to private  investors. According to HUD officials, the program grew out of an  initiative HUD announced in July 2010, which gave NSP-eligible  purchasers the opportunity to acquire foreclosed properties owned by  HUD\u2019s Federal Housing Administration at 10 percent below the appraised  value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Taken Actions to Mitigate NSP 1 Program Risks through Training, Technical Assistance, and the Establishment of Internal Controls", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, HERA established specific program requirements for  NSP 1 beyond those for CDBG, including an accelerated timeline for  obligating funds and the requirement that grantees must use 25 percent of  their NSP 1 funds to benefit households at or below 50 percent AMI.  Additionally, HERA required that NSP 1 grantees ensure, among other  things, that properties are acquired at a discount and properties sold to  individuals as a primary residence cannot be resold for more than the total  cost of acquisition and redevelopment.", "At the start of NSP 1, HUD conducted a front-end risk assessment (FERA)  to assess NSP 1 program risks and identify actions required to reduce  control risks to an acceptable level. Among other risks, HUD\u2019s review  noted that the scale of the effort could overwhelm some grantees; meeting  the requirement to obligate funds within an 18-month time frame could be  challenging for grantees, especially those with limited real estate  experience; and HUD\u2019s personnel resources were not adequate to oversee  the program. The FERA concluded that implementing NSP 1 successfully  and within required time frames would require early and regular  deployment of controls, including training, technical assistance, and  monitoring.

Most of the grantees that we  interviewed said that the combination of HUD\u2019s guidance and training was  helpful but some grantees had raised some concerns. Several grantees that  we spoke with about 1 year after the program began said that the guidance  and training they received was not always timely. For example, one  grantee said that the information it received at an NSP problem-solving  clinic in early 2010 would have been more useful had it been provided 6  months earlier. Additionally, two grantees said they did not always get  timely answers to questions about program rules when the field office staff  they asked had to obtain clarification from HUD headquarters. HUD  officials said that some of the assistance grantees found useful was  delivered using funds that HUD received well after the start of NSP 1.", "HUD modified NSP policy in two key respects to address challenges faced  by grantees in implementing the program. Grantees we spoke with said  that the first of these modifications helped them overcome difficulties they  were experiencing in acquiring properties. More specifically, in June 2009,  HUD reduced the required discount from the appraised value at which  grantees must purchase NSP-eligible properties. HUD reduced the  discount from a minimum of 5 percent for individual acquisitions to a  minimum of 1 percent, and eliminated the 15 percent discount for  aggregate acquisitions. This change was intended to mitigate the  potentially adverse impact that the larger discounts could have on  neighborhood property values and the inability or unwillingness of the  holders of foreclosed properties to sell at prices that reflect the higher  discount.", "NSP 1 grantees had mixed views about the effect of the other program  modification, implemented in April 2010, which expanded the definitions  of foreclosed and abandoned properties. As a result of the program  modification, properties no longer had to have completed the foreclosure  process to be purchased with NSP funds, and the standards for what  constituted an abandoned property eligible for NSP were loosened\u2014for  example, to include tenant-occupied properties. HUD made these  changes in response to suggestions from local communities to increase the  reach of NSP by allowing more properties to qualify. HUD headquarters  staff said this change also enabled some NSP 1 grantees to increase the  pace of their acquisitions and meet their obligation deadlines. They added  that, on the basis of comments from grantees, the expanded definitions  had helped grantees acquire multifamily properties but had not yet been  used to acquire single-family homes. Similarly, some CPD field staff said  the expanded definitions helped grantees that were facing challenges in  meeting the obligation deadline by increasing the number of eligible  properties they could acquire. Specifically, field staff reported that it  helped some of their grantees to fulfill the 25 percent set-aside  requirement by easing restrictions on acquiring multifamily properties,  which many grantees we spoke with intend to rent to low-income  households. Several grantees we spoke with expressed similar views,  noting that the new definitions helped them acquire multifamily  properties. However, others indicated that the broader definitions would  not make a significant impact at this stage in their NSP 1 efforts because  they had made many of their acquisitions prior to the definition changes or  had a large inventory of fully foreclosed homes available.

In terms of program design, HUD staff said that some  grantees had selected unsuitable NSP 1 approaches for their local housing  markets. For example, some grantees had planned to implement strategies  for selling homes or increasing home ownership in what were primarily  rental markets. In another example, one grantee was initially not planning  to use NSP 1 funds for demolition, even though, according to HUD staff,  demolition was an appropriate use of NSP 1 funds given the grantee\u2019s local  housing market conditions.

HUD adapted a range of internal control processes already  in place for the CDBG program to ensure compliance with program  requirements and mitigate the risks posed by NSP 1 (see fig. 7). Before  releasing grantees\u2019 NSP 1 funds, HUD required all grantees to submit a  substantial amendment (or \u201cNSP 1 action plan\u201d) to their CPD consolidated  and annual action plans by December 2008 to describe how they would  use NSP 1 funds. As noted earlier, NSP 1 action plans identify areas of  greatest need, establish expected program outputs, set forth plans for  complying with key requirements, and define relevant NSP 1 terms (such  as blighted structures, housing rehabilitation standards, and affordable  rents). HUD reviewed NSP 1 action plans to determine if grantees\u2019 planned  uses of funds were in accordance with key HERA requirements. After  approving the action plans, HUD signed the grant agreements (most were  signed in March 2009, according to HUD officials, resulting in 18-month  obligation periods ending in September 2010).", "Also prior to releasing NSP 1 funds, HUD implemented additional controls  for grantees at higher risk of noncompliance with program requirements.  For example, in the initial stage of the program, HUD designated 104  grantees as high risk because their NSP 1 grants were at least three times  greater than their annual CDBG allocations or they had audit findings or  other performance problems in similar HUD grant programs. HUD added a  \u201cspecial condition\u201d to the NSP 1 agreements of these high-risk grantees  that required them to submit management plans along with their NSP 1  action plans.

Field staff used an action plan checklist to verify that grantees had  identified eligible NSP 1 uses, responsible organizations, and income- based national objectives associated with activities in DRGR.

As under the CDBG program\u2014-which was designed to  give grantees substantial flexibility\u2014-HUD officials said they permit NSP 1  grantees to group activities in different ways. For example, HUD officials  told us they instructed grantees to enter information for property  acquisitions under a rehabilitation activity if the acquisition and  rehabilitation are to be carried out by the same responsible organization  and are to be rehabilitated within a short time frame. Accordingly, our  review of DRGR information for 18 grantees identified a number of  variations, including: (1) one activity (classified as \u201crehabilitation\u201d)  covering both the acquisition and rehabilitation of housing units; (2) two  activities (one classified as \u201cacquisition\u201d and the other as \u201crehabilitation\u201d)  for acquiring and rehabilitating units; and (3) one activity (classified as  \u201cacquisition for land banking\u201d) for acquiring, demolishing, and land- banking housing units. Due to these variations, totaling outputs for  individual activity types can result in undercounting program outputs  (because grantees that combine two or more activities report the  associated outputs under a single activity type) and totaling outputs across  multiple activity types can result in double counting program outputs  (because grantees that do not combine activities may report the same  outputs under multiple activity types).", "HUD officials said that the variation did not affect their ability to monitor  grantees\u2019 compliance with program requirements but acknowledged that it  complicated analysis of program outputs. HUD officials said they were in  the process of identifying duplicate property addresses in DRGR, which  will allow them to report total numbers of NSP 1 housing units and  benefiting households without double counting these outputs.  Undercounting is likely primarily an issue with the acquisition activity  type, because, as previously noted, HUD allows grantees to combine  acquisition and rehabilitation under a rehabilitation activity in some  circumstances. Additionally, HUD officials said they were more focused  on reporting outputs for \u201cend uses\u201d of NSP 1 funds, such as the number of  housing units rehabilitated and demolished and the number of benefiting  households.", "However, we found that grantees did not always group acquisition and  rehabilitation under a rehabilitation activity. For instance, contrary to  HUD\u2019s instructions, we identified several instances in which grantees  combined acquisition and rehabilitation under an acquisition activity. HUD  officials indicated they had found similar cases in their reviews of DRGR  information. As a result, totaling output data for rehabilitation activities  may understate actual outputs. HUD training and its QPR review checklist  developed for CPD field staff responsible for reviewing activity data in  DRGR do not adequately address this issue. In particular, the checklist  that field staff use to review grantees\u2019 QPRs does not require field staff to  determine whether grantees grouped activities in accordance with HUD  guidance. As a result, HUD staff may not be detecting errors in how  grantees are classifying activities, which can negatively affect the accuracy  and reliability of NSP 1 output data and therefore the usefulness of these  data for monitoring program progress and results.", "We also found variation in how grantees selected output measures for  different activity types. For example, one grantee selected \u201cnumber of  properties\u201d as its sole output measure for the majority of its activities  (including acquisition and rehabilitation) and did not select numbers of  households benefiting, which HUD told us it considers the program\u2019s  primary output measure.

They said the assessment will  track conditions and trends in NSP-assisted neighborhoods in relation to  the short- and long-term outcome measures. They also will attempt to  identify suitable comparison areas (e.g., similar areas that did not receive  assistance) to demonstrate the impact of NSP, but expect this to be more  challenging. Additionally, PD&R staff noted that DRGR was structured to  track spending by DRGR activity rather than by property, making it  difficult to determine the amount of NSP 1 funds that were spent in a  particular geographic area. PD&R staff plan to obtain and review  additional records from NSP 2 grantees to determine the amount of funds  spent on NSP 2 properties and may collect similar information for NSP 1  properties in areas served by both rounds of the program. HUD is  anticipating that the assessment will be completed no earlier than January  2014.

HUD took actions to help grantees meet these  challenges though guidance, training, and technical assistance.  Additionally, HUD established internal control procedures to mitigate  risks and promote compliance with program requirements. Our work  suggests that these efforts helped grantees obligate funds in a timely  manner, adopt strategies appropriate to their communities, and follow  program rules. Nevertheless, because many NSP 1 activities have not been  completed, continued HUD oversight will be required to ensure that any  implementation and compliance problems are identified and addressed in  an effective manner. In particular, HUD will need to follow through on its  efforts to ensure that grantees are taking corrective actions on findings  from on-site monitoring visits.", "As NSP 1 and other rounds of NSP progress, assessing program outputs  and outcomes will become increasingly important. HUD took a number of  important steps to collect key program data in DRGR, including  information on grantees\u2019 activities and performance measures. However,  variation in how grantees entered this information make it difficult to  accurately summarize program outputs without undercounting (in the  case of activity-specific outputs) or overcounting (in the case of program- wide outputs). While HUD has developed a method to resolve the  overcounting issue, limitations in HUD\u2019s written guidance to grantees and  field staff may be contributing to variation in data entry and impairing  HUD\u2019s ability to accurately summarize program outputs. Existing guidance  does not require field staff to review whether grantees properly grouped  activities and does not specify which output measures grantees should  select for each type of activity. Similarly, HUD has not provided grantees  with written guidance specifying the output measures they should select  for different activity types. In the absence of such guidance, HUD lacks  assurance that it is collecting consistent information from NSP 1 grantees  and that it is summarizing and reporting program outputs in an accurate  manner. Because grantees involved in NSP 2 and 3 also are using DRGR,  addressing limitations in written guidance would benefit HUD\u2019s analysis of  output data for all rounds of NSP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the consistency of data collection in DRGR and enhance the  reporting of program outputs for all rounds of NSP, we recommend that  the Secretary of HUD take the following two actions:    Update the QPR review checklist to include reviews of whether grantees  are (1) grouping activities in accordance with HUD instructions and (2)  selecting the appropriate output measures for different activities.", "Issue written guidance to NSP grantees on the output measures they  should select for different activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HUD for its review and comment.

Additionally, by analyzing DRGR data as of June 24, 2010, we also  determined the number of states that reallocated funds to local  governments that had also received NSP 1 funds directly from HUD. We  also determined the number of local governments that received NSP 1  funds both directly from HUD and from state reallocations, as well as the  amount and percentage of program funds this represented. The funding  amounts and percentages are approximate because in two states it was  unclear from HUD data how reallocations were divided between two  recipients, only one of which was a direct grantee.
