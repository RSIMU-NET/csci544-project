Of the other federal actions in those 2 years, at least 43 statutes and 65 rules contained new requirements on nonfederal parties that might be perceived as \"unfunded mandates.\" For 24 of those statutes and 26 of those rules, CBO or federal agencies had determined that the estimated direct costs or expenditures would not meet or exceed applicable thresholds. For the remaining examples of statues, most often UMRA did not require a CBO review prior to their enactment. The remaining rules most often did not trigger UMRA because they were issued by independent regulatory agencies.

Rather, UMRA  generates information about the nature and size of potential federal  mandates on other levels of government and the private sector to assist  Congress and agency decision makers in their consideration of proposed  legislation and regulations.  UMRA requires congressional committees and  the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to identify and provide information  on potential federal mandates in certain legislation and federal agencies to  identify the costs and benefits of federal mandates contained in certain  regulations.", "Concerns about actual or perceived federal mandates continue.  In the fall  of 2003, for example, the presence of an intergovernmental mandate as  defined by UMRA was one of the issues raised by senators opposing the  Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act (S. 150). The proposed legislation  would have permanently extended and expanded a federal moratorium  prohibiting state and local governments from levying new taxes on Internet  access and electronic commerce and also eliminated the \u201cgrandfather\u201d  protection for existing access taxes granted under the previous statutory  moratorium, which expired November 1, 2003. Pursuant to UMRA, CBO  estimated that repealing the grandfather clause would result in revenue  losses for as many as 10 states and several local governments totaling from  $80 million to $120 million annually, beginning in 2007, and that a change in  the definition of Internet access under the legislation could result in  additional substantial revenue losses for states and local governments.  In  recent months, criticisms of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 because  of perceived \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d implications have also received  increasing attention. No Child Left Behind contains a number of new or  expanded requirements, such as the design and implementation of  statewide achievement tests, imposed upon states and local educational  agencies that receive federal assistance.", "You asked us to provide information and analysis regarding UMRA\u2019s  implementation and identify options for refining the act.

Specifically, you asked  us to: (1) describe the applicable procedures, definitions, and exclusions  for identifying federal mandates in statues and rules under UMRA,  (2) identify statutes and final rules that contained federal mandates under  UMRA, and (3) provide examples of statutes and final rules that were not  identified as federal mandates, but that affected parties might perceive as  \u201cunfunded mandates,\u201d and the reasons these statutes and rules were not  federal mandates under UMRA.

As agreed with  your staff, we focused on statues enacted and final rules published during  2001 and 2002.  We conducted our review from August 2003 through  February 2004 in Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.  We have not previously reported on the  implementation of title I.

Such statutes and their  regulations can provide substantial benefits, as well as imposing costs.  OMB\u2019s 2003 final report on the costs and benefits of federal regulations  estimated that the total annual quantified benefits of major rules issued  from October 1, 1992, to September 30, 2002, ranged from $146 billion to  $230 billion, while the total annual quantified costs ranged from $36 billion  to $42 billion.", "Title I of UMRA focuses on the legislative process, and title II focuses on  the regulatory process.  For both legislation and regulations, UMRA was  intended to provide more information on and prompt more careful  consideration of the costs and benefits of federal mandates that affect  nonfederal parties.  UMRA generally defines a federal mandate as any  provision in legislation, statute, or regulation that would impose an  enforceable duty on state, local, or tribal governments or the private sector  or that would reduce or eliminate the amount of funding authorized to  cover the costs of existing mandates.  However, as discussed in the body of  this report, some other definitions, exclusions, and thresholds in the act  vary according to whether the mandate is in legislation or a rule and  whether a provision imposes an intergovernmental or private sector  mandate.", "If legislation or a rule contains a federal mandate, as defined by UMRA, a  major consequence is that other requirements in the act are triggered.  Under title I, when a committee of authorization of the Senate or the House  of Representatives reports a bill or joint resolution that contains any  federal mandates to the full legislative body, the committee is required to  provide the bill or resolution to the Director of CBO and identify the  mandates it contains.  UMRA then requires CBO to analyze each of these  bills and resolutions\u2014and, on request, other legislative proposals\u2014for the  presence of such mandates and to estimate their associated costs.  CBO  prepares UMRA statements that are to be included in the authorizing  committees\u2019 reports.  The CBO mandate statements must also include an  assessment of whether the legislation authorizes or otherwise provides  funding to cover the costs of any new federal mandates.", "UMRA\u2019s specific enforcement mechanism for the requirements of title I is a  point of order, which a member of Congress may raise to indicate that a  rule of procedure has been or will be violated. Generally, a point of order  is available under UMRA if there is no CBO UMRA statement for the  legislation or if the legislation contains an unfunded intergovernmental  mandate with costs over UMRA\u2019s threshold or if it was not feasible to  estimate the costs of the intergovernmental mandate.  However, points of  order are not available under UMRA for private sector mandates that  exceed the cost threshold or if the private sector mandates\u2019 costs are not  feasible to estimate. UMRA\u2019s rules are not self-enforcing and a point of  order must be actively raised to hinder the passage of unfunded federal  mandates.  Specifically raising an UMRA point of order may serve to  heighten the profile of \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d implications in the challenged  legislation.  As of March 2004, 13 points of order had been raised in the  House of Representatives and no points of order had been raised in the  Senate under UMRA.  Only 1 of these 13, regarding the minimum wage in  the Contract with America Advancement Act in 1996, resulted in the House  voting to reject consideration of a proposed provision.", "For rules that contain federal mandates, title II of UMRA requires the  agencies to prepare written statements containing specific descriptions  and estimates, including a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the  anticipated costs and benefits of the mandate.  For such rules, agencies are  to \u201cidentify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives  and from those alternatives select the least costly, most cost-effective, or  least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule\u201d or  explain why that alternative was not selected. UMRA requires OMB to  collect the written statements prepared by the agencies on federal  mandates in rules and periodically forward them to CBO.  UMRA also  requires OMB to submit annual reports to Congress detailing agencies\u2019  compliance with title II.  OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs (OIRA) has the primary responsibility for monitoring agencies\u2019  compliance with this title.", "CBO and OMB regularly produce reports on, respectively, activities under  titles I and II of UMRA. CBO has prepared an annual report on its  activities under title I each year since UMRA\u2019s enactment.  Included in these  reports is information on two requirements placed on CBO by title I,  identifying (1) proposed legislation that would have imposed federal  mandates on another level of government or the private sector and (2) the  subset of the legislation examined by CBO that was found to contain  mandates with costs at or above the relevant thresholds.  Although not  required by UMRA to do so, CBO also reviews all statutes enacted to  identify mandates enacted into law for its annual reports.  Since 2001, OMB  has fulfilled its requirement to report to Congress on compliance with title  II in the same document used to fulfill a statutory requirement for reporting  to Congress on the costs and benefits of federal regulations.

At our request, CBO identified from that 2-year period the 5  statutes that contained federal mandates at or above UMRA\u2019s cost  thresholds and 43 examples of statutes that were not so identified but  nevertheless contained provisions having impacts on nonfederal parties.  We did not ask CBO to compile a comprehensive list of all statutes in those  years that might have impacts on nonfederal parties.  For our review and  analysis of the implementation of title II, we reviewed all 122 major and/or  economically significant final rules\u2014generally, those that would have an  annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or raise other  significant economic or policy issues\u2014that federal agencies issued during  2001 and 2002.  Parallel to the information on statutes provided by CBO, we  focused on identifying two sets of final rules\u2014those that were identified as  containing federal mandates at or above UMRA\u2019s threshold and those that  were not but included provisions affecting nonfederal parties that might be  perceived by those parties as potential \u201cunfunded mandates.\u201d  To determine  whether the statutes and final rules we examined were perceived by  affected parties as potentially having \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d implications, we  shared them with the following national organizations representing  nonfederal levels of government: National Association of Counties,  National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), National Governors  Association, the National League of Cities, and the U.S. Conference of  Mayors. We then analyzed the statutes and rules to identify how they had  been treated under UMRA, in particular identifying the application of  procedural, definitional, and other provisions of UMRA that guide the  identification of federal mandates.", "The scope of our review was limited to a 2-year period and, within that  period, only to examples of legislation enacted and rules that were finalized  (i.e., we did not include all legislation considered by Congress or rules that  were proposed but not finalized).  Therefore, the examples we reviewed  might not illustrate all possible ways that a statute or rule with a perceived  mandate could be enacted or issued without being identified as a federal  mandate under UMRA.  However, the representatives from external public  sector organizations who reviewed the statutes and rules we examined  generally concurred that they were perceived as potential \u201cunfunded  mandates\u201d and that we did not exclude any major examples that they  believed should have been included.  It is also important to recognize that  perceived \u201cunfunded mandates\u201d could result from nonstatutory,  nonregulatory federal actions, such as Homeland Security threat level  adjustments, which are not covered by UMRA and therefore were outside  the scope of our specific objectives.

In 2001 and 2002, 5 of the 377 statutes enacted were  identified as containing provisions that were federal mandates exceeding  the thresholds.

For example, a provision prohibiting states from  issuing a permit or lease for certain oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes  was not reviewed by CBO prior to enactment because it was contained in  the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2002.", "Although UMRA does not require an automatic CBO review of provisions  not contained in authorizing bills or bills not reported by authorizing  committees, CBO told us that it initiates an informal review of provisions in  appropriations bills and the results of these informal reviews are  communicated to appropriations committee clerks when CBO finds  potential mandates in these bills.  During these informal reviews, CBO does  not estimate costs unless CBO already has cost data from an earlier review  or unless Congress requests it.

A provision would also meet the definition of a  intergovernmental mandate if it relates to an existing federal program of  $500 million or more (annually) to state, local, and tribal governments if the  provision would increase the stringency of conditions of funding, place  caps or reduce the funding and the state, local, or tribal governments  cannot modify their financial or programmatic responsibilities regarding  the federal program.", "A private sector mandate is also a provision that would reduce or eliminate  the amount of authorization of appropriations for federal financial  assistance that would be provided to the private sector for the purposes of  ensuring compliance with such an enforceable duty.", "UMRA also excludes certain provisions from its application.  Specifically,  UMRA does not apply to any provision in legislation that:  1.  enforces Constitutional rights of individuals;  2.  establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination  on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap,  or disability;  3.  requires compliance with accounting and auditing procedures with  respect to grants or other money or property provided by the federal  government;  4.  provides for emergency assistance or relief at the request of any state,  local, or tribal government or any official of a state, local, or tribal  government;  5. is necessary for the national security or the ratification or  implementation of international treaty obligations;  6.  the President designates as emergency legislation and that Congress so  designates in statute; or  7.  relates to the old age, survivors, and disability insurance program under  title II of the Social Security Act (including taxes imposed by sections  3101(a) and 3111(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating to  old-age, survivors, and disability insurance).", "If provisions are excluded, CBO will state the reason for the exclusion and  make no statement regarding mandates in those provisions.", "If a provision is not excluded and meets the definition of a federal mandate  without exception under UMRA, CBO identifies the provision as a federal  mandate under UMRA, and then determines if a cost estimate is feasible.  For intergovernmental mandates, if a cost estimate is feasible, the direct  costs (to state, local, or tribal governments) of all mandates contained  within the legislation must equal or exceed $50 million (in 1996 dollars) in  any of the first 5 fiscal years that the relevant mandates would be effective  for CBO to determine that the mandate meets or exceeds UMRA\u2019s cost  threshold.  The same requirements apply for private sector mandates,  except that the cost threshold is $100 million (in 1996 dollars) or more.  CBO adjusts both the intergovernmental and private sector cost thresholds  annually for inflation.  If an intergovernmental mandate exceeds the cost  threshold, a point of order is available under UMRA.  However, if a private  sector mandate exceeds the cost threshold, a point of order is not available.  If an intergovernmental or private sector mandate is below the applicable  threshold, CBO states that a mandate (intergovernmental or private) exists  with costs estimated to be below the threshold.

If a cost estimate for legislation is not  feasible, CBO specifies the kind of mandate it contains, but that the agency  cannot estimate its costs.  This does not prevent the legislation from  moving through the legislative process, but in the case of an  intergovernmental mandate, UMRA would still allow a member of  Congress to raise a point of order.", "CBO reported that it could not estimate the costs of mandates in nine bills  that ultimately were enacted during 2001 and 2002.  Of these nine laws,  seven contained intergovernmental mandates and two contained both  private sector and intergovernmental mandates.  For example, CBO could  not estimate the costs of provisions requiring manufacturers of medical  devices to comply with certain labeling and notification conventions and to  submit their registrations electronically contained in the Medical Device  User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002. CBO stated that since many of  the requirements in the act would depend on the future actions of the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, CBO could not determine  whether their direct costs would exceed UMRA\u2019s threshold.", "Even if costs can be estimated, UMRA focuses only on the direct costs  imposed by federal mandates in legislation.  According to UMRA, such  costs are limited to spending that results directly from the mandates  imposed by the legislation, rather than from the legislation\u2019s broad effects  on the economy.  The direct costs of a federal mandate also include any  new revenues that state and local governments are prohibited from raising.  While CBO has estimated the indirect costs of some federal mandates, CBO  is limited to including only direct costs when determining if the aggregate  total costs of federal mandates in legislation meet or exceed the applicable  cost thresholds under UMRA.  CBO testified in July 2003 that, \u201cfederal  mandates often have secondary effects, including the effects on prices and  wages when the costs of a mandate imposed on one party are passed along  to other parties, such as customers or employees.\u201d  CBO told us that if it  determined that indirect costs (including secondary effects) would be  significant, it would include the estimate in its UMRA statement, but that its  determination of whether a mandate meets or exceeds the applicable  thresholds is based only on direct costs.  Therefore, although information  on indirect costs may be available, legislation with significant total costs  (direct and indirect) on nonfederal parties may not be identified as  exceeding the cost thresholds under UMRA.", "CBO may conclude that legislation contains a federal mandate and is  funded because the legislation authorizes funds to be appropriated to carry  out or comply with the mandates.  However, if the appropriation  subsequently provided is less than the amount authorized, the federal  mandate\u2019s costs may be at or above the threshold.", "UMRA contains a mechanism designed to help curtail mandates with  insufficient appropriations, but it has never been utilized.  UMRA provides  language that could be included in legislation that would allow agencies  tasked with administering funded mandates to report back to Congress on  the sufficiency of those funds. Congress would then have a certain time  period to decide whether to continue to enforce the mandate, adopt an  alternate plan, or let it expire, meaning the provision comprising the  mandate would no longer be enforceable.

We then analyzed these 43 examples to illustrate the  application of UMRA\u2019s procedures, definitions, and exclusions on  legislation that was not identified as containing mandates at or above  UMRA\u2019s threshold, but might be perceived to have \u201cunfunded mandates\u201d  implications.  We shared CBO\u2019s list of 43 examples with national  organizations representing nonfederal levels of government, and they  generally agreed that those laws contained provisions perceived by their  members as mandates.", "For 12 of the 43 examples, an automatic UMRA review was not required of  at least some provisions prior to enactment because of the legislative  process used to enact the bill, for example, not being reported by an  authorizing committee.  Out of the remaining 31 laws that did undergo a  cost estimate, 24 were found to contain mandates with costs below  applicable thresholds, 3 contained provisions that were excluded, 2  contained provisions with direct costs that were not feasible to estimate, 1  contained a provision that did not meet UMRA\u2019s definition of a mandate,  and 1 was reviewed by JCT and found not to contain any federal mandates  (see fig. 2).  It should be noted that the number of laws in any of the  categories listed do not necessarily correlate with the magnitude of  perceived or actual impact on affected nonfederal parties.", "Of the 12 examples of laws with provisions that CBO was not required to  review prior to enactment, CBO later determined how they would have  been characterized under UMRA:  5 laws contained mandates with direct  costs below UMRA\u2019s thresholds, 4 laws contained mandates with direct  costs that could not be estimated, 1 was excluded under UMRA for national  security so would not be reviewed for the presence of mandates, 1 did not  meet the definition of a mandate, and 1 had some provisions with costs  below the threshold and some provisions excluded (again, for national  security).

Although regulatory agencies generally are to  assess the intergovernmental and private sector effects of all their actions,  under UMRA title II they only need to publicly identify and prepare UMRA  \u201cwritten statements\u201d on those rules that the agencies believe include a  federal intergovernmental or private sector mandate that may result in  expenditures of $100 million or more (adjusted for inflation) in any year.  However, there are 14 definitional exceptions, exclusions, or other  restrictions applicable to the identification of federal mandates in rules,  compared to 10 that are applicable to identifying mandates in legislation.  Agencies identified 9 of the 122 major and economically significant final  rules published in 2001 and 2002 as containing federal mandates as defined  by UMRA.  However, based on our review of the published rules, we  determined that 65 of the remaining rules imposed new requirements on  nonfederal parties.  Agencies cited, or could have cited, a variety of reasons  that these 65 rules did not contain federal mandates under UMRA.

Thus, unlike CBO\u2019s reviews of proposed legislation,  one cost threshold applies to both intergovernmental and private sector  mandates in rules, and there is no public identification of potential federal  mandates in rules before agencies determine whether such mandates  exceed the threshold.  As is the case for legislation, UMRA contains many  definitions and exclusions that affect the extent to which agencies\u2019 rules  are considered to have federal mandates at or above the threshold.", "The three definitional provisions and seven general exclusions from UMRA  that we previously identified as applicable to legislation also apply to  federal rules.

Under title I,  though, the direct costs of a mandate in legislation also include any  amounts that state and local governments are prohibited from raising in  revenues to comply with the mandate.  However, as in reviews of  legislation, indirect costs of rules are not considered when determining  whether a mandate meets or exceeds UMRA\u2019s threshold.", "Two of these restrictions on UMRA\u2019s scope in the regulatory process are  essentially procedural.

For example, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a  final rule that expanded loans, loan deficiency payments, and working  assistance loans for certain agricultural commodities, such as cotton and  honey, and was expected to increase federal outlays by about $1.1 billion  annually.

There were 26 rules in which the agencies stated that the rule would not  compel expenditures at or above the UMRA threshold and 10 rules in which  the agencies stated that rules imposed no enforceable duty.  For 24 of the  65 rules, the agency did not provide a reason.  However, independent  regulatory agencies, which are not covered by UMRA, published 12 of these  24 rules, and there is no UMRA requirement for covered agencies to  identify the reasons that their rules do not contain federal mandates.", "Our review of the 65 rules indicated that agencies did not cite all of the  applicable reasons they could have for determining that the rules did not  trigger UMRA\u2019s requirements (see fig. 5).  For example, although in only 3  of the 65 rules did the agencies identify the absence of a notice of proposed  rulemaking as the reason the rule did not trigger UMRA, this reason applied  to another 25.   Similarly, although 5 rules cited the exclusion that any  enforceable duties would occur as a consequence of participation in a  voluntary federal program, another 21 rules could have claimed this  exclusion.

In these 29 rules, the agencies either  explicitly stated that they expected the rule could impose significant costs  or published information indicating that the rule could result, directly or  indirectly, in financial effects on nonfederal parties at or above the UMRA  threshold.  (Appendix V provides more detailed information on each of the  29 rules that were not identified as federal mandates under UMRA, but that  could impose significant costs or have other negative financial effects on  state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector.)", "These 29 rules not identified as federal mandates under UMRA, but with  significant financial impacts on nonfederal parties, can be roughly  categorized as follows:  9 that imposed costs on individuals\u2014a category included in UMRA\u2019s  definition of the private sector\u2014exceeding $100 million in any year;    5 that reduced the level of federal payments to nonfederal parties by  more than $100 million in any year;   4 with substantial indirect costs or economic effects on nonfederal   4 from independent regulatory agencies that imposed substantial fees or  other costs on regulated entities;   3 published by DOT on aviation security in the aftermath of the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which the agency noted \u201cmay  impose significant costs,\u201d although it did not prepare quantified  estimates;   2 with voluntary options that might increase Medicaid costs to states by  over $125 million in some years;   1 amending the Federal Acquisition Regulations that could result in  nonfederal costs ranging from $92 million to $377 million annually,  depending on the \u201cuncertainty of manufacturers to distribute these  costs over the general population;\u201d and  1 USDA rule imposing private-sector costs to limit retained water in raw  meat and poultry products.", "Table 4 provides more detailed information about selected examples from  among the 29 rules.", "We determined that 1 of the 29 rules, a USDA rule on retained water in raw  meat and poultry products, probably was a federal mandate under UMRA.   The rule establishes a requirement of zero retained water, unless the water  retention is unavoidable in processes necessary to meet food safety  requirements.  USDA did not mention UMRA in the rule but estimated that,  if extensive modifications to chilling systems were needed throughout the  poultry industry, the fixed costs could run to \u201cwell over $100 million.\u201d   USDA provided only a \u201clower bound\u201d estimate of $110 million in private- sector costs for the first year of implementation (representing the costs of  reducing retained water in the range of 1 percent to 1.5 percent).  While  that estimate was under the $113 million UMRA threshold (adjusted for  inflation) in 2001, the agency did not quantify median or upper bound cost  estimates, which reference to a lower bound estimate implies.   Because  the lower bound estimate was so close to the UMRA threshold, it is  reasonable to assume that a median or upper bound estimate would  probably have equaled or exceeded the threshold, and the rule would have  been a private sector mandate under UMRA.  No other UMRA exclusion  appeared to apply to this rule.  However, to address the requirements of  Executive Order 12866 the agency provided an analysis of the costs and  benefits of the rule, as well as an analysis of the regulatory alternatives  considered.  As noted earlier, OIRA guidance points out that the same  analysis may permit agencies to comply with both the executive order\u2019s and  UMRA\u2019s requirements.", "For the remaining 36 of the 65 rules, either the agencies provided no  information on the potential costs and economic impacts on nonfederal  parties or the costs imposed on them were under the UMRA threshold.  For  example, a Federal Emergency Management Agency interim final rule on a  grant program to assist firefighters included some cost-sharing and other  requirements on the part of grantees participating in this voluntary  program.  In return for cost-sharing of $50 million to $55 million per year,  grantees could obtain, in aggregate, federal assistance of approximately  $345 million.  Similarly, USDA\u2019s interim rule on the noninsured crop  disaster assistance program imposed new reporting requirements and  service fees on producers estimated to cost at least $15 million.  But  producers were expected to receive about $162 million in benefits.", "Even when the requirements of UMRA did not apply, agencies generally  provided some quantitative information on the potential costs and benefits  of the rule to meet the requirements of Executive Order 12866.  Rules  published by independent regulatory agencies were the major exception  because they are not covered by the executive order.

At our request, they also identified 43 examples of  statutes enacted during that 2-year period that they believed, based on  professional judgment, had potential intergovernmental or private sector  impacts but had not been identified as containing mandates at or above  UMRA\u2019s thresholds.  (We did not ask CBO to compile a comprehensive list  of all statutes passed by the 107th Congress that may have had  intergovernmental or private sector impacts.)  To assure that this set of  examples was relevant for our purposes and to confirm CBO\u2019s  characterization of the potential impacts of these statutes and the reasons  why provisions were or were not identified as federal mandates, we  reviewed available source material on each of these statutes.  In particular,  we examined the detailed descriptions and information on each statute that  were contained in CBO mandate statements, cost estimates, annual  reports, and testimony, as well as other relevant information on each  statute from the Legislative Information System of Congress.", "To address the second and third objectives regarding final rules that were  and were not identified as federal mandates under title II of UMRA, we  conducted a content analysis of all 122 major and/or economically  significant final rules that agencies published in 2001 or 2002 to identify the  rules that could have significant financial effects on nonfederal parties and  determine why they were or were not considered federal mandates.  We  chose not to review other rules because, by definition, they were less likely  to have significant effects on nonfederal parties, although arguably some  could have had a significant effect.  To arrive at our final set of 122 rules,  we relied primarily on the list of 119 major rules published during the 2- year period, as identified in GAO\u2019s compilation of reports on federal agency  major rules.  Our Office of General Counsel takes several steps to assure  the completeness of the list of major rules; however, to generally  corroborate that this list of major rules included those that could have  significant effects on nonfederal parties, we also compared GAO\u2019s major  rules list to the rules identified as \u201ceconomically significant\u201d by the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC).  As a result of this exercise,  we supplemented our initial list with 3 additional rules.  We then reviewed  the Federal Register notices that agencies published for all 122 of these  rules to confirm that they were major and/or economically significant and  to identify whether, and to what extent, they imposed requirements on  nonfederal parties.  On the basis of our comparisons and reviews, we  concluded that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "Because we were asked to identify rules that affected parties might  perceive as intergovernmental or private sector mandates, even if not  technically identified as such under UMRA, our initial screening used a  broader definition of a potential mandate than delineated in UMRA.  For  this screening, we used the information in the published rules to make a  team consensus judgment on whether a nonfederal party (state, local, and  tribal governments or the private sector) might consider provisions of the  rule to impose requirements or mandates that had at least some costs or  negative financial effects.  In particular, we focused on identifying rules  that imposed new requirements and costs (direct or indirect) on affected  parties.  For each rule identified as including a potential \u201cmandate,\u201d team  members then independently reviewed the text of each rule to code the  reasons agencies may have cited that their rules were not federal mandates  under UMRA, as well as other reasons available under UMRA that might  have applied to these rules.  The team members generally concurred in  their initial coding, and, based on team discussions, we were able to  resolve any differences and determine a team consensus judgment on the  appropriate coding for each rule.", "To provide corroboration that the examples of statutes CBO identified and  final rules we identified to address objective three were perceived by  affected parties as having \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d implications, we shared our  draft lists of examples with national organizations representing other levels of government.  These organizations included the National Association of  Counties, National Conference of State Legislatures, National Governors  Association, the National League of Cities, and the U.S. Conference of  Mayors.
