The Bureau, which is part of the Department of the Interior (DOI), has 210 state, district, and resource area offices that manage about 270 million acres of public lands located in 28 states, primarily in the West and Alaska (see figure 1). BLM\u2019s offices also manage another 300 million acres of subsurface mineral resources that underlie lands administered by other government agencies or are owned by private interests. BLM\u2019s fiscal year 1995 appropriation totaled $1.24 billion.", "In fulfilling its mission, BLM develops land-use plans to balance multiple uses and competing demands, including ecosystem management, timber harvesting, mining, oil and gas production, watershed management, wildlife management, and recreation. It also designates and maintains land of critical environmental concern and is responsible for a major section of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. In performing these functions, BLM maintains over 1 billion documents, including land surveys and surveyor notes, tract books, land patents, mining claims, oil and gas leases, and land and mineral case files. According to BLM, many of these paper documents are deteriorating, and some are illegible. Most of the documents are manually maintained and stored in a number of locations, although some have been entered into various databases since the 1970s."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Evolution of ALMRS/Modernization", "paragraphs": ["During the early 1980s, BLM found it could not handle the case processing workload associated with a peak in the number of applications for oil and gas leases. BLM recognized that to keep up with the increased demand it needed to automate its manual records and case processing activities. Thus, the Bureau began planning to acquire an automated land and mineral case processing system (ALMRS). At that time, BLM estimated the life-cycle cost of such a case processing system would be about $240 million.", "In 1988, BLM expanded the scope of ALMRS to include a land information system (LIS). This system was to provide automated information systems and geographic information systems technology (GIS) support for other land management functions, such as land use and resource planning. BLM then combined the LIS with a project to modernize the Bureau\u2019s computer and telecommunications equipment. BLM estimated the total life-cycle cost of this combined project to be $880 million.", "According to DOI and ALMRS project officials, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed BLM to scale down the combined project in 1989 because of the projected high cost. The project, which was renamed ALMRS/Modernization, was reduced to three major components\u2014the ALMRS Initial Operating Capability (ALMRS IOC), Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and modernization of BLM\u2019s computer and telecommunications infrastructure and rehost of selected management and administrative systems. Estimated life-cycle costs were cut to $575 million. In 1993, BLM reduced the ALMRS/Modernization 10-year life-cycle cost estimate from $575 million to $403 million, after the system development and deployment contract was awarded at a lower cost than had been anticipated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of the ALMRS/Modernization Project", "paragraphs": ["BLM has designated the ALMRS/Modernization project as a mission-critical system to (1) automate land and mineral records and case processing activities and (2) provide information to support land and resource management activities. The project is a large-scale effort that is expected to provide an efficient means to record, maintain, and retrieve land description, ownership, and use information to support BLM, other federal programs, and interested parties. It is to accomplish this by (1) establishing a common information technology platform,(2) increasing public access to BLM records through the Internet, (3) integrating multiple databases into a single geographically referenced database, (4) shortening the time to complete case processing activities, and (5) replacing costly manual records with automated records. Appendix II provides an overview of the planned ALMRS/Modernization architecture.", "As noted above, the ALMRS/Modernization consists of three components\u2014ALMRS IOC, GCDB, and technology modernization and rehost of selected systems. The ALMRS IOC component is to provide (1) support for case processing activities, including recording valid mining claims, processing mineral patents, and granting rights-of-way for roads and power corridors and (2) information for land and resource management activities, including timber sales and grazing leases. The GCDB component is the database that will contain geographic coordinates and survey information for land parcels. Other databases, such as those containing land and mineral records, will be integrated with GCDB. The information technology modernization and rehost component consists of installing computer and telecommunications equipment and converting selected management and administrative systems to a relational database system that will be used throughout the Bureau."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Project Funding and Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal years 1983 and 1995, about $296.2 million had been appropriated for ALMRS/Modernization.

They expect obligations to equal appropriations by September 30, 1995.", "In 1993, OMB and BLM agreed to annual funding limits for ALMRS/Modernization through fiscal year 2002. As agreed, total spending was not to exceed $403 million for fiscal years 1983 through 2002. However, to stay within the limit for fiscal year 1995, BLM delayed the initial hardware installation for the Alaska and Wyoming state, district, and resource area offices. Also, BLM estimates that it will exceed the fiscal year 1996 limit of $69.5 million by $25.2 million. BLM expects to obtain the $25.2 million from other parts of its operations.", "According to ALMRS/Modernization project officials, the increase is attributable to several factors, but primarily because of requirements that were added after contract award. These requirements include system engineering studies for system architecture and system security issues, a requirement to integrate BLM\u2019s remaining older personal computers and local area networks with the new ALMRS/Modernization systems, changes to more easily accommodate land record automation requirements of other Interior bureaus and federal agencies, and more training for users and technical staff.", "In addition, the ALMRS/Modernization project office now believes that operations and maintenance costs in fiscal years 1997 through 2002 will be more than the OMB and BLM funding agreement for that category.

The Bureau plans to install 730 more workstations and other equipment in fiscal year 1995 at the Idaho and Utah state offices, their subordinate offices, and a support office.", "However, initial hardware installation for Alaska and Wyoming state and subordinate offices has been delayed because of a shortage of hardware funds in fiscal year 1995, according to ALMRS/Modernization project officials. BLM recently rescheduled the installation of servers and 951 workstations for these locations to fiscal year 1996.", "The collection and validation of land and mineral data for ALMRS IOC are on schedule for all ten state offices.

Nevertheless, project officials said they have been committed to completing the development and deployment of ALMRS as scheduled.", "Our analysis of the project schedule showed that several critical milestones are very close together with little recovery time available to deal with unanticipated problems that may be encountered. Therefore, slippages in the ALMRS/Modernization development and testing schedule could occur and impact project cost and completion plans. Similarly, slippages in the deployment of ALMRS IOC and database conversions could also impact project costs and completion plans because of the short installation periods scheduled for each state. As shown in table 1, BLM was allowing only 15 to 20 working days to perform the final installation of ALMRS IOC and convert databases in each state.", "ALMRS/Modernization project officials and an Interior Senior Technical Analyst agreed that both the development and testing milestones and deployment and database conversion milestones are very tight with little tolerance for slippages. Interior and BLM have been taking a number of actions to closely monitor the project status and schedule to avoid slippages. Interior Information Resources Management (IRM) officials have been conducting periodic oversight reviews and have required project officials to address project schedule issues. BLM has also established a consolidated project schedule that includes BLM\u2019s and the prime contractor\u2019s tasks to estimate and monitor the entire project schedule.
