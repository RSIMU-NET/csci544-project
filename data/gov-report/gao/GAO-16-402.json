GAO examined (1) states' and plans' experiences using federal databases to screen providers; and (2) how states and plans share data about ineligible providers. GAO interviewed officials from 10 states, selected generally based on enrollment and geography, and representatives from 16 plans from among these states. GAO reviewed those states' Medicaid program websites and plan contracts, and relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; and interviewed officials from CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the selected states and Medicaid managed care plans face significant challenges in screening providers for eligibility to participate in the Medicaid program. Based on information we received from two selected states and 16 selected plans, GAO found that the states and plans used information that was fragmented across 22 databases managed by 15 different federal agencies to screen providers. These databases included databases that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) had not identified for use in screening providers. Officials from some states noted that these additional databases provided better assurance they would not enroll ineligible providers\u2014i.e., providers who have been barred from participating in federal health care programs. Federal internal control standards stress the importance of collecting quality information to achieve objectives and assess risks. However, the variety of databases used for screening purposes beyond those identified by CMS, along with the current rate of improper payments to Medicaid providers, suggests that CMS might not have identified all reliable sources of information about ineligible providers that could help states and plans achieve program objectives. State officials and plan representatives also said that accessing and using fragmented information from multiple and disparate federal databases challenged their screening efforts. For example, they reported difficulties accessing certain databases, such as the Social Security Administration's Death Master File, and conducting and confirming identified provider matches across databases, particularly those not based on a unique national provider identifier. CMS has not coordinated with other agencies to address these challenges. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use quality data that are complete, current, accurate, and accessible\u2014and have a logical connection to the program\u2014to achieve agency goals to reduce fraud. However, the difficulties states and plans experienced accessing databases and confirming matches could result in provider screening efforts that do not ensure that ineligible providers are accurately and consistently identified.", "GAO also found that the selected states reviewed used inconsistent practices to make data on ineligible providers publicly available. States must ensure that none of their providers has been determined to be ineligible anywhere in the United States. Although CMS has issued guidance encouraging states to share data on ineligible providers through its Medicaid provider termination notification system, doing so is optional, not all states are using the list, and it is not available to Medicaid managed care plans. Moreover, CMS has not provided states with guidance on other ways to share their data on ineligible providers or how to access other states' data on ineligible providers. The 10 states GAO selected varied in how they shared data on ineligible providers. Plans are not required to make their own data on ineligible providers publicly available, and the 16 selected plans shared their data with states at differing intervals and, in rare cases, with other plans. The inconsistency with which this information is shared across states and plans creates the potential that providers could be ineligible in some states while still receiving payments from Medicaid in other states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) consider additional databases used in screening, (2) collaborate with the Social Security Administration to improve access to the Death Master File, (3) coordinate with other agencies to develop a common identifier across databases, and (4) provide state Medicaid programs with guidance that establishes expectations and best practices on sharing provider screening data among states and plans. HHS concurred with our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Medicaid program financed health care coverage for an estimated 69  million beneficiaries with estimated expenditures of $529 billion in fiscal  year 2015. This federal-state health care program for low-income and  medically needy individuals finances the delivery of health care services  to beneficiaries through fee-for-service (FFS) payments to participating  providers and capitated payments to Medicaid managed care (MMC)  plans under the terms of their contracts with the state. Under the  managed care delivery model, states typically contract with MMC plans to  provide a specific set of Medicaid-covered services to beneficiaries and  pay the MMC plans a set amount per beneficiary per month\u2014referred to  as capitation payments\u2014to provide those services. The Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for broad oversight of the  Medicaid program, while states are responsible for the daily  administration of their individual Medicaid programs, including program  integrity activities. In its broad oversight role, CMS develops guidance  and provides assistance to the states in administering their Medicaid  programs. In February 2015, we reported that Medicaid remains a high- risk program because of concerns about the adequacy of fiscal oversight,  including improper payments to Medicaid providers. CMS estimated that  $29.12 billion, or 9.78 percent, of federal Medicaid expenditures for fiscal  year 2015 were improper payments.", "Because provider actions can be a major factor behind improper  payments, the integrity of the Medicaid program depends, in large part,  on ensuring that only eligible providers participate in the program.  Consequently, screening providers is important in helping prevent  improper payments, including fraud and abuse. In 2000, we raised  concerns about the effectiveness of states\u2019 screening and enrollment  processes in preventing potentially fraudulent providers from enrolling in  the Medicaid program. More recently, we examined approximately  881,000 Medicaid providers in four states and found that in fiscal year  2011 hundreds of these providers were potentially receiving improper  Medicaid payments. The providers had suspended or revoked medical  licenses, had invalid addresses, were identified as deceased in federal  death files, or had been excluded from federal health care programs,  including Medicaid. Our prior work has also concluded that  comprehensive state screening and enrollment processes that prevent  fraudulent providers from billing Medicaid are more efficient in protecting  Medicaid funds than attempting to recover these funds once payments  have been made.  For the purposes of this report, an \u201cineligible or  potentially ineligible provider\u201d means a provider who has been, or could  be, excluded by HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) or  terminated by a state from participating in Medicaid under any applicable  requirements.", "As states move their Medicaid programs to managed care, the screening  of MMC plan providers becomes increasingly important and increasingly  complex.  As of July 2013, the date of the most recent enrollment data  available, about 55 percent of total Medicaid enrollment was in managed  care, a percentage that has likely grown since. In addition, MMC  expenditures are growing at a faster rate than FFS expenditures because  of the Medicaid expansions under the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA). Further, the HHS-OIG has noted the emergence of  MMC fraud, citing the increase in the agency\u2019s workload on MMC fraud  cases, some of which resulted in inflated payments to MMC plans. The  flexibility states have in setting up their Medicaid programs\u2014in the case  of screening MMC plan providers, states either screen providers, or they  delegate screening to plans, or use a combination of both approaches\u2014 makes identifying ineligible providers across multiple states a complex  task.  According to a 2016 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office,  managed care providers who have been determined to be ineligible for  the Medicaid program, but continue to participate, receive $3 million in  federal Medicaid payments annually.", "You asked us to examine the availability and use of databases and  information necessary to screen MMC plan providers.

We contacted Medicaid program officials in these  states to discuss whether the state or the MMC plans primarily screen  MMC plan providers. We determined that 2 states conduct their own  provider screening and 8 states primarily delegate provider screening to  MMC plans. We then contacted state Medicaid officials in the two states  that primarily screen providers, and representatives from the 16 plans in  states where plans primarily screen providers. We discussed which  federal databases they use to screen providers in order to help prevent  ineligible providers from enrolling and their experiences with using the  databases. The experiences of the Medicaid officials in the selected  states and the representatives in the selected MMC plans are not  generalizable to all plans in the states or to other states. In addition, we  reviewed applicable federal laws and regulations; CMS reviews of state  program integrity activities; CMS guidance on database use for the  screening of MMC plan providers; and Medicaid managed care contracts  in the 10 states. Further, we evaluated the sufficiency of CMS guidance  related to provider screening against our fraud prevention framework and  relevant federal internal control standards. Finally, we interviewed CMS  and HHS-OIG officials to obtain information about their databases, and  obtained and reviewed documentation on the various federal databases  identified by the states and plans.", "To obtain information about how states and MMC plans share information  and data on ineligible providers with other MMC plans and states, we  contacted Medicaid officials in all 10 selected states and plan  representatives from the 16 selected plans. In addition, we searched the  Medicaid program websites in each of the 10 states to determine whether  state data on terminated providers were publicly available; the type of  information provided; and the ease of searching, finding, and  downloading state information. The experiences of the Medicaid officials  in the selected states and the representatives in the selected MMC plans  are not generalizable to all plans in the states or to other states.

Federal regulations establish screening requirements that apply  when states enroll FFS providers into their Medicaid program. Because  states are required to enroll FFS providers, but have discretion on  whether to enroll MMC plan providers, MMC plan providers would not be  subject to the same screening requirements as FFS providers unless the  state opted to enroll them. States that do not enroll MMC plan providers  have flexibility in how they screen them. This occurs when states  require the MMC plans to screen and enroll providers directly into their  networks by delegating these responsibilities to the plans in their  contracts. In past work, we concluded that states that maintain centralized  control over the provider screening process and require MMC plan  providers to enroll with the state Medicaid agency may be better  positioned to ensure the integrity of their Medicaid programs.", "Federal health programs, including Medicaid, are prohibited from paying  for any items or services rendered by an ineligible provider. The HHS- OIG determines which providers are excluded from the federal health  programs, and thus ineligible, and maintains the List of Excluded  Individuals and Entities (LEIE). Grounds for exclusion include  convictions for program-related fraud and patient abuse, and suspension  or revocation of a medical license for reasons bearing on professional  competence or performance. While states may delegate provider  screening to the MMC plans, the states remain responsible for ensuring  that they do not pay ineligible providers for Medicaid health care items  and services. CMS is prohibited by federal law from making payments to  states for any amount expended for items or services provided by an  ineligible provider.  Any such payments constitute overpayments and  are therefore subject to recoupment. In addition, civil monetary penalties  may be imposed against MMC plans that employ or enter into contracts  with ineligible providers.", "Further, PPACA and its implementing regulations require state Medicaid  agencies to terminate the participation of any provider that has been  terminated on or after January 1, 2011, under Medicare or under any  other state Medicaid program or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.  CMS defines termination to mean that a state Medicaid program,  Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or the Medicare program has taken  action to revoke a provider\u2019s billing privileges for cause, and the provider  has exhausted all applicable appeal rights or the timeline for appeal has  expired. A termination for cause may include, but is not limited to,  terminations based upon fraud, integrity, or quality issues. Prior to  PPACA, if one state terminated a provider from its Medicaid program, the  provider could potentially enroll in or continue participation in another  state\u2019s Medicaid program, leaving the latter state\u2019s program vulnerable to  potential fraud, waste, and abuse. In response to the PPACA requirement  for CMS to establish a process for sharing information about terminated  providers with state agencies, CMS established a web-based portal\u2014the  Medicaid provider termination notification system\u2014where CMS and state  Medicaid agencies can submit information about providers that meet  CMS\u2019s criteria for having been terminated for cause from Medicare,  Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. However,  according to CMS officials, states\u2019 use of this portal to report terminations  is voluntary.", "In response to PPACA\u2019s requirement to establish procedures for  screening providers, CMS issued regulations that set forth minimum  requirements applicable to the screening of Medicaid FFS providers,  although states have flexibility to establish more stringent screening  requirements. Among other requirements, CMS designated four federal  databases that states must use to screen providers: (1) the Social  Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Death Master File (DMF), (2) HHS\u2019s  National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES), (3) the LEIE,  and (4) the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) maintained by the  General Services Administration. In December 2014, CMS issued  guidance to assist states when conducting required federal database  checks on FFS providers. In the guidance, CMS noted that MMC plans  are not mandated by regulation to screen providers who enroll in their  networks. However, CMS stated that it considered the requirements  under its regulation to be program safeguards that would be prudent in  managed care settings. CMS also noted that states may delegate these  requirements to their MMC plans through their contracts with them. In  guidance issued to MMC plans, CMS recommended that plans use the  LEIE and EPLS to identify ineligible providers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected States and Medicaid Managed Care Plans Face Significant Challenges Screening Providers", "paragraphs": ["According to two selected states and 16 selected MMC plans that screen  MMC plan providers, their efforts are challenged by fragmented  information and difficulty accessing and using particular databases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Screen Providers Are Based on Information that Is Fragmented across Multiple and Disparate Federal Databases", "paragraphs": ["According to the two selected state officials and 16 selected MMC plan  representatives we contacted, the information they use to screen MMC  plan providers is fragmented across multiple and disparate federal  databases.

Representatives from 13 of the 16 plans reported using  between 5 and 8 of these federal databases, while officials from the two  states that directly screen managed care providers reported using 5 and 6  databases. Table 1 lists the 22 databases that these selected state  officials and plan representatives said they used in their screening of  MMC plan providers, the agencies that managed them, and the role the  databases play in the screening of providers. (See appendix I for  additional details on each of these federal databases.)", "According to state Medicaid officials in the two selected states that do  their own screening of providers, both states used the LEIE, EPLS, and  NPPES, and one also used the DMF. In addition, both states checked  CMS\u2019s Medicare Exclusions Database and its Provider Enrollment, Chain  and Ownership System (PECOS).", "Almost all of the selected MMC plans reported using three databases\u2014 NPPES, DMF, and HHS\u2019s National Practitioner Data Bank\u2014in addition to  the two databases recommended by CMS guidance. Plans also reported  using several other of the federal databases identified in table 1. Officials  from some states noted that plans checking more databases than  recommended by CMS provided better assurance they would not enroll  ineligible providers and helped provide a more comprehensive  background on a provider. For example, by checking federal databases  beyond the two recommended by CMS for MMC plans (LEIE and EPLS),  plans may find background on a provider\u2019s termination or identify a past  administrative action taken against the provider by the Drug Enforcement  Administration. However, this also means that provider screenings within  a state may not always be conducted consistently, as the additional  databases checked may vary by plan.", "Additionally, all 10 selected states use the health plan accreditation  requirements of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) in  their monitoring of state MMC plans, because it includes provider  screening guidelines, such as assessing providers\u2019 practice history,  verifying their credentials, education, training, malpractice history and  disciplinary actions, and monitoring providers\u2019 sanctions, complaints, and  quality issues. Half of the states require that their plans be accredited by  NCQA, and the rest recognize NCQA accreditation as compliance with  federal guidance for screening MMC plan providers. In particular, to meet  the NCQA accreditation requirements, plans need to obtain information  beyond what the LEIE and EPLS provide. For example, to meet NCQA\u2019s  requirement that they verify provider history and other disciplinary actions,  plans must check the National Practitioners\u2019 Data Bank, a large central  federal data bank of all reports made against all health care  professionals, including fraud, abuse, licensure actions, or malpractice  reports.", "Federal internal control standards stress the importance of collecting  quality information to achieve objectives and assess risks.

However, the variety of databases  checked by states and MMC plans beyond those specified by CMS, the  use of NCQA\u2019s accreditation requirements in all 10 states, along with the  current rate of improper payments to Medicaid providers, suggests that  CMS might not have identified all reliable sources of information about  ineligible providers. This makes it difficult for the states and MMC plans to  achieve the Medicaid program\u2019s objectives. Moreover, the variety of  databases that the states and MMC plans have chosen to check raises  the possibility that they might be using information of varying quality to  screen providers. All of the states and MMC plans that screened  providers checked more databases than are currently specified by CMS  for this purpose, but CMS has not assessed whether there are benefits to  checking the additional databases.

The lack of a  consistent, unique identifier meant that it could be difficult to accurately  match a potentially ineligible provider across databases. Relying solely  on basic information for matching, such as providers\u2019 names and  addresses, can cause additional problems; for example, false positive  matches for common names such as John Smith. In these instances,  plans may have to take additional steps to confirm the match, such as  contacting the provider or federal agency managing the database to  obtain additional information that is not included in the database. Several  plans told us that they would prefer to use the NPI to search the  databases, because most providers are required to have an NPI.  However, because NPI is a health-care specific unique identifier, it may  not be used in databases external to HHS. Other unique identifiers that  state officials and plan representatives suggested could be used across  databases include Social Security numbers and taxpayer identification  numbers, although the officials noted the sensitivity involved with using  these numbers.", "These challenges affect states\u2019 ability to ensure that only eligible  providers in good standing participate in the Medicaid program.

In response to our fourth recommendation to provide  state Medicaid programs with guidance that establishes expectations and  best practices on sharing provider screening data among states and  Medicaid managed care plans, HHS commented that it developed the  Medicaid provider termination notification database to assist states with  the requirement to deny or terminate the enrollment of any provider that  has been terminated for cause under Medicare or another state\u2019s  Medicaid program or CHIP. It added that its Medicaid managed care  proposed rule, issued in June 2015, if finalized, will require that state  Medicaid programs enroll providers participating in Medicaid managed  care. HHS stated that this will help ensure that all Medicaid managed  care providers are screened against the Medicaid provider termination  notification database. However, states\u2019 use of the Medicaid provider  termination notification database is not required, not all states are using it,  plans do not have access to the database, and the proposed rule does  not address use of the database.
