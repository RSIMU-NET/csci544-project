In January 2003, GAO provided data on the diversity of career SES members as of October 2000 (GAO-03-34). In March 2000, GAO reported similar data for the Postal Career Executive Service (PCES) as of September 1999 (GAO/GGD-00-76). In its 2003 report, GAO also projected what the profile of the SES would be in October 2007 if appointment and separation trends did not change. In response to a request for updated information on diversity in the SES and the senior ranks of the U.S. Postal Service, GAO is providing data on race, ethnicity, and gender obtained from the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Central Personnel Data File and the Postal Service for (1) career SES positions as of the end of fiscal year 2007 and the SES developmental pool (i.e., GS-15 and GS-14 positions) as well as a comparison of actual fiscal year 2007 data to projections for fiscal year 2007 that GAO made in its 2003 report, and (2) the PCES, the Executive Administrative Schedule (EAS), and EAS participants in the Corporate Succession Planning (CSP) program. GAO also describes the process that executive agencies and the Postal Service use to select members into their senior ranks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Data in the Central Personnel Data File and provided by the U.S. Postal Service show that as of the end of fiscal year 2007, the overall percentages of women and minorities have increased in the federal career SES and its developmental pool for potential successors since 2000 as well as in the PCES and EAS levels 22 and above, from which PCES potential successors could come, since 1999. Actual fiscal year 2007 SES data show that representation increased from October 2000 among minorities and women and that those increases generally exceed the increases we projected in our 2003 report. The only decrease among minorities occurred in African American men, whose fiscal year 2007 actual representation (5.0 percent) was less than the October 2000 baseline (5.5 percent). For the developmental pool (GS-15s and GS-14s), fiscal year 2007 data show that increases also occurred generally among minorities and women since October 2000. Both executive branch agencies and the Postal Service have processes for selecting members into their senior ranks. Executive agencies use Executive Resources Boards to review the executive and technical qualifications of eligible candidates for initial SES career appointments and make recommendations on the best qualified. An OPM-administered board reviews candidates' qualifications before appointment to the SES. The Postal Service does not fall under the jurisdiction of OPM's board for promoting employees to the PCES. Instead, it promotes EAS and other employees to the PCES when they are selected to fill PCES vacancies. Most employees promoted to the PCES have been CSP program participants, consistent with Postal Service policy encouraging this practice. The CSP program is intended to identify and develop employees so that they can promptly and successfully assume PCES positions as these positions become available."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to provide the Subcommittees with  information on the representation of women and minorities in the senior  ranks of the federal government and the U.S. Postal Service.

Leadership in agencies across  the federal government, especially at senior executive levels, is essential to  providing accountable, committed, consistent, and sustained attention to  human capital and related organizational transformation issues. Having a  diverse SES corps, which generally represents the most experienced  segment of the federal workforce, can be an organizational strength that  can bring a wider variety of perspectives and approaches to bear on policy  development and implementation, strategic planning, problem solving, and  decision making.", "Today, as requested, we are providing updated information as of the end  of fiscal year 2007 on the representation of women and minorities in  career SES positions and the SES developmental pool (i.e., GS-15 and GS- 14 positions) as well as baseline data from October 2000, which we  previously reported for those same positions in 2003. As requested, we  also will compare the fiscal year 2007 data to statistically estimated  projections for fiscal year 2007 that we made in our 2003 report. We also  are providing updated information from the Postal Service on the  representation of women and minorities in the PCES and EAS as of the  end of fiscal year 2007 as well as baseline data from 1999, which we  previously reported for those same positions.

OPM and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), in  their oversight roles, require federal agencies to analyze their workforces,  and both agencies also report on governmentwide representation levels.  Under OPM\u2019s regulations implementing the Federal Equal Opportunity  Recruitment Program (FEORP), agencies are required to determine  where representation levels for covered groups are lower than the civilian  labor force and take steps to address those differences. Agencies are also  required to submit annual FEORP reports to OPM in the form prescribed  by OPM. EEOC\u2019s Management Directive 715 (MD-715) provides guidance  and standards to federal agencies for establishing and maintaining  effective equal employment opportunity programs, including a framework  for executive branch agencies to help ensure effective management,  accountability, and self-analysis to determine whether barriers to equal  employment opportunity exist and to identify and develop strategies to  mitigate or eliminate the barriers to participation. Specifically EEOC\u2019s  MD-715 states that agency personnel programs and policies should be  evaluated regularly to ascertain whether such programs have any barriers  that tend to limit or restrict equitable opportunities for open competition  in the workplace. The initial step is for agencies to analyze their workforce  data with designated benchmarks, including the civilian labor force. If  analysis of their workforce profiles identifies potential barriers, agencies  are to examine all related policies, procedures, and practices to determine  whether an actual barrier exists. EEOC requires agencies to report the  results of their analyses annually.", "In our 2003 report, we (1) reviewed actual appointment trends from fiscal  years 1995 to 2000 and actual separation experience from fiscal years 1996  to 2000; (2) estimated by race, ethnicity, and gender the number of career  SES who would leave government service from October 2000 through  October 2007; and (3) projected what the profile of the SES would be if  appointment and separation trends did not change. We estimated that  more than half of the career SES members employed in October 2000 will  have left service by October 2007. Assuming then-current career SES  appointment trends, we projected that (1) the only significant changes in  diversity would be an increase in the number of white women with an  essentially equal decrease in white men and (2) the proportions of  minority women and men would remain virtually unchanged in the SES  corps, although we projected slight increases among most racial and  ethnic minorities.", "Table 3 shows SES representation as of October 2000, our 2003  projections of what representation would be at the end of fiscal year 2007,  and actual fiscal year 2007 data. We projected increases in representation  among both minorities and women. Fiscal year 2007 data show that  increases did take place among those groups and that those increases  generally exceed the increases we projected. The only decrease among  minorities occurred in African American men, whose representation  declined from 5.5 percent in 2000 to 5.0 percent at the end of fiscal year  2007. For more information on our projections, see appendix II.", "Table 4 shows developmental pool representation as of October 2000, our  2003 projections of what representation would be at the end of fiscal year  2007, and actual fiscal year 2007 data. We projected increases in  representation among both minorities and women. Fiscal year 2007 data  show that increases did generally take place among those groups. For  more information on our projections, see appendix II.", "As stated earlier, we have not analyzed the factors contributing to changes  in representation; therefore care must be taken when comparing changes  in demographic data since fiscal year 2000 to the projections we made in  2003, as we do in tables 3 and 4. For example, we have not determined  whether estimated retirement trends materialized or appointment and  separation trends used in our projections continued and the impact these  factors may have had on the diversity of the SES and its developmental  pool.", "Considering retirement eligibility and actual retirement rates of the SES is  important because individuals normally do not enter the SES until well  into their careers; thus SES retirement eligibility is much higher than for  the workforce in general. As we have said before, as part of a strategic  human capital planning approach, agencies need to develop long-term  strategies for acquiring, developing, motivating, and retaining staff. An  agency\u2019s human capital plan should address the demographic trends that  the agency faces with its workforce, especially retirements. In 2006, OPM  reported that approximately 60 percent of the executive branch\u2019s 1.6  million white-collar employees and 90 percent of about 6,000 federal  executives will be eligible for retirement over the next 10 years. If a  significant number of SES members were to retire, it could result in a loss  of leadership continuity, institutional knowledge, and expertise among the  SES corps, with the degree of loss varying among agencies and  occupations. This has important implications for government management  and emphasizes the need for good succession planning for this leadership  group. Rather than simply recreating the existing organization, effective  succession planning and management, linked to the strategic human  capital plan, can help an organization become what it needs to be. Leading  organizations go beyond a \u201creplacement\u201d approach that focuses on  identifying particular individuals as possible successors for specific top- ranking positions. Rather, they typically engage in broad, integrated  succession planning and management efforts that focus on strengthening  both current and future capacity, anticipating the need for leaders and  other key employees with the necessary competencies to successfully  meet the complex challenges of the 21st century.", "Succession planning also is tied to the federal government\u2019s opportunity to  affect the diversity of the executive corps through new appointments. In  September 2003, we reported that agencies in other countries use  succession planning and management to achieve a more diverse  workforce, maintain their leadership capacity, and increase the retention  of high-potential staff. Racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in the SES is an  important component for the effective operation of the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Representation of Women and Minorities in the PCES, EAS, and CSP Program", "paragraphs": ["As we have testified before the House Subcommittee on Federal  Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform, the Postal Service expects nearly half  of its executives to retire within the next 5 years, which has important  implications and underscores the need for effective succession planning.  This presents the Postal Service with substantial challenges for ensuring  an able cadre of postal executives and also presents opportunities for the  Postal Service to affect the composition of the PCES. Table 5 updates  information we provided last year for the PCES and EAS levels 22 and  above, from September 1999 to September 2007, showing increases in the  representation of women and minorities.", "Since last year\u2019s testimony, we have studied the pools of potential  successors that the Postal Service can draw from in selecting PCES  promotions. The Service\u2019s policy encourages selecting employees from the  CSP program when it promotes employees to the PCES. The current CSP  program\u2014which first accepted participants in 2004\u2014is intended to  identify pools of potential successors for PCES positions and develop  these employees so that they can promptly and successfully assume PCES  positions as these positions become available. Nearly 87 percent of postal  employees promoted to the PCES in fiscal years 2004 through 2007 were  participating in the CSP program, and nearly 7 in 10 promotions were  drawn from CSP program participants in EAS levels 25 and above.

Each agency head is to appoint one or more Executive  Resources Boards (ERB) to conduct the merit staffing process for initial  SES career appointments. ERBs review the executive and technical  qualifications of each eligible candidate and make written  recommendations to the appointing official concerning the candidates.  The appointing official selects from among those candidates identified by  the ERB as best qualified and certifies the executive and technical  qualifications of those candidates selected. Candidates who are selected  must have their executive qualifications certified by an OPM-administered  Qualifications Review Board (QRB) before being appointed to the SES.", "According to OPM, it convenes weekly QRBs to review the applications of  candidates for initial career appointment to the SES. QRBs are  independent boards of three senior executives that assess the executive  qualifications of all new SES candidates. Two criteria exist for  membership on a QRB: at least two of three members must be career  appointees, and each member must be from a different agency. In  addition, OPM guidance states that QRB members cannot review  candidates from their own agencies. An OPM official stated that an OPM  official acts as administrator, attending each QRB to answer questions,  moderate, and offer technical guidance but does not vote or influence  voting. OPM guidance states that the QRB does not rate, rank, or compare  a candidate\u2019s qualifications against those of other candidates. Instead,  QRB members judge the overall scope, quality, and depth of a candidate\u2019s  executive qualifications within the context of five executive core  qualifications\u2014leading change, leading people, results driven, business  acumen, and building coalitions\u2014to certify that the candidate\u2019s  demonstrated experience meets the executive core qualifications.", "To staff QRBs, an OPM official said that OPM sends a quarterly letter to  the heads of agencies\u2019 human capital offices seeking volunteers for  specific QRBs and encourages agencies to identify women and minority  participants. Agencies then inform OPM of scheduled QRB participants,  without a stipulation as to the profession of the participants. OPM solicits  agencies once a year for an assigned quarter and requests QRB members  on a proportional basis. The OPM official said that OPM uses a rotating  schedule, so that the same agencies are not contacted each quarter.  Although QRBs generally meet on a weekly basis, an OPM official said that  QRBs can meet more than once a week, depending on caseload. The  official said that because of the caseload of recruitment for SES positions  recently, OPM had been convening a second \u201cad hoc\u201d QRB. According to  another OPM official, after QRB certification, candidates are officially  approved and can be placed.", "In addition to certification based on demonstrated executive experience  and another form of certification based on special or unique qualities,  OPM regulations permit the certification of the executive qualifications of  graduates of candidate development programs by a QRB and selection for  the SES without further competition. OPM regulations state that for  agency candidate development programs, agencies must have a written  policy describing how their programs will operate and must have OPM  approval before conducting them. According to OPM, candidate  development programs typically run from 18 to 24 months and are open to  GS-15s and GS-14s or employees at equivalent levels from within or  outside the federal government. Agencies are to use merit staffing  procedures to select participants for their programs, and most program  vacancies are announced governmentwide. OPM regulations provide that  candidates who compete governmentwide for participation in a candidate  development program, successfully complete the program, and obtain  QRB certification are eligible for noncompetitive appointment to the SES.  OPM guidance states that candidate development program graduates are  not guaranteed placement in the SES. Agencies\u2019 ERB chairs must certify  that candidates have successfully completed all program activities, and  OPM staff and an ad hoc QRB review candidates\u2019 training and  development experience to ensure that it provides the basis for  certification of executive qualifications.", "OPM also periodically sponsors a centrally administered federal candidate  development program. According to an OPM official, the OPM-sponsored  federal candidate development program can be attractive to smaller  agencies that may not have their own candidate development program,  and OPM administers the federal program for them. According to OPM  officials, 12 candidates graduated from the first OPM-sponsored federal  candidate development program in September 2006. Of those, 8 individuals  have been placed; 1 is about to be placed, and 3 are awaiting placement. In  January 2008, OPM advertised the second OPM-sponsored federal  candidate development program, and selections for the second program  are pending.", "With respect to oversight of and selection into the SES, we note that the  Chairmen of the two Subcommittees represented here today introduced  legislation in October 2007, which would create a Senior Executive  Service Resource Office within OPM to improve policy direction and  oversight of, among other things, the structure, management, and diversity  of the SES.

Promotions generally  involve EAS employees in levels 25 and above who are CSP program  participants and who were identified as potential PCES successors  through a nomination and evaluation process (either through self- nomination or nomination by a PCES \u201csponsor\u201d).

However, participation in the CSP program does not  trigger any promotion decision, and any employee can be promoted to the  PCES, regardless of whether that person is participating in CSP. Further,  there are no requirements for PCES vacancies to be advertised, nor are  selecting officials required to interview candidates for such vacancies.  According to postal officials, selecting officials use a variety of methods to  fill PCES-I vacancies, which may involve interviews and discussion  among officers regarding candidates or potential candidates, or which may  involve considering employees who have had developmental assignments.  Such discussions may happen when the vacancy is in one area of the  country and potential candidates are in other areas, or when potential  candidates are in CSP program position pools outside the jurisdiction of  the selecting official.", "The Postal Service has implemented a structured process to select  nominees to participate in up to 5 of the approximately 400 CSP program  position pools.
