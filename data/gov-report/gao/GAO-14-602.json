In this report, GAO focuses primarily on USAID because it provided the most funding for TCB in fiscal year 2012 and has a formal strategy focused entirely on TCB.

USAID's TCB activities are primarily guided by country needs and many of these activities are elements of large development projects that have their own objectives. According to USAID, the strategy's priority areas\u2014participation in trade negotiations, implementation of trade agreements, and economic responsiveness to opportunities for trade\u2014remain relevant. However, some parts of the strategy are not current. For example, the strategy does not include discussion of how USAID should coordinate with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which did not exist in 2003 and is a major TCB contributor (see figure). USAID officials told GAO that they had not updated the strategy because they questioned the costs and benefits of doing so given that trade resources were declining and they believed the priorities presented in the strategy were still relevant. However, USAID is still committing significant resources to TCB, and TCB contributes to goals outlined in USAID and the Department of State's joint strategic plan. USAID's TCB strategy may not be as useful as it could be for informing TCB activities because parts of it are no longer current. Moreover, directives, such as those in the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010, can serve as guidance for periodic updating of strategic plans.", "The 2003 strategy calls for USAID to be the primary coordinator for U.S. government TCB efforts, and GAO found that USAID coordinates TCB activities at home and abroad using a range of methods, including structured and informal dialogue between stakeholders. Specifically, USAID staff report that they participate in interagency working groups and maintain ongoing discussions with counterparts from other agencies to coordinate TCB activities. For example, at headquarters USAID participates in the Trade Policy Staff Committee, an interagency working group that includes a range of stakeholders and has subcommittees on development and TCB. In the countries GAO visited, GAO found that USAID missions coordinate TCB through formal mechanisms, such as working groups, as well as informal communication."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Administrator of USAID update the 2003 TCB strategy to reflect the current TCB environment.

TCB covers multiple categories of assistance across  numerous types of trade and development programs that have many  goals and are implemented by multiple agencies. Given the diffused  nature of TCB assistance, Congress has expressed concern about which  agency is ultimately accountable for TCB activities. While the U.S.  government is committed to providing TCB, no single agency is  responsible for it. We found in 2011 that U.S. agencies provided more  than $9 billion in TCB assistance from 2005 through 2010, based on data  from the U.S. government TCB database, administered by the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID). In fiscal year 2012, U.S.  government agencies provided nearly $1 billion for TCB activities in more  than 120 countries, customs territories, and regional groupings. Given the  diverse and disparate nature of TCB activities, congressional oversight of  key aspects of this effort, including strategy, coordination, and program  management, is important to ensuring that the U.S. government is  meeting its TCB commitment.

In this report, we  (1) determine the extent to which USAID\u2019s 2003 strategy guides USAID\u2019s  TCB activities; (2) describe methods USAID uses to coordinate TCB  efforts with other U.S. government agencies at home and abroad; and (3)  describe how, if at all, USAID has used TCB evaluations in its program  and project management.

Data from the TCB database were  previously deemed reliable for our 2005 and 2011 reports on TCB. We  identified limitations to the TCB database in our 2011 report on TCB,  including that the database did not adequately explain significant factors  driving changes in the composition of TCB funding over time. For this  report, we assessed data from fiscal years 2008 through 2012 and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to identify TCB funding  by agency, country, and category. Furthermore, in assessing the data, we  interviewed key USAID officials and the contractor responsible for  administering the database and reviewed supporting documentation.", "We primarily focused on TCB activities that USAID conducted because  USAID provided the most funding of all U.S. agencies for TCB activities in  2012. However, we also sought the views of three other entities in our  review regarding coordination with USAID on TCB activities: (1) State,  because it is committed to supporting the negotiation and implementation  of trade agreements and thereby helps countries advance trade  initiatives; (2) the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) because it  conducts TCB-related activities that support its broader strategic and  agency mission goals, although it does not have a specific TCB mission;  and (3) the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) because of  its role in leading trade efforts. In conducting our work, we analyzed  strategic, budget, and programmatic documents describing these  agencies\u2019 TCB funding and activities. We also reviewed evaluations of  TCB projects. We conducted fieldwork in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand,  Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Kenya.

USAID policy  requires most USAID missions to prepare a CDCS, which is a 5-year  strategy that serves as the basis for the mission\u2019s assistance planning,  budgeting, and resource allocation and is based on country needs and  U.S. priorities. It is developed in consultation with partner country  governments and citizens, civil society organizations, the private sector,  multilateral organizations, other donors, and other USG agencies. USAID  officials at the USAID Mission in Ethiopia stated that the mission\u2019s CDCS  is the main strategy guiding their TCB activities. For example, Ethiopia\u2019s  CDCS calls for TCB-related activities under its objective of increasing  economic growth with resiliency in rural Ethiopia. This objective focuses  on strengthening agricultural value chains\u2014the process or activities by  which relevant firms add value to a product\u2014by increasing the availability  of market-based information, among other things. The objective also  focuses on improving private sector competitiveness through efforts such  as trade and customs reform. The Agribusiness and Market Development  Project is an example of TCB activities in Ethiopia that were guided by  this objective. The Agribusiness and Market Development project has  activities aimed at improving the global competitiveness of selected value  chains for products such as sesame, chickpeas, and coffee, and  increasing private sector access to finance and investment.", "To help identify TCB needs and provide further strategic guidance for  their development of specific TCB programs, USAID missions also use  ongoing trade negotiations\u2014such as bilateral trade agreements or World  Trade Organization (WTO) accession\u2014and commitments made under  existing trade agreements. During our fieldwork, USAID officials in both  Vietnam and Laos reported that development and implementation of the  mission\u2019s TCB activities were guided by needs identified by USAID and  the host government during the negotiation and implementation of trade  agreements and WTO accession. Specific examples of TCB assistance  that was guided by these events are Vietnam\u2019s Support for Trade  Acceleration Projects (STAR I and STAR II), which ran from 2001-2010.

We found examples of such programs in the African  countries we visited, Tanzania and Ethiopia. USAID\u2019s officials in the East  Africa and Tanzania missions reported that most of the TCB-related  activities in Tanzania are part of the \u201cFeed the Future\u201d initiative and are  therefore guided by USAID\u2019s Feed the Future strategy for the country.

The official stated that a large  portion of USAID\u2019s total reported TCB assistance is for non-TCB focused  development projects that have TCB-related effects. USAID officials  reported that in some cases TCB needs to be woven into other  development projects as there is no dedicated funding source for TCB  activities.

USAID officials also noted that the strategy is supplemented with  guidance related to specific TCB activities and trade agreements.  However, since the strategy was developed, the TCB environment in  which USAID operates has changed significantly. For example, the total  number of free trade agreements the United States has entered into has  increased from 3 in 2003 to 14 as of May 2014, and the number of trade  and investment framework agreements signed by the United States  increased from 19 in 2003 to 50 as of May 2014.

For example, according to USAID\u2019s  guidance, its mission country development cooperation strategies are  only 5-year strategies. We also note that the Government Performance  and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 requires agencies to update  and revise their strategic plans at least every 4 years. In addition,  desirable characteristics of a national strategy include discussion of the  current operating environment. Moreover, a multicountry evaluation of  USAID\u2019s TCB assistance, released in 2010, stated that the usefulness of  USAID\u2019s 2003 TCB strategy diminishes as time passes and the base of  empirical literature on TCB and U.S. development policy evolves.

The number of agencies involved in  providing TCB increased from 15 in 2003 to 19 in 2012, but the  coordination section of the strategy does not reflect that change.

It also refers to a number of  potential trade agreements that have since been completed, including  the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement and  the U.S.\u2013Morocco Free Trade Area.", "The strategy does not reflect changes in emphasis placed on TCB  priorities. Changes since 2003 in the emphasis, or importance, USAID  places on each priority are not reflected in the strategy. For example,  USAID reported that it has placed more emphasis recently on trade  facilitation initiatives, such as streamlining customs clearance  procedures and increasing transparency.

A USAID official reported that  the focus in recent years had been on supporting ongoing field programs  and that these efforts took precedence over updating the TCB strategy.  USAID officials also reported that they believe an update to the existing  strategy would have limited impact, largely serving to maintain the status  quo, since the priorities have remained the same and all activities still fit  under the strategy. However, we previously found that assessing the  current environment has a critical impact on the success of strategic  planning. Further, even though USAID reports that trade resources are  declining, it continues to commit significant resources, obligating over $1  billion for TCB-related activities in fiscal years 2011 and 2012.

According to a USTR official, the TPSC\u2019s subcommittees  provide channels for USAID to identify developing country trade capacity  needs and opportunities. For example, USAID participates in the TPSC  Development and Trade Capacity subcommittee, which focuses on topics  such as WTO policy and agreements. In this forum, USAID may discuss  needs associated with WTO accession with USTR and other agencies to  see if an acceding developing country needs help understanding or  meeting requirements.

The Alliance provides  capacity-building assistance to developing countries specifically related to  the implementation of the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement.  According to USAID, assistance aims to help developing countries  improve the quality and safety of the products they export abroad and  increase exports, while reducing costs and bureaucratic hurdles. In  addition, Standards Alliance activities are implemented in collaboration  with USTR and draw heavily on expertise and technical support from  other U.S. agencies including the Department of Commerce/National  Institute of Standards and Technology and the Consumer Product Safety  Commission. In 2013, USAID worked with the Standards Alliance to  conduct workshops in Peru that brought together industry representatives  and government officials to discuss U.S. and Peruvian experiences and  perspectives related to standardization and regulatory practices. About  130 individuals took part in the event, representing a mix of stakeholders  in government, industry, testing and certification bodies, and academia.", "USAID also reports using other mechanisms, such as shared  management structures and cross-agency agreements, to facilitate TCB  coordination. For example, the Administrator of USAID sits on the MCC  Board of Directors and contributes to the approval of MCC compacts.  According to USAID officials, this shared management structure is  intended to ensure stakeholder involvement and provides an opportunity  to leverage resources on TCB matters. In addition, USAID is represented  on the board of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and  contributes to the approval of OPIC deals, which may have TCB-related  components. The USAID Office of Development Credit and OPIC also  hold quarterly meetings to discuss project plans and other issues of  relevance to both units to help ensure relevant skills and expertise are  being utilized for TCB and other activities, according to USAID. In addition  to shared management structures, a USAID official reported that it has  agreements and works with other agencies that play relatively small roles  in TCB, such as the Trade and Development Agency and the  Departments of Justice and Labor. Involving stakeholders in this way  facilitates leveraging TCB resources, according to a USAID official. For  example, in Bangladesh, USAID and the Department of Labor are  cooperating on implementation of a program to improve labor conditions,  promote independent and democratic labor unions, and support labor  rights and worker representation. Such activities fall in line with USAID\u2019s  TCB objective to address labor issues related to trade and to leverage  expertise from across the U.S. government.", "In addition to using mechanisms that facilitate coordination, officials at  USAID, State, and USTR, told us that they discuss TCB matters  frequently and on an ad hoc basis, particularly at the staff level. As TCB  needs, opportunities, or issues arise, relevant stakeholders communicate  informally to coordinate, according to a USTR official. For example,  State\u2019s Office of Multilateral Trade Affairs monitors trade-related activities  and considers how State could help with TCB.

According to officials we met with, USAID coordinates TCB  activities primarily through the Economic Growth and Development  working group, which meets monthly. This interagency group, one of  five created about a year ago under an ambassadorial directive to  address the highest-level embassy priorities, covers TCB matters and  related topics, such as WTO accession progress and upcoming visits  of U.S. government or private sector personnel. Generally, the Chief  of Mission and the USAID Mission Director or their deputies report  that they attend the meeting, along with representatives from the  Foreign Agricultural Service, USAID, and State.

The embassy Deputy Chief of Mission sets  the agenda for the task force and participants provide updates on  active projects, issues, and policy considerations related to TCB and  commercial activities. According to embassy officials, TCB is a key  embassy priority and requires a broad range of engagement with the  host government, so coordination is critical.

According to a USAID official, TCB efforts in  Laos are relatively small and focused, so formal coordination  structures are not necessary or practical. Instead, this official  explained that the USAID representative regularly liaises with the  State Economics Officer, who meets with the Ambassador weekly.  Although no official working group has been established, the  Economic Officer, Ambassador, and USAID representative meet at  least quarterly to discuss TCB assistance. These discussions help to  ensure conflicts are avoided and resources are used effectively.  Because economic development and TCB projects have been key  priorities of the embassy in Laos in recent years, USAID  communicates frequently with State counterparts in-country,  according to an official.

For example, the  assessment recommended that the Trade Hub work with the  embassies in the countries it covers, including Tanzania, to develop a  shared vision and to facilitate mutually beneficial relationships.  According to a USAID official, the Trade Hub responded by taking  steps to address this issue. Specifically, the Trade Hub committed to  send a person to visit each embassy in the region at least once a year  to discuss goals and priorities, and it provided additional country- specific information on its website so stakeholders could see and  monitor its activities anytime. The assessment also recommended  that the Trade Hub shift to assisting the East Africa Community, a  regional economic group that includes Tanzania, and national  authorities with the implementation of policies and procedures. As a  result, the Trade Hub reallocated some of its TCB resources away  from supporting trade-related business development activities to  supporting the East Africa Community, its five members, and regional  trade associations focused on regional policy implementation,  according to a USAID official.", "Vietnam. USAID conducted a performance evaluation of STAR, its  main TCB activity, in 2011. One of the evaluation\u2019s recommendations  was that USAID should focus its future efforts on trade facilitation  activities, such as improving customs, transportation, and the  commercial regulatory environment. According to the evaluation, this  would benefit the trading community and help the host government  implement and enforce some of the legal and regulatory reforms put  in place over recent years with the support of STAR. A USAID official  told us that in response to the recommendation, they designed TCB  activities to focus on leveraging relationships with the host  government\u2019s customs ministry.

Given the diffused nature of TCB assistance,  Congress has expressed concern about which agency is ultimately  accountable for TCB activities. While no single agency is responsible for  this type of assistance, USAID has a 2003 TCB strategy that defines  overall TCB priorities and discusses coordination with other U.S.  agencies. In addition, in fiscal year 2012, USAID provided about $418  million for TCB, the most funding of any U.S. government agency.  Therefore, it is important that USAID\u2019s strategy reflect the current TCB  environment. USAID officials asserted that the priorities in the strategy  are still relevant, but we observed that neither USAID nor other agency  officials we met with in the field used, or in some cases even knew about,  the strategy. Moreover, we found that the strategy may not be as useful  as it could be because it is outdated in several areas. For example, the  coordination section of the strategy does not include all agencies now  providing TCB assistance, the trade initiatives discussed in the strategy  are no longer current, and the categories of TCB activities identified in the  strategy have changed. Updating the strategy to reflect the current TCB  environment would provide USAID an opportunity to examine its TCB  priorities in light of changes to the environment and ensure that the  priorities are indeed still relevant. A strategy update would also raise  awareness of the agency\u2019s TCB priorities in relevant missions and offices.
