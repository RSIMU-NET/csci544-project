This delay is linked to continuing delays in developing software needed to support the two interventions, offsite investigations and the use of cooperative safety plans. The software under development is intended to help FMCSA overcome some of the information challenges it faces due to its reliance on legacy information systems. FMCSA estimates that the software development project will be completed by April 2017.", "FMCSA has conducted evaluations of the effectiveness and efficiency outcomes it established for the CSA program. However, GAO identified several limitations in FMCSA's approaches that impact the usefulness of the evaluations:", "Intervention effectiveness: FMCSA has developed a statistical model to annually evaluate the combined effectiveness of interventions. Although the model has some key strengths, such as accounting for a broad range of external factors, GAO identified a number of design and methodology limitations that reduce the usefulness of its results. For example, the model does not include an assessment of individual intervention types. Without this type of specific information, FMCSA is hampered in its ability to identify the circumstances under which different types of interventions are effective. Similarly, these types of limitations affect FMCSA's ability to accurately draw conclusions about intervention effectiveness across all intervention types.", "Intervention efficiency: To assess the efficiency of CSA interventions, FMCSA has relied on a study that it sponsored and that was published in 2011. This study estimated the average cost of conducting interventions in four states from October 2008 through May 2009. However, FMCSA has not taken steps to update its cost estimates for interventions since the 2011 evaluation, despite changes since that time in the resources needed to conduct CSA interventions; nor has it taken steps to develop additional information that is representative of the costs in other states. Without current cost estimates that are representative of all states, FMCSA cannot appropriately assess the efficiency of its interventions.", "FMCSA has taken some actions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of CSA interventions, but lacks measures to monitor progress. In April 2014, FMCSA established a working group to assess CSA interventions and make recommendations for improvement. As of April 2016, the group had made 20 recommendations, of which 12 had been implemented. However, GAO found that while FMCSA has established some performance measures for its effectiveness outcome that are appropriate, it has not established similar measures for its efficiency outcome. FMCSA headquarters officials told GAO that effectiveness and efficiency are complementary outcomes that FMCSA strives to balance. Without a complete set of measures for both outcomes, FMCSA lacks benchmarks needed to regularly measure progress to achieve these outcomes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FMCSA evaluate the effectiveness of individual intervention types, update cost estimates so that they are current and representative of all states, and establish complete performance measures.", "The Department of Transportation concurred with all of GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Commercial trucks and buses are vital transportation links connecting  goods and people with American markets and communities.

These crashes harm  the well-being of the people involved and the companies that own  commercial trucks and buses (motor carriers). Fatalities resulting from  these crashes have also increased, rising from about 4,200 in 2011 to  almost 4,500 in 2015. Further, FMCSA estimated that crashes involving  large trucks and buses cost over $110 billion in 2014.", "FMCSA\u2019s Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) program is intended  to reduce the number of motor carrier crashes by using a data-driven  approach to identify and intervene with the highest-risk motor carriers.  When motor carrier safety problems are identified, FMCSA applies a  range of intervention types\u2014such as sending warning letters, conducting  investigations, or issuing civil penalties\u2014that attempt to remedy those  problems early and before crashes occur.", "A provision in a Senate Appropriations Committee report required us to  periodically assess FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the CSA program.

We  intended to analyze whether there were any notable increases,  decreases, or other trends in FMCSA\u2019s application of interventions\u2014 across states, regions, and motor carrier types. However, data limitations  prevented an adequate and comprehensive assessment of the reliability  of FMCSA\u2019s intervention data. For example, officials told us FMCSA  changed the way it counted interventions over time, and as a result, we  could not validate the results of our analysis against agency totals\u2014a  step to testing data reliability. As a result, we concluded that FMCSA\u2019s  intervention data were of undetermined reliability, a factor that precluded  our analysis of trends in FMCSA\u2019s application of interventions across  states, regions, and motor carrier types. As a substitute, we requested  that FMCSA provide estimates for how frequently it applied each  intervention type from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2015 to identify  general trends. After reviewing FMCSA documentation related to the  estimates and interviewing responsible FMCSA officials, we concluded  that FMCSA\u2019s estimates were sufficiently reliable for this purpose. We  also reviewed relevant regulations and FMCSA guidance and policy  documents to identify how FMCSA should implement and apply  interventions. We interviewed headquarters officials from FMCSA\u2019s Office  of Enforcement, Office of Field Operations, and its Office of Research and  Information Technology. FMCSA has 52 divisions that correspond with  each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. One of the four  service centers oversees each division. We interviewed FMCSA division  officials in eight states that we selected based upon their participation in  FMCSA\u2019s Operational Model Test of the CSA program, geographic  location, and program size, among other factors, and interviewed FMCSA  officials from each of the four service centers.

In contrast to the one investigation intervention, the  compliance review, available under FMCSA\u2019s previous approach, FMCSA  expects the CSA program to more effectively change unsafe behaviors by  reaching and intervening with more potentially  unsafe carriers earlier  using a range of intervention types to enforce compliance with safety  regulations. In 2014, we reported on the effectiveness of the SMS  component of the CSA program.", "FMCSA conducted an Operational Model Test of the program from  February 2008 through June 2010 in nine pilot states. In December  2010, FMCSA began implementing the CSA program in three phases: (1)  implementation of SMS and some intervention types nationwide, (2) introduction of new investigative techniques and the Safety Management  Cycle, and (3) nationwide rollout of all intervention types and FMCSA\u2019s  new investigative software, the Safety Enforcement Tracking and  Investigation System (SENTRI).", "After a series of four commercial motor vehicle crashes\u2014two involving  buses and two involving trucks\u2014that together resulted in 25 deaths and  injuries to 83 people, the National Transportation Safety Board  investigated and, in November 2013, made recommendations to improve  the quality of FMCSA\u2019s compliance review processes. The Secretary of  Transportation tasked the Federal Aviation  Administration, as a peer of  FMCSA within DOT, to conduct a review and develop appropriate  recommendations for DOT\u2019s response to the National Transportation  Safety Board. The Federal Aviation Administration formed an  Independent  Review Team, which in July 2014, issued a report that  included a range of recommendations intended to support both  incremental and transformative improvements to FMCSA\u2019s compliance  and enforcement programs.

Four of the intervention types  were newly introduced under the CSA program; FMCSA had been  applying the other four intervention types prior to the program (see   table 3). Each type falls into one of the following intervention categories:  early contact, investigation, and follow-on interventions.", "Before the CSA program, FMCSA used one investigation intervention  type\u2014the onsite compliance review\u2014and three follow-on intervention  types. Compliance reviews required investigators to examine every part  of a carrier\u2019s operations and were thus extremely resource intensive to  conduct. As a result, FMCSA and its state partners investigated only  about 3 percent of active carriers. According to FMCSA Motor Carrier  Safety Progress Reports, federal or state investigators conducted  between approximately 15,000 and 17,000 compliance reviews each year  from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CSA Intervention Process", "paragraphs": ["Under the CSA program, FMCSA has established a process for  measuring the relative safety risk of carriers in seven Behavioral Analysis  and Safety Improvement Categories (BASICs), prioritizing carriers based  on risk, assigning an appropriate intervention type, and investigating or  enforcing compliance with regulations (see fig. 1). The CSA intervention  process has no set progression, and based on existing guidance, FMCSA  applies one or more interventions depending on the circumstances of  each case. For example, FMCSA may directly assign an onsite  comprehensive investigation to a carrier without first assigning another  type of intervention. FMCSA may also apply multiple interventions to a  carrier over time, and as a result, common patterns in FMCSA\u2019s  application of CSA interventions can be identified. For example, if a  carrier receives a warning letter as a first intervention and its safety  performance does not improve, FMCSA may assign the carrier a second  intervention, such as an onsite focused investigation. If FMCSA identifies  violations during an investigation, such as the onsite focused  investigation, that warrant enforcement, FMCSA may assign a third  intervention, such as a notice of claim. In such a case, the resulting  intervention pattern would be: (warning letter) \u2192 (onsite focused  investigation) \u2192 (notice of claim).", "Every month, FMCSA uses SMS to generate percentiles in any of seven  BASICs for carriers with sufficient data. However, as we reported in  2014, the SMS methodology contains limitations that reduce FMCSA\u2019s  ability to reliably assess carriers\u2019 safety risks because FMCSA lacks  sufficient safety performance information on the majority of carriers. We  identified the lack of sufficient information as a particular limitation for  carriers with few inspections and vehicles because their underlying  violation rates can have artificially low or high values, or greater  variability, which affects the precision of the BASIC percentiles used by  FMCSA in comparing carriers to one another.", "Nonetheless, FMCSA uses these BASIC percentiles to identify potentially  risky carriers, to prioritize them for intervention, and to automatically  generate warning letters. FMCSA automatically prioritizes carriers into  risk-based categories of escalating urgency based on the extent to which  a carrier\u2019s BASIC percentiles exceed certain combinations of designated  thresholds, in addition to the carrier\u2019s intervention history and unresolved  violations. For example, under the new high-risk definition FMCSA  adopted in March 2016, for a carrier to be considered high-risk, its BASIC  percentile has to be above 90 in at least two of four BASICs\u2014unsafe  driving, crash indicator, hours-of-service compliance, or vehicle  maintenance\u2014and the carrier cannot have had an onsite comprehensive  investigation in the last 18 months. In addition to changing the high-risk  definition, FMCSA implemented a new prioritization approach with five  risk-based categories, from most to least urgent: high-risk, moderate-risk,  risk, warning letter, and monitor. According to FMCSA, high-risk carriers  are the agency\u2019s highest investigative priority.", "After FMCSA prioritizes carriers for intervention, FMCSA division  managers decide which intervention type carriers should receive based on priority level, guidance, and carrier history among other things. The  principal guidance document for assigning intervention types is the  electronic Field Operations Training Manual (eFOTM). Although eFOTM  includes some requirements, division managers have some discretion to  select investigation and follow-on intervention types based on additional  information, such as complaints received, significant crashes, and  professional judgment. For example, FMCSA must investigate non- frivolous written complaints that allege substantial violations regardless of  whether the carrier is prioritized for intervention, but have discretion to  determine the most appropriate investigation type based on the safety  problems associated with the complaint, the carrier\u2019s BASIC percentiles,  and the carrier\u2019s history. However, for carriers identified as high-risk,  FMCSA must conduct an onsite focused or onsite comprehensive  investigation.", "Federal Safety Investigators and their state partners follow eFOTM  guidance when conducting investigation and follow-on interventions. In  April 2013, FMCSA introduced enhanced investigative techniques (EIT)  that are intended to help investigators identify the root cause of a motor  carrier\u2019s safety problems. While financial and legal penalties are typically  applied following an investigation, FMCSA may levy financial penalties  against a carrier without an investigation if it believes there is sufficient  evidence, such as evidence that the carrier operated after being placed  out of service.

The test  was intended to help the agency assess the four new intervention types  and identify any features that needed to be adjusted prior to implementing  them nationwide, among other things. According to FMCSA headquarters  officials, personnel experienced challenges using multiple legacy  information systems that were not designed to support FMCSA\u2019s  application of the expanded range of interventions under the CSA  program.

However, FMCSA decided to  implement the remaining two new intervention types\u2014warning letters and  onsite focused investigations\u2014nationwide because they believed those  two interventions were demonstrated as effective during the Operational  Model Test and that delays would hinder safety benefits for the public  (see fig. 2). The Operational Model Test evaluation found that offsite  investigations demonstrated a similar pattern of effectiveness as onsite  focused and onsite comprehensive investigations.", "FMCSA headquarters officials told us that developing and implementing  SENTRI is important to help field staff and their state partners conduct  their work. Field staff currently may use a variety of legacy information  systems to apply and manage interventions. Principally, field staff use the  CAPRI system to prepare for investigation interventions and to report  their results. However, CAPRI was designed to support traditional  compliance review investigations, not the expanded range of investigation  types under the CSA program. According to FMCSA officials, this has  resulted in field staff taking time-consuming additional steps to report their  application of interventions. For example, some division administrators  spent additional time reviewing how investigators entered information into  CAPRI to determine the correct investigation type performed. According  to officials, SENTRI is expected to help address these inefficiencies by  consolidating investigative, follow-on, reporting, and other functions into a  single interface. FMCSA officials also expect SENTRI to improve data  consistency and enable better policy and program decisions through  improved data quality.", "However, FMCSA has faced longstanding delays in developing  SENTRI  software as part of its broader IT modernization effort. In September  2005, FMCSA initiated a comprehensive overhaul of the way it collects,  manages, and conveys safety information. The agency-wide  modernization effort was intended to help FMCSA achieve its  effectiveness and efficiency outcomes for the CSA program by  centralizing FMCSA data and simplifying information access, among  other things.

See table 4 for detailed  estimates of FMCSA\u2019s application of interventions. Reasons for these  notable decreases are discussed below.", "Offsite investigations: Division officials from each of the four pilot test  states we interviewed told us they selected offsite investigations less  frequently in more recent years, because the number of carriers that met  eFOTM criteria for receiving them decreased over time. For example, officials from one division told us their use of offsite investigations  decreased because motor carriers\u2019 BASIC percentiles were typically too  high or involved too many BASICs to qualify to receive an offsite  investigation according to current eFOTM criteria. FMCSA headquarters  officials told us they are focused on increasing the use of offsite  investigations, because they believe offsite investigations were  demonstrated as both efficient and effective. For example, in March 2016  FMCSA established a working group to explore modifying policy to give  division managers more discretion in assigning offsite investigations.", "Notices of violation: Division officials from four of the eight divisions we  interviewed told us they selected notices of violation infrequently because  the intervention type was time-intensive to process compared to other  intervention types or was not appropriate to address severe safety  violations. FMCSA headquarters officials told us that investigators prefer  to issue notices of claim instead, because they result in penalties to motor  carriers. However, officials stated that investigators may not be aware of  other associated FMCSA activities that increase the overall resources  used to issue notices of claim. For example, notices of claim require  additional legal oversight, which generally requires more resources.  Headquarters officials said investigators may choose to issue notices of  violation rather than notices of claim, when appropriate, if they better  understood this context.", "Total investigation interventions: FMCSA headquarters officials told us  that total investigation interventions declined because investigators spent  more time conducting in-depth reviews of motor carriers\u2019 safety  management practices to identify the root causes of underlying safety  problems as part of FMCSA\u2019s EIT initiative. FMCSA implemented EIT in  fiscal year 2013 as part of continuous improvement efforts and in  response to Independent Review Team recommendations.

For example,  although all but 10 states did not implement offsite investigations, the  CAPRI system nonetheless allowed investigators in these states to select  \u201coffsite\u201d for the \u201creview location\u201d data element. According to FMCSA  officials, this inflated counts when FMCSA used \u201creview location\u201d as one  of multiple data elements to identify offsite investigations. Similarly,  investigators may conduct onsite focused investigations on carriers that  receive complaints, but CAPRI requires investigators to select either  \u201ccomplaint\u201d or \u201cfocused CR\u201d for the \u201creview reason\u201d data element.  Because FMCSA\u2019s algorithm used \u201creview reason\u201d as one of multiple  data elements to count onsite focused investigations, this deflated onsite focused investigation counts when investigators selected \u201ccomplaint\u201d to  conduct them.", "Evaluation Limitations: FMCSA officials told us they occasionally modified  algorithms used to identify the occurrence of intervention types, but  generally did not evaluate how the modifications affected the accuracy of  intervention counts. According to officials, they modified algorithms for a  variety of reasons, such as when the agency changed how it recorded  intervention data. Once modified, FMCSA applied the most recent  algorithm to all previous data\u2014including historical data. For example, in  January 2016, FMCSA removed a redundant data element from the  algorithm used to count investigation interventions, a step that changed  historical intervention counts. FMCSA officials told us they did not know  the extent to which applying the modified algorithm to previous data  affected the accuracy of historical counts, because they generally did not  evaluate the modification\u2019s effect on count accuracy before applying it.

To evaluate the effectiveness of CSA interventions  specifically, FMCSA developed a statistical model intended to annually  evaluate the combined effects of all of its interventions. According to  FMCSA, the model is a revised version of a prior model that FMCSA used  to evaluate the effectiveness of compliance reviews, before the  implementation of the CSA program added new intervention types.

According to FMCSA\u2019s Strategic Plan: Fiscal Years 2015\u20132018, the  agency\u2019s strategy to reduce the number of unsafe and high-risk carrier  behaviors is to create and apply appropriate interventions. As we  previously discussed, FMCSA\u2019s application of individual intervention  types depends upon a combination of eFOTM rules and managers\u2019 day- to-day discretion. For example, according to eFOTM, managers generally  assign offsite investigations when a carrier has percentiles above  intervention thresholds in three or fewer BASICs. However, managers  have the discretion to apply an onsite focused investigation instead,  based on the carrier\u2019s circumstances. Additionally, FMCSA may apply  multiple intervention types for the same carrier over time, resulting in  commonly observed intervention patterns. For example, one official told  us that most carriers that FMCSA investigates have, at one time, been  issued a warning letter.", "In contrast to the design and implementation of CSA interventions,  FMCSA\u2019s model does not include an assessment of either individual  intervention types or common intervention patterns.

Recommended practices for  program evaluation recommend that program managers attempt to  separately evaluate multiple types of program activities that seek to  achieve a common outcome\u2013in this case, multiple intervention types that  seek to improve carrier safety performance. Consistent with these  practices, FMCSA\u2019s Strategic Plan: Fiscal Years 2015\u20132018 calls for the  agency to use data to make smarter day-to-day decisions and to  determine the impact that various rules have on decreasing crashes,  injuries, and fatalities by conducting regular program evaluations and  effectiveness reviews.", "Therefore, to provide information appropriate to the design and  implementation of CSA interventions, an evaluation should assess how  effectively each intervention type or common intervention patterns  addressed the safety problems of the carriers that received them.

Specifically, FMCSA concluded that \u201cthis   suggests that the warning letter in and of itself can be an effective tool for  improving motor carrier safety.\u201d However, as accepted practices for designing evaluations explain, quality evaluations should draw  conclusions commensurate with the power of the design. Because  FMCSA did not evaluate the separate effect of warning letters, it lacks  specific analytical evidence to support its conclusion. As a result, FMCSA  lacks quality information needed to estimate how each intervention type,  including warning letters, or common intervention patterns affect motor  carrier safety performance and address carriers\u2019 specific safety problems.", "FMCSA headquarters officials stated that they were unsure if it was  possible to measure the effects of individual  intervention types or  common intervention patterns because the quantity of available data may  not be sufficient to produce reliable results. However, as previously  discussed, FMCSA\u2019s August 2011 evaluation of the CSA Operational  Model Test, conducted by UMTRI,  assessed the effectiveness of each  intervention type and common intervention patterns for carriers that  received multiple interventions. An evaluation of these effects was  possible for the Operational Model Test, despite the fact that UMTRI  had  less data available than FMCSA would generate after nationwide  implementation of the CSA program. According to the study, UMTRI  assessed such patterns to provide a more detailed look at the  effectiveness of the interventions, in light of how FMCSA actually applied  them in the field. Furthermore, in March 2016, FMCSA conducted  separate evaluations of how two specific intervention types\u2014onsite  focused and offsite investigations\u2014influenced carriers\u2019 BASIC percentiles  in calendar years 2011 and 2012. By combining multiple years of  intervention data, as FMCSA did in these evaluations, rather than using a  fiscal year construction, which officials told us FMCSA used in the annual  evaluation for administrative reasons, FMCSA could potentially overcome  data sufficiency limitations (see app. III).", "FMCSA and independent evaluators have identified a need for this level  of detailed information in the management and implementation of  interventions. For example, an internal FMCSA working group determined  that the agency needed a more detailed understanding of the  effectiveness of onsite focused investigations to empower investigators to  select the most appropriate intervention to change carrier behavior.  Additionally,  in its 2014 assessment, the Independent  Review Team that  DOT tasked with reviewing FMCSA\u2019s compliance review processes  identified a need for FMCSA to perform consistent, detailed, evaluations  of effectiveness by enforcement tool, such as intervention types. Without  detailed evaluations, the team said that FMCSA would be unable to focus  resources on using its most effective tools or to reconfigure tools that are  not meeting the agency\u2019s goals.", "Nonetheless, as discussed earlier in this report, FMCSA\u2019s ability to  accurately identify specific intervention types is limited.

In a quasi- experimental evaluation, like FMCSA\u2019s annual  effectiveness evaluation, w here participants  (i.e., carriers) are not sorted randomly into  groups, the comparison group should be  constructed to be as similar as possible to the  group being influenced by the program (i.e.,  carriers receiving interventions), in order to  draw  strong conclusions about the effects of  the program. The groups should be similar  enough that any difference in outcome can be  plausibly attributed to the intervention type  being evaluated.", "FMCSA\u2019s annual and separate effectiveness evaluations had  methodological limitations that limited their ability to accurately attribute  changes in carrier safety behavior solely to interventions. Because of  these limitations, FMCSA may not have accurately accounted for factors  other than FMCSA\u2019s interventions that could be responsible for the  outcomes observed. Most notably, FMCSA did not consistently use a  comparison group design, which compares outcomes among carriers that  did and did not receive interventions, for its effectiveness evaluations.  When FMCSA did use this design, it constructed comparison groups that  did not sufficiently account for external factors that could affect group  crash rates. According to recommended practices for designing program  evaluations, comparison group designs are typical for assessing program  effectiveness, because they can isolate a program\u2019s unique effects when  the comparison groups are sufficiently similar to the groups affected by a  program.

Officials stated that they  determined that a comparison group method was not appropriate for  FMCSA\u2019s evaluation of onsite focused investigations because the officials  were concerned that a comparison group would overstate the  effectiveness of onsite focused investigations due to the differing safety  profiles of carriers that receive each intervention type. FMCSA  headquarters officials stated that they chose to use the same  methodology as the onsite focused investigation effectiveness evaluation  for the separate evaluation of offsite investigation interventions.", "Although FMCSA did use a comparison group approach in its annual  effectiveness evaluation, we identified limitations with FMCSA\u2019s approach  that affect the model\u2019s ability to accurately attribute changes in crash  rates to interventions. For example, FMCSA\u2019s comparison group was  observed over a different measurement period from the carriers that  received interventions, so that the two groups were not perfectly matched  on broad changes, such as weather and economic changes. By not  matching the measurement period, FMCSA\u2019s use of a comparison group  was limited in its ability to account for external factors, as intended.", "Additionally,  in the 2015 evaluation, FMCSA\u2019s comparison groups held  constant the effects of carrier size, but did not hold constant key factors  that could influence intervention outcomes, such as pre-intervention  safety behaviors as measured by regulatory violations or BASIC  percentiles. FMCSA headquarters officials said that comparison groups in  the model accounted only for carrier size because of data limitations and  their concern that accounting for too many additional variables would  reduce the power of the model. Specifically, officials said that FMCSA  does not currently have sufficient data to assess the effectiveness of  agency interventions for motor carriers with different characteristics, such  as the total number of miles a carrier\u2019s vehicles travel per year. However,  FMCSA has previously used the data it has available to hold constant  important factors external to the program and attribute changes in  outcomes to its interventions with greater accuracy (see app. III).  For  example, FMCSA\u2019s August 2011 evaluation of the Operational Model  Test, conducted by UMTRI,  matched groups of carriers that did and did  not receive various types of interventions on several key characteristics,  such as the distributions of pre-intervention crash rates and BASIC  percentiles.

In the past, FMCSA evaluated the efficiency of CSA  interventions using both of these elements. Specifically, UMTRI\u2019s August  2011 evaluation estimated the average cost of conducting individual  intervention types and measured the effects on carrier safety  performance of those CSA intervention types, as well as common  intervention patterns, in four pilot test states during an 8-month period  from October 2008 through May 2009.

Implemented recommendations include:  Changing FMCSA\u2019s high-risk definition and prioritization criteria: In March  2016, FMCSA adopted a change to its definition of high-risk carriers and  the criteria it used to prioritize carriers for intervention. For example, as  discussed above, for a carrier to be defined as high-risk under FMCSA\u2019s  new criteria, it has to exceed higher percentile thresholds than previously  used in any of at least two of four specified BASICs. According to  FMCSA, this decreases the total number of high-risk carriers but better  identifies carriers at a high-risk for crashes and will allow investigators to  investigate higher-risk carriers sooner, using current resources. However,  FMCSA\u2019s continued reliance on BASIC percentiles supported by  insufficient safety data, which we identified in our 2014 report and  discussed above, will limit its ability to effectively identify and prioritize the  highest-risk carriers for intervention.", "Changing criteria to receive warning letters: In January 2016, FMCSA  expanded the criteria it used to determine which motor carriers receive  warning letters in an effort to reach more carriers and, according to  FMCSA, to prevent further non-compliance before a more intensive  intervention type becomes necessary. Specifically, the CIWG  recommended that FMCSA send warning letters to carriers with BASIC  percentiles above the intervention threshold in more BASICs than  previously allowed, while shortening the time period carriers have after  receiving a warning letter to improve their safety performance before  being prioritized for an investigation intervention. The CIWG projected  that implementing the change would increase the number of warning  letters that FMCSA issued by 30 percent; however, the CIWG noted that  issuing a warning letter that is not effective may merely postpone the  eventual necessity of a carrier receiving an investigation intervention and  that issuing more frequent warning letters could dilute their effectiveness.", "Establishing intervention quality review procedures: In March 2016,  FMCSA issued two memorandums requiring field staff to use tools that  FMCSA developed to evaluate and improve the quality of some  intervention types.

Specifically, we  analyzed data from two FMCSA data systems: (1) the Motor Carrier  Management Information System (MCMIS)  and (2) the Enforcement  Management Information System (EMIS). If we determined that MCMIS  and EMIS data were sufficiently reliable, we intended to then analyze  whether there were any notable increases, decreases, or other trends in  FMCSA\u2019s application of interventions\u2014across states, regions, and motor  carrier types (e.g., fleet size). We also intended to determine common  intervention patterns when carriers receive multiple interventions (e.g.,  warning letter, then off-site investigation, then notice of violation).", "To determine the reliability of FMCSA data we requested a complete set  of all MCMIS  and EMIS data from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year  2015. To develop our request, we conducted interviews with cognizant  FMCSA officials as well as officials from the Volpe National  Transportation Systems Center, which provides technical support to  FMCSA\u2019s data analysis. We would typically review documentation to  prepare a data analysis plan; however, FMCSA could not provide up-to- date or complete data dictionaries or other reference documents for these  data systems. Thus, we requested and FMCSA provided sample data  tables and variables that we could use to identify the occurrence of each  intervention type by analyzing MCMIS  and EMIS data.", "Using the information that FMCSA provided, we performed electronic  data testing to count how frequently FMCSA conducted each intervention  type in fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2015. We then compared the  results of our analysis against FMCSA-published  sources to determine if  the results included obvious errors or outliers. While we replicated  FMCSA\u2019s counts for warning letters and unsatisfactory/unfit out-of-service  orders in all fiscal years, our comparison revealed differences in at least  one fiscal year for all remaining intervention types. We subsequently met  with FMCSA data analysis officials on several occasions to identify the  cause of the differences that we identified. FMCSA officials told us that  when they modified the algorithms used to count interventions, the  agency applied the most recent algorithm to all previous data\u2014including  historical data\u2014thereby changing the way that FMCSA counted  interventions over time. As a result, FMCSA officials told us that we could  not validate the results of our analysis against agency totals.", "After evaluating the reliability of these data for our analytical and reporting  purposes, we concluded that the data were of undetermined reliability,  because data limitations prevented an adequate and comprehensive  assessment. This precluded our analysis of trends in FMCSA\u2019s  application of interventions across states, regions, and motor carrier  types. As a substitute, we requested that FMCSA provide estimates for  how frequently it applied each intervention type from fiscal year 2010  through fiscal year 2015 to identify general trends. After reviewing  FMCSA documentation related to the estimates and interviewing  responsible FMCSA officials, we determined that FMCSA\u2019s estimates  were sufficiently reliable for this purpose.", "We reviewed relevant regulations and FMCSA guidance and policy  documents to identify how FMCSA should implement and apply  interventions.

Similarly, we selected two states from  each service center. Although the information obtained from our  interviews with officials from the selected states is not generalizable to all  states or FMCSA divisions, it provided illustrative examples of how  FMCSA is applying interventions as well as the perspectives of officials  knowledgeable about the program.

The January 2015  evaluation report assessed two intervention types that existed prior to the  Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) program, including compliance  review investigations and Performance and Registration Information  Systems Management letters, and four new CSA intervention types,  including warning letters, offsite investigations, onsite focused  investigations, and onsite comprehensive investigations.", "To estimate the impact of these interventions, the CIEM measures the  difference between crash rates among carriers in the treatment group  before and after receiving interventions, and then subtracts the difference  in crash rates among carriers in the comparison group. The comparison  group accounts for confounding factors (other than FMCSA interventions)  that may affect safety performance during the post-intervention period,  such as broad changes in weather or economic conditions.", "The model is designed to estimate the impact of interventions carried out  in a single fiscal year and measures crash rates over a 12-month period  following the first intervention a carrier receives in the fiscal year. The  model estimates the combined impact of all interventions performed  during 12-month periods, not the unique impact of each individual  intervention type.", "We identified the following limitations:", "Lack of process evaluation: The CIEM is designed to evaluate  impact, but does not include a process study. According to accepted  practices for designing program evaluations, a program logic model or  process evaluation that identifies the most important external  influences on desired program outcomes is valuable in planning an  impact evaluation that convincingly rules out most plausible  alternative explanations for the observed results. Process  evaluations clarify the program as implemented and specify which of  its activities may be responsible for the observed outcomes. The CSA  program\u2019s logic model might include elements of the CSA program,  such as FMCSA and state safety inspectors and information systems,  roadside inspections, safety interventions, and crashes, injuries,  deaths, and monetary losses prevented.", "Without an initial process evaluation, the impact evaluation cannot  precisely identify what aspects of the program affect safety outcomes,  or whether the estimated impacts reflect the program as designed.  Without studying the program\u2019s implementation and comparing its  theoretical logic model to actual practices, it is uncertain whether  impact estimates represent the effectiveness of the program\u2019s  activities as designed or the activities that program staff happened to  have used in practice. The CIEM\u2019s ability to accurately evaluate the  impact of the CSA program could be improved by taking into account  the program\u2019s strategy and goals, and studying how the program is  implemented.", "Exclusion of intervention types: The January 2015 evaluation  report did not include all intervention types. According to the report,  the evaluation did not assess cooperative safety plans or direct  notices of violation and direct notices of claim, because data on these  intervention types had inconsistent completeness and accuracy.  FMCSA officials told us that the evaluation included carriers that  received follow-on notices of violation or claim, but it did not  separately estimate their effects. When notices of violation or claim  follow an investigation, the model implicitly estimates their effects in  the post-intervention crash rate. However, the evaluation could have  excluded some carriers that received a notice as their first intervention  in the modeled year but not in the same fiscal year as the  investigation.", "Aggregation of intervention types: The CIEM implicitly estimates  how combinations of interventions affect safety, not the effects of  each individual intervention type. The model identifies only the first  intervention that a carrier receives in the modeled year, and estimates  the intervention\u2019s effect on crash rates from that time of first contact.", "According to FMCSA officials, the model is designed to evaluate the  effect of general FMCSA contact with carriers through interventions.  Officials said that they tested some alternatives to using the first  intervention in the fiscal year, including using a carrier\u2019s most severe  or last intervention in the fiscal year. Agency staff told us that they  ultimately preferred to use the first intervention, because it  represented the beginning of FMCSA\u2019s influence on a carrier within  the target time period.", "FMCSA did not seek to estimate the effectiveness of individual  intervention types, because agency staff had concerns about the  small amount of data available on specific intervention types and  common intervention patterns when carriers receive multiple  interventions over time. FMCSA officials stated that Volpe conducted  preliminary analysis of the data used for the CIEM to determine  potential sample sizes, but did not provide documentation on the  sample sizes for each intervention type or common patterns of  interventions. The challenges arising from small sample sizes could  potentially be addressed by pooling together data from multiple years,  rather than relying on intervention data from one fiscal year.", "Recommended practices of program and policy evaluation  recommend that program managers attempt to separately evaluate  multiple types of program activities that seek to achieve a common  outcome. Such \u201ccomparative effectiveness (or efficiency)\u201d  evaluations give managers information on how various activities  perform compared to each other. Variation in outcomes across  settings or populations can be the result of variation in program  operations, such as varying types or levels of enforcement. Further,  variation in outcomes associated with features under program control,  such as different agency activities, may identify opportunities for  managers to take action to improve performance.", "To obtain this kind of information on comparative effectiveness, the  treatment effects of interventions could be disaggregated into more  nuanced categories than having at least one intervention. This  approach could directly evaluate how each of several intervention  types, or common intervention patterns, affect safety outcomes.  Detailed performance information would better align with the design of  the CSA program and give staff flexibility to choose from a range of  intervention types that can address each carrier\u2019s unique safety  problems. With evidence of comparative effectiveness and efficiency,  FMCSA would have better information on whether specific CSA  interventions or combinations of interventions are more effective than  others in certain circumstances.", "The challenges from small sample sizes on particular interventions  could be addressed in several ways. Pooling together data from  multiple years, rather than relying on intervention data from one fiscal  year, might produce a sufficient sample for evaluating less commonly  used interventions. A multi-year design might become viable as the  CSA program continues to produce data over several years, though  pooling data might increase the potential for unmeasured factors to  influence safety outcomes. A process evaluation, as discussed above,  could clarify how FMCSA field staff and state partners have  implemented the program and could identify intervention types, or  specific combinations of interventions, with sufficient data for analysis.", "Regression to the mean: The CIEM design does not fully account for  the possibility that variation over time in the treatment group\u2019s safety  outcomes reflects regression to the mean. Regression to the mean is  a statistical phenomenon in which, following an extreme measurement  assumed to be due to random sources of variation, such as sampling  error, subsequent measurements are likely to be closer to the  average, or mean.", "Under the CSA program, FMCSA prioritizes carriers to receive  interventions based on whether the carriers\u2019 percentiles exceed pre- determined thresholds in any of seven behavioral analysis and safety  improvement categories (BASIC). FMCSA\u2019s decision to intervene  with a carrier largely depends on BASIC percentiles, and officials use  these percentiles, in addition to other criteria set out in guidance, to  determine which type of intervention to apply. This is especially true  for carriers that exceed the thresholds intended to identify the highest  risk carriers, because FMCSA policy requires that those carriers  receive onsite investigations.", "However, some carriers, especially those with few inspections or  vehicles, may go above the intervention threshold in one  measurement period due to anomalous events, but return below the  threshold in the next measurement period due to factors unrelated to  intervention. For example, a carrier may generally violate vehicle  maintenance regulations at the industry average rate over the long- term. The carrier\u2019s estimated violation rate in FMCSA data\u2014and its  related BASIC percentile\u2014may vary around the long-term average in  any particular period. The degree of variation could reflect the actual  inconsistency of the carrier\u2019s maintenance practices over time or  sampling error in the estimation of its violation rate, related to its  frequency of inspection (exposure to violating regulations). A large  deviation in one period from the long-term average could exceed  BASIC percentile thresholds and trigger additional FMCSA oversight,  but the deviation may not reflect a real change in the carrier\u2019s long- term maintenance behavior. In a subsequent period, the carrier\u2019s  BASIC percentile has a higher probability of returning to the long-term  average than continuing at the extreme from the previous period,  assuming the prior deviation was caused by random sources of  variation, such as sampling error. The same process may apply to  crash rates.", "According to recommended practices for evaluating the impact of a  program, the evaluation must be carefully designed to rule out  plausible alternative explanations for the results. The CIEM\u2019s quasi- experiment design implicitly controls for differences across carriers  that do not vary substantially over short time periods, which could  include carrier management practices, leadership, and operating  routes and procedures. The design controls for industry-wide changes  over time that are constant across carriers, changes that could include  weather and economic conditions. Lastly, the design explicitly controls  for carrier size by stratifying the analysis by size groups. Although the  size control may account for differences within carriers over time  among the treatment carriers, the model includes few other controls  that might specifically address this potential threat to valid causal  inference. By not fully accounting for regression to the mean, the  CIEM could be attributing changes in outcomes to CSA interventions,  when those changes would have occurred on their own without  intervention.", "Accordingly, there is some evidence that some carriers\u2019 safety  behavior improves without intervention. For example, the Independent  Review Team found that, of the carriers FMCSA prioritized for  intervention in 2013, nearly 33 percent had a BASIC percentile above  threshold when assigned for intervention that was no longer above  threshold at the time of the review, suggesting that carriers\u2019 safety  performance may improve naturally without intervention. As we have  previously reported, carriers with fewer vehicles experience wide  variance in crash and violation rates, which can make them especially  prone to regression to the mean.", "An alternative design might compare carriers just above and just  below the intervention-triggering  threshold (at a given point in time).  This \u201cregression discontinuity\u201d design would lend itself better to  interventions triggered automatically when carriers exceed some  threshold and would better reflect the nature of the CSA program, as  recommended in accepted practices for evaluation design.", "Another alternative approach that could address the regression to the  mean issue would be to match carriers based on variation over time in  the safety outcomes prior to exceeding a BASIC percentile threshold.  This design would fall into a general class of methods that include  pre-treatment outcomes as an additional covariate. This would  enhance the comparison group\u2019s control for any deviations in the  outcome over time prior to treatment and thereby ensure that  treatment carriers would be matched to comparison carriers with  similar outcome dynamics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparison Group", "paragraphs": ["The CIEM constructs comparison groups using carriers that did not  receive any of the model\u2019s interventions during the modeled, prior, or  subsequent year. The model assigns carriers to one of several  comparison groups, using the same measure of size\u2014the number of  vehicles\u2014used to assign carriers to treatment groups. These separate  comparison groups are intended to eliminate differences associated with  carrier size from the model\u2019s calculation of adjusted crash rates.", "We identified the following limitation:", "Limited control: Accepted practices for program evaluation would  classify the CIEM as a \u201cquasi-experimental\u201d design for estimating  impact. Quasi-experimental designs compare outcomes in a treatment  group to outcomes in a comparison group formed using non-random  assignment. Due to the lack of randomized assignment, the treatment  and comparison groups may differ on other factors that affect the  outcome. To compensate for this potential bias, evaluators generally  ensure that such confounding variables are held constant in the  construction of the comparison group or use other methods of  adjustment.", "The CIEM explicitly holds constant one factor in the construction of its  comparison group: carrier size. The model implicitly controls for all  factors that vary between the treatment and control groups but remain  constant over time, such as state or region of operation. In addition,  the model implicitly controls for all factors that vary over time and  affect the treatment and comparison groups equivalently,  such as  industry-wide effects due to weather or economic conditions.", "The CIEM\u2019s \u201cdifference-in-difference\u201d design provides these forms of  implicit control, and thus is a key strength of the model. However,  FMCSA might try to construct a more robust comparison group that  explicitly controls for more than just carrier size. Since the design  controls for variables that are fixed across carriers and vary in the  same ways within groups over time, FMCSA might construct a  comparison group that controls for change across multiple variables. If  reliable data were available, then potential variables could include:  multiple measures of size; state of registration, inspections, or  violations; driver characteristics; pre-treatment safety outcomes; pre- treatment BASIC percentiles; and pre-treatment inspections and  regulatory violations. Controlling for pre-treatment outcomes and  BASIC percentiles would be especially desirable and would address  the potential limitation of regression to the mean because the  fluctuations due to sampling error would be controlled by design.", "Data availability  and reliability  may limit FMCSA\u2019s ability to include  additional control variables to construct comparison groups. For  example, the 2015 evaluation report notes that data on vehicle miles  traveled\u2014a measure of carrier exposure to crashes\u2014were less  reliable than vehicle count data because, according to officials, they  were sometimes incomplete or inconsistent across carriers. Similarly,  officials told us that FMCSA considered using carrier operation type to  construct comparison groups, but ultimately did not because some  carriers reported multiple operation types or changed their operation  types over time. Given the central importance of the CSA program to  FMCSA\u2019s enforcement efforts, the agency would benefit from  improving or expanding data collection to support a more robust  model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Observation Periods", "paragraphs": ["The CIEM defines different observation periods for the treatment and  control groups. For the treatment group, the CIEM uses the date of the  first intervention in the modeled fiscal year as the demarcation between a  12-month pre-intervention period and a 12-month post-intervention  period. Pre- and post-intervention crash rates are measured for these 12- month periods. For the comparison group, in contrast, the CIEM defines  18-month periods preceding and following the midpoint of the modeled  fiscal year to measure pre- and post-intervention crash rates. (This is  because comparison carriers do not have an intervention date to define  the pre- and post-intervention periods and measure crash rates.) The  evaluation report noted that these longer 18-month periods ensure that  the comparison group\u2019s crash rates cover the entire treatment group time  frame. To adjust for the 50 percent longer observation period for carriers  in the comparison group, the evaluation divided crash rates for those  carriers by 1.5 to yield annual crash rates.", "We identified the following limitation:  Inconsistent time periods: According to accepted practices for  program impact evaluation, a design must confidently rule out non- program influences that could cause changes in outcomes to occur.  The CIEM does not completely account for factors that might have  affected crash rates for both treatment and comparison groups,  because the lack of overlap between the measurement time periods  does not hold constant factors unique to the season or period of  measurement. For example, as FMCSA officials noted to us, crash  rates are known to depend on seasonal and periodic changes in  weather, and the model\u2019s lack of overlap in measurement time periods  meant that treatment and comparison groups were subject to different  seasonal and periodic conditions. Other potential confounding  variables include seasonal or periodic variation in economic demand  and state enforcement resources.", "The design might use measurement periods that vary as a function of  each observed intervention\u2019s timing and characteristics. For example,  the design might construct a custom comparison group for each  member of the treatment group, selecting multiple comparison carriers  using size and other potential confounding variables.

The January 2015 evaluation notes that FMCSA assumed that  these carriers will exhibit the same response to intervention as the  carriers included in the model. Accordingly, the model adds the estimated  safety benefits for carriers included in the model to those for carriers with  outliers and missing data. The sum determines the aggregate estimated  safety benefits. According to the 2015 evaluation report, FMCSA  extrapolated safety benefits to the following number of carriers that  received an intervention but were not included in the model: 9,567  carriers in fiscal year 2009; 9,929 carriers in fiscal year 2010, and; 14,816  carriers in fiscal year 2011.", "We identified the following limitations:", "Multiple hypothesis tests: The model uses multiple statistical  hypothesis tests to calculate total safety benefits.

These  adjustments typically produce lower alpha values for each individual  test.", "Multiple  hypothesis testing methods would be appropriate for the  CIEM, given that it ultimately seeks to estimate total safety benefits as  a function of multiple hypothesis tests. Without making these  adjustments, the CIEM\u2019s estimates of total safety benefits may have  more risk of error than FMCSA intends to accept because the model  does not conduct a joint test. That is, the probability that at least one  group\u2019s safety benefits equals zero may exceed the 0.05 confidence  level that FMCSA accepts in each individual  test. An alternative  approach might calculate the confidence interval of the summed  safety benefit estimate and test whether it equals zero, consistent with  the discussion below.", "Confidence intervals of estimated impacts: The CIEM uses  inferential statistical methods to test the hypothesis that the impact for  each pair of treatment and control groups equals zero. However, the  CIEM does not conduct statistical inference, such as estimating  confidence intervals, when analyzing the net change in crash rates  and associated total safety benefits. This approach is inconsistent,  given that the model\u2019s hypothesis test for a non-zero net change in  crash rates implies that the quantity is a random variable with a  sampling distribution and confidence interval. The model\u2019s authors  agree with this implication, suggesting that the test is equivalent to a  \u201c95 percent confidence interval that does not include zero.\u201d Total  safety benefits must also have a confidence interval, given that it is a  function of the change in net crash rates. Nevertheless, the CIEM  reports only point estimates of safety benefits, without conveying the  statistical uncertainty that the model\u2019s assumptions imply.", "Accordingly, the CIEM might estimate and report confidence intervals  for its estimates of crash rate impact and safety benefits, in order to  make the statistical inference consistent and quantify the uncertainty  of its estimates. The current hypothesis testing approach may  produce a point estimate for safety benefits that appears more precise  than the underlying confidence interval would support."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, H.
