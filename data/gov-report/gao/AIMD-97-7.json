Grants-in-aid are payments from the federal government to state and local governments to help them finance activities in areas such as public assistance, highway construction, and education. In addition to these well known areas, grants also finance many lesser known areas, such as public libraries, sport fish restoration, and boating safety. In fiscal year 1995, the federal government allocated $225 billion for more than 600 grant programs\u2014about 15 percent of total federal spending and 23 percent of total state spending. However, the largest 87 programs accounted for 95 percent of total grant funds.", "Federal grants have been established to achieve a variety of goals, and it is for the Congress to decide among the various objectives for grants and the manner in which the federal government allocates the aid. In this report, you asked us to focus on the extent to which the grant system succeeds in two objectives frequently cited by public finance experts: (1) encouraging states to use federal dollars to supplement rather than replace their own spending on nationally important activities and (2) targeting grant funding to states with relatively greater programmatic needs and fewer fiscal resources.", "The first issue concerns the extent to which federal grant dollars replace state dollars, often referred to as substitution or supplantation. Public finance experts suggest that one objective of federal grants is to increase spending beyond what states would have spent anyway for the aided services. However, to the degree states use federal funds to free up their own resources for other state priorities, specific-purpose federal funds are, in effect, converted to general fiscal relief. The second issue concerns the extent to which federal dollars are distributed to balance differences among the states in three areas\u2014program needs, ability to fund grant activities without federal assistance (state fiscal capacity), and service costs.", "This examination of the fiscal impact of grants adds to a larger body of GAO work on design issues in certain federal subsidy programs. It expands on our case studies of grant targeting for specific programs by analyzing all formula grants and helps to answer whether grants, like some loan programs and tax expenditures we have examined, experience efficiency losses as funds flow through a network of third parties, who either have their own spending priorities or would have undertaken the subsidized activity even without federal assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Intergovernmental grants are a significant part of both federal and state budgets. From the first annual cash grant under the Hatch Act of 1887, the number of grant programs rose to more than 600 in 1995 with outlays of $225 billion, or about 15 percent of total federal spending. Most federal grant programs are small and serve narrow purposes, while a few large programs\u2014such as Medicaid and the Highway Planning and Construction Program\u2014dominate the grant-in-aid system. Of the 633 grants we reviewed, 87 programs\u2014or 14 percent\u2014accounted for 95 percent of total grant funding.", "In 1995, federal grants accounted for about 23 percent of total state spending. Here too there is variation in the federal share of state spending across categories used by the Census Bureau. Grants accounted for about 60 percent of public welfare and 64 percent of housing and community development spending. The federal share was much smaller in other categories, about 8 percent overall.", "In theory, grants are to serve purposes beyond returning resources to taxpayers in the form of state services. Grants also can serve as a tool to encourage states to spend federal funds for nationally important activities for which they otherwise would have spent less. The amount of additional spending is affected by the degree to which federal grant funds actually supplement state funds. Public finance literature uses the term substitution to characterize situations in which states use federal grant dollars to reduce their own spending for the aided program either initially or over time. To illustrate how substitution works, if states use federal funds to replace state spending on a dollar-for-dollar basis, then federally aided state services would remain at pre-grant levels\u2014in which case the fiscal impact of the additional federal dollar on the intended program is zero. In practice, substitution effects are not this extreme; total state spending rises upon receiving federal grant funds\u2014but by less than the full amount of the grant because states reduce their own spending for the area. In effect, substitution allows a portion of federal grant funds to be spent on other state priorities.", "Figure 1 illustrates how substitution would work for a hypothetical state spending $5 on an activity and receiving $1 in federal grant funds for that activity. As previously noted, federal grant dollars are rarely used dollar-for-dollar to supplement state spending on aided activities. However, we show this case in the top part of the figure as a contrast to the expenditure level that might result when substitution occurs. We show substitution at 60 cents to correspond to the approximate midpoint of the range of estimates we reviewed. The figure indicates that with substitution, although the federal grant dollar is spent on the aided program, the state can reduce its own spending by about 60 cents so that total spending increases by 40 cents. The state can then reallocate the 60 cents that has been freed up. In this regard, the figure shows the two options cited by economists\u2014spending on other state priorities or tax relief. For example, states could spend their freed up funds for other public goods they value, such as education, transportation, or corrections. Or, states could reduce or maintain existing tax rates or slow the rate of increase.", "As noted, there are a variety of approaches available to distribute grants among the states. Public finance experts suggest that grants can be targeted to states with relatively greater programmatic needs and fewer fiscal resources. In program areas where states share financing responsibilities with the federal government, service levels depend to an important extent on state fiscal capacities. For example, after adjusting for differences in state service costs, the fiscal burden on Mississippi of providing a given level of public services is greater than the burden on Connecticut because Mississippi has about three-fourths the tax base of Connecticut. Where the federal government has sought a minimum or more comparable level of a service for all potential beneficiaries\u2014 regardless of where they live\u2014grants can help reduce disparities between the capacities of wealthier and poorer communities to provide that service. Our past studies of individual grant programs have led us to conclude that grants can be designed to reduce differences between states\u2019 fiscal resources and programmatic needs by designing formulas that allocate funds according to measures of states\u2019 program needs, fiscal capacities, and service costs. In those studies, we also commented on the importance of using data that accurately capture differences in these factors across states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Roles Grants Have Played", "paragraphs": ["The objectives examined in this report are those most often put forward by public finance experts: (1) encouraging states to spend more for public goods that appear underfunded from a national perspective, and (2) offsetting the differences between states\u2019 programmatic needs in federally aided functions and their fiscal resources. Grants have played other roles in intergovernmental relations as well. For example, grants have been used to provide states with (1) funding to offset the costs of meeting federal regulatory standards or administering federal regulatory programs, (2) counter-cyclical assistance in times of economic downturns, (3) general purpose fiscal assistance (e.g., general revenue sharing), and (4) performance incentives to improve or enhance existing programs. Appendix I contains a more detailed discussion of the various roles grants have played."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To examine substitution in the grant system, we synthesized the body of econometric literature which statistically isolated the fiscal impact of federal grant funds and estimated their impact on total spending. We used this approach because conventional auditing methods were not sufficient to answer the questions about substitution. Such methods do not control for state spending that would have occurred without a federal grant and cannot sort out the effects of other factors, such as population and state income growth, that also influence state spending. Thus, an audit of a federal grant program might demonstrate that all federal funds were spent on the authorized activities. However, because the audit could not observe the level of state spending that would have occurred without the grant, it could not detect substitution in the form of reductions from that unobserved level.", "To examine targeting in the grant system, we developed a statistical model to determine the extent to which federal aid in the aggregate is allocated to offset differences between state programmatic needs and fiscal resources (see appendix IV for a description of this model). We did not analyze targeting for individual grant programs because there is less consensus on\u2014and few readily available and suitable proxies for\u2014measures of individual grant program needs and costs. For this reason, our prior work on federal grant targeting has proceeded using a program-by-program approach, with each case study requiring substantial work to identify and validate suitable proxies for state programmatic needs and costs. For this report, our model used state population as the primary measure of state programmatic need. The model also controlled for a variety of other state need indicators, such as measures of poverty, housing age, highway mileage, and service costs. Controlling for programmatic needs and costs enabled us to isolate more accurately the statistical effect of state fiscal capacities on federal grant allocations.", "In addition to this statistical analysis, our examination of substitution and targeting included (1) a comprehensive review of over 120 journal articles, reports, and econometric studies on substitution, targeting, and grant design factors related to both, (2) a synthesis of 50 econometric studies of federal grants, culminating in the development of point and range estimates of fiscal impact overall as well as for different time periods and grant designs, (3) a review of 23 GAO reports on options to achieve greater targeting in specific formula grant programs, and (4) an analysis of grants for design features associated with substitution and targeting. Our analysis of the design features associated with fiscal substitution was for both all 633 grants and separately for the largest 87 programs representing 95 percent of grant funds. Our analysis of the design features associated with targeting was for the 149 formula grants that represented 85 percent of grant funds. We excluded project grants, which are awarded on a discretionary basis, because of the difficulty of generalizing about targeting based on individual grant decisions.", "Because grant implementation issues were outside the scope of our analysis, this report cannot be used to draw conclusions about how well a jurisdiction uses grant funds or who benefits. In addition to design features, two important determinants of a grant\u2019s fiscal impact are states\u2019 priorities, which may differ from the federal government\u2019s, and program management, which may differ across states. To illustrate, a grant for computer education programs might feature few of the design features to limit substitution, but shared goals and objectives could result in states using the grant funds they receive to increase substantially total spending on computer education. Or, a grant for health services to low-income children could lack equity factors that target funds to states with higher concentrations of such children. Notwithstanding the lack of targeting, however, a state could still spend more of each federal assistance dollar it receives to serve its low-income children than another state receiving more grant funds. Just as the presence of suitable design features does not guarantee that funds will be allocated efficiently or equitably, so the absence of such features alone does not prove that they are not.", "We asked well-known public finance experts as well as experts on state and local government to review a draft of this report and incorporated their suggestions where appropriate. Appendix II contains a more detailed description of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grant Design Influences Fiscal Substitution", "paragraphs": ["The economic literature we reviewed suggested that three types of grant design features affect the likelihood that states will use federal funds to supplement, rather than replace, their own spending. These features work by (1) restricting the use of funds to specified purposes, (2) requiring recipients to contribute their own funds to obtain grant funds, and (3) not restricting federal matching of state funds.", "The first type of feature concerns the extent to which grant purposes are restricted. Categorical grants, which fund narrow-purpose activities, such as nutrition for the elderly, are the most restricted. Block grants, which fund broader categories of activities, such as community development, are less restricted. General purpose grants, such as revenue sharing, require only that the funds be spent for government purposes. Generally speaking, experts agree that conditions attached to aid can encourage states to use federal funds as a supplement if the conditions are binding. Conditions are more likely to be binding if states are not already spending their own funds for that purpose. For example, a state with no computer education program in its schools would be more likely to spend a federal computer education grant on its intended purpose than a state that had already invested its own funds in such a program. If the state that had already invested funds in computer education was satisfied with pre-grant spending levels, it would be more likely to substitute the federal grant funds for its own and shift state funds to other priorities.", "The second type of feature concerns requirements that states contribute their own funds in order to receive federal matching funds. Economic theory suggests that grants requiring matching result in less substitution than those that do not because, by lowering the effective price of aided programs relative to other state spending priorities, they encourage states to invest more of their own funds. Matching grants typically contain either a single rate (e.g., 50 percent) or a range of rates (e.g., 50 percent to 80 percent) at which the federal government will match state spending on an aided program. Experts agree that federal matching rates should correspond to the share of benefits that accrue to non-state residents. Public finance economists have argued that federal shares of less than 50 percent are appropriate, recognizing that in-state residents generally receive the predominant share of the benefits from most federally aided programs, such as education or transportation.", "Another feature, maintenance-of-effort, requires states to maintain existing levels of state spending on an aided program as a condition of receiving federal funds. By requiring states to maintain a given level of spending from their own funds in addition to the federal grant funds they receive, maintenance-of-effort can prevent substitution in those programs where there is no federal matching requirement or where state spending exceeds the minimum required state match.", "As we have noted elsewhere, designing effective maintenance-of-effort provisions can be difficult because it requires balancing federal interests against states\u2019 desire for flexibility in planning and implementing grant programs. Experts suggest that maintenance-of-effort provisions should keep pace with both inflation and program growth so that state spending efforts are truly maintained over time. But maintenance-of-effort requirements can penalize states that take the initiative to start programs without federal aid by locking them into prior spending levels when federal grant funds become available. In contrast, states without prior spending programs are implicitly rewarded for their lack of initiative because they would be required to maintain a lower base of spending in exchange for the federal grant. As a result, the prospect of such requirements could defer state program innovation until federal funds become available.", "The third type of feature concerns the extent to which federal funding for a program is limited. Grants are considered \u201copen-ended\u201d when there is no limit on federal matching, and \u201cclosed-ended\u201d when total federal matching funds are capped. The influence of federal matching is essentially the same for both types of grants until a state obtains the maximum federal contribution for a closed-ended grant. After this point, closed-ended grants no longer match additional state spending on aided activities and lose their price incentive. Therefore, a state spending beyond the amount needed to obtain maximum federal funding is doing so without any price inducement. From this economists have concluded that the state would likely have spent some its own funds without the federal matching incentive, and federal funds have substituted for some of the state\u2019s own resources.", "Although we discuss the influence of grant design in terms of isolated features, in practice they work in combination. For example, when total federal spending for a grant is capped, maintenance-of-effort provisions that track inflation and program growth can increase the likelihood that federal dollars will supplement rather than replace state spending even after the cap is reached. Similarly, a grant which allows a wide range of uses within a broadly defined federal objective may still contain matching and/or maintenance-of-effort features to reduce the likelihood of substitution. Appendix III contains a more detailed discussion of the grant design features that influence state spending.", "Apart from design features, other factors, such as the amount of state spending relative to federal spending and state programmatic preferences, can also influence the impact of a federal grant on total spending. For example, a non-matching categorical grant without maintenance-of-effort is more likely to supplement state spending in areas where state governments have invested few, if any, of their own funds. Conversely, when a state is already spending an amount from its own resources that exceeds the amount of federal aid for a program, categorical restrictions are less likely to be effective because the state could spend all the grant funds on the intended program, but reduce spending from its own funds by the same amount. In this case, the categorical grant has the same effect on total program spending as an unrestricted grant, and the state will use the resources released in accordance with its own spending priorities, which will not necessarily be the same as the federal government\u2019s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies Show Grants Replace a Portion of State Funds", "paragraphs": ["There is a substantial body of econometric research on the impact of federal grants on state spending spanning the period from the late 1950s to recent years. Our review and synthesis of this body of work found that beginning around 1978, a consensus view emerged that each additional federal grant dollar contributed to increased total spending on aided functions, but, because of substitution, total spending increased by less than a dollar. Of the studies we reviewed, three-fourths of the estimates from studies published since 1978 indicated some substitution, i.e., that $1 of federal grant aid did not increase total spending in a state by $1. Estimates from these studies suggest that a median of nearly 60 cents of every federal dollar is used to replace state and local funds that otherwise would have been spent on the aided activity. That is, for every dollar of additional federal aid, states have withdrawn about 60 cents of their own spending. Omitting extreme high and low estimates, the middle 50 percent (mid-range) of these estimates was between 11 and 74 cents. Table 1 contains a summary of the grant impact estimates we reviewed.", "As shown in table 1, the econometric studies we reviewed support the view that certain grant design features promote relatively more total spending on aided activities. Matching programs generally involved less substitution than non-matching programs. Our synthesis suggests that 85 cents of every additional matching dollar represented new spending, implying that states have withdrawn 15 cents of their own resources. For non-matching programs, 42 cents of every additional federal dollar resulted in new spending, implying that states have withdrawn 58 cents of their own resources. Open-ended programs were associated with the smallest amount of substitution and may even have stimulated additional state spending over and above the amount of federal aid they received. Every additional federal dollar for open-ended matching programs resulted in $1.38 of new spending, suggesting that states have contributed 38 cents of their own resources to such programs. Given that the estimates for open-ended programs ranged from 71 cents (substitutive) to $1.74 (stimulative), caution should be used in drawing the conclusion that such programs generally have stimulated additional state spending. However, as the first column in the table shows, the expenditure impacts of open-ended programs generally exceeded those of closed-ended programs, which resulted in a median of 54 cents of new spending (ranging from 37 cents to $1.04).", "The studies we reviewed examined the impact of grants on total spending as well as on categories of spending for service areas, such as education, health, highways, and welfare. Our analysis did not provide support for any differences in the expenditure impact of grants across those service areas. Nevertheless, studies from the 1980s and 1990s in the areas of education, highways, and sewage suggested that states have withdrawn some of their own funds in response to federal grants. For example:", "Education: Craig and Inman\u2019s (1982) study of the impact of an additional dollar of federal education grants to state and local governments on total education spending from federal, state, and local sources found substitution effects ranging from more than a dollar for unrestricted federal grants (total spending decreased $1.06 for each $1.00 in grants) and non-matching, categorical grants (total spending decreased $1.30), to 14 cents for grants with maintenance-of-effort provisions (total spending increased 86 cents). The study found matching categorical grants actually had fiscal impacts on total education spending that were larger than $1.00 (total education spending increased $1.05).", "Highways: Meyers (1987) and Stotsky (1991) studied the impact of an additional dollar of closed-ended matching grant funds for highway construction on state spending and found substitution rates of 63 and 95 cents, respectively. That is, for every $1 in federal aid, states used between 63 and 95 cents to fund other priorities. Meyers also tested whether the 63 cents of federal funds that was not spent on highway construction was used for tax relief. He rejected that hypothesis, finding instead that states most likely used the funds for other non-aided transportation priorities, such as maintenance.", "Sewage systems: Jondrow and Levy\u2019s (1984) study of the impact of an additional dollar of Environmental Protection Agency sewage system construction grants on local spending on sewage systems found that local governments substituted 67 cents for their own spending on sewage treatment plants and sewer lines. The authors also estimated the impact of federal grants on sewer lines alone and found complete substitution. The authors concluded that this occurred because, unlike treatment plants which generate benefits for surrounding localities, sewer lines have purely local benefits and would be fully funded even without a federal grant. Therefore, the federal grants simply displaced, rather than supplemented, local spending.", "Because most of the research we reviewed studied periods when resources and spending were increasing, caution should be used in drawing conclusions about how states would respond to reductions in federal grant spending. Evidence of substitution does not necessarily mean that states would replace cuts in federal grant programs with funds from their own sources. However, states may be more likely to replace cuts in federal funds used to fund ongoing state operations and priorities. From a federal perspective, this state replacement might be viewed as a positive event. But from a state perspective, because federal funds have been woven into the structure of state budgets, replacing cuts in federal funds would require cutting funds for other state programs, raising taxes, or both.", "Few have studied state responses to federal aid reductions, and those that have provide a mixed picture. Using a case study approach, Nathan (1987) found that state governments replaced funding for some federal programs cut during the 1980s, particularly those that were not highly redistributive, had active constituencies, or were primarily managed by state rather than federal agencies. Our prior work on the effect of reductions in federal grants during the 1980s generally supported Nathan\u2019s conclusion that states replaced some of the federal cuts. We reported that states used three strategies to mitigate federal funding reductions that occurred in most block grant programs during the early 1980s. These involved states (1) taking advantage of available funds from the categorical programs that preceded the block grants, (2) transferring funds among block grants, and (3) increasing the use of state funds. However, in a more recent econometric study of local responses to federal cutbacks during the 1980s, Stine (1994) found that local governments did not raise local revenues to replace permanent losses in federal aid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grants Lack Features to Discourage Substitution", "paragraphs": ["Currently, the grant system is comprised of 633 conditional grants, of which 617 are narrow-purpose categorical grants and 16 are broader-purpose block grants. The federal government has not provided any unconditional grants since the General Revenue Sharing program, which ended in 1986. Table 2 summarizes the design features of all 633 grants. However, because 95 percent of the funds are associated with the 87 largest grant programs, we also summarized the design features of the 87 largest grants in table 3.", "Of the 87 largest grant programs, 15 were block (26 percent of funds) and 72 were narrow-purpose, categorical (74 percent of funds). To some extent, then, the federal grant system is designed around narrow federal purposes, suggesting fewer opportunities for substitution. However, if states are already spending more of their own funds than the federal government provides for these block and categorical programs, the purposes for which the federal aid is to be spent are less likely to be binding, and the potential for substitution is higher.", "With regard to other design features we reviewed, few federal grants contain the combination of design features that would encourage states to maintain their spending levels and reduce the extent of substitution. About half the 87 largest grants, representing 30 percent of the funds for those programs, did not require state matching. Of the grants containing matching provisions, almost all had federal shares in excess of 50 percent. This stands in contrast to expert views that federal shares should generally be less than 50 percent to correspond with the benefits non-state residents receive. In sum, 97 percent of the largest grants\u2014corresponding to 99 percent of total grant funds\u2014had federal shares between 50 and 100 percent.", "Furthermore, 89 percent of the largest grant programs\u2014representing 48 percent of the funds for those programs ($98.4 billion)\u2014were closed-ended. Excluding the largest open-ended program\u2014Medicaid\u2014 from this total, 85 percent of the remaining grant funds were for closed-ended programs. Closed-ended programs may result in substitution when state spending exceeds the amount necessary to obtain federal matching funds. At this level of spending, unless strong maintenance-of-effort provisions are attached, the federal match loses its price incentive, and can become\u2014in effect\u2014general purpose income to states. According to a number of studies we reviewed, state spending for most closed-ended grant programs was well beyond the amount needed to obtain the maximum level of federal funds. Because this additional state spending has occurred without the incentive provided by federal matching rates exceeding 50 percent, the studies concluded that such generous federal matching rates may be unnecessary to induce existing levels of state spending in those areas.", "Finally, 16 of the largest 87 programs\u2014representing 58 percent of the funds for those programs\u2014had maintenance-of-effort provisions that would encourage states to maintain a defined contribution to those programs. A well-designed maintenance-of-effort provision can deter substitution in a grant program, particularly in those programs with no matching requirement or where state spending already exceeds the amount needed to meet federal matching requirements. To determine if federal maintenance-of-effort provisions were designed to keep pace with program growth, we looked at the top eight closed-ended programs with maintenance-of-effort provisions. We found that none of the maintenance-of-effort provisions sampled were designed to keep pace with inflation or case-load growth. For example, the maintenance-of-effort requirement for the Special Programs for the Aging grant stipulates that states need only spend an amount equal to the average of the 3 previous fiscal years in order to avoid reduced federal funding. States could maintain spending at this historical average and still substitute. Substitution could occur if states use new or increased federal funds to finance case-load growth or inflation they otherwise would have had to finance.

Others might argue that this substitution serves the purpose of providing budgetary relief to the states. They might also prefer that the fiscal relief be allocated to more fiscally stressed states. These are policy questions that only the Congress can decide. If policymakers seek to target aid to fiscally stressed states, the question arises as to whether such aid is allocated to those states with relatively greater programmatic needs and fewer fiscal resources.", "We examined whether existing federal grant allocations can be justified on the grounds that they provide budgetary relief to fiscally stressed states.We found that, controlling for differences in programmatic needs, grant allocations to states were not significantly higher for states with relatively fewer fiscal resources. Specifically, the variable we used to measure fiscal capacity\u2014total taxable resources\u2014was not a statistically significant factor in targeting funds to lower-capacity states, controlling for differences in state (1) program needs, such as poverty, population under age 18, and highway miles, and (2) service costs. In effect, this means that the current grant system does not help lower-capacity states provide levels of aided services comparable to higher-capacity states.", "To illustrate the lack of a relationship between fiscal capacity and grant allocations, we ranked the states according to an index of their per capita federal grants, adjusted for costs, and calculated averages for five groups of 10 states each (quintiles).

Nearly 95 percent of the 149 grant formulas we reviewed, representing 99 percent of formula grant funds, used a measure of need. However, only 15 percent of grant formulas, representing 61 percent of funds (7 percent excluding cash welfare and Medicaid), used both need and fiscal capacity factors. Finally, only 2 percent, representing less than 2 percent of funds, used a combination of need, fiscal capacity, and cost factors. As we noted earlier, where the federal government seeks a minimum or more comparable level of services for all potential beneficiaries\u2014regardless of where they live\u2014the inclusion of a fiscal capacity factor helps to reduce the disparities between the abilities of wealthier and poorer communities to provide such service levels. Cost factors help ensure that states facing higher service costs are compensated for these differences, which contributes to comparability in aided service levels.", "The lack of targeting factors was not concentrated in any one budget function we reviewed. However, grants that have historically comprised the social safety net were more likely to include data elements that reflect fiscal capacity as well as need. About 24 percent of grants, representing 75 percent of funds (8 percent excluding cash welfare and Medicaid), in the education, income security, and health functions used need and fiscal capacity factors. Only 3 percent of grants in those functions (less than 2 percent of funds) also used a cost factor. In comparison, grants for other budget functions were less likely to use a combination of targeting factors. Notably, no grants in the natural resources, transportation, administration of justice, agriculture, community and regional development, veterans, or energy budget functions used fiscal capacity or cost factors in their formulas. Table 6 summarizes how the three targeting factors were combined in the 149 formula grants we reviewed, both in total and by budget function.", "The fact that a combination of the three targeting factors did not appear in most grant formulas, and fiscal capacity did not play a significant role in explaining the variation in grant funding to states, raises the logical question as to what factors did influence grant allocations. In this regard, the most significant as well as reliable explanatory variable in the grant targeting model was one that indicated whether or not a state was very small. This variable was a proxy for states that benefit most from formula hold harmless provisions and guaranteed funding floors, which have the effect of providing a minimum grant to each state regardless of its size. The results indicated that a very small state with average needs and fiscal capacity would receive per capita grant funds 20 percent higher than a larger state with the same needs and fiscal capacity.", "Finally, despite our finding that many grant formulas contained need factors and some contained fiscal capacity and/or cost factors, the measures used to allocate funds were often poor proxies for the three factors. For example, 28 of the 149 grant formulas we reviewed used a state\u2019s share of the U.S. population as a proxy for need. Generally, population is a poor proxy for program needs because when population is used funds are allocated to states in proportion to the number of people in the state, which is not necessarily the same as the number of people who actually need a particular program\u2019s services. Also, per capita personal income is a frequently used but poor proxy for fiscal capacity because it does not comprehensively measure state income. Specifically, it fails to capture income produced, but not received, in a state.

This is an indication that the federal government may be getting less fiscal impact than it could from the dollars it spends. Our literature synthesis implied that each additional federal grant dollar results in about 40 cents of added spending on the aided activity. This means that the fiscal impact of the remaining 60 cents is to free up state funds that otherwise would have been spent on that activity for other state programs or tax relief.", "Grants are not the only type of federal subsidy tool in which design issues have undermined fiscal impact. Our prior work has shown that programs implemented through subsidies, such as loans and tax expenditures as well as grants, sometimes fall short of expectations because federal funds are transmitted through a network of third parties who have their own spending priorities or who would have undertaken subsidized activities anyway.", "Given the complex and evolving relationship between the federal and state governments and their shared responsibilities for most domestic programs, it is understandable that observers will have different views of substitution. Some might see the substitution we identified as reasonable, given differences in state and federal priorities and a desire to provide states with managerial flexibility. As economists have shown, some substitution is to be expected whenever a grant is received\u2014whether the funds go to an individual, an organization, or a state government. From the perspective of a recipient, the funds are simply additional income, to be used according to the recipient\u2019s own preferences, within the limitations imposed by the grant. This is why a grant\u2019s design together with the degree of state commitment to federal priorities determine the ultimate fiscal impact of federal grant dollars. Also, in our federal system the balance of domestic responsibilities may be shifting toward the states. Thus, providing states with a measure of fiscal relief, albeit indirectly, could be considered a legitimate role for the federal grant system.", "Others might argue that if the provision of fiscal relief is to be the primary goal of the federal grant system, then this relief should be allocated in a manner that allows for adequate oversight and control by the Congress. If fiscal relief is accepted as a policy goal, there are a variety of alternatives available to the Congress to allocate this relief. The alternative we examined would target the relief to states with greater programmatic needs and fewer fiscal resources. Our analysis showed that existing grant formulas do not allocate federal aid to states in a targeted manner. This may have occurred because grant formulas or eligibility rules were constructed too broadly, grant floors and ceilings allocated funds too widely, or the circumstances that created a need for the program may have changed.", "Notwithstanding the importance policymakers may place on providing states with fiscal relief, the question remains as to whether the federal government can afford this approach and still accomplish objectives of national importance in an era of increasingly scarce federal resources. The issues we have raised concerning grants are part of a larger problem of how to improve government performance concurrent with downsizing. A focus on cost-effectiveness will be especially important as agencies implement the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, thus turning the federal government\u2019s focus to outcome-based measures of grant performance. As a consequence, it will be increasingly important to design grant programs so that the federal dollars needed to produce desired outcomes reach their intended targets.", "Moreover, substitution raises questions about the federal role in the federal system. In many cases, the federal government created grant programs because of the view that states were not funding certain services to a degree consistent with national, rather than purely local, policy objectives. However, the difference in priorities that provides the rationale for such grants also makes it more likely that states will attempt to use grant dollars to replace their own funds, thus converting specific-purpose aid to general fiscal relief. While the federal government may still wish to pursue national objectives in these areas, it should be recognized that, because of substitution, such objectives may be costly to achieve.", "The potential for substitution may increase when the federal government chooses to finance areas in which state spending is already significant. Historically, initial federal involvement in funding state spending in an area may have occurred when little or no state funds were being committed, thus prompting states to commit resources for the first time. But as states\u2019 commitment to funding those areas has grown over time, or the federal government has chosen to enter an area where state spending has traditionally been large, the potential for substitution may have grown as well.", "There are many factors that must be reconciled in considering the budgetary implications of grant design. Taking one path, the Congress could consider redesigning grants to reduce substitution and increase targeting. For example, to reduce substitution and increase the likelihood that federal grant funds lead to greater total spending on aided programs, greater use of state matching, with reduced federal shares, and maintenance-of-effort provisions that track inflation and program growth can be considered. However, as previously noted, policymakers would need to consider the potential losses in state spending flexibility that could occur as a result of adding spending restrictions. Also, if formula grants were redesigned to include a combination of targeting factors, a larger share of federal aid could be allocated to those states and communities with relatively greater programmatic needs and fewer fiscal resources. We recently reported that greater targeting of grant formulas offers a strategy to bring down federal outlays by concentrating reductions on jurisdictions with relatively fewer needs and greater fiscal capacity to absorb cuts.", "Taking a different path, the Congress could use information about the relative performance of grant programs to consider which programs may have outlived their usefulness. The Congress may decide that the benefits of particular programs are not being achieved in a cost-effective manner due to substitution and a lack of targeting. Accordingly, the Congress may decide that such programs no longer represent the best use of scarce federal resources. Targeted reductions based on the relative performance of federal programs can help promote a government whose responsibilities are better matched to the resources available. Such reductions could be used either to cut the deficit or invest in other federal programs that the Congress judges to be more cost-effective. However, because the evidence on whether states would replace reductions in federal grant funds is inconclusive, and because replacing federal funds would mean reductions to other state programs or increases in state taxes, the Congress would need to consider the costs and benefits of individual programs carefully in selecting which programs to reduce or eliminate.", "As arranged with the Committee, we are sending copies of this report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, cognizant congressional committees, and other interested parties.

Thus, for grants, the model depicts a government which may \u201cpurchase\u201d (1) goods aided by a grant, (2) all other public or private goods, (3) or some combination. The quantity of goods the government can purchase is constrained by a budget consisting of its own revenues plus additional revenue from federal grants. The model demonstrates how the government would purchase as much of the aided and non-aided goods it could afford, within its budget constraint in accordance with the taxpayers\u2019 collective preferences. How much more of an aided good a government purchases using its additional grant income depends on two factors: (1) taxpayers\u2019 preferences for the aided good relative to other goods the government could purchase with the additional resources and (2) the incentives to purchase aided rather than non-aided goods that are built into the grant.", "According to economic theory, there are three types of incentives that can be used to encourage grant recipients to increase total spending on aided goods.

To understand why this is so, consider the different spending responses of recipients to a gift certificate from a sporting goods store compared to an equivalent amount of cash. A gift certificate that exceeds the amount recipients normally would spend on sporting goods will tend to boost their total spending on sporting goods. With cash, they are likely to spend each additional dollar of income according to their preferences for all goods. Spending on sporting goods could be a small share of each additional dollar, such as 5 cents.", "In reality, communities receive federal grant dollars, not gift certificates, and these dollars are fungible with other community resources. For this reason, economists have concluded that grant recipients rarely are wholly constrained by the legal conditions attached to a grant. Rather, there will likely be an element of substitution in every grant as recipients find ways to replace their own funds with federal funds, freeing up local resources for other purposes. Overall, economic theory recognizes that $1 in conditional grants will not necessarily result in an additional dollar of state spending on the grant activity.", "Substitution also occurs when a community may have planned to spend more of its own resources on a particular purpose, even without a grant. In such cases, a conditional grant simply increases the budget available to the community and becomes, in effect, added income similar to the income provided through an unconditional grant. In this situation a community can substitute some or all of its conditional grant funds for other purposes, including tax relief. To extend the gift certificate analogy, the holder may have been planning to buy sports equipment before receiving the certificate. Because the gift certificate can replace the cash the holder was planning to spend on sporting goods, the holder has, in effect, received a grant of additional income that can be used for purposes unrelated to sports.

Non-matching grants, in contrast, provide funds to recipients without any requirement for state cost-sharing.", "According to economists, matching grants encourage more state spending on aided goods that non-matching grants, other factors being equal. Both matching and non-matching grants provide additional income to recipient governments. Because grant funds are partially fungible, this income, like any other type of income, permits recipients to consume more of both aided as well as non-aided activities according to their preferences. However, matching grants, in addition to providing additional income, also lower the \u201cprice\u201d to the recipient government of the aided good relative to the other goods it could purchase with the funds. For example, with federal matching of 75 percent of total spending, a state could spend 25 cents on an aided good and obtain 75 cents in federal funds, for a total maximum increase in spending of $1. Without matching, another dollar of spending on an aided good still costs a dollar. Therefore, the same federal subsidy of 75 cents yields a maximum of only 75 cents of total additional spending.", "How effective a matching grant will be in increasing a recipient\u2019s spending depends on the recipient\u2019s preferences for aided versus non-aided activities (including tax relief).

For activities the recipient desires less, the price effect may be less. In the extreme, if the recipient does not want more of an aided activity, the price effect will be negligible.", "The use of maintenance-of-effort provisions can help make up for the lack of a price effect in non-matching grants by requiring states to continue a designated spending level from their own sources in order to receive the federal assistance. Because states must maintain a prescribed level of spending, their ability to substitute federal funds for their own is limited. Over time, however, increases in the population served by the program, inflation, and other determinants may cause federal spending for the program to rise.

In theory, maintenance-of-effort provisions have an impact similar to a matching requirement since the recipient must continue to spend from its own resources on the aided function at a required level to receive additional federal aid.", "For a few federal matching grants, the federal share of program spending is unlimited\u2014or \u201copen-ended.\u201d Open-ended grants consist primarily of a few large entitlement programs, such as Medicaid and Foster Care. The federal government has limited control over the amount of spending on open-ended grant programs, mainly through variations in the strictness of the grant eligibility requirements.", "According to economists, a closed-ended matching grant will be as stimulative as an open-ended matching grant as long as state spending on the aided activity remains below the level needed to obtain the maximum federal contribution. In this case, a closed-ended grant has the same stimulative income and price effects as described for a matching grant. However, the fiscal impact of a closed-ended grant will be different when state spending on the grant activity is above the federal grant ceiling. In this situation, the price reduction created by federal matching is eliminated for the additional spending beyond the limit of the federal contribution. Therefore, the grant has only an income effect, and grant funds simply add to the total resources of the community with an effect equivalent to an unconditional grant. The community can substitute part or all of the grant funds for its own spending and has full discretion over the use of the freed-up resources.

To do this, we developed a grant targeting model, we modified the model to reflect the influence of funding floors and hold harmless formula provisions, and we tested the model using a statistical technique known as multiple regression. The regression analysis enabled us to estimate the influence of state fiscal capacity, apart from the influence of the other independent variables, on per capita federal grant allocations to the 50 states. We found that, after controlling for indicators of program needs, such as poverty, population under age 18, and highway miles, and for service cost differentials, fiscal capacity did not play a statistically significant role in allocating aid to states. In fact, the most significant variable in the model was a proxy for the presence of funding floors and hold harmless provisions in grant formulas.", "The remainder of this appendix discusses, in technical detail (1) the theory that provided the basis for our analysis and the specification of a grant allocation model suitable for estimation using multiple regression, (2) the data we used to estimate the grant targeting model, and (3) the results of our analysis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Model Specification", "paragraphs": ["In theory, targeted grants should correct for differences in the fiscal conditions of state governments so that taxpayers in less wealthy states can provide comparable services at comparable tax rates to wealthier states. Under the theory of grant targeting, a state\u2019s fiscal condition can be described in terms of expenditure needs compared to revenues. Technically, this is defined as the gap between the revenues that can be raised from local sources with an average tax burden on local residents (i.e., fiscal capacity) and the expenditures required to finance an average level of public services (i.e., needs).", "States with positive gaps are regarded as being in better fiscal condition to provide services than those with negative gaps. States with average fiscal capacities and average service needs are in the middle. In a theoretical redistribution scheme, states with positive gaps would transfer resources to those with negative gaps through an unconditional grant or transfer of funds.", "In practice, grants are allocated from a general fund at the federal level and distributed to eligible states for particular purposes according to a formula. The design of a grant targeting formula will depend on the type and degree of equity desired. There are two types of equity policymakers can consider\u2014beneficiary equity and taxpayer equity. To achieve beneficiary equity, grant funds would need to be allocated in proportion to each state\u2019s potential program needs and adjusted for differences in service costs. Achieving taxpayer equity requires considering fiscal capacity in addition to the needs and cost factors used to achieve beneficiary equity.", "Beneficiary and taxpayer equity cannot be achieved simultaneously. Maximizing beneficiary equity provides equal federal funding per beneficiary, resulting in unequal taxpayer burdens across states. Maximizing taxpayer equity equalizes state taxpayer burdens, resulting in unequal federal funding per beneficiary. Another equity goal falls between achieving either full taxpayer or full beneficiary equity, whereby differences in state taxpayer burdens are reduced but not totally eliminated by allowing some differences in funding per beneficiary across states. In prior work we referred to this goal as \u201cbalanced equity.\u201d The model in figure IV.1\u2014which we refer to as the grant targeting model\u2014incorporates the need, cost, and fiscal capacity factors, consistent with achieving balanced equity.", "G = per capita grant allocation Need = program need indicators, such as poverty rates, population  of school age children, unemployment rates, etc.  = coefficients representing the relative influence of each need indicator and the fiscal capacity indicator on the grant allocation FC = per capita fiscal capacity C = cost of public services subsidized by federal grants According to the grant targeting model, the dependent variable is per capita grant allocations to states, adjusted for costs (G/C). The independent variables are a variety of state program need indicators (Need) and state per capita fiscal capacity, also adjusted for costs (FC/C). The hypothesis implied by the model is that the dependent variable, G/C, would be a positive function of need; i.e., states with greater needs should receive larger per capita grants. In contrast, the model implies that the dependent variable would be a negative function of fiscal capacity; i.e., states with greater resources to provide program services on their own would receive smaller per capita grants.", "Our objective for estimating the grant targeting model was to determine the extent to which the fiscal capacity variable explained the variation in the allocation of federal funds to states, controlling for a variety of plausible indicators of state program needs and cost differentials. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the fiscal capacity variable would have the predicted negative sign and be statistically significant. We included the need indicators primarily as control variables that would enable us to more accurately assess the impact and significance of the fiscal capacity variable.", "Our ability to accurately estimate the impact of the model\u2019s need factors on aggregate grant allocations was limited. In contrast to the fiscal capacity variable, there is no single or aggregate measure that accurately represents the program goals and objectives of all the grants in the system.", "Therefore, it was difficult to determine the effects an individual needs indicator, such as the school age population, had on the allocation of aggregate grant funds. Because each grant program uses a unique set of factors to allocate funds, a particular need indicator used to distribute funds for one program may play no role in other programs. Consequently, in estimating the influence of a variety of need indicators on aggregate grants allocations, the effects of the need indicators may, to a certain extent, cancel one another out. Thus, the statistical significance or insignificance of a particular need indicator in this analysis does not provide an adequate basis for drawing conclusions about its relative importance in the allocation of federal grants. However, used in combination, the need variables provided a valid control to isolate the effect of needs from that of fiscal capacity on aggregate grant allocations.", "The grant targeting model describes the allocation of grant funds as a function solely of state needs and fiscal capacities, adjusted for costs. However, many grants contain funding floors and hold-harmless provisions that guarantee each state a minimum grant allocation, regardless of their needs and fiscal capacities. This has the effect of providing smaller states greater per capita grant allocations than larger states. Therefore, in specifying the model, we created two dummy variables representing very small states (those with populations less than .25 percent of the total United States population), and small states (those with populations between .25 percent and .5 percent) to serve as proxies for the influence of funding floors and hold-harmless provisions on grant allocations.", "When two variables have a joint effect over and above the effects of each factor separately it is considered \u201cinteraction.\u201d Given the presence of funding floors in most federal grant formulas, we thought it likely that one or both of the dummy variables would be statistically significant. Therefore, to test whether the effect of fiscal capacity was significantly different for the smaller states, we included interaction terms to provide separate fiscal capacity coefficients for very small, small, and all other states.", "We also deflated the two fiscal variables, per capita grant allocation and fiscal capacity, by an input-cost index to control for the different costs states face in providing program services. Finally, all variables were constructed as indexes, having weighted average values of 1.0. Measuring all variables as indexes allowed the regression coefficients in the statistical model to be interpreted as elasticities (i.e., the percent change in the dependent variable\u2014per capita grant allocation\u2014in response to a 1 percent increase in an independent variable from its mean value).

The income of nonresidents received from activities within a state is considered relevant to a state\u2019s fiscal capacity because taxation of such income (for example, through retail sales, other excise taxes, or corporate income taxes) reduces the burdens on resident taxpayers. On both grounds, PCI is a relatively poor indicator of fiscal capacity.", "We previously reported that total taxable resources (TTR) is a better measure of fiscal capacity than PCI because it is a more comprehensive indicator of economic income and addresses tax exporting. TTR, developed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is an average of PCI and per capita gross state product (GSP). GSP measures all income produced within a state, whether received by residents, nonresidents, or retained by business corporations.
