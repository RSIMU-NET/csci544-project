From November 28, 2009, to March 1, 2010, CBP processed 103,565 arriving travelers at CNMI airports, and ICE processed 72 aliens for removal proceedings. In calendar year 2009, USCIS processed 515 CNMI applications for permanent U.S. residency and 50 CNMI applications for U.S. naturalization or citizenship. However, the DHS components face operational challenges and have been unable to negotiate solutions with the CNMI government. First, airport space available to CBP does not meet facility standards and CBP has not reached a long-term occupancy agreement with the CNMI. Second, ICE has not come to an agreement with the CNMI for access to detention space and as a result has transferred 3 of 30 aliens--convicted criminals under CNMI or U.S. law--to correctional facilities in Guam and Honolulu. Third, DHS efforts to gain direct access to the CNMI's immigration databases have been unsuccessful, hampering U.S. enforcement operations. DHS has begun to implement work permit and visa programs for foreign workers, visitors, and investors, but key regulations are not final and certain transition programs therefore remain unavailable. A lawsuit filed by the CNMI government challenging some provisions of the CNRA resulted in a court injunction delaying implementation of the CNMI-only transitional worker program until DHS considers public comments and issues a new rule. As a result this program is unavailable to employers as of May 1, 2010. DHS has established the Guam-CNMI visa waiver program. However, DHS did not include China and Russia, two countries that provide significant economic benefit to the CNMI. Currently, DHS allows nationals from these two countries into the CNMI temporarily without a visa under the DHS Secretary's parole authority. DHS is reconsidering whether to include these countries in the Guam-CNMI visa waiver program. Although DHS has proposed rules that apply temporary U.S. nonimmigrant treaty investor status to investors with CNMI foreign investor entry permits, the program is not yet available."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under the terms of its 1976 Covenant with the United States, the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) administered its  own immigration systems from 1978 to 2009.

Family-based applications  are filed by U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens to establish their  relationships to certain alien relatives, such as a spouse, parent, or minor  child, who wish to immigrate to the United States. Employment-based  applications include petitions filed by employers for aliens to enter the  United States temporarily as nonimmigrant workers for temporary work  or training or as immigrants for permanent work. USCIS reviews petitions  for certain nonimmigrant workers against criteria such as whether the  petition is accompanied by a certified determination from DOL, whether  the employer is eligible to employ a nonimmigrant worker, whether the  position is a specialty occupation, and whether the prospective  nonimmigrant worker is qualified for the position. Humanitarian-based  applications include applications for asylum or refugee status filed by  aliens who fear persecution in their home countries.
