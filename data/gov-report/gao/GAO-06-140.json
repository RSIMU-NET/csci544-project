During this same period, participation in the program has grown from 10 sites in 10 states to 29 sites in 24 states and Puerto Rico. Since the program's inception, NGB has reported positive performance outcomes in academic performance, community service activities, and post-residential placements. For example, in 2004, NGB reported graduating 7,003 students, or 79 percent of those enrolled, with 70 percent of those graduates earning a high school equivalent diploma. While Reserve Affairs and NGB have expressed concern about the current program funding level and have suggested increasing both the cost basis used to determine funding needs and the federal cost share, neither has performed analyses to support the need for such changes. Federal financial standards state that reliable cost information is crucial for effective management of government operations. Since 1993, NGB has used $14,000 per student as the basis for determining the amount of funds needed to cover program operating costs, and applied the federal-state cost share to this amount. To keep pace with inflation, NGB has suggested increasing the per student cost to $18,000. Reserve Affairs has reported some states are having difficulty meeting their share and, in 2004, recommended the federal share be increased from 60 percent to 75 percent. However, neither Reserve Affairs nor NGB has compiled or analyzed data on actual program costs, states' financial situations, or the impact of adjusting the federal and state cost-share. Without better cost and financial information, the Department of Defense (DOD) cannot justify future funding requests or a change in the cost-share ratio. Although NGB uses various oversight mechanisms, it lacks a complete oversight framework, making it difficult to measure program effectiveness and to adequately address audit and review findings. Also, some audits have not been performed as required. The Government Performance and Results Act suggests a complete oversight framework including goals and measures against which to objectively evaluate performance. While NGB requires states to report certain performance outcomes, it does not require states to establish performance goals in these areas, and therefore does not have a firm basis for evaluating program outcomes and DOD's return on investment. Existing agreements require state programs to be audited at least every three years. However these audits have not been conducted as required and no provisions exist for submitting audit results to NGB. Without regular audits and access to results, NGB cannot be assured that programs are using federal funds appropriately and that audit findings are addressed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After Operation Desert Storm and the end of the Cold War, Congress  After Operation Desert Storm and the end of the Cold War, Congress  began to reevaluate the focus of U.S. military activities and proposed using  began to reevaluate the focus of U.S. military activities and proposed using  some military assets and training to help address critical domestic  some military assets and training to help address critical domestic  challenges such as drugs, poverty, and unemployment.

The graduates work with  adult mentors who were matched with them during the residential phase.   These mentors provide guidance and support to the graduates and are  required to contact the youths twice each month at a minimum.  Program  staff use the written, post-residential action plan that each student  prepares and updates during the residential phase to monitor placement  activities.

According to NGB, Wyoming will begin its first class in  January 2006. In addition to those states currently operating Challenge  Program sites, there are also nine states that have expressed interest in  establishing new programs.  For example, according to NGB officials,  representatives from Washington and Indiana National Guard units have  visited some existing program sites and are in the process of developing  state programs.

The  Challenge Program sites use the same automated system, DMARS, to  collect information on students and report on their progress and activities.   The information collected in DMARS is reviewed by the contractor  through weekly and monthly reports and during random checks of source  documents during operational evaluation site visits.", "Some residential phase outcomes of the Challenge Program, such as the  number of graduates earning a general educational development (GED)  credential or high school degree and changes in scores on standardized  math and reading tests, are tied to the core component of Academic  Excellence.  For example, NGB reported that 70 percent of graduates in  2004 earned a GED.  Figure 5 illustrates the outcomes of GED attainment  for the past 5 reporting years.  Students also take the Tests of Adult Basic  Education, a series of tests that identify individual education levels in  various academic subject areas. Each state program tests its students early  in the residential phase and then toward the end of the 22-week period,  and it reports the changes in test scores. In 2004, for example, NGB  reported that graduating students improved 1.7 grade levels in reading and  1.8 grade levels in math during the residential phase. Another core  component, Service to the Community, requires each student to perform a  minimum of 40 hours of service to the community or conservation project  activities. The number of community service hours performed by each  student is tracked, and the total number of hours for each site is another  outcome that the Challenge Program reports annually.  For example, in  2004, NGB reported that Challenge Program students performed more  than 590,000 hours of community service, such as maintaining historical  cemeteries and parks and supporting organizations such as Special  Olympics and Habitat for Humanity.", "Each month of the post-residential phase, each Challenge Program  graduate, or that individual\u2019s mentor, reports on the graduate\u2019s post- residential activities. Following the 12-month post-residential phase, each  Challenge Program site reports graduate placements in continuing  education, the military, or the labor force.  These placements are verified  with schools, the military, and employers and are documented.  Program  representatives are not always able to contact all graduates for placement  information and therefore placement data reflect only the students  contacted, not all graduates.  Education placements include returning to  high school or going to a post-secondary or vocational-training institution,  which students may be attending full- or part-time.  Some Challenge  Program graduates also enter the military, into either the active or the  reserve forces.  Post-residential employment placements can be full- or  part-time, and they include those graduates who are self-employed.   Graduates can have placements in more than one of these categories.  For  example, an individual might be attending school and working part-time.   Challenge Program sites continue to update their placement records after  the 12-month follow-up period when they come in contact with former  students.  During the longitudinal study, for example, the contractor has  been able to update placement data based on information received from  state program officials and graduates.

Without better cost and  financial information, DOD cannot justify future funding requests or a  change in the cost-share ratio.", "Other than calculating how inflation has affected program costs, NGB has  not analyzed data on actual program costs.  Since 1993, NGB has used a  cost of $14,000 per student as the basis for determining the amount of  funds needed to cover program operating costs.  In 2003, NGB calculated  that if that amount were adjusted for inflation, it would be $18,000.  The  results of our survey of all Challenge Programs showed that in 2004, states  actually spent between $9,300 and $31,031 per graduate with an average of  $15,898 per graduate.  In addition, our survey showed that, on average,  states estimated that the program should be funded at approximately  $16,900 per target graduate to cover all of the services in the cooperative  agreements, although the estimates ranged from $14,000 to $31,800.  Most  Challenge Program officials also told us that increasing the cost per  student funding level for the program without increasing the federal cost  share would negatively impact their programs because their states would  be unlikely to come up with the additional state match money.  Because  costs vary between states due to regional differences in salary levels, staff  benefits, and facility costs, Reserve Affairs has asked NGB to determine a  new funding formula for the program based on individual state needs.  At  the time of our review, NGB had not yet done this and Reserve Affairs has  not given NGB a deadline for completion.", "In addition to expressing a desire to change the amount of funding per  student, Reserve Affairs, NGB, and participating states have suggested that  the cost-share ratio be changed from its current 60 percent federal share to  a 75 percent federal share because they believe that the current 40 percent  state share is sometimes difficult for states to meet; however, neither  Reserve Affairs nor NGB has analyzed states\u2019 financial situations or the  impact of adjusting the federal and state cost share.  Challenge Program  officials told us that increasing the federal cost share of the program  would be beneficial because it would enable states to expand their  existing programs; give states more flexibility in funding their programs;  and allow programs to restore to students some services that had been  eliminated due to budgetary constraints.  Although we did not analyze how  changing the cost basis or the cost-share ratio would affect specific states,  we prepared hypothetical examples for illustrative purposes.  Table 1  shows how changing the cost basis and the cost-share ratio would affect  federal and state required funding levels.", "In our survey, states reported varying views on whether they were  experiencing difficulty in meeting their share of program costs.  We did  not verify the basis for their responses.  Our survey showed that some  states are able to provide funds above the required match; some states  provide only the required match; and some states are unable to provide a  match based on $14,000 per student and therefore fund the program at a  lower level and receive less money from NGB.  For example, California is  able to provide additional support beyond the required match through  additional money provided from the state general fund and funding from  the program\u2019s local school district.  In 2004, California spent  approximately $20,200 per graduate.  Oregon, on the other hand, funds its  program primarily through state education money.  Due to recent state  budget difficulties, Oregon cannot fund the program at $14,000 per  student.  In 2004, Oregon spent approximately $12,600 per graduate.   According to the National Guard Bureau, all 29 programs are providing the  services required by the cooperative agreements, and several states have  added program enhancements such as field trips or vocational classes.   However, some states reported that they reduced nonrequired services to  stay within their budgets.  For example, they implemented pay and hiring  freezes; eliminated the student stipend; and eliminated program  enrichment activities, such as field trips and vocational classes.  Some  states told us that additional funding, provided by a change in the cost- share ratio or an increase in the per student funding amount, would allow  them to restore some of these services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The National Guard Bureau Lacks a Complete Framework for Oversight of the Challenge Program, Making It Difficult to Measure Program Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Although NGB has several mechanisms in place for overseeing the  Challenge Program, it lacks a complete oversight framework, making it  difficult to measure the effectiveness of the program.

In response  to our review, in October 2005, NGB provided new guidance to AOC  Solutions regarding the operational evaluations and resource management  reviews, which required, among other things, AOC Solutions to review  findings from previous evaluation reports to determine whether corrective  actions have been taken where warranted.

The establishment of  performance goals is consistent with the principles of effective  management as set forth in the Results Act and would allow NGB to better  evaluate the overall performance of the program and to assess DOD\u2019s  return on its investment.  Without clear and agreed upon performance  goals, there is no objective yardstick against which to fully measure  program performance and thereby assess DOD\u2019s return on investment.", "Although it may not be reasonable to have the same performance goal for  all state programs, it would be appropriate for each state program to  negotiate a performance goal for defined performance areas such as  increases in standardized test scores or physical fitness levels.  Similar  state programs, overseen by the Department of Labor, set individual  negotiated levels of performance for specified core performance  measures.  These measures are used to provide information for  systemwide reporting and evaluation for program improvement.  For  example, state Workforce Investment Act programs negotiate  performance measures for youth ages 14 to 18 in three areas: attainment of  basic skills; attainment of high school diplomas or their equivalents; and  placement in education, the workforce, or the military.  For the area of  diploma attainment, the goals range from 42.8 percent of participants in  Louisiana to 68 percent of participants in New Hampshire.", "Currently, Challenge Program states are required to submit state plans  annually.  These state plans are required to contain long-term and annual  performance goals and are to be updated annually.  However, NGB has not  provided guidance on specific performance areas where states should  focus their goals; therefore, states may not have goals in the same  performance areas, making it difficult for NGB to compare performance  across programs.  For example, California\u2019s state plan contains a goal to  acquire additional sources of funding through grants and charitable  contributions.  Oregon\u2019s state plan, on the other hand, contains a goal  stating that 80 percent of graduates from the residential portion of the  program will be placed in education, the military, or employment but does  not contain any goal related to acquiring additional sources of funding.  In  addition, states are not currently held accountable to the goals that they  do set since the evaluation process does not measure the states\u2019  performance against their goals.

For example, according to NGB, out  of a required 29 audits, only 14 were conducted in 2003, and only 7 audits  were conducted in 2004.  According to property and fiscal officers that we  spoke with, audits were not conducted due to the lower priority placed on  these audits compared to other audits that needed to be conducted within  the state and a lack of staff to conduct the audits.

NGB needs to be aware of all audit findings,  including those reported by the property and fiscal officers to effectively  manage the Challenge Program.", "We reviewed the most recent property and fiscal officer audits for each  Challenge Program participating state and found that they did identify  areas that needed improvement.  For example, an audit conducted of one  program in fiscal year 2004 found unspent program dollars totaling  approximately $180,000 that needed to be returned to the NGB.  According  to a follow-up report by the property and fiscal officer, this money was  returned to NGB.  Another audit conducted during fiscal year 2003 found  that oversight of budget expenditures for one program was not adequate  to ensure accurate, timely, and complete accounting of expenditures and  recommended that key management controls over the program be  identified, documented, published and tested.

Although the  authorizing legislation for the Challenge Program allows the Secretary of  Defense to use nondefense funding sources in support of the program,  Reserve Affairs has not adopted a formal strategy for pursuing nondefense  funding.  Rather, Reserve Affairs has primarily adopted informal strategies  to contact agencies outside DOD to inform them about the Challenge  Program and seek opportunities for partnerships.  For example, Reserve  Affairs officials have sent information via e-mail to officials at federal  agencies with programs targeting at-risk youth (i.e. Department of Justice  (DOJ), Department of Labor (DOL), and Department of Education (ED))  to inform them about the Challenge Program.  These e-mails did not  include specific requests for program funding.  In addition, in July 2003,  Reserve Affairs presented senior DOL officials with a proposal for forming  an interagency partnership with the Challenge Program, but did not ask  for a commitment of funding from DOL in a specified amount.   Additionally, officials from these agencies have been invited to events  sponsored by the National Guard Youth Foundation in support of the  Challenge Program.  Lastly, Reserve Affairs officials told us that they  participate or have participated on a number of interagency councils and  working groups that represent at-risk youth such as the President\u2019s Crime  Prevention Council, the White House Federal Interagency Working Group  on Service, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the  National Civilian Community Corps, the Math Science Initiative, and the  Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Council.", "Officials from DOJ, DOL, and ED noted that their agencies have general  authority to provide funds to other programs if the transferred funds were  used to support a program consistent with their agency\u2019s interests.

In fiscal years 2000 and 2001, DOD and DOJ signed an  interagency agreement under which DOJ agreed to provide $5 million in  2000 and $7,483,500 in 2001 to the Challenge Program.

By providing  information and examples of programs that are currently implementing  these strategies, other state Challenge Programs have the information  available to them on how to obtain additional funding support for their  programs.  In our review of the program, we found that some states had  identified strategies for soliciting additional funding support from  nonprofit organizations.

For example, in one state we visited, the Challenge site  was also a charter school, which allowed the program to receive  additional funding from the local school district.  Moreover, in four states  we visited, the state legislatures provided additional funding beyond the  required state match of 40 percent to pay for additional staffing costs or  facilities.  According to our survey of all Challenge Programs, 28 out of 29  programs identified receiving some type of funding support beyond the  required federal and state contributions to pay for program expenditures  incurred during 1999 through 2004.  These programs identified receiving  additional funding from the states\u2019 general fund beyond the required state  match as well as support from other state agencies such as the state  Department of Education.

Some programs also received support from the  surrounding community in the form of donated services such as  transportation assistance and medical services from local doctors and  nurses.  Our survey further showed that 21 out of 29 programs received  some form of donated goods and services.  Program officials we met  stated that donations of goods and services were vital to programs  because many times they do not have funds available to acquire equipment  or services for the program.

DOD also contends that until  recently, sluggish state revenues made the cost share requirement more  burdensome and inhibited the ability of both the NGB and the states to  focus on determining the actual costs of the Challenge Program. DOD  claims that the budget shortfalls required the states to reduce and/or  eliminate program services and that, with state revenues slowly closing  their budget gaps, restoring funding for needed program services is being  considered.  DOD also notes that it is currently working on a new funding  formula for the program.", "Although DOD\u2019s comments suggest that adequate funding was not  available for needed services, through our survey and other work, we  found that all 29 programs were able to provide the services required by  the cooperative agreements, and several states reported they added  program enhancements such as field trips or vocational classes. However,  some states reported that they reduced nonrequired services to stay within  their budgets.  Furthermore, the basis for DOD\u2019s comment regarding the  effect of the matching fund requirement and the level of state revenues on  the program is unclear.
