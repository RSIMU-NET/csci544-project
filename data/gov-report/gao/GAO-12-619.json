In 2009, GAO reported that DOD lacked (1) visibility and accountability for achieving fuel reduction, (2) incentives and a viable funding mechanism to invest in the implementation of fuel demand reduction projects, and (3) guidance and policies that addressed fuel demand at forward-deployed locations. In response to GAO recommendations, DOD has taken steps since 2009 to increase its visibility and accountability for fuel demand management at forward-deployed locations, including those located in Afghanistan. In addition, with an increased focus on fuel demand management, DOD has also provided funding and incentives to implement fuel demand management projects. Further, DOD has issued some guidance on fuel demand management at forward-deployed locations since 2009 and is developing more comprehensive guidance on how DOD will incorporate energy efficiency considerations into operations, planning, and training decisions for current military operations in Afghanistan and for future military operations. DOD\u0092s 2012 Operational Energy Strategy Implementation Plan acknowledges the need for additional comprehensive guidance and directs the Joint Staff and military departments to report, by the end of fiscal year 2012, on how operational energy considerations will be reflected in policy, doctrine, and professional military education. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 requires DOD to report to Congress annually on its progress in implementing its operational energy strategy.

However, it is still developing an approach to systematically identify and track all of the fuel demand management initiatives that have been fielded, or are in the research and development phase throughout DOD. GAO\u0092s prior work found that utilizing a mechanism such as a database can help organizations enhance their visibility and oversight of DOD programs. Until DOD finalizes its approach to systematically identify and track fuel demand management initiatives, it may be limited in its ability to foster collaboration, achieve efficiencies, and avoid unintended duplication or overlap of activities.", "DOD has started to measure the results of some of the fuel demand management initiatives used in Afghanistan, but is still in the process of collecting and assessing comprehensive baseline data needed to measure current fuel consumption at forward-deployed locations. The Army and Marine Corps have begun collecting data on the amount of fuel consumed by their current assets in Afghanistan. Recognizing the need for additional information, DOD\u0092s 2012 Implementation Plan has tasked the services with developing and refining their fuel consumption baselines by mid-2012 and DOD has provided funding for this purpose. Once collected, these data should enhance DOD\u0092s planning, programming, and operational decisions and help DOD assess progress toward meeting its operational energy goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD finalize and implement a systematic approach that includes establishing a mechanism to identify and track fuel demand management initiatives that have been fielded, or are in the research and development phase.

According to DOD, the U.S. military\u2019s  dependence on liquid fuel in countries like Afghanistan creates an  enormous logistics burden that exposes forces to enemy attack and  diverts operational resources from other mission areas to support delivery  of this critical resource. In addition, global oil supply routes flow through  unstable regions, which can pose supply vulnerabilities, and sharp rises  in fuel prices have increased DOD\u2019s operating costs at a time when the  department faces mandated reductions to defense spending. In 2011,  DOD consumed almost 5 billion gallons of fuel in military operations  worldwide, at a cost of approximately $17.3 billion. To help reduce its  demand for fuel in military activities abroad, the services expect to spend  approximately $4 billion over the next 5 years on operational energy  initiatives.", "Over the past several years, we and others have reported on the  challenges DOD faces in managing fuel use at forward-deployed  locations, and Congress has required action by DOD on this issue. In  February 2008, the Defense Science Board reported that the high demand for fuel in-theater degrades operational capabilities, exposes  support operations to greater risk than necessary, and increases life-cycle  costs. In 2009, we reported that each of the services had efforts planned  or underway to reduce fuel demand, but these efforts were not well  coordinated and DOD lacked an effective approach for implementing its  fuel demand management initiatives and maintaining sustained attention  to fuel demand management at its forward-deployed locations. The  Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009  established a Director of Operational Energy Plans and Programs  (OEP&P) and developed an operational energy strategy, providing the  department with an opportunity to increase attention on improving fuel  demand management. As defined in that act, operational energy is  energy required for training, moving, and sustaining military forces and  weapons platforms for military operations, including tactical power  systems, generators, and weapons platforms.", "Interested in DOD\u2019s progress in addressing these issues since our 2009  report, you asked us to examine DOD\u2019s efforts to reduce the demand for  and promote the efficient use of fuel by the U.S. military at forward- deployed locations in Afghanistan. Specifically, this report addresses (1)  DOD\u2019s approach for fuel demand management, including at forward- deployed locations in Afghanistan; (2) the extent to which DOD has  initiatives to promote fuel efficiency at forward-deployed locations in  Afghanistan and efforts to coordinate and collaborate on such initiatives;  and (3) DOD\u2019s efforts to measure the results of its fuel demand  management initiatives and establish a baseline measure of fuel  consumption in Afghanistan.", "To address our objectives, we analyzed DOD and military service  guidance, relevant legislation, and other documents, and discussed fuel  demand issues with agency officials to gain their perspectives on DOD\u2019s  fuel demand management efforts and challenges. We focused our review  on efforts to manage fuel demand to include forward-deployed locations  within the Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility in Afghanistan.  Based on discussions with DOD officials and site visits to forward- deployed locations in Afghanistan, we analyzed the extent to which DOD  had established an approach for managing fuel demand at forward- deployed locations and a means to facilitate coordination and  collaboration among the services on these initiatives since our 2009  report. Additionally, based on data provided by the services, we identified  key fuel demand management initiatives that are currently fielded or are  in development and expected to address fuel demand issues at forward- deployed locations.

The number of personnel and locations vary with the frequency and type  of military operations and deployment demands. In general, operational  control of U.S. military forces at forward-deployed locations is assigned to  the nation\u2019s six geographic, unified overseas regional commands,  including Central Command. Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility  includes Afghanistan, where military operations have led to the creation of  several hundred locations that vary in size and structure to meet mission  requirements, and the military service components have been responsible  for establishing and maintaining these locations. Some forward operating  bases such as Bagram Air Field support thousands of personnel and are  large consumers of energy. Forward operating bases generally support a  brigade or larger population and are typically composed of temporary or  semi-permanent structures that require energy for lighting, heating, and  air conditioning; electrical power grids; water and sewage systems; and  force protection systems. At the other end of the spectrum, small units at  the company level and below have established combat outposts to  enhance local operations. These outposts have a short life-cycle and  unique configurations. Since these forward-deployed locations can be  constructed in a variety of ways, the amount of fuel they consume can  vary. Figure 1 shows the forward-deployed locations we visited during the  course of our review.", "Military deployments generally rely on petroleum-based fuels, which  power communication equipment, expeditionary bases, tactical vehicles,  aircraft, some naval vessels, and other platforms. According to DOD  officials, more than 43 million gallons of fuel, on average, were supplied  each month to support U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2011. Equipment  such as generators provides power for base support activities such as air  conditioning, heating, lighting, and communications, and consumes a  significant amount of fuel  In Afghanistan, the Defense Logistics Agency-Energy (DLA-Energy)  delivers fuel to multiple points of delivery throughout the country via  contracted trucking assets, depending on the location of the bases. DLA- Energy tracks the aggregate amount of fuel the services consume based  on sales receipts, and the U.S. government pays for fuel that is delivered  to each of these designated delivery points. The North Atlantic Treaty  Organization delivers fuel in the southern part of Afghanistan.", "While the cost of fuel represents only about 2 percent of DOD\u2019s total  budget, it can have a significant impact on the department\u2019s operating  costs. Since the military services prepare their annual budgets based on  the approved fuel price projections in the President\u2019s budget, market  volatility in the year of execution can result in out-of-cycle fuel price  increases that are difficult for the services to absorb. A prior DOD report  has estimated that for every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil,  DOD\u2019s operating costs increase by approximately $1.3 billion. The  department has received supplemental appropriations from Congress in  prior years to cover budget shortages associated with rising fuel prices.", "Moreover, the total cost of delivering fuel to a consumer on the  battlefield\u2014which includes the aggregate cost of buying, moving, and  protecting fuel during combat operations\u2014can be much greater than the  cost of the fuel itself. A 2008 Defense Science Board task force report  noted that preliminary estimates by the OSD Program Analysis and  Evaluation office and the Institute for Defense Analyses showed that the  fully burdened cost of a $2.50 gallon of fuel (DLA\u2019s standard price for  fuel in 2008)  begins at about $15, not including force protection  requirements for supply convoys. In addition, fuel delivered in-flight was  estimated to cost about $42 a gallon at that time. However, the report  notes that these figures were considered low when the report was  published in 2008 and, according to DOD officials, in 2011, the cost of a  gallon of this fuel had risen to $3.95 (DLA standard price in 2011), making  the fully burdened cost of fuel even higher than previously reported. In  fiscal year 2009 Congress required the Secretary of Defense to  incorporate the fully burdened cost of fuel into its cost analyses, including  acquisition analyses of alternatives and program design trade decisions.At the time of our review, DOD officials stated the department was in the  process of analyzing the fully burdened cost of fuel and how it will be  applied throughout DOD\u2019s acquisition process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Steps to Establish an Approach for Fuel Demand Management, but Is Still Developing Comprehensive Guidance", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken steps since our 2009 report to establish an approach for  managing overall fuel demand, but is still developing comprehensive  guidance to address fuel demand management.

Specifically, in our prior report we noted that  DOD\u2019s organizational framework did not provide the department with  visibility or accountability over fuel demand management issues at  forward-deployed locations because there was no one office or official  specifically responsible for these issues. We also found that fuel demand  reduction efforts were not consistently shared across DOD. Our prior  work has shown that visibility and accountability for results are  established by assigning roles and responsibilities, establishing goals and  metrics, and monitoring performance.", "Congress and DOD have taken multiple steps to address this issue. For  instance, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2009 established a Director of Operational Energy Plans and  Programs (OEP&P) responsible for serving as the principal advisor to  the Secretary of Defense for operational energy plans and programs,  which includes, among other responsibilities, monitoring and reviewing all  operational energy initiatives in DOD. Since its establishment, OEP&P  has worked in conjunction with all of the services\u2019 energy offices to  provide visibility and accountability for operational energy issues,  including fuel demand management issues. For example, with input from  the services, OEP&P published the Operational Energy Strategy  Implementation Plan in March 2012 that assigns responsibilities for key  tasks and specifies milestones and reporting requirements that will  provide accountability for implementing the operational energy strategy  (see appendix II). Also, in March 2012, DOD established a Defense  Operational Energy Board to help provide visibility and accountability over  operational energy efforts that included fuel demand management. The  board will be cochaired by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Operational Energy Plans and Programs and the Joint Staff\u2019s Director of  Logistics. According to OEP&P officials, the board will help review,  synchronize, and support departmentwide operational energy policies,  plans, and programs. In addition, the board will monitor and, where  necessary, recommend revisions to DOD policies, plans, and programs  needed to implement the operational energy strategy. DOD\u2019s operational  energy strategy, the implementation plan, and the Defense Operational  Energy Board are intended to support departmentwide operational energy  efforts while also having a direct impact on DOD\u2019s efforts to manage fuel  demand at forward-deployed locations in Afghanistan. Figure 2 provides a  timeline of key events in OEP&P\u2019s efforts to manage operational energy  issues.", "To further enhance DOD\u2019s operational energy efforts, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 required the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff to designate a senior official under the jurisdiction  of the Chairman to be responsible for operational energy plans and  programs. In August 2011, the Chairman appointed the Joint Staff\u2019s  Director of Logistics to this position with responsibility for coordinating  with OEP&P and implementing initiatives pursuant to the operational  energy strategy. According to Joint Staff officials, the Joint Staff is  committed to addressing operational energy capability gaps and in April  2012 formed a Joint Capabilities Task Group to identify and address fuel  demand management issues. The task group\u2019s mission includes: providing recommendations to better integrate operational energy into  current and future materiel and nonmateriel solutions to improve  operational capabilities, and  supporting evaluation of the operational energy requirements process,  and providing recommendations through the requisite Functional  Capabilities Boards and the Joint Logistics Board to the Joint  Capabilities Board or Joint Requirements Oversight Council for  validation/decision.", "According to Joint Staff officials, the Joint Capabilities Task Group will  focus on developing a framework for analysis that supports service and  DOD efforts to inform leaders such as commanders in Afghanistan about  operational energy vulnerabilities. The group will also propose guidance  to support the combatant commands in assessing logistics plans and  evaluating energy assumptions that will influence the execution of  operational plans. OEP&P officials told us that the Joint Staff plays a key  role in collaborating with OSD to create policy, develop joint doctrine, and  advocate for combatant commander requirements. Joint Staff officials told  us their goal is to incorporate energy efficiency guidance into existing joint  publications when such documents are up for review. As part of this  process the Joint Staff\u2019s Joint Capabilities Task Group will prioritize which  guidance documents will be revised first, then work toward updating other  applicable guidance documents. According to DOD officials, when these  guidance documents are updated, operational energy issues, including  priorities for addressing fuel demand management, should be included in  the services\u2019 and combatant commanders\u2019 mission planning activities.", "Our prior work on government performance and management also notes  the importance of establishing goals and metrics to assess progress and  provide accountability. DOD\u2019s operational energy strategy established  three overarching operational energy goals to: (1) reduce demand for  energy in military operations, (2) expand and secure energy supplies, and  (3) build energy security into the future force, and DOD has begun to take  steps to establish metrics to measure progress toward these goals.  OEP&P officials told us that the Defense Operational Energy Board will  develop departmental operational energy performance metrics to promote  the energy efficiency of military operations by the end of fiscal year 2012.  The board will also monitor and, as needed, recommend revisions to  DOD policies needed to implement the operational energy strategy and  monitor progress to ensure DOD is meeting its operational energy goals.  OEP&P officials stated that establishing such strategies, goals, and  metrics will not only provide DOD with the direction and tools needed to  assess progress towards meeting fuel demand management goals at  forward-deployed locations, including those in Afghanistan, but will  enhance DOD\u2019s efforts to achieve its overall fuel demand management  objectives worldwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Funding and Incentives for Fuel Demand Management at Forward-deployed Locations", "paragraphs": ["Since our 2009 report, DOD has taken action to fund fuel demand  management initiatives and restructure maintenance contract task orders  to include energy efficiency considerations and incentives. In our 2009  report on fuel demand management, we found that DOD had not  established incentives or a viable funding mechanism for fuel reduction  projects at forward-deployed locations and commanders were not  encouraged to identify fuel reduction projects as a priority. Specifically,  we found that much of the funding provided to support military operations  in Iraq and Afghanistan was provided through supplemental funding  measures,fuel demand management initiatives. As such, we recommended that  DOD establish incentives for commanders of forward-deployed locations  to promote fuel demand reduction at their locations, as well as identify a   making it difficult to plan for and fund costly projects such as  viable funding mechanism for the department and commanders of  forward-deployed locations to pursue fuel reduction initiatives. DOD  partially concurred with our recommendation and said it was not  convinced that financial incentives represent the best fuel reduction  strategy for forward-deployed locations, but stated that it will seek to  incorporate fuel reduction incentives while recognizing the primacy of  mission accomplishment. Since the release of our 2009 report, DOD\u2019s  increased focus on fuel demand management at forward-deployed  locations, and the establishment of OEP&P and the U.S. Forces- Afghanistan Operational Energy Division, increased priority has been  given to fuel demand management initiatives at forward-deployed  locations in Afghanistan. For example, DOD has undertaken a  widespread initiative to replace spot generation with centralized power  and the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan\u2019s Operational Energy Division secured  $108 million in fiscal year 2011 from the Army to invest in more efficient  power production and distribution equipment for the Afghanistan area of  operations. According to DOD\u2019s analysis, this investment will remove as  many as 545 spot generators saving an estimated 17.5 million gallons of  fuel per year, the equivalent of removing over 7,000 fuel trucks from the  roads in Afghanistan. Furthermore, the Marine Corps committed fiscal  year 2011 funds to support the accelerated procurement of a suite of  more efficient tactical energy systems. Also, in 2011, DOD completed the  Afghanistan Micro-Grid Project, which was an effort at Bagram Airfield  to replace less efficient generator sets with a smart, more energy-efficient  power source. DOD provided over $2 million to fund this project.  Furthermore, to reinforce DOD\u2019s commitment to reducing its reliance on  fuel at forward-deployed locations, in September 2011 the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics issued a  memorandum to support reprogramming overseas contingency  operations funds to expedite the deployment of more efficient generators,  centralized power projects, and shelter modification kits to forward- deployed locations in Afghanistan.", "With the establishment of OEP&P, DOD also has increased its efforts to  obtain visibility over funding for initiatives aimed at reducing fuel  consumption at forward-deployed locations. For example, to help ensure  the services\u2019 budgets support the implementation of DOD\u2019s operational  energy strategy, OEP&P is now required by law to publish an annual  operational energy budget certification report. This report certifies that the  proposed services\u2019 budgets are adequate for the implementation of the  operational energy aspects of their respective energy strategies.  According to OEP&P\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget certification report, the  services anticipate spending approximately $4 billion on operational  energy initiatives over the next 5 years. Although the operational energy  initiatives identified through OEP&P\u2019s budget certification process are not  specifically targeted for use at forward-deployed locations in Afghanistan,  many of them have been tested and fielded there, and will be applicable  to DOD\u2019s fuel demand management efforts both in Afghanistan and  elsewhere. To improve the energy efficiency of DOD\u2019s operational forces,  the fiscal year 2012 President\u2019s Budget also included an additional $19  million in funding for an Operational Energy Capabilities Improvement  Fund. Its mission is to fund innovation to improve operational  effectiveness by investing in research and development for operational  energy innovation. These funds are intended as \u201cseed money\u201d to  consolidate or initiate promising operational energy programs. The initial  funding for these efforts will be administered by OEP&P, but the  programs will be ultimately sustained by the services. According to DOD,  the initiatives funded by this program will support efforts to develop and  rapidly transition energy technologies for the combat force, resulting in  improved military capabilities, fewer energy-related casualties, and lower  costs for the taxpayer. As part of this fund, in January 2012 DOD allotted  funds to begin developing six new operational energy initiatives. Although  these initiatives are not finalized and are still being developed, DOD  expects these efforts to play a role in reducing fuel demand at forward- deployed locations. Initiatives such as the development of new energy- efficient containerized living units used in expeditionary bases around the  world, energy-efficient heating and air conditioning systems, and newly  designed shelter systems used to decrease fuel demand at forward- deployed locations are some of the products being developed under this  program.", "In addition to the initiatives mentioned above, DOD has placed a higher  priority on ensuring contractors responsible for executing operations and  maintenance contracts are addressing energy efficiency issues at  forward-deployed locations. For instance, the U.S. Army Materiel  Command has taken steps to enforce the existing language included in  Logistics Civil Augmentation Program ( LOGCAP) contracts to require  more attention be given to increasing energy efficiency at forward- deployed locations. To address power generation concerns, a June 2011  LOGCAP policy letter indicates that contractors should complete  assessments for the more than 4,000 generators located on over 130  bases in Afghanistan to assess power load demand and energy  efficiency. The U.S. Army Materiel Command and U.S. Forces- Afghanistan also plan to include energy efficiency standards in the  technical specifications for new and refurbished facilities maintained by  support contractors. Further, contractors will also now be required to  provide energy assessments and make recommendations for improved  efficiency to supported units. According to DOD and LOGCAP officials,  these and other efforts are ongoing and are expected to assist DOD in  reducing its fuel consumption at forward-deployed locations. Officials also  told us that by increasing efforts to reduce fuel demand, U.S. forces will  both reduce operational costs associated with high fuel consumption and  increase combat capability by freeing up forces used to protect fuel  convoys and reduce forces\u2019 exposure to hostile action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Guidance for Fuel Demand Management", "paragraphs": ["DOD has issued guidance for fuel demand management and is  developing comprehensive guidance for its operational, planning, and  training decisions. Since our 2009 report on fuel demand management,  various DOD organizations have issued guidance for fuel demand  management and the department is still developing more comprehensive  guidance on how to incorporate energy efficiency considerations into  DOD\u2019s operational, planning, and training decisions. In our 2009 report,  we found that DOD had not developed overarching fuel demand  management guidance to require commanders to manage and reduce  fuel consumption at forward-deployed locations. In addition, we found that  there was little or no written guidance that addressed fuel demand  management or energy efficiency for base camp construction or for other  business decisions such as maintenance or procurement actions. We  recommended that multiple organizations within DOD develop specific  guidance on fuel demand management in their areas of responsibility.  DOD has since issued overarching, theater-level, and base camp  construction and development guidance, but is still developing policy and  doctrine to provide guidance on how energy efficiency considerations will  be included in operational decisions that affect fuel demand management  at forward-deployed locations, such as those in Afghanistan.", "To provide overarching guidance to DOD\u2019s operational energy efforts,  including reducing its reliance on fuel at forward-deployed locations, DOD  published its 2011 operational energy strategy and its 2012  implementation plan. As noted above, the implementation plan provides  DOD stakeholders involved in fuel demand management with a roadmap  for accomplishing key tasks to reduce fuel demand. However, because  OEP&P is a new organization and in the early stages of working within  DOD to develop guidance and policies, DOD has yet to address how  energy efficiency considerations will be incorporated into its joint  doctrine, which provides the principles that guide the employment of  U.S. military forces in an operational environment and is essential to  organizing, training, and equipping its units. DOD\u2019s Operational Energy  Strategy Implementation Plan also acknowledges the need for additional  comprehensive guidance and directs the Joint Staff and military  departments to report to the Defense Operational Energy Board by the  fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 on how the strategy\u2019s goals will be  reflected in policy, doctrine, and professional military education. The plan  further states that the scope of this task includes examining departmental  directives, instructions, field manuals, doctrine, professional military  education curricula, and other relevant guidance in order to include  energy efficiency considerations in its operational, planning, and training  decisions.", "Central Command has updated its guidance for construction and base  camp development to place more emphasis on energy efficiency for  contingency and permanent base camps that support missions in its area  of responsibility. Specifically, in 2009 we noted that some of DOD\u2019s  combatant commands and military services had developed construction  standards for forward-deployed locations, but our analysis showed that  this existing guidance was largely silent with regard to fuel demand  management and energy efficiency. Pertinent Central Command  guidance in 2009 included only one reference to energy efficiency  requiring that semi-permanent facilities\u2014those facilities with a life  expectancy of more than 2 years, but less than 25 years\u2014be designed  and constructed with finishes, materials, and systems selected for  moderate energy efficiency. According to the guidance in effect at that  time, semi-permanent construction standards were to be considered for  operations expected to last more than 2 years. In 2009, we found that the  temporary status of many forward-deployed locations, combined with a  focus on quickly establishing the locations rather than on sustaining them,  limited DOD\u2019s emphasis on constructing energy-efficient facilities. We  recommended that DOD develop specific guidelines that address energy  efficiency considerations in base construction. In October 2011, Central  Command revised its policy for base camp construction standards to  include a greater emphasis on energy efficiency. For example, the  revised policy now calls for energy conservation best practices to be  incorporated into all new construction that is to be environmentally  controlled. Also, in an effort to reduce fuel consumption at forward- deployed locations, the policy requires all bases receiving power  generation support from contingency contracting programs, such as  LOGCAP, to conduct an electrical infrastructure assessment. According  to Central Command officials, conducting electrical infrastructure  assessments will allow base planners and commanders to determine  areas where energy efficiency shortfalls may be occurring, and identify  areas where energy generation and distribution adjustments should be  made in order to save fuel. The policy also includes other notable  provisions to promote energy efficiency such as encouraging the  insulation of temporary facilities when funds and time allow. Central  Command and OEP&P officials told us that revisions to this policy  encourage commanders to consider incorporating energy efficiency  standards into base camp construction and development, which may not  have otherwise been an area of concern.", "In addition, in April 2012, the Commander of Bagram Airfield, one of the  major U.S. logistics bases in Afghanistan, issued additional guidance to  direct the use of energy efficiency design and construction standards for  all new and renovation construction projects on Bagram Airfield. For  example, the guidance requires new or renovated projects to use energy- saving equipment such as fluorescent or Light-Emitting Diodes (LED)  lighting, energy-efficient motors, and that windows, ceilings, walls, and  roofs be insulated, among other things. According to an OEP&P official,  all requests for approval to build or alter facilities must be reviewed by  Bagram\u2019s Joint Facilities Utilization Board, which provides a way to  enforce efficiency standards throughout this location.", "In 2011 and 2012, commanders in Afghanistan issued theater-level fuel  demand management guidance regarding maintenance and procurement  decisions for forward-deployed locations. In our 2009 report on fuel  demand management we found a lack of attention to fuel demand  management in guidance, including an absence of fuel usage guidelines  and metrics to evaluate progress of reduction efforts, as forward-deployed  locations are maintained and sustained over time. We also found the  procurement of products for forward-deployed locations presents  opportunities for DOD to consider making purchases that take into  account fuel demand or energy efficiencies when practical. Since that  time, commanders in Afghanistan have issued general policy memoranda  on repairing, maintaining, and procuring equipment to help reduce fuel  consumption at forward-deployed locations. Specifically, in June and  December of 2011 the Commander, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, issued  operational energy guidance in the form of policy memoranda to  soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and civilians of U.S. Forces- Afghanistan located at forward-deployed locations. These memoranda  stated that commanders are expected to take ownership of fuel demand  management issues and explore methods for reducing fuel demand at  forward-deployed locations. For example, commanders are to ensure  personnel take action to repair faulty equipment, avoid using heating and  air conditioning in unoccupied buildings, and work with support  contractors, suppliers, and the services to improve inefficient facilities and  devices such as generators and air conditioning units. In addition,  commanders should push for rapid fielding of new fuel savings methods,  where appropriate, and pursue existing, proven alternative energy options  that reduce the use and transport of fuel. During our visit to forward- deployed locations in Afghanistan in October 2011, however, many of the  commanders and personnel we spoke with were unaware of this  guidance or commented that it did not provide specific direction on how to  implement needed fuel demand management actions. As such, many of  the commanders with whom we spoke had not establish specific  guidance or protocols to address day-to-day fuel use, such as  establishing a base policy on turning off lights in unoccupied buildings or  immediately repairing faulty equipment. In addition, we found that some of  the commanders we spoke with in Afghanistan were not using available  energy efficient equipment and/or had not fixed faulty equipment. For  example, at Camp Sabalu-Harrison we observed inefficient generator  configurations in which multiple generators were used to power individual  tents when one generator could have provided adequate power for  multiple tents (see fig. 3). At Camp Leatherneck we observed, and were  told that available tent shading used to provide cover from the sun was  not being used consistently throughout the base (see fig. 4).", "Additionally, at Joint Combat Outpost Pul-A-Sayed, we observed an entry  control checkpoint powered by a 60-kilowatt generator when, according to  the commander in charge of this outpost, a smaller more energy-efficient  5- or 10-kilowatt generator would have provided adequate power (see fig.  5). Army officials at this location told us that the previous generator used  to power this entry control checkpoint had failed and had not been  replaced because it was considered a lower priority. According to officials  at the outpost, these types of equipment breakdowns happen frequently,  and due to the lack of adequately trained personnel and other mission  requirements, may take weeks to be repaired or replaced.", "After our visit to Afghanistan, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan developed and  issued a fragmentary order to provide specific guidance on fuel demand  management procedures, and specific operational energy practices  needed to comply with the policy memoranda. The April 2012 operational  energy fragmentary order established milestone dates for accomplishing  tasks for reducing fuel demand at select forward-deployed locations.  According to DOD officials, this type of guidance provides U.S. Forces- Afghanistan\u2019s subordinate commands with the specific direction  necessary to begin reducing fuel demand at its forward-deployed  locations. The order requires commanders located at forward-deployed  locations in Afghanistan to distribute the December 2011 operational  energy policy memo so that personnel will be aware of fuel demand  management goals and objectives for forward-deployed locations. In  addition, the order requires commanders to develop, distribute, and  implement policies that will complement the operational energy policy  memorandum no later than 30 days after the order was published.  Furthermore, the guidance requires that fuel accountability metrics be  established and made available by U.S. Forces-Afghanistan\u2019s Joint Staff  (J-4) by the end of May 2012.", "Further, service officials acknowledged the need for additional training  throughout the department on fuel demand management, and told us the  services are developing various curricula and training programs to make  sure personnel deployed to forward-deployed locations know how to  operate relevant equipment and understand the importance of reducing  fuel demand. For example, U.S. Marine Corps Training and Education  Command has begun developing and adding operational energy courses  to its expeditionary warfighting school curricula and, according to officials,  has begun working with other services to further educate military  personnel on the importance of energy conservation.", "OEP&P officials stated that DOD\u2019s focus on operational energy issues  and the organizations supporting this effort are new, and expect these  efforts to have an impact on fuel demand management at forward- deployed locations as they are implemented.

DOD also stated that the Defense  Operational Energy Board\u2019s membership ensures departmentwide  coordination. Furthermore, DOD stated that the Operational Energy  Implementation Plan addresses energy improvements in current  operations, and the Board will oversee the tracking and sharing of  information on fuel demand improvements. Lastly, DOD stated that the  department conducts an annual review of the components\u2019 budgets and  activities to determine their adequacy for implementing the Operational  Energy Strategy, and this review also encompasses fuel demand  management initiatives that are being developed, fielded, or supported by  the budget.

However,  until these initiatives are fully implemented, we are unable to assess the  extent to which they will address our recommendation. During the course  of our review, DOD officials explained that many of the initiatives included  in its Operational Energy Strategy Implementation Plan, such as  identifying investment gaps in the department\u2019s science and technology  portfolio necessary to reduce fuel demand, would be completed at the  end of fiscal year 2012 or beyond. DOD officials also told us they were in  the process of finalizing the department\u2019s annual review of the  components\u2019 budgets and activities to include fuel demand management  initiatives that were being developed or fielded. However, at the  conclusion of our review, this budget review process had not been  finalized and the department acknowledges that its annual budget review  efforts do not include initiatives that are part of rapid fielding or are locally  procured.

Our review focused on fuel demand management initiatives planned for  or underway at forward-deployed locations in Afghanistan. For the  purposes of our review, we defined fuel demand management initiatives  to include nonmateriel and materiel solutions to assist DOD in reducing its  reliance on fuel consumed at forward-deployed locations. We did not  examine energy efficiency initiatives for naval vessels, aircraft, or combat  vehicles. We asked officials to identify key initiatives planned or under  way to reduce fuel demand.
