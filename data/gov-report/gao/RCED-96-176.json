Dating back to the opening of the BART system in 1972, transportation planners envisioned a system that would bring travelers and airport employees into the San Francisco International Airport. These plans began to take shape in 1991, when the Congress authorized an extension of the BART system to the airport as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). In the act, the Congress authorized $568,500,000 for two BART projects and one light rail project in Santa Clara county. The act directed the Secretary of Transportation to fully fund the BART airport extension project, and if necessary, use the unobligated balance in the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund.", "In 1992, the Bay Area\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) completed the first of three draft EISs for the project. As a result, local transit agencies selected an alternative that proposed to link together BART\u2019s and Caltrain\u2019s (the commuter rail operator\u2019s) systems and the airport, at one intermodal location west of the airport. The estimated cost of this alternative was $960 million. However, local opposition to environmental impacts and concerns over ridership forecasts required a study of new alternatives. Subsequently, BART took the lead in preparing a new draft EIS and in April 1995 selected an alternative that would bring the BART system directly into the airport via a subway. The estimated cost of this alternative was $1.27 billion. While this alternative mitigated some of the concerns about environmental impacts and ridership, there was continued opposition to the project. The airport objected to the impacts that the proposed subway\u2019s construction would have on the airport, and the House and Senate Conference Committee report accompanying DOT\u2019s fiscal year 1996 appropriations expressed concerns about the project\u2019s cost.", "As a result, BART developed new alternatives and studied them in a third draft EIS. In September 1995, BART selected a new preferred alternative, which changed the project\u2019s entrance into the airport from a subway to an aerial (elevated track) approach. The current project consists of about 8 miles of straight mainline track running south from the existing end of the BART line at the city of Colma to the city of Millbrae, with an incorporated \u201cY-stub\u201d aerial line diverging from the mainline track and running southeast into the airport, then southwest out of the airport to Millbrae (see fig. 1). The aerial line would include a transit station adjacent to a planned international air terminal and would be linked to the airport\u2019s light rail system to circulate passengers through the airport. Besides the airport and Millbrae stations, the project would include the Hickey and the Tanforan station north of the airport. Under this option, BART has reduced the estimated cost to $1.167 billion, primarily from savings associated with eliminating the more costly subway option.", "The overall purpose of the BART airport extension is to help relieve existing and anticipated highway congestion and improve air quality in the region. The traffic on local highways, including Interstate 280, Interstate 380, and Highway 101 regularly exceeds the existing capacity. For 1990 to 2010, MTC forecasts a 16-percent increase in traffic between San Francisco and counties in the South Bay area, including a 52-percent increase in traffic to and from the airport. San Francisco International Airport is proceeding with a $2.3 billion expansion and projects its annual passengers will increase by 21 million between 1990 and 2006. In addition, the San Francisco Bay area has been unable to meet federal air quality standards. The BART extension to the airport is one of the key transportation related antipollution measures. Recognizing growth in the region, the governor of California, on April 29, 1996, designated the BART airport extension project as one of the state\u2019s top three transportation priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA Must Review the Finance Plan and Answer Congressional Concerns Before Signing a Full Funding Grant Agreement", "paragraphs": ["While DOT has announced its support for a full funding grant agreement, key activities remain before FTA can sign one.

Since March 1995, BART has been coordinating with the Service to develop and finalize plans for mitigating impacts to the snakes\u2019 and frogs\u2019 habitat and in January 1996 submitted a mitigation proposal to the Service. On May 20, 1996, the Service issued an opinion of \u201cno jeopardy\u201d on the project\u2019s impact to both species. The Service found that BART\u2019s mitigation plan, which included enhancing the snakes\u2019 and frogs\u2019 habitat at a location several miles from the construction area, was acceptable for ensuring the continued existence of the species.", "In September 1995, BART issued a second supplemental draft EIS. In the draft statement, BART changed the project\u2019s entry into the airport from a subway to an aerial approach, thereby responding to a congressional request to reduce the project\u2019s cost and the impacts that construction would have on the airport. In November 1995, the boards of directors of BART and the San Mateo County Transit District (SAMTRANS) adopted this approach as the locally preferred alternative. BART held public hearings on the new alternative and received 800 comments on the draft statement. According to BART\u2019s schedule, it plans to receive FTA\u2019s approval for the final EIS by June 14, 1996, and expects FTA to issue the record of decision by mid-August 1996. Under regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, during this time FTA must provide a 30-day public comment period; BART must assess and incorporate any comments received; and FTA must review and assess the comments and how BART responded to them. According to FTA officials, they expect to issue the final EIS in early June 1996.", "Finally, federal law requires BART to obtain a section 404 wetlands permit from the Corps. As with the requirements for protecting endangered species, BART must develop a plan for mitigating the project\u2019s impacts to wetlands. The amount of wetlands affected is about 1 acre. BART has been coordinating with officials from the Corps and submitted a permit application in February 1996. According to BART, the Corps has provided preliminary agreement on its wetlands mitigation plan. However, a final permit cannot be issued until after FTA approves the final EIS and signs a record of decision for the project. Corps officials stated that a permit could be issued by September 1996.

Since this project is intended as a demonstration, little empirical evidence currently exists to confirm the 15- to 20-percent cost savings BART has assumed it will realize from using the innovative procedures known as design-build contracting. BART has built into each of the design-build contracts an 18.5-percent contingency amount for cost increases. As described below, much of the cost savings stems from reducing construction time. But these savings could be offset by higher borrowing costs should federal appropriations be less than specified in BART\u2019s draft finance plan.", "According to BART officials, design-build is an emerging method for implementing construction of new rail transit systems and has the capacity to save significant time and money. Under conventional procurement, a public agency is typically responsible for managing a project from planning to completion. Most of the project\u2019s elements are segmented into components (contracts) that are separately bid and administered through the design, construction, testing, and startup phases by the agency. Design-build procurement in the public sector refers to a process whereby a public agency awards a single master contract to a private firm for the final design, construction, and startup of a public works project. After certification that the project is complete, the contractor turns the keys over to the agency.", "According to BART officials, the reduced costs from using the design-build approach are obtained primarily by reducing the construction time and administrative costs. On the airport extension project, BART estimates that one-third less time will be needed to construct the project as a result of awarding only four design-build contracts rather than using multiple conventional contracts. BART estimates that it will complete the project in about 50 months, beginning in October 1996. In comparison, on BART\u2019s recent $1.2 billion project under which two new stations opened since last year and three additional stations will open this year, BART used conventional procedures, which will require about 78 months to complete, and awarded 50 major contracts. Extrapolating from this experience, BART projected that for the airport extension project a design-build approach would reduce costs by 15 to 20 percent over conventional procedures.", "However, FTA officials stated that since the BART airport extension project is intended to demonstrate any potential cost savings derived from design-build procedures, it would be difficult to predict the exact savings from employing this method. A 1994 report, prepared for FTA, on design-build projects stated that although the use of the method is very common for transit projects outside of North America, the North American experience is limited and has provided mixed results.", "In addition, the cost savings from the design-build procedures are time-dependent; that is, the method assumes that with fewer contracts, BART can complete the project in less time. Less time means less money needed. However, the shorter construction period also requires BART\u2019s financial contributors to provide larger contributions over a shorter period of time. As discussed in the next section on BART\u2019s finance plan, BART anticipates that federal appropriations for the project will increase from the $10 million for fiscal year 1996 to between $50 million and $121 million each year for fiscal years 1997 through 2003. Should these appropriation levels not materialize, the cost of the project would increase because BART would have increased borrowing costs. Any cost savings derived from the design-build approach could thereby be offset."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contingencies and Cost Escalations", "paragraphs": ["Because of the scale and risk of the project, BART has added on to construction and design estimates 18.5 percent for the four design-build contracts. These amounts for contingencies and cost escalations\u2014totaling approximately $107 million\u2014are included in the project\u2019s overall cost of $1.167 billion. In addition, BART has included a separate $80 million contingency amount specified as a line item in its finance plan, resulting in a total of $187 million for contingencies. In commenting on BART\u2019s finance plan, FTA found that BART\u2019s contingency amounts were low on the basis of past experiences with other transit projects. FTA recommended an additional contingency funding source and a contingency level higher than 18.5 percent to cover potentially higher environmental costs for mitigating the impacts on wetlands and for connecting the project to the airport terminal. In commenting on a draft of our report, BART stated that surcharges collected at its Daly City station would be set aside in a capital reserve account to cover unexpected cost growth beyond the project\u2019s $1.167 billion budget. These surcharges would generate $2 million a year. If additional funds are needed, premium surcharges could be imposed for trips at the airport station. These surcharges could generate $3 million to $4 million each year but would not be available until the airport station opened in 2000.", "These additional funds may be needed to cover a potential $40 million cost escalation not included in BART\u2019s finance plan. In an April 1996 report on BART\u2019s cost estimates, FTA\u2019s project management oversight consultant found that BART calculated its costs based on a midpoint of construction in 1997. The consultant stated that BART should have used 1999 as the midpoint of construction.

Specifically, the plan anticipates that the federal government will provide funding of $750 million. BART anticipates finalizing agreements with the state, the San Francisco airport, and other regional transit agencies to provide the $417 million local share. From our review of the finance plan and our discussions with officials from FTA, the airport, regional transit agencies, and the state, we have identified four factors that could affect the plan\u2019s viability. First, although BART\u2019s finance plan assumes that the Congress will appropriate $51 million to $121 million annually for the next 7 fiscal years, FTA has advised BART to revise its plan and lower the appropriation levels expected each year. As a result, the project\u2019s borrowing costs will increase. Second, BART must secure changes in California law to facilitate establishing a borrowing program to cover expected cash shortfalls. Third, the airport has not identified the source of funding it will use to meet its $200 million commitment to the project. And, fourth, all of the remaining local contributors face financial limitations that have capped their current pledges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Funds Are Expected to Provide Two-Thirds of the Project\u2019s Financing; Cash Shortfalls Are Also Expected", "paragraphs": ["Federal funds are expected to cover about two-thirds of the total cost for the project\u2014approximately $750 million.

As a result, BART will experience cash shortfalls of up to $240 million during the 50 months of construction. This situation will require it to borrow funds to fill the gap between revenues and expenses. BART is working to develop a borrowing program to address the revenue gap, including securing a second source of collateral to back up the expected federal appropriations.", "Figure 2 shows the funding sources for the BART project. The $750 million federal contribution includes $40 million in interest costs associated with BART\u2019s need to issue debt to finance cash shortfalls occurring during construction. BART expects additional funds from the airport ($200 million), the state ($108 million), SAMTRANS ($99 million), and MTC ($10 million). BART cannot contribute to the capital costs of the project, since it is precluded by state legislation from making expenditures for extending service or facilities outside the geographic boundaries of its district until it fulfills certain commitments within its original district.According to BART officials, the agency will not have fulfilled these commitments before completing the airport extension project.", "Appendix II displays BART\u2019s April 1996 draft finance plan for the airport extension. The finance plan shows that federal contributions will continue after revenue operations for the project begin in fiscal year 2000 and construction ends in fiscal year 2001. This is because BART will be using federal funds received in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to pay back principal and interest from debt (short-term notes) that it must issue during construction. BART must issue the debt because construction will be completed over 50 months but financing will be stretched over 84 months. As BART spends funds for construction faster than it receives them, a cash shortfall will result. The largest shortfall is $240 million in fiscal year 2000.", "FTA\u2019s financial advisers stated that BART\u2019s request for appropriations of $120 million in the later years of the finance plan represent 18 percent of the total $660 million in FTA\u2019s current annual budget for the New Starts program. Accordingly, FTA advised BART to reevaluate the finance plan by assuming a lower level of annual federal funding. In its April 1996 revised plan, BART assumed lower federal appropriations for the early years of the project but higher federal appropriations in the last 3 years. BART also reduced the interest rate it assumed it would have to pay for its borrowing program from 6.25 percent to 5.5 percent. The annual level of federal appropriations and the assumed interest rate can affect BART\u2019s borrowing costs. Table 1 compares BART\u2019s current finance plan to funding scenarios that vary the level of federal appropriations and the interest rate. FTA has advised BART that borrowing costs are federally reimbursable. However, in commenting on the draft of our report, FTA stated that the federal contribution for the BART project will be capped at $750 million; BART would bear any and all expenses beyond those identified in the grant agreement as necessary to complete the project. The federal contribution will be finalized in the grant agreement, which is still subject to negotiation between FTA and BART.", "With different federal appropriations and interest rates, BART\u2019s borrowing costs could increase from its current estimate of $40 million to about $70 million should federal appropriations be provided over a longer time than the 7 years in BART\u2019s plan.

The purpose of the demonstration project is to determine whether this contracting method will, in fact, help contain costs for large transit projects. We revised the report to characterize design-build procedures as a new, rather than unproven, contracting method. The FTA officials also suggested technical and editorial changes to the report. Where appropriate, we incorporated these changes into the report.", "BART provided written comments on our draft report. Overall, BART stated that the draft report in large part accurately represented the facts associated with the proposed airport extension project. However, BART did not concur with the opinions we reached in our \u201cResults in Brief\u201d and \u201cConclusions\u201d sections. For example, BART did not agree with our characterization of design-build as an unproven contracting method for transit projects. BART also disagreed with our conclusions that its timetable for the project was very ambitious and that its finance plan had little room for error. As explained, we revised the report to characterize design-build as a new, rather than unproven, contracting method. However, we continue to believe that BART\u2019s timetable is ambitious, particularly since BART expects FTA to sign a full funding grant agreement by October, yet FTA has not approved the final EIS, the airport will not identify its funding commitment until September, and FTA has yet to certify to the Appropriations Committees that the project has resolved a number of significant issues. We also continue to believe that the finance plan has little room for error because state legislation has not yet been amended to allow BART to pledge its assets as collateral, limited funding sources are available to cover cost growth beyond the project\u2019s $1.167 billion budget and contingency amounts, and BART may not have adequately escalated the costs to cover 2 years\u2019 worth of inflation (about $40 million). BART\u2019s detailed comments and our responses are found in appendix V.", "We performed our review from October 1995 through May 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We also interviewed FTA legal counsels in headquarters and Region 9, FTA headquarters and Region 9 program officials, and BART officials responsible for project management. To determine congressional requirements placed on FTA regarding the BART airport extension, we reviewed federal legislation and the relevant Conference Committee report.", "To describe the project\u2019s current schedule and estimated cost and factors that could affect the cost, we interviewed officials at FTA Region 9 and BART, and we reviewed cost information contained in each of the draft EISs, the report on the locally preferred alternative, and reports by BART\u2019s financial consultant. We also reviewed project and construction schedules submitted to FTA by BART. We reviewed reports from FTA\u2019s financial consultant for the project, FTA\u2019s annual reports, and oversight documents by Region 9 officials. In addition, we reviewed information from critics of the project, including local transportation agency officials; transportation planners; and industry, environmental, and transit user groups. To assess BART\u2019s progress in meeting environmental requirements needed to begin construction, we interviewed officials from FTA, BART, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers. In addition to reviewing each draft EIS, we reviewed the biological assessment for endangered species.", "To describe the project\u2019s financing plan, we interviewed officials at FTA and each of the local agencies involved in the project\u2019s financing, including BART, the San Mateo County Transit District, the San Francisco International Airport, the California Transportation Commission, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. We obtained and reviewed documents from these officials regarding their financial contribution to the plan. To further assess the airport\u2019s contribution to the plan, we obtained the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) guidance on allowable costs and interviewed FAA officials. We also reviewed analyses of BART\u2019s commercial borrowing program that were contained in reports from BART\u2019s financial consultant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From BART", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on BART\u2019s letter dated May 23, 1996."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. In regard to coordinating with the airport, previous documents by BART and statements of FAA and San Francisco airport officials contradict BART\u2019s current concern that it will miss a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d should construction not move forward immediately. First, BART\u2019s September 1995 draft EIS found that the BART project\u2019s impact on the construction schedule of the airport would be nominal. The report noted that BART and the airport would have to coordinate minor changes and minimal modifications to align their respective projects. Second, the airport director stated to us that changes in BART\u2019s construction schedule would not adversely affect the airport\u2019s expansion plans: No major design changes would be needed to accommodate the BART project. FAA officials stated that the BART project is an add-on to the airport\u2019s construction plans. Therefore, the airport can complete its construction without the BART extension\u2019s being complete.", "More importantly, BART needs to secure a financial commitment from the airport. BART\u2019s additional information provided in its response does not lessen the concerns we raised about the airport\u2019s contribution to the project. First, the Airport Commission has not provided FTA or BART with a written agreement committing to its portion of the project\u2019s cost nor has it determined the source of funds it will use to pay for that portion of the BART project located on the airport\u2019s property. Second, FAA has not reviewed or approved the source of funds the airport can use for the BART project. Until these issues are resolved, the project does not have a firm commitment to cover nearly one-fifth of the project\u2019s $1.167 billion cost. 2. Where appropriate, we have updated the draft report to include the more current information that BART presented. In particular, we have updated the report to indicate that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a no jeopardy opinion on May 20, 1996, regarding the project\u2019s impacts to endangered species. We also updated the report to show that FTA expects to approve the final EIS in early June. At that time, the final EIS is subject to a 30-day comment period and subsequently will result in FTA\u2019s issuing a record of decision for the project by mid-August. 3. In regard to cost savings from using design-build procedures, we agree that this method has been used successfully in improving public and private sector construction projects. However, as FTA\u2019s consultants on design-build procedures noted in their 1994 report, the experience with these procedures for transit projects is common outside of North America, and these experiences may not be directly transferable to the U.S. environment. For example, transit agencies in foreign countries have greater control over land use than their U.S. counterparts, thus facilitating public-private partnerships for the development of fixed guideway (transit) systems. In addition, the combination of design and construction disciplines within a single private entity tends to be a fairly prevalent practice in many countries but relatively new in the United States. FTA\u2019s consultants also noted that much of the experience gained by design-build projects outside the transit industry may not be directly transferable to that industry because of differences in industries\u2019 structures and the types of technologies used. As a result of the limited experience with design-build procedures in an American contracting environment, FTA selected the BART project to demonstrate any benefits from using these innovative contracting procedures to reduce a project\u2019s schedule and cost. Accordingly, we affirm our concerns with BART\u2019s projection of 15- to 20-percent savings from employing design-build contracting procedures.", "In regard to the project management oversight consultant\u2019s (PMOC) report, the PMOC did not assess the certainty of BART\u2019s estimated 15- to 20-percent cost savings attributable to design-build procedures. However, the PMOC expressed concern that BART\u2019s estimates did not take into account 2 years of inflation, thereby underestimating the project\u2019s total cost by as much as $40 million. We have updated the body of our report to incorporate the PMOC\u2019s concerns.", "We have revised the report in response to BART\u2019s explanation of why it included 18.5 percent in the design-build contracts to cover contingencies. However, it should be noted that BART\u2019s portrayal of the combined amounts for contingencies as 43 percent of the construction costs is misleading. Cost growth in nonconstruction areas, such as vehicle acquisition and financing, must also be funded by these contingency funds. The total amount for contingencies represents about 16 percent of the project\u2019s total cost. 4. We changed the report to state that FTA intends to cap the federal contribution at $750 million for the BART project; BART would bear any and all expenses beyond those identified in the grant agreement as necessary to complete the project. However, FTA does not expect to conclude a grant agreement with BART until October 1996; the final federal contribution that would be included in the grant agreement is still subject to negotiation between FTA and BART.", "In regard to surcharges, while we recognize that BART proposes to use surcharges to cover unexpected cost growth, the ability of these surcharges for this purpose is limited. The Daly City station surcharge is projected to provide BART with $2 million each year to cover unexpected cost growth. This represents two-tenths of 1 percent of the project\u2019s total cost. The proposed premium surcharge at the airport would generate $3 million to $4 million each year, or three-tenths of 1 percent of the project\u2019s total cost. Furthermore, the airport surcharge would not be available until the airport station is open\u2014currently projected for October 2000. In addition, none of these surcharges can be applied until the state legislature passes an amendment to BART\u2019s legislation. 5. We recognize that the project has strong support, including support from the governor and state legislature. However, during the course of our review, we also discovered opposition to the project from numerous groups, including local transit advocates, environmental groups, the Air Transport Association, and area businesses. In addition, two of BART\u2019s board members expressed concern to us about the cost-effectiveness of the project. We also observed at a public hearing on the BART project that many transit users and advocates in San Mateo county were concerned about the impact of this project on their current transit system, particularly the impact on Caltrain. Many of these opponents also testified before the House Appropriations Committee, which highlights the controversial nature of the project. 6. We have modified our draft report to include the new information on environmental approvals. While BART has made progress in gaining environmental approvals, we continue to consider the project\u2019s timetable ambitious. In addition, we cannot reconcile BART\u2019s concern over our conclusion with its previous statement that the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d will close without FTA\u2019s speedy approval.", "Furthermore, BART\u2019s comments do not address a major obstacle for the financing plan, namely a change in California law needed to finance anticipated cash-flow shortfalls. We continue to believe that there is little room for financial error. As noted earlier, the surcharges BART cites to create a capital account for funding shortages would produce annual revenues equaling less than 1 percent of the project\u2019s current cost."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Chicago", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "San Francisco", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of Information Management and Communications", "paragraphs": ["Armetha Liles The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
