Specifically, the departments' are now exchanging pharmacy and drug allergy data on over 21,000 shared patients, an increase of about 2,700 patients between June and October 2008. Further, they recently expanded the number of standards and specifications with which they expect their interoperability initiatives will comply. In addition, DOD reported that it received certification of its electronic health record system. Also, the departments have defined their plans to further increase their sharing of electronic health information. In particular, they have identified the Joint Executive Council Strategic Plan and the DOD/VA Information Interoperability Plan as the key documents defining their planned efforts to provide interoperable health records. These plans identify various objectives and activities that, according to the departments, are aimed at increasing health information sharing and achieving full interoperability, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. However, neither plan identifies results-oriented (i.e., objective, quantifiable, and measurable) performance goals and measures that are characteristic of effective planning and can be used as a basis to track and assess progress toward the delivery of new interoperable capabilities. In the absence of results-oriented goals and performance measures, the departments are not positioned to adequately assess progress toward increasing interoperability. Instead, DOD and VA are limited to assessing progress in terms of activities completed and increases in data exchanged (e.g., the number of patients for which certain types of data are exchanged). The departments have continued to take steps to set up the interagency program office. For example, they have developed descriptions for key positions and agreed with GAO's July 2008 recommendation that they give priority to establishing permanent leadership and hiring staff. Also, the departments developed the program office organization structure document that depicts the office's organization and, in January 2009, the departments approved a program office charter to describe, among other things, the mission and function of the office. Nonetheless, DOD and VA have not yet fully executed their plan to set up the program office. For example, among other activities, they have not yet filled key positions for the Director and Deputy Director, or 22 of 30 other positions identified for the office. In the continued absence of a fully established program office, the departments will remain ineffectively positioned to assure that interoperable electronic health records and capabilities are achieved by the required date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you are aware, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) have, for over a decade, pursued initiatives to  share data between their health information systems.

Among these, a presidential task force recommended in May 2003 that  DOD and VA develop and deploy bidirectional electronic health records by  fiscal year 2005. Further, in July 2007, the President\u2019s Commission on Care  for America\u2019s Returning Wounded Warriors reported that the departments  had continued to develop independent, stand-alone systems and  recommended that DOD and VA move rapidly to make all essential health  information available to clinicians.", "More recently, to expedite the departments\u2019 efforts to exchange electronic  health information, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2008 included provisions directing DOD and VA to jointly develop and  implement, by September 30, 2009, fully interoperable electronic health  record systems or capabilities. The Act required that these systems or  capabilities be compliant with applicable interoperability standards of the  federal government, and it established an interagency program office to be  a single point of accountability for the departments\u2019 efforts.", "In addition, the Act directed GAO to assess DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s progress in  implementing the electronic health record systems and to report  semiannually its results to the appropriate congressional committees.  Accordingly, on July 28, 2008, we issued the first of our reports in  response to the Act. Further, we subsequently testified on this report in  September 2008. As agreed with the committees of jurisdiction, our  objectives for this second report are to (1) evaluate the departments\u2019  progress and plans toward developing electronic health record systems or  capabilities that allow for full interoperability and comply with applicable  federal interoperability standards and (2) determine whether the  interagency program office established by the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is positioned to function as a single  point of accountability for developing and implementing electronic health  records.", "To carry out these objectives, we reviewed our past work in this area;  analyzed current agency documentation (including plans for achieving  interoperability, actions accomplished or planned to establish the  interagency program office, and program documentation for  interoperability standards); and conducted interviews with officials from  DOD, VA, and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the  National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2008 through January  2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Historically, patient health information has been  scattered across paper records kept by many different caregivers in many  different locations, making it difficult for a clinician to access all of a  patient\u2019s health information at the time of care. Lacking access to these  critical data, a clinician may be challenged to make the most informed  decisions on treatment options, potentially putting the patient\u2019s health at  greater risk. The use of electronic health records can help provide this  access and improve clinical decisions.", "Electronic health records are particularly crucial for optimizing the health  care provided to military personnel and veterans. While in military status  and later as veterans, many DOD and VA patients tend to be highly mobile  and may have health records residing at multiple medical facilities within  and outside the United States. Making such records electronic can help  ensure that complete health care information is available for most military  service members and veterans at the time and place of care, no matter  where it originates.", "Key to making health care information electronically available is  interoperability\u2014that is, the ability to share data among health care  providers. Interoperability enables different information systems or  components to exchange information and to use the information that has  been exchanged. This capability is important because it allows patients\u2019  electronic health information to move with them from provider to  provider, regardless of where the information originated. If electronic  health records conform to interoperability standards, they can be created,  managed, and consulted by authorized clinicians and staff across more  than one health care organization, thus providing patients and their  caregivers the necessary information required for optimal care. (Paper- based health records\u2014if available\u2014also provide necessary information,  but unlike electronic health records, paper records do not provide  decision support capabilities, such as automatic alerts about a particular  patient\u2019s health, or other advantages of automation.)", "Interoperability can be achieved at different levels. At the highest level,  electronic data are computable (that is, in a format that a computer can  understand and act on to, for example, provide alerts to clinicians on drug  allergies). At a lower level, electronic data are structured and viewable,  but not computable. The value of data at this level is that they are  structured so that data of interest to users are easier to find. At still a  lower level, electronic data are unstructured and viewable, but not  computable. With unstructured electronic data, a user would have to find  needed or relevant information by searching uncategorized data. Beyond  these, paper records also can be considered interoperable (at the lowest  level) because they allow data to be shared, read, and interpreted by  human beings. Figure 1 shows the distinctions between the various levels  of interoperability and examples of the types of data that can be shared at  each level.", "According to DOD and VA officials, not all data require the same level of  interoperability. For example, in their initial efforts to implement  computable data, DOD and VA focused on outpatient pharmacy and drug  allergy data because clinicians gave priority to the need for automated  alerts to help medical personnel avoid administering inappropriate drugs  to patients. On the other hand, for such narrative data as clinical notes,  unstructured, viewable data may be sufficient. Achieving even a minimal  level of electronic interoperability is valuable for potentially making all  relevant information available to clinicians."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Efforts to Adopt and Implement Federal Interoperability Standards Are Ongoing", "paragraphs": ["Interoperability depends on adherence to common standards to promote  the exchange of health information between participating agencies and  with nonfederal entities in supporting quality and efficient health care.

In addition, specifications are needed for implementing the standards, as well as criteria and a  process for verifying compliance with the standards.", "In April 2004, the President called for widespread adoption of  interoperable electronic health records by 2014.

The  departments also had jointly published a common (agreed to) set of  interoperability standards called the Target DOD/VA Health Standards  Profile. Updated annually, the profile was used for reviewing joint  DOD/VA initiatives to ensure standards compliance. The departments  anticipate such updates and revisions to the profile as additional  federal standards emerge and are recognized and accepted by HHS. In  addition, according to DOD officials, the department was taking steps  to ensure that its modernized health information system, AHLTA, was  compliant with standards by arranging for certification through the  Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology.

In contrast, 36 activities lacked results-oriented performance  measures, limiting the extent to which progress can be reported in terms  of results achieved. For example, one activity calls for the development of  a plan for interagency sharing of essential health images, but does not  provide details on measurable achievement of additional interoperable  capabilities.

Further, we interviewed responsible officials to obtain  information regarding the steps taken by the departments to certify their  electronic health record products.", "To evaluate DOD and VA plans toward developing electronic health record  systems or capabilities, we obtained information from agency  documentation and interviews with cognizant DOD and VA officials  pertaining to the November 2007 VA/DOD Joint Executive Council  Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2008-2010, and the September 2008 DOD/VA  Information Interoperability Plan (Version 1.0) which together constitute  the departments\u2019 overall plans for achieving full interoperability of  electronic health information. Additionally, we reviewed information  gathered from agency documentation to identify interoperability  objectives, milestones, and target dates. Further, we analyzed objectives  and activities from their plans to determine if DOD and VA had established  results-oriented performance measures that enable the departments to  assess progress toward achieving increased sharing capabilities and  functionality of their electronic health information systems.", "To determine whether the interagency program office is fully operational  and positioned to function as a single point of accountability for  developing and implementing electronic health records, we analyzed DOD  and VA documentation, including the schedule for setting up the office  identified in the DOD/VA Information Interoperability Plan. Additionally,  we interviewed responsible officials to determine the departments\u2019  progress to date in setting up the interagency program office. Further, we  reviewed documentation and interviewed DOD and VA officials to  determine the extent to which the departments have positioned the office  to function as a single point of accountability for developing electronic  health records.", "We conducted this performance audit at DOD sites and also the  Department of Heath and Human Services\u2019 Office of the National  Coordinator for Health Information Technology in the greater Washington,  D.C., metropolitan area from August 2008 through January 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, key contributions to this report  were made by Mark Bird, Assistant Director; Neil Doherty; Rebecca  LaPaze; J.
