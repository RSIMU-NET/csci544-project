The geographic combatant commands provide unity of  command over all the United States forces in a specific region. Generally,  the commander of each combatant command has the authority to  organize the structure of each command as necessary to carry out  assigned missions and maintain staff to assist in exercising authority,  direction and control over subordinate commands and other assigned  forces.

It is  intended to help guide decisions in determining the size and shape of the  department for the future, with a global presence emphasizing the Asia- Pacific and Middle East regions of the world. One of the principles  outlined in the guidance is the need to examine the existing campaign  and contingency plans in the context of the new strategy so that more  limited resources may be better aligned with current mission  requirements. Further, it states that DOD must continue to reduce the  cost of doing business, which includes reducing the rate of growth in  personnel costs and finding further efficiencies in overhead and  headquarters, in its business practices, and in other support activities. At  a time of growing economic and fiscal constraints, it is critical that DOD  ensure the geographic combatant commands, their subordinate unified  commands and other activities, and respective service component  commands have the appropriate levels of resources to meet current  mission requirements in the most efficient and effective manner possible.", "In response to direction from the congressional committees to review the  resources of the combatant commands, this report (1) identifies the  trends in resources devoted to DOD\u2019s geographic combatant commands  and their service component commands, and (2) assesses the extent that  DOD has processes in place to manage and oversee the resources of the  combatant commands.", "To conduct this work we identified sources of information within DOD that  would provide data on the resources at the geographic combatant  commands, to include their subordinate unified commands and other  activities, and corresponding service component commands.

Our review excluded  U.S. Central Command and its corresponding service component  commands due to their responsibilities to support military operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan during the past several years. To identify trends in  resources devoted to DOD\u2019s geographic combatant commands, to  include their subordinate unified commands and other activities, and their  service component commands, we obtained and analyzed available  authorized positions and actual assigned personnel (military, civilian, and  contractors) data and operation and maintenance obligations data for  each of the five geographic combatant commands, and their  corresponding service component commands from fiscal years 2001  through 2012. We focused our review on operation and maintenance  obligations\u2014as these obligations reflect the primary mission and  headquarters-support costs of the combatant commands, to include their  subordinate unified commands and other activities, and their  corresponding service component commands\u2014to include the costs for  civilian personnel and service-support contracts. Our review excluded  obligations of operation and maintenance funding for DOD\u2019s overseas  contingency operations not part of DOD\u2019s base budget. Since historical  data was unavailable in some cases, we limited our analysis of trends to  authorized military and civilian positions at the combatant commands  from fiscal years 2001 through 2012 and authorized military and civilian  positions at the service component commands from fiscal years 2008  through 2012. Due to the availability of data, we similarly limited our  analysis of trends in operation and maintenance obligations at the  combatant commands and service component commands to fiscal years  2007 through 2012. We assessed the reliability of the data given these  and other limitations, and we determined it was sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To determine the extent to which DOD has processes in place  to manage and oversee the resources of the combatant commands, we  obtained and analyzed documentation on DOD\u2019s policies, procedures,  and systems used for determining and validating manpower  requirements and managing personnel at the combatant commands, to  include their subordinate unified commands and other activities, and  corresponding service component commands. We also interviewed  officials at DOD, the Joint Staff, the geographic combatant commands  and some of their respective subordinate unified commands, and the  service component commands to obtain documentation on any steps  DOD had taken to reexamine the size and structure of its combatant  commands and the processes that the combatant commands and their  components use to determine, track and report their manpower and  assigned personnel (military, civilians, and contractors) and mission and  headquarters-support costs.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2012 to May 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The six geographic combatant  commands have responsibilities for accomplishing military operations in  regional areas of the world. The three functional combatant commands  operate worldwide across geographic boundaries and provide unique  capabilities to the geographic combatant commands and the military  services. In addition, each geographic combatant command is supported  by multiple service component commands that help provide and  coordinate service-specific forces, such as units, detachments,  organizations and installations, to help fulfill the commands\u2019 current and  future operational requirements.

The commands\u2019 structure may  include a principal staff officer, personal staff to the commander, a special  staff group for technical, administrative, or tactical advice and other  groups of staff that are responsible for managing personnel, ensuring the  availability of intelligence, directing operations, coordinating logistics,  preparing long-range or future plans, and integrating communications  systems. The commands may also have liaisons or representatives from  other DOD agencies and U.S. government organizations integrated into  their staffs to enhance the command\u2019s effectiveness in accomplishing  their missions. While the commands generally conform to these  organizational principles, there may be variations in a command\u2019s  structure based on its unique mission areas and responsibilities.", "The staff of a combatant command, subordinate unified command, or a  joint task force is generally composed of military and civilian personnel  drawn from the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps, personnel from  other DOD components, interagency personnel, and other personnel  associated with contracted services.

Our  analysis of data showed that the establishment of U.S. Northern  Command in fiscal year 2003 and U.S. Africa Command in fiscal year  2008 drove the increase in the total number of authorized military and  civilian positions since fiscal year 2001. U.S. Northern Command was  established in fiscal year 2003 to provide command and control over  DOD\u2019s homeland defense mission and to coordinate defense support of  civil authorities. U.S. Africa Command was established in fiscal year 2008  to focus U.S. security efforts within the African continent and strengthen  security cooperation with African countries, which had been primarily the  responsibility of U.S. European Command. At the remaining combatant  commands, our analysis showed growth in the number of authorized  positions in each command\u2019s theater special operations command, which  further drove overall position increases. For example, from fiscal years  2001 through 2012 the number of authorized positions at U.S. Pacific,  European, and Southern Commands\u2019 theater special operations  commands increased by almost 400 positions, largely to fulfill increased  mission requirements. Figure 2 shows the increases or changes in total  authorized military and civilian positions at the five geographic combatant  commands that we reviewed.", "The geographic combatant commands have also become much more  reliant on civilian personnel. We found that the number of authorized  civilian positions at the combatant commands almost doubled from about  2,370 in fiscal year 2004 to about 4,450 in fiscal year 2012. In contrast,  the number of authorized military positions decreased about 9 percent  from approximately 6,250 to 5,670 in the same period. This changed the  composition of the commands markedly. In fiscal year 2004, military  positions made up about three-quarters of total authorized positions  supporting the combatant commands that we reviewed; however, due to  the substantial increase in the number of authorized civilian positions the  proportion of military positions at the combatant commands is now just  over half. According to DOD officials, the increase in authorized civilian  positions is due in part to DOD-directed efforts to convert positions filled  by military personnel or contractors to civilians. As part of the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s 2010 efficiency initiative, baselines were established for the  number of authorized civilian positions at the combatant commands for  fiscal years 2011 through 2013. In June 2011, the Secretary of Defense  directed a series of initiatives designed to more effectively manage  combatant command manpower and funding, which further set baselines  for civilian manpower at the combatant commands for fiscal years 2013  through 2017. Any growth above these baselines in fiscal years 2013  through 2017 has to be revalidated by the Joint Staff and military  services, and must be based on workload and funding considerations.  This baseline in civilian positions is reflected in our analysis of the number  of authorized positions at the five geographic combatant commands, with  growth in civilian positions slowing significantly from fiscal years 2011  through 2012. Figure 3 shows changes in the combatant commands\u2019  number of authorized military and civilian positions from fiscal years 2004  through 2012.", "The availability of data on the number of contractor personnel or full-time  equivalents varied across the combatant commands, and thus trends  could not be identified. DOD officials stated the department generally  tracks and reports expenditures for contract services, and that the  combatant commands were not required to maintain historical data on the  number of contractor personnel. We found that the combatant commands  had taken initial steps to collect data on contractor full-time equivalents  and reliance on personnel performing contractor services varies across  the combatant commands. For example, U.S. Northern Command  reported having 460 contractor full-time equivalents at its command in  fiscal year 2012, whereas U.S. European Command reported having 169  contractor full-time equivalents supporting the command in fiscal year  2012. Our work over the past decade on DOD\u2019s contracting activities has  noted the need for DOD to obtain better data on its contracted services  and personnel to enable it to make more informed management  decisions, ensure department-wide goals and objectives are achieved,  and have the resources to achieve desired outcomes. In response to  GAO\u2019s past work, DOD has outlined its approach to document contractor  full-time equivalents and collect manpower data from contactors.  However, DOD does not expect to fully collect contractors\u2019 manpower  data until fiscal year 2016. The Secretary of Defense, as part of his  2010 efficiency initiative, directed the department to reduce funding for  service-support contracts by 10 percent per year across the department  for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. In June 2011, the Secretary of  Defense established limits on service support contract expenditures at the  combatant commands in fiscal years 2011 through 2013.", "Our analysis of data provided by the military services showed that total  authorized military and civilian positions at the service component  commands supporting the geographic combatant commands we reviewed  increased by about one-third from about 5,970 in fiscal year 2008 to  about 7,800 in fiscal year 2012. The increases in authorized military and  civilian positions at the service component commands supporting U.S.  European Command account for more than one-third of the total increase  in authorized positions across all the service component commands.  Among the services, the Army\u2019s service component commands saw the  greatest increase in authorized positions, accounting for about 85 percent  of the total increase in authorized positions. The service component  commands fulfill dual roles: organizing, training and equipping assigned  service-specific forces while also assisting the combatant commands in  their employment during military operations. According to DOD officials,  service component commands with assigned forces such as Pacific Air  Forces and Army Europe, are likely to have larger staffs than service  component commands that do not have assigned forces, such as Marine  Forces Africa. Figure 4 shows the increase in authorized positions at the  service component commands that we reviewed. Similar to the data on  the number of personnel performing contract services at the combatant  commands, we found that the data on the number of personnel  performing contact services at the service component commands varied  or was unavailable, and thus trends could not be identified. We found that  some service component commands do not maintain data on the number  of personnel performing contract services and others used varying  methodologies to track these personnel, counting the number of  contractors on hand or the number of identification badges issued.", "When adjusted for inflation, total mission and headquarters-support costs  from fiscal years 2007 through 2012\u2014including costs for civilian pay,  contract services, travel, and equipment\u2014more than doubled at the five  geographic combatant commands we reviewed. The cost growth, from  about $500 million in fiscal year 2007 to about $1.1 billion in fiscal year  2012, primarily was due to increases in contract services and civilian  pay. For example, U.S. Southern Command\u2019s mission and  headquarters-support costs more than quadrupled from about $45 million  in fiscal year 2007 to about $202 million in fiscal year 2012; more than  half of the increase was attributable to contract services, and 20 percent  of the increase was attributable to civilian pay. In addition, U.S. Pacific  Command\u2019s mission and headquarters-support costs increased from  about $175 million in fiscal year 2007 to about $246 million in fiscal year  2012; about 65 percent of these cost increases was attributable to civilian  pay.

The costs grew from  about $430 million dollars in fiscal year 2007 to about $605 million in  fiscal year 2012. The increase primarily was due to the establishment of  U.S. Africa Command\u2019s supporting service component commands, which  first reported costs in fiscal year 2009. U.S. Africa Command\u2019s mission  and headquarters-support costs were $71 million in fiscal year 2012. In  addition, the service component commands at U.S. European and Pacific  Commands experienced cost increases from fiscal years 2007 through  2012 of about $53 million and $54 million respectively, which accounted  for the majority of the remaining increase in mission and headquarters- support costs. Figure 6 shows the increase in the mission and  headquarters-support costs at the service component commands that we  reviewed from fiscal years 2007 through 2012. The Army\u2019s service  component commands accounted for more than half of the total increase  in mission and headquarters-support costs across all service component  commands over the period. Across the service component commands the  Air Force components account for the majority of the mission and  headquarters support\u2013costs.

In  November 2007, to improve the links between mission, manpower  requirements, and resource decisions, the Joint Staff was tasked by the  Deputy Secretary of Defense with reviewing the authorized positions  supporting the combatant commands. The review resulted in the  establishment of baselines in the number of major DOD headquarters  activity positions at each of the geographic and functional combatant  commands that could be adjusted based only on the approval of new  missions. However, these baselines apply only to positions performing  major DOD headquarters activity functions, and our prior work found that  DOD\u2019s major headquarters activity data is not always complete and  reliable. In addition, as part of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s 2010  efficiency initiative, the combatant commands, along with other  organizations within the department, were asked to identify efficiencies in  headquarters and administrative functions, support activities, and other  overhead. Specifically, the combatant commands were directed to  perform organizational assessments to identify any disconnects between  the commands\u2019 priorities and their allocation of resources. Based on  these assessments and the direction of the Secretary of Defense, the  combatant commands reduced seven Standing Joint Force  Headquarters to two global Standing Joint Force Headquarters,  decreased their reliance on individual augmentees at two commands,  and consolidated joint task forces at several commands. These changes  eliminated a total of about 530 authorized positions and about 470  temporary personnel in total. In addition, some commands, such as U.S.  European Command and U.S. Northern Command, were directed to  reduce personnel and consolidate staff functions to better align their  available resources with their current missions. Other commands,  however, such as U.S. Africa Command, did not make specific reductions  as part of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s efficiency initiative.", "In 2011, DOD announced that it was studying the regional structure of the  combatant commands, estimating that it could save $900 million from  fiscal years 2014 through 2017 by considering alternatives to the current  construct of regional geographic combatant commands. To achieve the  estimated cost savings, the Joint Staff considered several alternatives to  the current structure that involved merging geographic combatant  commands. However, the Joint Staff has since reviewed and rejected the  proposed options, in part because they believed that merging commands  would not achieve the estimated savings.

As part of  the reductions, officials stated the department plans to reduce civilian  positions at the combatant commands and Joint Staff by approximately  400 positions over 5 years through fiscal year 2018.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff Instruction 1001.01A, Joint Manpower and Personnel Program,  outlines a process for determining and validating requirements for  additional manpower at the combatant commands. According to the  instruction, requests for additional positions should be mission driven,  supported by the combatant commands\u2019 priorities, and based on studies  of the capabilities and readiness of the commands\u2019 personnel.  Furthermore, the combatant commands should consider other options  prior to requesting additional positions, such as internally realigning  personnel, using internal funding for contract positions, and utilizing  temporary personnel. As part of their request, the combatant commands  may also rely on manpower studies to support their requests for  additional positions. For example, U.S. Africa Command and U.S. Pacific  Command are currently undergoing manpower studies to review their size  and structure as part of DOD\u2019s emphasis on the Asia-Pacific and Middle  East regions of the world. According to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff Instruction 1001.01A, requests for additional positions are to be  drafted by the commands and submitted to the Director of the Joint Staff.  A team made up of representatives from the Joint Staff and the military  services is then convened to evaluate the request, based on the  command\u2019s mission drivers, capability gaps, internal offsets, and  manpower assessments. This team makes recommendations to the  Director of the Joint Staff and the operations deputies of the military  services, who decide whether or not to endorse the request for additional  positions to support each command\u2019s mission. If the request for additional  positions is endorsed, the authorized positions are initially documented on  the combatant command\u2019s joint table of distribution and the positions get  evaluated, along with DOD\u2019s other resource requirements, to determine  whether or not it will be funded. The combatant commands may also  submit requests to the Joint Staff for minor changes in their authorized  structure to meet changing missions as long as they do not affect the total  number of authorized positions at the command. Figure 7 describes the  process for reviewing and validating proposed increases in authorized  positions at the combatant commands.", "While DOD and some military services have policies on manpower  management, we found that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Instruction 1001.01A does not specify a process for reviewing the  combatant commands\u2019 size and structure and focuses on requests for  additional positions or nominal changes in authorized positions.  Specifically, some military service regulations that guide manpower  requirements at the service component commands require manpower to  be periodically evaluated to ensure they still meet assigned missions.  For example, Army Regulation 570-4, Manpower and Equipment Control,  Manpower Management, suggests that Army components\u2019 manpower  requirements be reevaluated by Army commanders and agency heads  every two to five years, and optimally every three years. In addition, DOD  Directive 1100.4, Guidance for Manpower Management states that  manpower policies, procedures, and structures should be periodically  evaluated to ensure efficient and effective use of manpower resources.  In contrast, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 1001.01A  suggests that manpower requirements at the combatant commands be  set based on the projection of workload over three years, but it has no  provisions for reevaluating this determination. DOD officials confirmed  that there is no periodic evaluation of the commands\u2019 authorized  positions, in part because there is no process in place to review  authorized positions when there is a change in roles or missions. Our  prior work on strategic human capital management found that high- performing organizations stay alert to emerging mission demands and  remain open to reevaluating their human capital practices in light of their  demonstrated successes or failures in achieving the organization\u2019s  strategic objectives. In addition, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Instruction 1001.01A does not address personnel associated with  contracted services. As previously stated, DOD Instruction 1100.22,  Policy and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix, requires DOD\u2019s  workforce, which includes military and civilian manpower and contractor  support, to be structured to execute missions at a low-to-moderate level  or risk. The purpose of DOD Instruction 1100.22, among other things, is  to establish policy, assign responsibilities, and prescribe procedures for  determining the appropriate mix of manpower within the department.", "While DOD is aware of the growth in missions and authorized positions at  the combatant commands since 2001 and has undertaken some efforts to  manage and assess the size and structure of the combatant commands,  these efforts did not constitute a comprehensive and periodic bottom-up  review of the combatant commands\u2019 total workforce. Without a  comprehensive, periodic evaluation of the commands\u2019 authorized  positions, DOD will not be able to ensure that the combatant commands  are properly sized and structured to meet their assigned missions or  ensure that the commands identify opportunities for managing personnel  resources more efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Combatant Commands Are Inconsistent in Their Use of the Existing Personnel Management System to Identify and Track Their Total Assigned Personnel", "paragraphs": ["DOD has an electronic system to document and review information about  authorized positions and assigned military and civilian personnel at the  combatant commands, but the commands are not consistently inputting  complete information on all assigned personnel. All of the combatant  commands that we reviewed use to some extent the Electronic Joint  Manpower and Personnel System (e-JMAPS) to manage their  commands\u2019 manpower and personnel; however, we found differences  across the commands in how they use the system to manage their  assigned personnel. DOD has identified e-JMAPS as the system of  record to document the combatant commands\u2019 organizational structure  and according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction  1001.01A, Joint Manpower and Personnel Program, the system should  be used to track the manpower and personnel required to meet the  combatant commands\u2019 assigned missions. The instruction states e- JMAPS should provide visibility over joint personnel by allowing the Joint  Staff and combatant commands to maintain, review, modify, and report all  personnel actions in the system, to include changes in authorized  positions or updates to personnel arriving at or departing from the  command. In January 2012, the Vice Director of the Joint Staff issued a  memo identifying e-JMAPS as the authoritative data source for DOD and  for congressional inquiries of joint personnel, stating that e-JMAPS must  accurately reflect the manpower and personnel allocated to joint  organizations, such as the combatant commands, to provide senior  leaders with the necessary data to support decision making in a fiscally  constrained environment. According to Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government, policies, procedures, and mechanisms to  effectively manage an organization\u2014including accurate and timely  documentation of an organization\u2019s transactions and resources and  effective management of an organization\u2019s workforce\u2014are important  factors in enabling an organization to improve accountability and achieve  their missions.", "Our review found that the commands vary in the types of personnel that  each enters into e-JMAPS and that some commands exclude certain  personnel from the system when managing personnel who support the  command. All of the combatant commands we reviewed said that they  use e-JMAPS to manage and track authorized military and civilian  positions within the command, and where appropriate, other temporary  personnel. To fulfill temporary or short-duration mission requirements,  additional personnel\u2014such as activated reservists, civilian overhires, and  interagency personnel\u2014may be needed to support the commands\u2019  authorized manpower. However, the commands varied in their use of e- JMAPS to track these additional personnel because Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff Instruction 1001.01A does not clearly state that temporary  personnel, such as civilian overhires and activated reservists, should be  accounted for in e-JMAPS, resulting in the differences in what is tracked  by the commands. While U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern  Command track their civilian overhires and activated reservists in e- JMAPS, U.S. European Command does not, and U.S. Pacific Command  tracks only activated reservists in e-JMAPS. In addition, officials at most  of the combatant commands that we reviewed noted that they do not  account for temporary personnel, such as interagency personnel, in  eJMAPS, and that they primarily use the system to manage personnel  filling authorized positions at the command, which may not include all  command personnel. For example, during the course of our review, U.S.  European Command officials identified approximately 172 civilian  overhires and activated reservists supporting the command in fiscal year  2012 that are not accounted for in e-JMAPS. U.S. Africa Command is the  only command that inputs all assigned personnel, to include civilian  overhires, activated reservists, and interagency personnel, into e-JMAPS  regardless of whether they are filling an authorized position, reflecting  about 250 additional personnel at the command in fiscal year 2012. Our  review also found that 4 out of the 5 geographic combatant commands do  not account for personnel performing contract services in e-JMAPS.  According to DOD officials, personnel performing contract services are  not required to be accounted for in e-JMAPS and those personnel would  be included in the costs reported for contract services. As part of a  department-wide plan to account for contractor services, DOD has begun  efforts to collect contractor-manpower data directly from contractors, but  DOD does not expect to fully collect data on personnel performing  contract services until fiscal year 2016.", "Furthermore, according to Joint Staff officials, the combatant commands  do not always input personnel information in a timely manner and civilian  personnel may not be tracked as diligently in e-JMAPS as military  personnel. While Joint Staff officials stated that the accuracy of personnel  data in e-JMAPS has improved, there is no specific guidance requiring  the combatant commands to periodically review and update data on  personnel assigned to the command to ensure that data in e-JMAPS is  accurate and up-to-date. According to some combatant command  officials, command staffs input personnel information in e-JMAPS when  personnel arrive at the command. However, our review confirmed that  there are differences across the combatant commands in how often they  update and review personnel information to ensure its accuracy, and  officials at one command confirmed that while e-JMAPS is their primary  personnel management system, they also rely on military service  personnel systems to track personnel because the service systems are  more accurate and capture more personnel information than e-JMAPS.", "While the combatant commands use e-JMAPS to manage some of their  assigned personnel and review personnel data periodically, there is no  DOD guidance requiring that all personnel supporting the commands be  tracked in e-JMAPS or that reviews of personnel occur within specific  timeframes to ensure assigned personnel data is accurate. Without  guidance to require complete and accurate information on all personnel  supporting the combatant commands, and the consistent and timely  review of assigned personnel data in e-JMAPS, DOD and the combatant  commands cannot be assured that e-JMAPS will provide comprehensive  data to inform their personnel decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have a System or Formal Process to Gather Information on Authorized Manpower and Assigned Personnel at the Service Component Commands", "paragraphs": ["In addition to not having complete information on the personnel assigned  to the combatant commands, DOD and the combatant commands do not  have oversight or visibility over authorized manpower or the number of  assigned personnel at the service component commands. As stated  previously, the service component commands often fulfill dual-roles:  organizing, training, and equipping assigned service-specific forces while  also assisting the combatant commands in their employment during  military operations. Some service component commands, such as U.S.  Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa manage large numbers of  assigned forces and operational units, while others, such as Marine  Forces South, manage few, if any, assigned forces. While these service  component commands provide support to the combatant commands, the  service component commands use service-specific personnel  management systems to account for their authorized manpower and  personnel, and DOD does not have a formal process to gather this  information. A Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff publication identifies  the importance of having reliable data on all personnel within a  geographic combatant command\u2019s area of responsibility for visibility of  personnel and for effective planning. Further, our previous work has  highlighted the need for agencies to have valid, reliable data and be  aware of the size of their workforce, its deployment across the  organization and the knowledge, skills and abilities needed for the agency  to pursue its mission.", "Even though the combatant commands rely on the service component  commands\u2019 personnel to support their missions and operational  requirements, they do not have oversight or visibility into the service  component commands\u2019 authorized manpower or how the components  determine the size and structure of their staff to support the combatant  commands\u2019 missions. Based on our analysis of data that we gathered, in  fiscal year 2012 there were 7,795 authorized positions at the  headquarters of the service component commands, which was more than  double the 3,817 authorized positions at the headquarters of the  combatant commands. Moreover, the service component commands are  generally structured to perform staff functions that are similar to those of  the combatant commands, such as collecting intelligence, coordinating  operations, performing strategic planning and policy, and supporting  communications. For example, at U.S. Pacific Command, there are about  650 authorized positions dedicated to gathering, analyzing, and  performing intelligence support, while there are about 175 additional  authorized positions within U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s service component  commands dedicated to the same staff function. According to DOD  officials, since headquarters personnel at service component commands  with large numbers of assigned forces are more likely to be focused on  the components\u2019 organize, train, and equip function rather than on solely  supporting the combatant commands missions, these positions may not  necessarily be redundant. However, given the similarities in mission  requirements and staff functions at the combatant and service component  commands, it is important for the combatant commands to have visibility  over the service component command\u2019s authorized manpower to be able  to determine whether these similarities at the combatant and service  component commands are necessary or duplicative.", "Moreover, the combatant commands do not have complete information  on personnel assigned to their service component commands. Officials at  the combatant commands and Joint Staff stated that they do not have  visibility over personnel at the service component commands or access to  the service-specific personnel management systems that the service  component commands use, and if they need information to determine  whether personnel at the service component commands can support the  combatant commands\u2019 mission requirements they have to request it from  the service component commands. For example, several combatant  commands we spoke with did not identify any specific processes that they  use to regularly gather information on personnel at their service  components, while officials at U.S. Africa Command stated that they had  only recently begun requesting this information on a monthly basis.  However, as part of the process for validating new manpower  requirements, the combatant commands are required to identify whether  the functions and tasks that they are requesting additional positions for  can be fulfilled by personnel at the service component commands.  Without access to the service-specific personnel data or a process to  regularly gather personnel information, it is unclear how this validation  process can occur expeditiously. According to a Joint Staff official,  officials in that office discuss the personnel and capabilities available  within the service component commands when reviewing the combatant  commands\u2019 requests for additional positions, but they also do not have  direct access to the service component commands\u2019 personnel data  systems to review the personnel assigned to the service component  commands\u2019 headquarters staff. Without a formal process to gather  information on the authorized manpower and assigned personnel at the  service component commands, the combatant commands may not have  the visibility that is necessary to appropriately size themselves to meet  their assigned missions, and are at risk for unnecessarily duplicating  functions between the combatant commands and their service component  commands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budget Documents Do Not Provide Details on Authorized Manpower and Funding For Each Combatant Command", "paragraphs": ["While each military department annually submits budget documents for  operation and maintenance to Congress\u2014including the total authorized  military positions, civilian and contractor full-time equivalents, and the  funding required to support the missions of the combatant commands that  they are the combatant command support agent for\u2014these documents  do not provide transparency into the authorized positions, the full-time  equivalents, or the funding directed to each combatant command.

Also, volume 2A, chapter 1 of DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation,  7000.14.R states that the military departments must ensure adequate  visibility over the resources of combatant command-directed missions  and other costs for each command. DOD guidance for the submission of  the President\u2019s budget justification materials for Fiscal Year 2013, which  include the military departments\u2019 budget documents for operation and  maintenance, also states that components should report details on  contractor manpower/full-time equivalents in addition to military, civilian,  and reserve manpower data.

For example, the Air Force\u2019s  fiscal year 2013 budget document shows that the combatant commands it  supports have about 6,550 authorized military positions and civilian and  contractor full-time equivalents, but it does not separate the data to  indicate the number of authorized positions or full-time equivalents at  each of the five combatant commands that it supports. Similarly, the  Army\u2019s comparable budget document shows about 3,200 total authorized  military positions and civilian and contractor full-time equivalents at all the  commands that it supports, but does not separate the data to display  authorized positions and full-time equivalents at each of the three  commands that it is responsible for. In addition, while the military  departments\u2019 budget documents provide information on the total funding  that all the combatant commands receive for expenses such as civilian  pay, contract services, travel, transportation and other supply costs, they  do not separate these expenses and display them for each command. For  example, the Air Force\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget document noted a lump  sum of about $285 million for civilian pay for all five combatant commands  that the Air Force supports, and the Army\u2019s comparable budget document  showed a total of about $38 million for travel costs for all of the  commands that it supports. Neither of the military departments\u2019 budget  documents displayed this cost data for each individual combatant  command.", "In reviewing DOD budget and policy documents, we found that the  military departments, as the combatant commands support agents, do not  provide detailed information for each combatant command in their budget  documents for operation and maintenance because DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation does not require the military departments to  identify individual combatant commands\u2019 authorized military positions and  civilian and contractor full-time equivalents or the mission and  headquarters-support funding required for civilian pay, contract services,  travel, and other transportation and supply costs.
