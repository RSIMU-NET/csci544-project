High school completion patterns of IDEA youth have remained stable over recent years despite concerns that states' increasing use of exit examinations would result in higher dropout rates. Students with some types of disabilities were much less likely, however, to complete high school with a standard diploma, receiving an alternative credential or dropping out instead. IDEA youth without a diploma have some options for entering employment or postsecondary education, but national data on their post-school status are over a decade old. Twenty-one states routinely track students' post-school status, but these data have some limitations. While most states used post-school data for program improvement purposes such as monitoring service delivery, some officials indicated that guidance was needed on how to best collect and use these data. A variety of transition problems, such as lack of vocational training and poor linkages between schools and service providers, have been consistently reported by students, parents, and others. While state and local educational agencies have taken actions to address some of the problems, other problems such as lack of transportation are less likely to be addressed at the state level. While state Directors of Special Education reported being generally satisfied with assistance provided to them by the Department of Education in addressing transition issues, some expressed concerns about the timeliness of the federal feedback on their state improvement plans and inconsistency in the quality of technical assistance provided by the six federal Regional Resource Centers. The vocational rehabilitation (VR) program, the Workforce Investment Act youth program (WIA), and the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency (Ticket) program all offer an array of employment and education-related services that can aid some IDEA youth. However, several factors may impede participation by the IDEA populations that are eligible for services. The lack of participation may be explained in part by the insufficient capacity of the VR and WIA programs to serve eligible populations requesting services, and potential concerns of Ticket participants about losing public assistance because of employment income. A general lack of awareness by youth and families of these programs may also limit participation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, states received nearly $9 billion for assuring that over 6 million  children and youth identified as having a disability received a free  appropriate public education, as required by the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

Research has  documented that youth with disabilities\u2014especially those with some types  of disabilities such as emotional disturbances\u2014are less likely to transition  into postsecondary education and employment once they leave high  school. In the 1997 Amendments to IDEA, Congress required greater state  and local accountability for improving graduation rates and postsecondary  results for youth with disabilities.

For example, IDEA students in Georgia can petition  for an exemption from the state\u2019s exit examination and still receive a  diploma.

Only 11 states collected information  on reasons why some students failed to successfully transition into  employment or postsecondary education.", "While studies from most of the states with routine data collection efforts,  by themselves, are of insufficient methodological quality to be cited alone,  together they show that the majority of IDEA youth were working or going  to school within a year of leaving high school, and that they were more  likely to be employed than to be enrolled in postsecondary education  programs. For example, in Wisconsin, a state with one of the more sound  approaches to data collection and analysis, 88 percent of IDEA youth who  left high school between December 1999 and 2000 participated in an  employment or educational activity 1 year later.

Eight states indicated in our survey that they have passed legislation or  regulations to include parents or advocacy groups in transition planning  while youth are in high school. In addition, at least three-fourths of the  states are funding parent centers or other family advocacy groups,  establishing task forces and workgroups, and providing technical  assistance to local school systems. Ongoing efforts also exist in over half  of the states to increase parent participation through developing culturally  diverse transition materials.", "Linkages between schools and service providers.

National data from NLTS show that more than  85 percent of IDEA youth received services that were sought after high  school, and IDEA legislation requires that a student\u2019s IEP include a  statement of interagency responsibilities or any needed linkages, if  appropriate, to ensure that IDEA youth will receive the services needed to  achieve their postsecondary education or career goals. Twenty-one state  Directors of Special Education reported in our survey that many local  school systems do not have designated intermediaries to establish such  linkages, and 18 Directors of Special Education said that their agency also  had difficulty coordinating with other state agencies outside of the school  system. Teachers from our site visits cited lack of time and knowledge  about available service providers as part of the problem.", "All states are taking some action to provide direction and resources for  improving linkages between schools and service providers.

Other actions  taken by half of the states included funding outreach and collaboration  efforts of local education agencies to create vocational education and  work opportunities.", "Transportation. Federal, state, and local officials in 3 states we visited all  said that many youth may not have access to transportation they need to  pursue employment and postsecondary education. In rural areas, public  transportation may be very limited, or may not be available during the time  needed to get to their job site or college. Availability of transportation is  not always the only issue. One parent told us that using public  transportation was not feasible because her child suffered from seizures.  While private providers may be better prepared to serve youth with  disabilities, parents and advocacy groups said that private providers were  often unreliable and their services were not coordinated with public  transportation systems. An advocacy official indicated that one reason  why these providers are unreliable is because they generally operate on a  priority system that gives medical needs a higher priority than employment  needs.", "The 3 states we visited had not addressed transition issues related to the  lack of reliable transportation in their state improvement plans. State  education officials said these types of problems are outside their area of  responsibility. In New York and California, however, some local areas are  taking initiative to address this problem. In western New York, a  collaborative endeavor involving 30 agencies provides transportation, as  well as other services, to youth with disabilities to help them in career  preparation activities.

While 39 state Directors of  Special Education found this feedback useful, some expressed  dissatisfaction over Education\u2019s timeliness in providing the feedback. For  example, of 21 state plans submitted to Education in 2002, only one-fourth  received feedback within 6 months, and at least another one-fifth did not  receive formal written feedback for a year or more.

To preclude delays on the formal written  feedback resulting from the agency\u2019s internal review process, Education  has developed standard language and written review procedures to be  used in preparing feedback. According to Education officials, having  standard language and review procedures will decrease the time necessary  to write and review the feedback report. They also hope these actions will  reduce the response time to states.", "Another way Education provides assistance to states is by funding   6 Regional Resource Centers that states can use to obtain technical  assistance for addressing transition issues. Services provided to states by  the centers include guidance, training, information dissemination,  assistance with state development of training materials, and facilitation of  meetings states convene to address problems. Directors of Special  Education in 29 states reported in our survey that assistance obtained  from the centers was very helpful, but there are some concerns that the  quality of services was sometimes inconsistent among the centers. One  center, for example, consistently received high marks from the states in  that region, while the remaining 5 centers received mixed reviews.", "State and center officials attributed the inconsistent quality of services to  variation in the expertise available at each center, an observation also  reported in a previous performance evaluation of the centers. This  evaluation recommended that Education provide training to alleviate the  disparity in staff expertise, particularly with regard to transition issues.  In  response to this issue, Education officials said that the agency offers  periodic professional development opportunities and encourages the  centers to operate as a network by sharing knowledge and expertise.

One  factor limiting services under VR and WIA is insufficient program capacity  to serve all eligible populations requesting services. Another factor  affecting participation under the Ticket program is family concerns about  whether finding employment would result in youth losing public  assistance. A factor that may affect IDEA youth participation in all  programs to various extents is a general lack of awareness by youth and  families that these federal resources are available for transition assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The VR, WIA, and Ticket Programs Provide a Variety of Education and Employment Transition Services", "paragraphs": ["The VR, WIA, and Ticket programs all offer an array of similar and  complementary education, employment, and support services for certain  population groups.", "Education services. These services can support youth who are trying to  complete their high school education as well as those youth furthering  their education in postsecondary institutions, such as community colleges.  Services for youth at all education levels can include those that prepare  them for learning by providing tutoring and study skills training as well as  providing access to educational programs through tuition support.  Education services support both out of school youth, as well as those at  risk of dropping out. We observed a tutoring program in an Alabama  school district, for example, that used WIA funds to assist high school  youth who are struggling academically.", "Employment services. These services can assist IDEA youth that are  trying to obtain a job or obtain job skills necessary to increase potential  wages. Services for youth in either situation can include those that prepare  them for employment by providing job coaching and training, as well as  direct placement with an employer. A service provider under the Ticket  program in New York, for example, said that in addition to employment  preparation services, they help find jobs for enrollees.", "Support services. These services can assist IDEA youth pursue their  education and employment goals as well as achieve goals for independent  living. These services can include mentoring and counseling, childcare,  and transportation, as well as any other services that might be needed. In  California, for example, the VR agency has cooperative agreements with  education agencies to provide support services to youth with disabilities,  including financial assistance for assistive technology, such as wheelchairs  and adapted computers, conducting vocational assessments for students,  and providing information on options for both independent and supported  living facilities.", "IDEA youth are not automatically eligible for these education,  employment, and support services, and the VR, WIA, and Ticket programs  serve populations that are both different and overlapping. Of the  approximately 2 million IDEA youth ages 14 to 21, only some of these  youth are eligible for these federally funded services.", "Under the VR program, all people with a physical or mental impairment  are potentially eligible for services, but states may only serve those with  the most significant disabilities in times of funding constraint. The former  administrator of Oregon\u2019s VR program said that in the past the state was  unable to serve some youth with psychiatric disorders due to funding  constraints.", "WIA primarily limits services to low-income youth that have some type of  barrier to employment. While disabilities under IDEA may qualify as  barriers for WIA purposes, available data suggest that only about 29  percent of IDEA youth meet WIA\u2019s low-income requirement.", "To qualify for the Ticket program, individuals must be at least 18 years old,  and qualify for disability benefits from SSA. Available data suggest that  about 13 percent of the IDEA youth population meets Ticket\u2019s age and  benefit requirements.", "Education, Labor, and SSA are not required to track the number of IDEA  youth who are enrolled and obtaining transition services provided through  the VR, WIA, and Ticket programs. However, available data for all youth  show that over 550,000 were enrolled and received services during the  time frames outlined in table 4.", "While federal agencies are not required to collect data on the type of  education, employment, and support services actually provided to IDEA  youth under the VR, WIA, and Ticket programs, Education and Labor do  collect information on services provided to all youth ages 14 to 21.  Education data on the approximately 94,000 youth who received services  and exited the VR program in fiscal year 2001 show that three-fourths of  youth obtained vocational, medical, and social counseling, and more youth  obtained employment services than services to further their education or  training. (See table 5.)", "Labor data on the approximately 80,000 youth who received services and  exited the WIA program in fiscal year 2001 show that about 40 percent of  youth obtained employment and education services, but less than one- fourth received support services. (See table 6.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Awareness and Other Factors May Impede IDEA Youth Participation in Federally Funded Transition Services", "paragraphs": ["While IDEA youth vary in their need and desire to use federal transition  services, there are several factors that may impede their access to them.  Three factors that may limit IDEA youth participation include   (1) limitations in program capacity to serve the eligible population seeking  services, (2) youth and family fears that employment income may  jeopardize access to other public assistance, and (3) a lack of awareness  about the availability of the transition resources.", "Program capacity. In regard to program capacity, the VR, WIA, and  Ticket programs face different issues in serving IDEA youth eligible for  their services. These problems include a lack of expertise to serve youth  with disabilities, a lack of resources to serve all those seeking services,  and unavailability of services in some states. For example:    Under the VR program, IDEA youth compete with all adults and youth  with disabilities for services. Education officials report that a number of  states have waiting lists for VR services. At the end of fiscal year 2001, for  example, VR agencies had more people seeking services than resources to  serve them, and about 30,000 people in 25 states were on waiting lists for  services. (See app. III.) Of this total, Education reported that about   20 percent, or about 6,000 individuals, were on a waiting list for VR  services in Washington state.", "Under WIA, IDEA youth compete with all youth facing some type of  barrier to employment, and older youth also compete with adults for  services under the WIA adult program. WIA officials told us that WIA  providers generally do not have the expertise to serve youth with  disabilities, and in some cases facilities do not have the appropriate  physical accommodations. In light of these deficiencies, WIA officials told  us that this population is often referred to VR agencies for assessment and  services.", "The Ticket program has resources to serve all eligible youth seeking  services; however, this new program has not yet been implemented in all  states. SSA plans to complete its rollout of the program to the final   17 states and the U.S. territories by 2004, which will increase access to the  program for over half of the approximately 257,000 youth receiving  assistance from SSA. (See app. IV.)", "Fear of losing public assistance. A second contributing factor may be  that some youth and families that receive public assistance are afraid that  employment income will jeopardize their access to other federal and state  public assistance benefits such as health insurance and subsidized  housing. SSA reports that less than 1 percent of eligible youth had signed  up for the Ticket program to increase self-sufficiency. In the 3 states we  visited, SSA officials, school administrators, teachers, advocacy groups,  and others involved in the transition process said that fear of losing  federal and state benefits is a common reason why individuals are hesitant  to participate in federal work incentive programs such as the Ticket  program. While some of these fears may be unfounded, others are not, and  working and receiving income can affect youth\u2019s ability to retain services  such as health insurance benefits through Medicaid. For example, while  SSA has encouraged states to offer beneficiaries the opportunity to retain  Medicaid benefits while earning wages, only about half of the states have  established such policies. (See app. V.) While some programs allow youth  to earn a certain amount of income and retain benefits, amounts allowed  under the various assistance programs can differ, and many families are  not aware of the contingencies. Although youth unable to sustain  employment can re-enroll in public assistance programs, parents we spoke  with stated that enrollment in the various programs is a lengthy and  difficult process that they do not want to repeat.", "Lack of awareness of available federal services. Finally, a third factor  that may limit IDEA youth participation in federal programs is that many  youth and families are unaware that they exist. While IDEA legislation  requires schools to provide youth with transition services and information  about available transition resources, students, parents, and teachers we  spoke with in the 3 states visited were generally uninformed about the  continuum of available federal transition services and how to access them.  Most of those we talked with were familiar with the VR program and the  types of services it provides. However, many were unfamiliar with the  Ticket program, and familiarity with the services provided through the  Workforce Investment Act assistance centers varied dramatically within  and among states. In one California suburban community, a high school  we visited had a close working relationship with the local assistance  center, and school administrators, teachers, and students were aware of  the services available there. However, teachers, parents, and students we  talked to at an urban New York school were unfamiliar with the assistance  centers that provide WIA services, even though a center was located only a  few miles away.", "Education, Labor, and SSA recognize that action is needed to reach out to  youth and families and tell them about federal resources such as the VR,  WIA, and Ticket programs. While these agencies have several efforts  underway to publicize or increase awareness of available resources, these  efforts may not include information on all federal transition resources, or  reach youth, families, and teachers involved in developing transition plans  for youth leaving high school. For example:    Education\u2019s Regional Resource Center in the Southeast developed a guide  to inform students and families about available resources, but this guide  does not include information about WIA services. The guide is available on  the Web, but there is no consistent distribution process to provide the  guide to all youth and families in all states served by the center.", "Labor partnered with SSA and other federal agencies to identify more than  200 federal programs among 12 federal agencies that serve persons with  disabilities. A Labor official said that once the report is finalized, it will be  available to the public, including IDEA youth and families; however, this  report is primarily targeted to policymakers and program officials.", "SSA has several efforts underway to increase awareness of the Ticket  program among other federal and state agencies, service providers, and  advocacy groups. While the agency is conducting local outreach using  benefits planning, assistance, and outreach centers as well as protection  and advocacy partners, these efforts do not consistently target youth and  families through high schools."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Youth served under IDEA are not a homogeneous population, and  graduation patterns and postsecondary education and employment status  can differ significantly among those with physical, sensory, emotional, or  cognitive disabilities. IDEA requires individualized education programs  that address needed transition services that recognize the unique  challenges each youth with a disability must face. These programs can  best be developed when states and schools have the necessary information  to evaluate how well existing programs are working to assist youth during  and after graduation. State education officials increasingly show interest  in collecting data on what happens to IDEA youth after they leave high  school, and nearly half of the states voluntarily collect such data. Many  states, however, are still searching for ways to develop cost-effective and  sound data collection systems and there is no central information point to  share alternative methodologies that may be most useful for identifying  which groups of IDEA youth are behind their peers and whether  programmatic changes are needed to eliminate performance gaps. In the  absence of guidance and information on how to collect and use  postsecondary data, state and local education agencies and schools will  continue to experience difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of  existing programs for students with disabilities, initiating program  improvements, and targeting resources to areas or groups that need them  most.", "Although state and local education agencies are taking steps to minimize  transition problems for youth with disabilities, challenges such as  developing linkages between schools and community youth service  providers still remain that need to be addressed both inside and outside of  the education system. While Education provides some federal resources to  help state and local education agencies address these problems, the  usefulness of the assistance may be compromised because of delays and  inconsistent quality of some services. Some transition challenges are likely  to remain unless federal assistance is strengthened and used to help states  take a more holistic approach to dealing with transition issues.", "Federal assistance provided under the VR, WIA, and Ticket programs can  help augment transition services provided by state and local education  agencies, or fund transportation or other services that are otherwise  unavailable.
