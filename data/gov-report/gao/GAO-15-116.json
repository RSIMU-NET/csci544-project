We entered each contract number into USASpending.gov to search for  specific subcontractors associated with the contract. This search was  conducted under the subaward search and was considered successful if  the system reported any subcontractors for a particular contract. When  searching in USASpending.gov for information on indefinite  delivery/indefinite quantity contracts, we searched via the specific task  orders instead of the base contract as awards are reported via the task  orders. As contracting and subcontracting information in  USASpending.gov is automatically imported from FPDS-NG and FSRS,  we verified the information found in USASpending.gov by entering some  contracts, including all of those that reported subcontract data, in FSRS  and FPDS-NG. We then entered contract numbers for the contracts that  reported subcontractors into eSRS to determine which type of  subcontracting plan each contract used. We first searched for individual  subcontract reports submitted by a prime contractor and if we were  unable to find one, we conducted a search in USASpending.gov using the  contract number to find the prime contractor\u2019s Data Universal Numbering  System (DUNS) number. As contract numbers cannot be used to search  for summary subcontracting plan information, we then took the prime  contractor\u2019s DUNS number and searched in eSRS for a summary  subcontract report and supplementary information that identified specific  contract numbers. We considered the search to be successful if it  returned either an individual subcontract report for the prime contractor  associated with the contract or if we were able to determine through the  summary subcontract report search that a particular contract was  associated with that report. We also used eSRS to determine which  contracts reported subcontracting activity by searching for individual  subcontract reports associated with particular contracts reported at the  prime or subcontractor level. We used the results to compare actual  subcontracts found in USASpending.gov with contracts that report some  level of subcontracting activity in eSRS. From the set of 37 contracts with  available subcontract data in USASpending.gov, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 12 contracts based on the military service,  contracting office, contract type, subcontracting plan type, and prime  contractor. We determined that these contracts had 278 unique  subcontractors. We downloaded the DUNS numbers from  USASpending.gov for each of these subcontractors and entered the  DUNS numbers in SAM to determine their small business status. SAM  requires registrants to update their information annually in order to remain  in an active status. To better identify that status, we searched under both  active and inactive registrants. Agency officials indicated to us that many  subcontractors do not regularly update their information and if this search  setting is not changed then the small business status of some  subcontractors cannot be found.
