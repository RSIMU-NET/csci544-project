These data address the goals to differing degrees. National data, which includes data collected in national surveys and information that all states report to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), include extensive information on TANF's two goals of providing assistance to needy families and ending dependency on government benefits but have limited information on promoting family formation. The data pertain to such issues as changes in TANF workloads, recipients' participation in work activities, employment status and earnings, and family well-being. Although there are national data on the incidence of out-of-wedlock births and marriage among TANF recipients and other low-income families, these data include only very recently available information on states' strategies to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies or promote family formation. Studies of welfare reform at the state and local levels contain the same kind of information as national data, but they also include information about areas very recently covered by national data. Much of these data come from waiver evaluations--evaluations conducted in states that experimented with their welfare program, under a waiver from HHS, prior to TANF. The usefulness of existing data for assessing TANF's progress varies. In general, the need for information about TANF's progress will have to be balanced against the challenges of rigorous data collection from the low- income population."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 4 years have passed since federal welfare reform legislation was  enacted, replacing the legal entitlement to cash assistance under the Aid to  Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program with the promotion of  work and personal responsibility. The policy and research community has  been asking what has happened to low-income families since the Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996  (PRWORA) created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)  block grant, replacing the federal entitlement to assistance and  institutionalizing reforms that had been initiated by many states. Overseen  by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the federal  level, TANF makes $16.8 billion in federal funds available to states each  year through 2002. While TANF delegates wide discretion to the states to  design and implement the program, it does specify four broad program  goals that focus on children and families:  providing assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for  in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;  ending the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by  promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;  preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies;   encouraging the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.", "As TANF has been implemented by the states, the Congress has asked  questions about a broad range of issues concerning welfare reform\u2019s  consequences. Several issues\u2014for example, the circumstances of those  who have left TANF and the characteristics of those currently receiving  cash assistance\u2014relate to what has happened to low-income families since  TANF has been in effect. The Congress also has asked about the extent to  which any changes that have occurred in low-income families\u2019 life  circumstances, such as TANF recipients\u2019 increases in employment and  earned income and decreases in births, can be attributed to TANF rather  than to other factors, such as changes in economic conditions. These  questions will be especially important when the program is considered for  reauthorization in 2001.", "To determine what data will be available from planned and existing  research to address these and other questions, you asked us to examine (1)  the type of data that will be available from national surveys and studies of  welfare reform to help assess progress towards TANF\u2019s goals and (2) the  usefulness of the data for assessing TANF\u2019s progress nationwide. Our major  objective was to examine data already collected by national surveys of low- income families and for major studies of welfare reform to identify data  available for use in a comprehensive assessment of TANF for the  reauthorization debate. We did not examine study findings; rather, we  examined the data that have been collected or will be collected as part of  the considerable body of research about TANF that is accumulating. The  focus on data also addresses issues raised by several critiques of this work  that have emerged. The critiques that examine the methodology of this  research agree that, for welfare reform research, the quality and  comprehensiveness of the existing data are cause for concern. Two  critiques in particular question whether the major national survey designed  to provide information to assess TANF at the national level\u2014the Survey of  Program Dynamics (SPD)\u2014has \u201ca sufficient number of observations\u201d for  an analysis of TANF\u2019s effects in individual states.", "To determine what data will be available, we considered all of the national  surveys and welfare reform studies discussed in six major critiques of  welfare reform research, as well as surveys and studies available through  the Research Forum and the Welfare Information Network, the major  clearinghouses for welfare reform research. We also interviewed HHS  officials about their perspective on welfare reform data and asked welfare  experts to nominate key pieces of work in the field for inclusion in our  review. We selected a sample of surveys and studies that resulted in 187  individual data sets related to TANF reauthorization issues. For each data  set, we analyzed the content of the data to determine (1) the range of  TANF-related data topics covered; (2) the level of detail the data offer; (3)  the data\u2019s quality, including, where relevant, the sampling method, sample  size, response rate, and attrition rate; and (4) how the data could be used to  provide the Congress with an understanding of what has happened under  TANF. Appendix I provides additional details about our methodology and  its limitations. We conducted our work between January 2000 and January  2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["PRWORA overhauled the nation\u2019s welfare system by abolishing the  previous welfare program, AFDC, and creating the TANF block grant.  PRWORA established four broad goals for TANF, which included (1)  providing assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in  their own homes or in the homes of relatives; (2) ending dependence of  needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work,  and marriage; (3) preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock  pregnancies; and (4) encouraging the formation and maintenance of two- parent families. Unlike the previous program, TANF gives states great  flexibility to design programs that meet these goals. However, while states  have flexibility, the programs they design must meet several federal  requirements that emphasize the importance of work and the temporary  nature of TANF. For example, PRWORA requires that parents receiving  assistance engage in work, as defined by the state, after receiving  assistance for 24 months, or earlier, at state option. In exercising their  option, 28 states require immediate participation in work, and 9 other  states require participation in work within 6 months of receiving cash  assistance, resulting in great interstate variation in program provisions.  Further, despite the programmatic flexibility authorized by TANF, states  must meet federal data reporting requirements by submitting quarterly  reports that include information from administrative records about those  receiving welfare and those terminated from assistance, as well as an  annual report, to HHS. The annual report contains information about  program characteristics, such as states\u2019 activities used to prevent out-of- wedlock pregnancy.", "In 1995, we reported that the block grants enacted as part of the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA) carried no uniform federal  information requirements. We found that the program information states  collected was designed to meet individual states\u2019 needs and that, as a  result, it was difficult to aggregate states\u2019 experiences and speak from a  national perspective on the block grant activities or their effects. Without  uniform information definitions and collection methodologies, it was  difficult for the Congress to compare state efforts or draw meaningful  conclusions about the relative effectiveness of different strategies. In a  second examination of federal block grant programs, we reported that  problems in information and reporting under many block grants\u2014the  Education Block Grant, the Community Services Block Grant, and the  Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Block Grant\u2014have  limited the Congress\u2019 ability to evaluate them. However, for the TANF  Block Grant, the regulations require that states submit the quarterly TANF  Data Report and the TANF Financial Report or be subject to statutory  penalties. For these reports, HHS provides data reporting specifications  including timing, format, and definitions for such data topics as family  composition, employment status, and earned and unearned income. These  specifications facilitate the use of HHS\u2019 TANF administrative data for  welfare reform research by improving the data\u2019s comparability from state  to state. Several national surveys and data collected for state and local  studies of welfare reform also are potential sources of data for an  assessment of TANF."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Data Sources on TANF", "paragraphs": ["A number of national surveys that collect information about welfare receipt  have been used in the past by researchers to analyze welfare reform or  have been developed to assess current welfare reform. Four surveys\u2014the  Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Current  Population Survey (CPS), the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth  (NLSY), and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)\u2014have been used  in past research on the AFDC program and the low-income population in  general. Both the SIPP and the PSID have updated their questionnaires to  include questions that pertain to welfare reform specifically, including  questions about the work participation requirements and penalties for not  complying with these and other program rules. Moreover, two national  surveys are designed specifically to answer questions about welfare  reform. The U.S. Census Bureau, at the direction of the Congress, is  conducting a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of  families, with emphasis on eligibility for and participation in welfare  programs, employment, earnings, the incidence of out-of-wedlock births,  and adult and child well-being. This survey, the Survey of Program  Dynamics, was designed to help researchers understand the impact of  welfare reform on the well-being of low-income families and children.  Similarly, the Urban Institute has been conducting a multiyear project  monitoring program changes and fiscal developments, along with changes  in the well-being of children and families. Part of this project includes a  nationally representative survey of 50,000 people called the National  Survey of America\u2019s Families (NSAF) that is collecting information on the  well-being of adults and children as welfare reform is implemented.", "With the change in the fundamental structure of the nation\u2019s welfare  program, there have been several efforts by private research organizations  to document the policies states have adopted under TANF. The Center for  Law and Social Policy and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in  collaboration, have created the State Policy Documentation Project to  document policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Available on  the Web, the State Policy Documentation Project contains information  about state policies contained in statutes, regulations, and caseworker  manuals, but it does not describe state practices. In addition, the Urban  Institute has developed and made available to the public a database that  documents changes in state program rules since 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Data From Welfare Reform Research", "paragraphs": ["Prior to and since TANF\u2019s implementation, a considerable body of research  about the low-income population has been conducted to examine the  circumstances of families affected by welfare reform, the effectiveness of  welfare reform initiatives, and the implementation of TANF at the state  level. HHS has played a major role in laying the foundation for this welfare  reform research. During the early 1990s, HHS granted waivers to states  that allowed them to test various welfare reform provisions. In return,  states were required to evaluate the effectiveness of the waiver provisions  by randomly assigning welfare recipients to either participate in the waiver  program or not. With the passage of TANF, states were given the option to  continue their waiver evaluations as originally designed or modify the  evaluation design. Several states opted to continue with their original  random assignment design, while others modified their evaluation designs  to focus on examining the implementation of the waivers or describe  participants\u2019 employment, earnings, and well-being. Because some  elements of the waivers granted to states were incorporated into many  TANF programs, the waiver evaluations provide useful insights into issues  and designs for research about TANF.", "However, according to HHS, one aspect of waiver policies may mean that  some waiver evaluations may not represent TANF requirements  completely. TANF established work requirements for all adult recipients,  but states could delay adhering to these requirements under their TANF  program, in part or whole, if the requirements were inconsistent with state  waiver policies. Under the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training  (JOBS) program, work requirements were mandatory for a work-ready or  able-bodied population, excluding a number of subgroups such as those  caring for young children and the disabled. For the most part, states that  continued the original random assignment design maintained some or all of  the JOBS exemptions from work requirements and applied these  exemptions in determining who was subject to time-limited assistance.  Consequently, while these states\u2019 waivers may incorporate other work  policies prescribed under TANF, these policies would not be expected to  affect the exempt population. In contrast, in states that do not claim JOBS  exemptions from work requirements, all adults are subject to work  requirements and time limits on assistance. Thus, while testing TANF-like  policies, evaluations that continued the random assignment design may not  fully reflect the experience, outcomes, or impacts of fully implemented  TANF requirements.", "In addition to the waiver evaluations, HHS, as well as private foundations,  has provided funding for demonstration programs across the country. The  demonstration programs are pilot projects designed to measure the effects  of a particular strategy, rather than an entire program, on welfare recipients  or those eligible to receive welfare. Many of these demonstration programs  were intended to increase employment, decrease out-of-wedlock  pregnancy, or promote marriage. For example, in the late 1980s, several  demonstration programs aimed at decreasing teen pregnancy among  welfare recipients were developed. One program, the New Chance  Demonstration, randomly assigned teen mothers receiving welfare to  participate in a program that offered education or training classes and  other support services and then compared the accomplishments of these  teen mothers with those of teen mothers who did not participate in the  program.", "Given states\u2019 greater responsibility for welfare programs under PRWORA  and the larger number of people leaving the welfare rolls, there has been  general interest among program administrators and state and local  policymakers about the condition of those who are no longer receiving  TANF, otherwise known as \u201cleavers.\u201d In response to this concern, a  growing body of research about leavers has been initiated at both the state  and federal levels. Generally, researchers have found that once low-income  families leave welfare, they become hard to keep track of. Moreover, we  previously reported that studies of former TANF recipients\u2019 status differ in  important ways, including geographic scope, the time period covered, and  the categories of families studied, which limits the comparability of the  data across states. In order to facilitate cross-state study comparisons, the  Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  within HHS has issued guidance to states and the research community on  developing comparable measures for commonly reported outcomes and  defined these outcomes. In fiscal year 1998, ASPE awarded approximately  $2.9 million in grants to 10 states and three large counties to study leavers,  followed by additional grants in fiscal years 1999 and 2000. ASPE also has  encouraged the researchers to use comparable measures.", "Research is also being conducted to examine the effects of welfare reform  in metropolitan areas or neighborhoods. This area of research is important  because the caseload decline in urban areas has been substantially lower  than in other areas of the country. Moreover, urban areas can have higher  unemployment rates and a greater concentration of poverty than suburban  or rural communities; thus, insights gathered from these studies will be  useful in understanding the potential for the success of welfare reform in  the event of an economic downturn. For example, one study\u2014the Three  City Study\u2014will survey primarily low-income, single-mother families from  poor and moderate-income areas in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio,  with half of those surveyed being TANF recipients. The survey will collect  information on adult and family well-being, employment, and welfare  receipt three times within 4 years.", "Finally, a body of welfare reform research examines the implementation of  TANF at the state and local levels. Since PRWORA has not only granted  states greater responsibility for providing cash assistance but also changed  the nature of cash assistance, it is important to learn how states and  localities are coping with these changes. Much of the research about  program implementation focuses on challenges faced by state, and in some  cases local, administrators in implementing TANF. Typically, in this  research qualitative data are collected by visiting state or local TANF  agencies; reviewing program records; and interviewing agency officials,  caseworkers, and clients. For example, the State Capacity Study conducted  by the State University of New York, Rockefeller Institute of Government,  is collecting data in 20 states about the implementation of TANF at the state  level, such as the structure of government services and information  systems used to track clients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Framework for Assessing Data Availability", "paragraphs": ["Because we expect much of the reauthorization debate to focus on TANF\u2019s  four legislative goals, the framework for our data assessment was based on  those goals. To assess whether data exist to address the goals, we first  created a list of \u201cdescriptive\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d research questions relevant to  each goal. Descriptive questions concern a low-income individual\u2019s or  family\u2019s status or behavior, such as the receipt of TANF cash assistance or  support services like transportation, housing, child care, or health services;  an adult\u2019s employment status and earnings; and a family\u2019s reliance on non- TANF government benefits, such as Food Stamps, Medicaid, or the Earned  Income Tax Credit. Effect questions concern the extent to which changes  in an individual\u2019s or family\u2019s status or behavior, such as obtaining  employment, earning income, avoiding out-of-wedlock births, or forming a  two-parent family, are the result of the TANF program.

The data categories represent combinations of topics we found  in the data, such as employment and earnings or family and child well- being, that were associated with the research questions. Figure 1 shows the  relationships among TANF\u2019s goals, the research questions, and the data  categories, several of which are associated with more than one question.

The criteria we used in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of  survey data included survey sample size, the attrition rate of respondents  from whom data were collected over time, and survey response rate.

Data collected over time could be analyzed to describe how  people cycle on and off TANF, how their use of benefits changes over time,  and how their family well-being changes. In addition, comparisons could be  made between groups covered by different welfare provisions. For  example, AFDC recipients included in the 1993-96 SIPP panel could be  compared with TANF recipients who were part of the 1996-2000 SIPP  panel. The NSAF, as well as HHS administrative records, has collected data  from different samples of individuals in different years.

As surveys that collect data over time, the  NLSY, PSID, SIPP, and SPD all have experienced sample loss, as shown in  table 2.

As  table 3 shows, the response rate for all the national surveys except the 1999  NSAF was at or above the 70-percent standard. Given the survey\u2019s  response rate, using the 1999 NSAF survey data would require determining  whether patterns in who responded and who did not respond existed and  what this means for how well respondents represent the original sample.  For those surveys that collect data on the same individuals over time,  response rates sometimes are considered in conjunction with rates of  attrition.", "The major limitation of most existing national data is that they cannot be  used for state-level analyses. In general, national data sources have state  sample sizes that are too small to allow reliable generalizations about  TANF recipients within individual states. The NLSY, PSID, SIPP, and SPD  collect data not from states per se, but from regions that, in some cases,  include more than one state. Thus, while these data can be analyzed to  provide a descriptive picture of TANF for the nation, they cannot be used  within states for descriptive analyses or to analyze the effects of states\u2019  TANF provisions. This does not mean that researchers do not use these  data sources for state-level analyses. For example, some researchers  combine several years of CPS data to obtain adequate sample sizes within  states for state-level analyses. However, Census, which administers the  CPS, SIPP, and SPD, does not recommend using data from these surveys  for state-level analyses, because doing so when sample sizes are small may  produce findings that are not reliable.", "Two national data sources, HHS administrative records and the NSAF  survey, can be used for state-level analysis, but with limitations. HHS  administrative records provide data from all 50 states and the District of  Columbia. However, the reporting requirements for these data are not  completely standardized across states, so that how a variable is defined  may vary among states. For example, each state may define the work or  work-related activities in which TANF recipients participate as they think  appropriate to the state program.", "Like HHS administrative records, NSAF survey data can be used for state- level analyses. NSAF has samples large enough to allow state-level analyses  in 13 states, representing 58 percent of the fiscal year 1999 national TANF  caseload; this is not the case in the 37 remaining states. For example, the  number of low-income children surveyed for the 1997 NSAF ranged from a  low of 760 to a high of 1,813 in each of the 13 states where NSAF collected  samples large enough to permit state-level analysis. However, the number  of low-income children surveyed in the 37 remaining states averaged 35 per  state, a number too small to allow reliable conclusions about the children  of TANF recipients in any of these states.", "Even if the issue of sample sizes within states were resolved, obstacles to  using the national data to analyze TANF\u2019s effects within states would still  exist. The lack of information about the choices states have made about  TANF policies and program rules has been identified as one of the  challenges to using national data to analyze TANF\u2019s effects. However,  research organizations have collected this information. The Center for Law  and Social Policy has worked with the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities to document policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia,  and the Urban Institute has developed a state database that documents  state program rules. Yet, even with this information, using national data to  measure state-level effects poses challenges.", "The first challenge is deciding with whom TANF recipients should be  compared. To test TANF\u2019s effects, the employment, earnings, and well- being of individuals in the program must be compared with those of  individuals who are not in the program. In the case of TANF, it would be  difficult to determine what group should provide the point of comparison.  Because waivers introduced TANF-like policies and program rules while  AFDC was still in effect, it would be difficult to select a group of welfare  recipients whose experiences with welfare were not influenced by TANF.", "The second challenge is determining the effect of any single welfare  provision given the multiple provisions that make up states\u2019 TANF  programs. For example, TANF recipients are required to work, and states  must impose penalties or sanctions when recipients do not comply with  work requirements. In such cases, it would be difficult to separate the  combined effects of work requirements and any penalties or sanctions that  were imposed into the individual effects of each.", "A third challenge is detecting the long-term effects of state programs that  have been recently implemented. Although PRWORA was enacted in 1996,  states implemented their TANF programs at different points in time. Some  states were still refining their TANF programs at the beginning of 1998.  Consequently, the long-term effects of TANF may not yet be realized.", "Finally, state-level analyses may not be the best way to measure TANF\u2019s  effects in every state. Some states have further devolved TANF to localities,  and different localities may implement a state\u2019s TANF provisions  differently. In total, 17 states have given local governments responsibility  for TANF program design and implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Waiver and Demonstration Data Allow Assessment of TANF Effects, but Only for Localities", "paragraphs": ["The strength of the waiver and demonstration data is that they can be used  to analyze TANF\u2019s effects, but with few exceptions these data were  collected from city and county samples rather than statewide samples.

Experiments, when done correctly, are recognized as the most  rigorous way of determining the extent to which an observed outcome can  be attributed to the program itself, rather than to differences among the  program participants. Over half of the waiver data sets and virtually all of  the demonstration data sets we reviewed consisted of data from  experiments. Of the waiver data sets, about half were collected from city  and county samples, with the others being collected from statewide  samples.

Given limited resources, researchers may  choose to conduct rigorous evaluations in selected cities or counties rather  than sacrifice rigor to evaluate a program statewide. Data sources we  reviewed for both the Vermont and Iowa waiver evaluations mentioned  budget constraints as a factor that led researchers to limit their data  collection efforts.", "Another limitation of the waiver and demonstration data is that most often  they were collected prior to the implementation of TANF.

When a state has both administrative data and  survey data available, the administrative data could be used in place of  survey data that are not representative. As figure 6 shows, Arkansas,  Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina have either survey  data that meet the standard for response rates or data from survey  respondents who were not significantly different from nonrespondents.  Arizona, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri,  Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin have both administrative data and  survey data. The response rate for the District of Columbia, Illinois, Kansas,  Virginia, and Wisconsin was below 70 percent, but for Virginia, a  comparison of respondents with nonrespondents revealed no significant  differences between the two groups.

Contrasting outcomes for these two groups would require deciding which  AFDC leavers provide the best point of comparison. Many factors specific  to the year in which recipients left the welfare rolls would influence their  employment prospects, wages, and well-being.

Given the costs, some limitations  may be difficult to overcome. Our examination of the data raised three  issues.", "First, for a comprehensive assessment of TANF, it is important to have data  for a representative sample of TANF recipients and nonrecipients that  allow for analyses of effect at the state level. The federal government has  made an investment in national surveys, which either in whole or in part  are intended to gather information about the lives of TANF recipients. One  of these, the SPD, was funded as a means to gather data about TANF  recipients. For another, the SIPP, the Census Bureau added a special  section of questions about welfare and reworded questions so that they  would better capture respondents\u2019 participation in state programs.  However, even with these efforts, none of Census\u2019 surveys currently being  administered can be used for state-level analyses of TANF\u2019s effects because  of small sample sizes within individual states. In addition, the SPD has a  high attrition rate. The Census Bureau plans to take steps to improve  response to the SPD through intensive follow-up with survey dropouts to  enlist their participation and through monetary incentives for future  respondents to participate in the survey. However, the issue of small  sample sizes at the state level will remain unresolved.", "Second, HHS has encouraged state agencies to study the effects of their  TANF programs through the AFDC waiver requirement for experimental  studies and subsequent research initiatives. Moreover, our examination of  data indicates that, because of the variability in TANF program provisions  across states, analysis of TANF\u2019s effects at the state and local levels can be  done with the greatest confidence. However, even when conducted at the  state and local levels, studies designed to examine TANF\u2019s effects tend to  be costly, time-consuming, and impractical to implement in every state. In  some cases, conducting an evaluation for an entire state is determined to  be so expensive that data collection is limited to a portion of the state. For  example, the evaluation of Vermont\u2019s waiver program focused on 6 of 12  welfare service districts. The evaluation\u2019s 42-month follow-up survey was  administered to only these 6 district offices and, owing to cost constraints,  included a subset of the sample for whom administrative records, rather  than survey responses, were collected. Policymakers, federal and state  officials, and the welfare reform research community will need to seek  ways to balance the need for information about TANF\u2019s effects with the  resource demands of rigorous studies.", "Third, both qualitative and quantitative data may be needed to understand  what has happened to former TANF recipients. Leavers are a difficult  population to track, and, in some cases, using multiple methods of  quantitative data collection has not necessarily increased the number of  former recipients who could be located or who responded to surveys. In  fact, in some of the studies we reviewed, the low rate of success in  gathering data from these individuals makes the data\u2019s usefulness  questionable. Surveys that used only one mode of data collection, such as  telephoning former TANF recipients, generally had the lowest response  rates. Some leavers\u2019 studies followed telephone surveys with personal  interviews of those who could not be reached by phone or who did not  respond. However, even the use of multiple modes of data collection did  not always ensure high response rates. Given the difficulties inherent in  collecting quantitative data from this group, other data collection strategies  that use local communication networks to identify families as well as  interviews of respondents in their homes may be needed to gain  information about the lives of TANF leavers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS said that the report will be of  help to the Congress and other interested parties.

The first step in this  process was to express each of TANF\u2019s goals as a research question. In  looking at the goals themselves, it is evident that some express expected  results\u2014for example, that work and marriage will improve the well-being  of low-income families. Assessing TANF\u2019s progress toward these expected  results required, in part, questions about TANF\u2019s effects. However, some of  TANF\u2019s goals focus on its general purpose\u2014for example, providing  assistance to needy families. In this case, assessing TANF\u2019s progress  required research questions that are descriptive, that is, questions that ask  what public assistance looks like under TANF. To translate TANF\u2019s goals  into research questions, we considered the nature of each of TANF\u2019s goals  and formulated questions to represent key issues the Congress will  consider at reauthorization. As shown in figure 1, we created  corresponding questions that asked for descriptions of what has happened  under TANF, the effects of TANF, or both.", "We then specified the information, or data topics, necessary to address our  research questions. We developed a data collection instrument that listed  the data topics associated with each question and used the instrument to  record the data topics found in each data set examined. It is important to  note that what we identified as data topics were not equivalent to specific  measures. In other words, our coding captured the fact that a certain data  source collected measures on employment. It did not capture the specific  manner in which employment was measured. In addition to data topics, we  collected such pertinent information as the unit of analysis, population,  sampling method, sample size, dates covered by data collection, and design  of the study for which data were gathered. We recorded response rates and  attrition rates when they were relevant given the method of data collection.  We also looked to see if data had been or were being collected for a  comparison or control group.", "To summarize our findings, we identified data categories related to TANF\u2019s  goals, some of which represented the research questions and others of  which were more narrowly focused. The narrowly focused data categories  represented combinations of data topics, such as employment and earnings  or family and child well-being, that were associated with the research  questions. We took this approach for a variety of reasons. First, in making a  judgment that data were available to address particular questions, we  required that certain data topics be present in combination and, for effect  questions, that the data were collected using control groups or comparison  groups. However, a data source could provide relevant data topics, even  though the data topic could not be used to address the particular question  we had posed. Rather than discount the value of these data topics, we  decided to note their availability. Second, in many cases, the same data  topics and data categories were being used to address different questions.  For example, as figure 1 shows, the data categories associated with  employment were related to 5 of our 11 questions. Presenting our findings  in terms of data categories allowed us to report on all of the data topics,  including those that were not available in the combinations needed to  address a research question.", "Finally, to assess how the data might be used for an assessment of TANF,  we considered three attributes of the data. We considered the geographic  scope of the sample; the data topics included in the data set; and whether  or not the data could be used for descriptive analyses or analyses of effect,  given the design of the study. In determining the geographic scope of the  sample, we looked at the sampling method and sample size, as well as at  response rates and attrition rates, since both affect how well a sample  represents a population. We relied on the design of the study, the data  topics included in a data set, and how researchers had used the data to  make a judgment about whether the data could be used for descriptive  analyses or analyses of effect. We coded data as being useable for analyses  of effect when they came from a study that made comparisons between  groups, one of which served as the treatment group and the other as the  absence of the treatment, or the comparison group.

Second,  framing the data needs for an assessment of TANF\u2019s progress around  TANF\u2019s objectives, which focus on the behavior and well-being of low- income children and families, excluded from consideration the bodies of  welfare reform research concerned with institutions, including studies of  TANF\u2019s implementation at the state and local levels and descriptions of  TANF program policies and practices.
