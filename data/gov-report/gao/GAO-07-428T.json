In response, Congress created the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) as a separately organized agency within DOE under Title 32 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000--the NNSA Act. Since its creation, NNSA has continued to experience security problems, such as unauthorized access to NNSA computer systems, and cost and schedule overruns on major projects, such as the National Ignition Facility. GAO was asked to review the extent to which NNSA has taken steps to (1) improve security at its laboratories and plants and (2) improve its management practices and revise its organizational structure. In January 2007, GAO issued a report--National Nuclear Security Administration: Additional Actions Needed to Improve Management of the Nation's Nuclear Programs, (GAO-07-36)--that addressed these matters. To carry out its work, GAO reviewed legislation; NNSA policies, plans and budgets; collected and analyzed security performance ratings and interviewed current and former DOE and NNSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While NNSA has better delineated lines of authority and improved communication through a reorganization and has made progress in establishing critical management systems, especially in the development of its Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Evaluation process, important weaknesses remain with respect to security; the Administration's relationship with DOE; and project, program and financial management. Although NNSA has begun to build an effective headquarters security organization, it still cannot demonstrate that all of its security program objectives are being met at all of its sites. Specifically, GAO identified weaknesses in physical security at several NNSA sites, including the Nevada Test Site, the Sandia National Laboratories, and the Y-12 National Security Complex; and weaknesses in cyber security throughout NNSA. Four factors have contributed to these problems: (1) lack of consistent NNSA headquarters leadership and direction for security; (2) security personnel staffing shortages at NNSA site offices; (3) lack of adequate training resources and opportunities for site office security staff; and (4) incomplete security data to gauge the effectiveness of NNSA's security program. While NNSA has focused considerable attention on reorganizing its internal operations, it and DOE have continued to struggle with agreeing on how NNSA should operate as a separately organized agency within the department. This lack of agreement has resulted in organizational conflicts that have inhibited effective operations. While there have been continuing calls for removing NNSA from DOE and establishing it as a separate agency, GAO does not believe that such drastic change is necessary to provide effective oversight of the nuclear weapons complex. Rather, DOE and NNSA need to clearly define their working relationships and determine how conflicts will be resolved. Finally, GAO identified several other management weaknesses where additional NNSA actions could strengthen its ability to manage the nuclear weapons complex. For example, among other things, NNSA has not (1) implemented a plan for improving its project management efforts; (2) identified all of its program managers and trained them to a certified level of competency; and (3) established an independent analysis unit to review program budget proposals and analyze budget alternatives. In its recent report, GAO made recommendations to the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of NNSA to (1) improve NNSA's security oversight program; (2) clearly define NNSA's status as a separately organized agency within DOE; and (3) improve project and program management, and the Administration's planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation process. NNSA generally agreed with the report and its recommendations. NNSA considered the agency a success but acknowledged there was considerable work yet to be accomplished."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the actions the  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\u2014a separately organized  agency within the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014has taken to improve the  security and management of the nation\u2019s nuclear programs. Specifically,  my remarks are based on the report we are issuing today\u2014National  Nuclear Security Administration: Additional Actions Needed to Improve  Management of the Nation\u2019s Nuclear Programs, which was prepared at  the request of this Subcommittee.", "During the late 1990s, DOE experienced management difficulties with its  nuclear weapons programs that contributed to security problems at the  nation\u2019s nuclear weapons laboratories and significant cost overruns on  major projects. According to a June 1999 report by the President\u2019s Foreign  Intelligence Advisory Board (the Board), DOE\u2019s management of the  nuclear weapons laboratories, while representing \u201cscience at its best,\u201d also  embodied \u201csecurity at its worst\u201d because of \u201corganizational disarray,  managerial neglect, and \u2026a culture of arrogance.\u201d The Board urged the  Congress to create a new organization that, whether established as an  independent agency or a semi-autonomous entity within DOE, would have  a clear mission, streamlined bureaucracy, and drastically simplified lines  of authority and accountability. Responding to the Board\u2019s  recommendations, the Congress created the National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA) under Title 32 of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000\u2014the NNSA Act.", "The NNSA Act established NNSA as a \u201cseparately organized agency\u201d  within DOE and made NNSA responsible for the management and security  of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and naval  reactor programs. The NNSA Act established the position of DOE Under  Secretary for Nuclear Security, who was also designated as the  Administrator of NNSA. The Secretary of Energy and the Deputy Secretary  of Energy were allowed to establish policy for NNSA and to give direction  to NNSA through the Administrator; however, other DOE employees were  prohibited from directing the activities of individual NNSA employees.  Finally, the NNSA Act required that, among other things, NNSA develop a  planning, programming, and budgeting process in order to ensure that the  administration operated under sound financial management principles.", "Since its inception, however, NNSA has continued to experience both  security and management problems. For example, with respect to security,  in 2003 we found that NNSA had not fully defined the roles and  responsibilities of officials in its security program and that NNSA had  shortfalls in security staff at the site offices that oversee its contractors. In  addition, two NNSA studies commissioned in July 2003 found ongoing  problems with NNSA\u2019s security program, including weaknesses in its  security culture, organization, and staffing and training. Finally, DOE\u2019s  Office of Inspector General found security problems with NNSA\u2019s  contractors, including improprieties in the testing of the officers who  protect NNSA\u2019s sites and weaknesses in NNSA\u2019s cyber security program.  With respect to the management of major projects, the National Ignition  Facility and the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility\u2014two  major facilities needed to support NNSA\u2019s nuclear weapons programs\u2014 experienced major delays and cost overruns because of problems with  project management and are still not complete.", "In this context, you asked us to evaluate the extent to which NNSA has  taken steps to (1) improve security at its laboratories and plants and (2)  improve its management practices and revise its organizational structure.  To carry out our objectives, we reviewed the NNSA Act; and NNSA and  DOE policies, plans and budgets; and interviewed current and former  NNSA and DOE officials. We also used reports on NNSA\u2019s security efforts  prepared by GAO, the DOE Inspector General, and outside groups, such as  a 2005 report on security commissioned by NNSA. Finally, we collected  and analyzed security performance ratings developed by DOE\u2019s Office of  Health, Safety and Security and NNSA site offices, from fiscal years 1996  through 2005. We used these performance ratings because there was wide  agreement among NNSA and DOE security officials that these ratings  represented the best available information on the overall performance of  NNSA\u2019s safeguards and security program. We conducted the work for our  report from March 2005 through January 2007 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards, which included an  assessment of data reliability and internal controls.", "Producing a well-organized and effective agency out of what was widely  considered a dysfunctional enterprise has been a considerable challenge.  In some areas, NNSA can be viewed as a success. Most notably, through its  internal reorganization efforts, NNSA has addressed some past problems  by better delineating lines of authority and improving communication and  has made important progress in establishing critical management systems,  especially in the development of its Planning, Programming, Budgeting  and Evaluation (PPBE) process. However, important problems remain  with respect to security, the Administration\u2019s relationship with DOE, and  project, program and financial management.", "Regarding security, NNSA still cannot demonstrate that all of its security  program objectives are being met at all of its sites. Specifically, we found  weaknesses with physical security at several NNSA sites, including the  Nevada Test Site, Sandia National Laboratories, and the Y-12 National  Security Complex, and weaknesses throughout NNSA in the cyber security  area. Four factors have contributed to problems with NNSA\u2019s security  program. Specifically, we found    a lack of consistent NNSA headquarters leadership and direction for    security personnel staffing shortages at the NNSA site offices that oversee  NNSA\u2019s contractors; inadequate training resources and opportunities for site office security  staff; and incomplete security data to gauge the effectiveness of NNSA\u2019s security  program.", "With respect to NNSA\u2019s relationship to DOE, we found that almost 7 years  after its creation, NNSA and DOE still have not fully agreed on how NNSA  should function within the department as a separately organized agency.  This lack of agreement has resulted in organizational conflicts that have  inhibited effective operations. In our view, DOE and NNSA need to take a  more active approach to clearly defining DOE and NNSA\u2019s working  relationships and determining how conflicts will be resolved. While there  have been continuing calls for removing NNSA from DOE and establishing  it as a separate agency, we do not believe that such drastic change is  necessary to produce an organization that can provide effective oversight  of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex.", "Finally, while NNSA has taken several actions to improve its management  practices, including developing a PPBE process, we also identified several  areas where management weaknesses remain. Specifically, NNSA has not  developed a project management policy, implemented a plan for  improving its project management efforts, and fully shared project  management lessons learned between its sites. In addition, NNSA has not  identified all of its program managers and trained them to a certified level  of competency. Finally, NNSA has not established an independent analysis  unit to (1) review program budget proposals, (2) confirm cost estimates,  and (3) analyze budget alternatives.", "In order to improve the management of NNSA and its ability to oversee the  nuclear weapons complex , in our report to you, we made a series of  recommendations to the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator, NNSA  to (1) improve NNSA\u2019s security oversight program; (2) clearly define  NNSA\u2019s status as a separately organized agency within DOE; and (3)  improve project and program management, and the agency\u2019s planning,  programming, budgeting, and evaluation process. In its comments on our  report, NNSA generally agreed with the report and its corresponding  recommendations. NNSA noted that it considers the agency to be a  success but acknowledged that there was considerable work yet to be  accomplished."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NNSA operates three national laboratories that design nuclear weapons\u2014 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California; Los Alamos National  Laboratory, New Mexico; and the Sandia National Laboratories, New  Mexico and California; and four nuclear weapons production sites\u2014the  Pantex Plant, Texas; the Y-12 National Security Complex, Tennessee; the  Kansas City Plant, Missouri; and parts of the Savannah River Site, South  Carolina; as well as the Nevada Test Site.", "To implement its programs, NNSA received about $9.1 billion for fiscal  year 2006, including almost $6.4 billion for its nuclear weapons activities,  about $1.6 billion for its defense nuclear nonproliferation programs, and  about $782 million for the Naval Reactors program. NNSA\u2019s appropriation  also included about $766 million to provide security at its sites. NNSA  requested over $9.3 billion for fiscal year 2007, including $6.4 billion for its  nuclear weapons activities, $1.7 billion for its defense nuclear  nonproliferation programs, and $795 million for the Naval Reactors  program. According to NNSA\u2019s Future Years Nuclear Security Program  plan, between fiscal years 2007 and 2011, NNSA is proposing to spend  almost $48.5 billion on its nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and  naval reactors programs.", "As noted earlier, for several years before NNSA was established, external  studies found problems with the organization and operation of what is  now NNSA\u2019s principal organization\u2014DOE\u2019s Office of Defense Programs.  These studies cited continuing problems in the areas of overall  management, organization, priority setting, and maintenance of a viable  infrastructure and workforce. Most influential in the creation of NNSA was  the study conducted by a Special Investigative Panel of the President\u2019s  Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Prepared in response to a series of  security problems, including public access to classified documents at the  Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Board found that DOE was a  dysfunctional bureaucracy incapable of reforming itself and that  reorganization was clearly warranted to resolve security and  counterintelligence problems. As noted earlier, the Board urged the  Congress to create a new organization that, whether established as an  independent agency or a semi-autonomous entity within DOE, should have  a clear mission, streamlined bureaucracy, and drastically simplified lines  of authority and accountability. To correct the problems identified by the  Board and others, in 1999, the Congress created the NNSA.", "For the last several years, we have monitored NNSA\u2019s actions to  implement the NNSA Act for this Subcommittee and the Special Oversight  Panel on Department of Energy Reorganization, House Armed Services  Committee. For example, in April 2001, we testified that NNSA\u2019s efforts to  establish a new organization looked promising. However, we highlighted  the need for NNSA to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of  headquarters and field staff and to establish clear lines of authority  between NNSA and its contractors, among other things. In May 2001,  NNSA announced plans to reorganize its headquarters operations. In  December 2001, however, we found that NNSA\u2019s plans for the  headquarters reorganization did not contain a clear definition of the roles  and responsibilities of the headquarters organizational units.", "In addition to reorganizing its headquarters, in February 2002, NNSA  proposed reorganizing its entire operation to solve important, long- standing issues. In February 2002, we testified that, with the proposed new  organizational structure, resolution of NNSA\u2019s long-standing  organizational issues appeared to be within its grasp. However, we noted  that NNSA\u2019s lack of a long-term strategic approach to ensuring a well- managed workforce precluded it from identifying its current and future  human capital needs, including the size of the workforce; its deployment  across the organization; and the knowledge, skills, and capabilities needed  to fulfill its mission. In December 2002, the Administrator of NNSA  implemented the proposed reorganization.", "Our May 2003 report on the management of NNSA\u2019s security program  identified similar concerns about NNSA\u2019s security organization and  management. Specifically, we found that NNSA (1) had not fully defined  clear roles and responsibilities for its headquarters and site security  operations and (2) had shortfalls at its site offices in the total number of  staff and in expertise, which could make it more difficult for the site  offices to effectively oversee security activities. We therefore concluded  that NNSA could not be assured that its contractors were working to  maximum advantage to protect critical facilities and material from  individuals seeking to inflict damage.", "Finally, in June 2004, we found that NNSA\u2019s reorganization had addressed  some past problems by better delineating lines of authority and improving  communication. However, we also found that NNSA\u2019s reorganization had  not ensured that the agency had sufficient staff with the right skills in the  right places because it had downsized its federal workforce by about 17  percent without first determining the critical skills and capabilities needed  to meet its mission and program goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Action Needed to Improve NNSA\u2019s Security Program", "paragraphs": ["Although NNSA has begun to build an effective headquarters security  organization, it still cannot demonstrate that all of its security program  objectives are being met at all of its sites. Specifically, we found that the  results of internal and independent security oversight assessments have  identified weaknesses in physical security at several NNSA sites, including  the Nevada Test Site, the Sandia National Laboratories, and the Y-12  National Security Complex; and weaknesses in cyber security throughout  NNSA. The following factors have contributed to this situation:    Lack of consistent leadership and direction for its security activities.", "For several years, the NNSA headquarters security organization  experienced turnover in the position of Chief of the Office of Defense  Nuclear Security. Specifically, four individuals have occupied the position  since NNSA\u2019s creation, often in an acting capacity. In addition, these chiefs  have reported to different levels within the organization. The current Chief  is a permanent appointee, reporting directly to the NNSA administrator,  and he has taken a number of steps to develop an effective headquarters  security organization.", "Security personnel staffing shortages at site offices. Having sufficient  staff to oversee the security programs of its contractors continues to be a  problem. For example, since NNSA became operational, key site offices,  such as the Los Alamos Site Office, have experienced staffing shortfalls.", "As a result, sites are limited in their ability to effectively oversee  contractors\u2019 security activities.", "Lack of adequate training resources and opportunities for site office  security staff. NNSA has not implemented a training program that  provides NNSA federal security officials with the skills needed to  effectively oversee contractor security programs. In addition, NNSA site  offices often do not have all the resources needed to meet training needs.  For example, according to site office officials, the Los Alamos Site Office  did not receive training funds for fiscal year 2006 and the Nevada Site  Office received a minimal training budget for its security staff.", "Lack of data to gauge program effectiveness. NNSA does not have  complete data for tracking security deficiencies identified by security  oversight reviews and, as a result, does not have information regarding the  overall effectiveness of its safeguards and security program. NNSA  officials told us that while they believe security across the weapons  complex has improved, NNSA does not have sufficient data to support this  assertion. In addition, NNSA has not implemented a formal process for  sharing best practices or lessons learned to guide security improvements.  While best practices and lessons learned have been communicated  informally, a formal process could help ensure that previously identified  security deficiencies, such as the retrieval of badges from terminated  employees at one NNSA site, are reviewed and corrected as necessary at  other NNSA field locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE and NNSA Have Not Yet Fully Determined How NNSA Should Operate as a Separately Organized Agency within DOE", "paragraphs": ["While NNSA has focused considerable attention on reorganizing its  internal operations, it and DOE have continued to struggle with  establishing how NNSA should operate as a separately organized agency  within the department. Several factors have contributed to this situation.  First, DOE and NNSA did not have a useful model to follow for  establishing a separately organized agency in DOE. The Board\u2019s June 1999  report suggested several federal agencies, such as the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce, which  could be used as a model for NNSA. However, we found that none of the  officials from these agencies considered their agency to be separately  organized or believed that their agency\u2019s operational methods were  transferable to NNSA. Second, DOE\u2019s January 2000 implementation plan,  which was required by the NNSA Act, did not define how NNSA would  operate as a separately organized agency within DOE. Instead reflecting  the opposition of the then DOE senior leadership to the creation of NNSA,  the implementation plan \u201cdual-hatted\u201d virtually every significant statutory  position in NNSA with DOE officials, including the Director of NNSA\u2019s  Office of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence and General Counsel. As we  testified in April 2001, this practice caused considerable concern about  NNSA\u2019s ability to function with the independence envisioned in the NNSA  Act. Dual-hatting was subsequently forbidden by an amendment to the  NNSA Act.", "As a result, although some NNSA programs have set up procedures for  interacting with DOE, other programs have not, resulting in organizational  conflict. For example, DOE made a commitment to issuing NNSA-specific  acquisition procedures in its January 2000 implementation plan for NNSA,  but it has not done so. According to DOE Office of General Counsel  officials, the department subsequently determined that NNSA-specific  procedures were inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the  NNSA Act, and the January 2000 implementation plan. According to both  DOE and NNSA officials, since 2004 the department has blocked NNSA\u2019s  efforts to issue its own acquisition regulations. As a result, according to  NNSA officials, NNSA has had to issue a series of deviations to the DOE  acquisition regulations to carry out NNSA acquisition policies in areas  such as negotiating a more effective contract fee arrangement and  awarding additional years to a contract\u2019s term.", "Even where formal procedures have been developed, interpersonal  disagreements have hindered effective cooperation. Most notable in this  regard has been the longstanding conflict between NNSA and DOE  counterintelligence offices. Specifically, as our report documents, NNSA  and DOE counterintelligence officials have disagreed over (1) the scope  and direction of the counterintelligence program, (2) their ability to jointly  direct staff in the headquarters counterintelligence program offices, (3) the  allocation of counterintelligence resources, (4) counterintelligence  policymaking and (5) their roles and responsibilities in handling specific  counterintelligence matters\u2014in particular with regard to the department\u2019s  handling of the well-publicized mid-2005 intrusion into an unclassified  NNSA computer system and removal of the names and social security  numbers of 1,502 individuals working for NNSA. Subsequently, the  Congress amended the NNSA Act to consolidate the counterintelligence  programs of DOE and NNSA under the Department of Energy.", "In this environment, concerns about NNSA\u2019s organizational status have  persisted. Most notably, a January 2006 report by the Defense Science  Board called for the removal of NNSA from DOE and the creation of a  new, independent National Nuclear Weapons Agency. However, former  senior DOE and NNSA officials with whom we spoke generally did not  favor removing NNSA from DOE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Management Issues Need to be Resolved for NNSA to Become Fully Effective", "paragraphs": ["In addition to identifying the underlying issue of NNSA\u2019s relationship to  DOE, we identified the following four other management areas where  additional NNSA actions could strengthen its ability to manage the nuclear  weapons complex if it took further action.", "Human capital. NNSA has made progress in developing a human capital  strategy. However, DOE and NNSA have not conducted a systematic,  detailed analysis of how many staff NNSA needs in relation to DOE. As a  result, we identified areas where potential staff imbalances have affected  NNSA\u2019s ability to operate separately from DOE. For example, NNSA\u2019s  Office of General Counsel has 35 attorneys, including the General Counsel,  to provide NNSA legal analysis, while the rest of DOE has 277 attorneys.  According to NNSA\u2019s General Counsel, his office would need 15 to 20  additional attorneys to fully handle NNSA\u2019s legal workload with minimal  assistance from DOE. Currently, NNSA relies on DOE\u2019s Office of General  Counsel to perform a significant portion of its legal work.", "Project management. While both DOE and NNSA have initiated efforts to  improve project management, NNSA reported in November 2006 that  about 16 percent of NNSA projects were at risk of breaching their cost  baseline, schedule baseline or both. We identified seven areas for  improvement that would foster a stronger culture for effective project  management. For example, DOE\u2019s Project Assessment and Reporting  System\u2014a Web-based system for keeping DOE senior managers apprised  of the performance of projects costing more than $5 million\u2014does not  include four major NNSA projects, estimated to cost over $100 million  each. Consequently, these projects do not receive the senior management  oversight that can be provided through that system.", "Program management. NNSA program managers are responsible for  completing a set of activities by employing a working knowledge of such  diverse areas as contracting, budgeting, and engineering. Recognizing the  important role of program managers, NNSA has taken several actions,  such as developing a program management policy. However, NNSA has yet  to identify all of its program managers or train them to a certified level of  competency. Indeed, DOE\u2019s most recent performance and accountability  report for fiscal year 2006 showed that NNSA fully met only about 52  percent of its program goals while the rest of DOE achieved about a 79- percent success rate.", "Financial management. NNSA has made significant progress in  implementing its PPBE process over the last 4 years, as mandated by the  NNSA Act. However, several areas of improvement still have not been fully  addressed. For example, NNSA has issued policy letters on PPBE, but  some of these letters are still in draft form because, in part, NNSA is  waiting to obtain DOE\u2019s views on certain matters. In addition, NNSA\u2019s  PPBE mechanism for centralized resource allocation relies on collegial  decision making among senior NNSA managers, with the Administrator  resolving disputes and deciding on the final resource allocation. However,  the Administrator does not have an independent group to review program  proposals, confirm cost estimates, and analyze alternatives. According to a  2003 DOE Inspector General report, most senior managers believe that  such an analytical group would be of value. While NNSA has taken some  action in this direction, it is not clear when such a group will be  established.", "As discussed earlier, while there have been continuing calls for removing  NNSA from DOE and establishing it a separate agency, we do not believe  that such drastic change is necessary to produce an organization that can  provide effective oversight of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex.  Rather, we believe NNSA can provide comprehensive oversight of the  operation and security of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons programs by  addressing a variety of lingering, often unrelated, but important  management issues. These issues include providing sufficient, qualified  staff to conduct program and operational oversight, especially in the  security area, and developing and implementing improvements needed to  support effective project, program, and financial management.", "Madam Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
