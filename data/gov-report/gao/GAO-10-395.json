Federal entities with responsibilities for addressing Central American gangs include the National Security Council (NSC); the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and State; and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). GAO was asked to review federal efforts to combat transnational gangs. This report addresses (1) the extent to which the federal government has developed a strategy to combat these gangs, and (2) how federal agencies have implemented the strategy and other programs to combat these gangs, coordinated their actions, and assessed their results. GAO examined federal agencies' antigang plans, resources, and measures; interviewed federal, state, and local officials in seven localities representing varying population sizes and geographic regions; and interviewed U.S. and foreign officials in El Salvador and Guatemala where U.S. agencies have implemented antigang programs. The results of these interviews are not generalizable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The NSC, in conjunction with State, DOJ, DHS, and USAID, developed a strategy to combat gangs with connections to Central America; however, the strategy lacks an approach or framework to oversee implementation and performance goals and measures to assess progress. GAO previously reported that characteristics such as defining the problem to be addressed as well as the scope and methodology of the strategy; describing agencies' activities, roles, and responsibilities; providing an approach to oversee implementation; and establishing performance measures, among other characteristics, can enhance a strategy's effectiveness. While the antigang strategy contains some of these characteristics, such as identifying the problems and risks associated with the gangs, describing the scope and purpose of the strategy, and defining roles and responsibilities of federal agencies as well as specific implementation activities, it lacks other characteristics such as an approach for overseeing implementation and goals and measures for assessing progress. For example, although agencies coordinate the strategy's implementation through an interagency task force, agency officials reported that this task force does not oversee the strategy's implementation and that no entity exercises oversight responsibility for the strategy's implementation. Similarly, while State and USAID are developing measures to assess the outcomes of their antigang programs, these measures do not encompass all programs under the strategy or track results of the strategy as a whole. Incorporating these characteristics could enhance the accountability of agencies to implement the strategy and provide a means for assessing progress. To carry out the strategy and combat transnational gangs, federal agencies have implemented programs and taken steps to coordinate their actions and develop performance measures to assess results of individual programs; but, coordination could be strengthened in an antigang unit in El Salvador by reaching agreement on Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) role in the unit, the only such unit currently in Central America. Agencies use various interagency groups to coordinate with each other, such as DOJ's Anti-gang Coordination Committee. However, improved coordination at the FBI-initiated antigang unit in El Salvador could enhance information sharing. While the FBI requests information directly from Salvadoran police, ICE requests go to its country attache, then to FBI agents at the unit who pass it on to Salvadoran police, as ICE does not have an agent at the unit. Prior GAO work has shown that agencies should facilitate information sharing and look for opportunities to leverage resources. Although FBI and ICE officials agree that the process could be improved by posting an ICE agent at the unit and have been discussing the possibility since 2008, they have not yet reached agreement on ICE's role. By reaching agreement, the FBI and ICE could strengthen coordination and information sharing. While agencies have established measures to assess programs, as some of the programs are just starting, data collection for many measures is in the early stages."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the 2009 National Gang Threat Assessment by the National  Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) and National Drug Intelligence Center  (NDIC), as of September 2008, there were approximately 1 million gang  members in the United States\u2014a 25 percent increase over 2005  membership levels. The assessment found that street gangs that operate  throughout most of the United States are a significant threat that has  become magnified as national- and regional-level street gangs migrate  from urban areas to suburban and rural communities. According to the  assessment, gang members engage in a host of criminal activities such as  homicide, extortion, drug distribution, and other crimes. Gangs such as  the Latin Kings, the Jamaican Posse, Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), and 18th  Street, as well as outlaw motorcycle gangs like the Hells Angels, have been  identified by federal law enforcement officials as transnational gangs\u2014 gangs whose members are present in and criminally active in more than  one country. Of these, gangs with ties to Central America such as MS-13  and 18th Street have been specifically identified as posing serious threats  to the public safety of communities in the United States and in Central  American countries due to their extremely violent nature, the breadth of  their criminal activities, and their rapid expansion. Our report focuses  primarily on U.S. federal agencies\u2019 efforts to combat these gangs with ties  to Central America.", "A wide variety of federal departments and agencies have responsibilities  for addressing the issue of gangs with ties to Central America, including  the Departments of Justice (DOJ), Homeland Security (DHS), State  (State), and Defense (DOD), and the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID). Under the auspices of the National Security  Council\u2019s (NSC) International Organized Crime Policy Coordinating  Committee (IOCPCC), these departments and agencies have  collaboratively developed an interagency strategy to combat the threat of  criminal gangs with connections to Central America and Mexico. In  addition, these departments and agencies work together and with Central  American countries and nongovernmental organizations to, among other  things, exchange information for use in investigating gang crime, remove  gang members who are illegally residing in the United States, and support  programs to help prevent young people from becoming gang members or  to intervene to provide at-risk youth with alternatives to being part of a  gang. In July 2009 we reported on federal efforts to combat gang crime  within the United States and coordination mechanisms among federal,  state, and local agencies for domestic-based antigang efforts. We discuss  the status of our July 2009 recommendations relevant to transnational  gangs later in this report.", "You asked us to examine the extent to which U.S. federal agencies have  taken steps to address the problem of transnational gangs. This report  focuses on U.S. federal agencies\u2019 efforts to combat Central American  gangs, addressing the following questions: (1) To what extent has the U.S.  federal government developed a strategy to combat transnational gangs  with connections to Central America? and (2) How have U.S. federal  agencies implemented this strategy and related programs to combat  transnational gangs with connections to Central America, and to what  extent have federal agencies coordinated these programs and assessed  their results? In addition, we provide information on the leadership  structure and transnational criminal activities of MS-13 and 18th Street  (see app. I) and other U.S. gangs that federal law enforcement agencies  have identified as having transnational connections (see app. II). We also  provide additional details on federal programs for combating transnational  gangs (see app. III) and federal antigang coordinating mechanisms and  entities (see app. IV).", "To determine to what extent the U.S. federal government has developed a  strategy to combat transnational gangs with connections to Central  America, we examined the interagency strategy developed by various  federal departments and agencies under the auspices of the NSC, called  the Strategy to Combat the Threat of Criminal Gangs from Central  America and Mexico (the Strategy), and compared the contents of the  strategy to select criteria in our prior work on desirable characteristics of  an effective national strategy, including (1) clear purpose, scope, and  methodology; (2) discussion of problems, risks, and threats; (3) desired  goals, objectives, activities, and performance measures; and (4)  delineation of roles and responsibilities. We also examined the roles and  activities of the various federal departments and agencies under the  Strategy, including DOJ, DHS, State, DOD, the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury), and USAID, and their component agencies, such as the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) within DOJ and U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE) within DHS, that are responsible for carrying  out efforts under the Strategy. In regard to the NSC, we discussed its role  in developing and implementing the Strategy with a mix of the  departments and agencies that participated in the NSC\u2019s IOCPCC such as  State, DOJ, and USAID.", "To determine how U.S. federal agencies have implemented programs to  carry out the Strategy and combat transnational gangs, coordinated these  programs and assessed their results, we examined a mix of DOJ\u2019s, DHS\u2019s,  State\u2019s, USAID\u2019s, and their component agencies\u2019 plans, performance data,  reports, and assessments for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. We compared  federal agencies\u2019 efforts to coordinate and share information on their  transnational antigang programs to select criteria on effective interagency  collaboration and results-oriented government. In addition, we reviewed  federal agencies\u2019 budget requests for fiscal years 2008 through 2010;  appropriations acts for DOJ, DHS, State, and USAID and supplemental  appropriations acts for those fiscal years; and expenditure plans for U.S.  provision of antigang assistance to countries in Central America. To assess  the reliability of statistical information, such as data on performance and  outcomes, we discussed the sources of the data with agency officials and  reviewed documentation regarding the compilation of data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. To obtain information on federal efforts to combat the gangs as  well as the extent to which agencies have coordinated their efforts with  other agencies, we interviewed a mix of federal, state, and local law  enforcement officials in seven locations in the United States as well as a  mix of officials from U.S. federal, foreign, and three nongovernmental  agencies in El Salvador and Guatemala. The locations we selected were  based on a mix of criteria that included locations (1) along the U.S.  borders; (2) where U.S. federal agencies have implemented antigang  programs; and (3) where federal law enforcement agencies have  conducted operations involving gangs with connections to Central  America. For our site visits to foreign locations, we consulted with  officials of federal agencies to identify in which foreign locations their  agencies had efforts underway. Of the countries in the region, agency  officials suggested we visit El Salvador and Guatemala because more  antigang initiatives were underway and further along compared to efforts  in other countries. Given this, we selected these countries to obtain more  information on these efforts and evaluate the effect they have had on the  gang problem. To obtain information on the process of how ICE handles  and removes gang members who are in the United States illegally, we  visited ICE\u2019s South Texas Detention Facility in Pearsall, Texas, and  interviewed officials with ICE\u2019s Office of Detention and Removal  Operations. We also observed activities related to gang prevention efforts  in El Salvador and Guatemala, such as those at the youth centers, and  interviewed participants, local government officials involved in the efforts,  and members of the community about their views of the programs and the  programs\u2019 effect. The information we obtained from interviewing officials  in the U.S. and Central American locations cannot be generalized across  all locations in the United States or Central America. However, because  we selected these locations based on a variety of factors, they provided us  with an overview of the agencies\u2019 antigang programs, examples of  coordination and measurements to assess results, and any challenges with  implementation of the programs. Additional details on our scope and  methodology, including the locations we visited, are in appendix V.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2008 through April 2010,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The 18th Street gang was founded primarily by Mexican  immigrants in the 1960s, though it currently accepts members from other  backgrounds. MS-13\u2019s early membership is reported to have included  former guerrillas and Salvadoran government soldiers whose combat  experience during the Salvadoran civil war contributed to the growth of  the gang\u2019s notoriety as one of the more violent Los Angeles street gangs.  The end of the Central American civil wars and changes in U.S.  immigration laws helped to facilitate the removal of tens of thousands of  Central Americans illegally in the United States to their native countries in  the 1990s, including MS-13 and 18th Street gang members who  subsequently spread their gang culture and operations to those countries.

In the 2009  National Gang Threat Assessment, the NGIC and NDIC indicated that MS- 13 members have been involved in a wide range of crimes within U.S.  communities, including homicide, drive-by shootings, assault, robbery,  weapons trafficking, the transportation and distribution of drugs, identity  theft, and prostitution operations. The 18th Street gang is active in 28  states and has a membership estimated at between 30,000 and 50,000.  According to the 2009 National Gang Threat Assessment, in California, for  example, about 80 percent of 18th Street gang members are illegal aliens  from Mexico and Central America. In the United States, 18th Street gang  members have been involved in homicide, assault, robbery, street-level  drug distribution, auto theft, and identification fraud.", "Although estimates vary, in the Central American countries of El Salvador,  Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala, USAID has estimated that there are  approximately 63,000 gang members, while the U.S. Southern Command  (SOUTHCOM) has estimated total gang membership in Central America to  be approximately 70,000.

The Strategy is also designed to be regional in scope, with the  United States working with the other countries affected by the gangs to  avoid transferring the gang problem to neighboring countries.

As shown in table 1, for each category, the  Strategy identifies agencies that are to implement the individual activities  and a lead agency to coordinate these activities.

Although the Strategy itself lacks goals and measures to gauge  results and assess progress across the Strategy\u2019s categories and activities,  State and USAID, for their parts of the Strategy, have begun to develop  mechanisms to assess the results of their efforts being implemented under  the M\u00e9rida Initiative, including the initiative\u2019s antigang programs. For  example, for its part, State has drafted four gang-specific performance  measures within the broader set of measures it is developing for the  M\u00e9rida Initiative: (1) number of arrests of suspected gang members  completed by police units trained/equipped through M\u00e9rida Initiative  funding in countergang strategies, (2) number of arrests and prosecutions  of gang leaders in the region, (3) number of gang-related crime  occurrences and homicides in the region, and (4) number of instances  where gang-related information is passed from the TAG to U.S. law  enforcement for review/action. State officials noted that the department is  working with its embassies to determine if Central American countries will  be capable of providing the department with the requisite data needed to  determine results and outcomes for these measures, as these countries  control much of the data, often in disparate data sets and across various  ministries. As of November 2009, State officials also reported that they  were in the process of reviewing bids from contractors to develop  performance measures for the department\u2019s M\u00e9rida Initiative programs,  including its antigang programs, and to work directly with the host nations  to obtain the necessary data to determine the results and outcomes of the  efforts based on these measures.", "In addition to the measures State is developing to evaluate the results of  M\u00e9rida Initiative-funded programs in Central America, USAID has  developed a M\u00e9rida Initiative Central America Results Framework that  includes an effect evaluation to be conducted by Vanderbilt University  through a contractual arrangement with USAID. The agency intends for  this evaluation to assess the long-term effect and measure the results of its  programs in Central American communities that are the focus of USAID  crime prevention efforts under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, including those  related to gangs. The evaluation consists of five elements: (1) community  surveys, (2) reviews of demographic data in the communities, (3) focus  groups, (4) interviews with stakeholders such as community leaders, and  (5) community observations such as physical infrastructure. Vanderbilt  University officials are to conduct the evaluations every 18 months in  communities where USAID-sponsored crime prevention activities have  been implemented and communities where no activities have been  implemented, with these latter communities serving as control groups in  order to establish a baseline. Specifically with respect to the surveys,  USAID plans to use the results to gauge the effect of its crime prevention  programs through community and citizen perceptions on safety and  security. To minimize any duplication and take advantage of survey efforts  already underway, USAID officials stated that they plan to incorporate the  survey questions on community and citizen perceptions on safety and  security as part of a broader survey Vanderbilt University will be  conducting in the region in 2010.", "Although State and USAID have begun to develop mechanisms to help  assess the outcomes of antigang programs implemented under the M\u00e9rida  Initiative, these mechanisms do not encompass all of the Strategy\u2019s  categories and activities, nor do they include the antigang programs of  other federal agencies, such as those of DOJ and DHS. For example, while  the measures State is developing, such as the numbers of arrests of gang  members and leaders in the region, relate to the law enforcement, capacity  enhancement, and prevention categories of the Strategy, these measures  do not encompass the diplomacy or repatriation categories of the Strategy.  According to State and USAID officials as well as officials from the FBI  and ICE, State and USAID have not consulted or worked with DOJ and  DHS agencies such as FBI and ICE in developing these performance  measures because State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s measures are intended to  encompass only their own programs and efforts. According to State,  USAID, DOJ, and DHS officials, each agency focuses on developing  performance-related goals and measures for its own programs as opposed  to other agencies\u2019 antigang programs for which it is not responsible, and,  therefore, less familiar. As a result, the performance measures State and  USAID are developing cannot serve as overall indicators of the federal  government\u2019s progress in implementing the Strategy as they do not take  into account all of the federal agencies\u2019 antigang programs to be  implemented under the Strategy\u2019s five categories, including those  programs led by DOJ and DHS. In the absence of goals and performance  measures or other mechanisms for monitoring and assessing the progress  and performance of agencies\u2019 antigang programs across the categories of  the Strategy, it will be difficult for the federal government to determine if  the overall interagency antigang effort is achieving the intended results  and to hold agencies accountable for implementing the Strategy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Federal Agencies Have Implemented Programs to Combat Transnational Gangs, but Could Take Additional Action to Enhance Coordination Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have implemented a variety of programs to carry out the  Strategy and combat transnational gangs with connections to Central  America. To coordinate their implementation of antigang programs,  agencies use a variety of mechanisms such as interagency committees and  task forces. However, for the antigang unit in El Salvador, coordination  among the FBI, ICE, and Salvadoran law enforcement in sharing  investigative information on gangs could be enhanced by reaching  agreement on ICE\u2019s participation in the unit. Further, although agencies  have taken steps to develop performance measures and obtain data on  those measures to track the results of programs, agencies are just starting  to collect performance data due to the early stage of implementation of  most of these programs. Additionally, federal agencies have identified  various factors that are largely outside their control and that can affect  their implementation of programs, such as challenges facing Central  American countries in sustaining antigang programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Developed a Variety of Programs to Implement the Interagency Strategy", "paragraphs": ["To carry out the Strategy and combat transnational gangs with  connections to Central American countries, federal agencies have  developed and implemented a variety of programs in the United States and  in host countries in the region, such as El Salvador and Guatemala. This  variety of programs reflects the different categories of the strategy and  includes diplomatic efforts to establish a coordinated approach to the  gang problem; efforts to facilitate the repatriation of gang members who  are in the United States illegally; mechanisms to facilitate the sharing of  investigative information between U.S. law enforcement agencies and  foreign law enforcement agencies; programs to provide training to Central  American law enforcement officials; and programs to provide recreational  and vocational opportunities for at-risk youth, among others. Additional  details on federal agencies\u2019 antigang programs under each category of the  Strategy are as follows:    Diplomacy: State has led efforts to engage diplomatically with Central  American countries to discuss gang issues. The department has led  discussions with member countries of the Central American Integration  System. Under this initiative, the United States and Central American  countries first held discussions regarding regional gang threats in July  2007, at which time the United States announced the Strategy. The  countries held a second, and the most recent, dialogue in December 2008,  which focused on discussing practical measures to combat the threats of  criminal gangs, narcotics trafficking, and illicit trafficking of firearms in  Central America. At the conclusion, all participating countries signed a  communiqu\u00e9 pledging their continued support in the fight against  transnational threats, including gangs.", "Repatriation: ICE has implemented the Electronic Travel Document  system to facilitate the issuance of travel documents for the removal of  illegal aliens, including gang members, to El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras. Under this program, ICE electronically sends travel document  applications to the consular officials of these countries; these officials can  then electronically sign and certify the documents stating that the  countries will receive the illegal aliens to be removed. These documents  are available to ICE electronically through the Electronic Travel  Document system. This program eliminates the need for consular officials  to visit in person the individual awaiting removal from the United States  before issuing documents, helping to reduce the amount of time it takes  for ICE to receive travel documents from foreign countries and ultimately  remove illegal aliens. According to ICE officials, the program can  eliminate approximately 5 to 7 days that an alien would spend in  detention, thus decreasing the cost incurred by the government.", "Law Enforcement: In 2005, ICE implemented Operation Community  Shield\u2014a nationwide initiative to arrest and remove criminal alien gang  members from the United States. ICE began the operation to target violent  transnational street gangs through the use of ICE\u2019s broad law enforcement  powers to identify, prosecute, and ultimately remove gang members from  the United States. Although initially focused on MS-13, ICE expanded  Operation Community Shield to target all transnational criminal street  gangs, prison gangs, and outlaw motorcycle gangs. For its part, the FBI has  implemented various programs to facilitate the exchange of information,  such as criminal histories of suspected gang members, between law  enforcement agencies in the United States and Central American  countries. For example, in 2007, the FBI established a joint U.S.- Salvadoran Transnational Anti-Gang unit in El Salvador\u2014called TAG\u2014to  exchange information on gangs and gang members between the  Salvadoran national police and U.S.-based law enforcement agencies for  use in criminal investigations and gang-member prosecutions in both  countries. The unit includes investigators and analysts from the  Salvadoran national police, prosecutors from El Salvador\u2019s Attorney  General\u2019s Office, and two FBI agents. The TAG unit\u2019s exchange of  information on gang members has aided U.S. gang investigations in  locations such as Charlotte, North Carolina; Omaha, Nebraska; and Los  Angeles, California. The FBI plans to establish units like this in Guatemala  and Honduras. Further, in 2006, the FBI began the Central American  Fingerprint Exploitation program to collect and store existing criminal  fingerprint records and other biometric information from the countries of  Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras in FBI databases  and make them available to all U.S. local, state, and federal law  enforcement agencies. These records are searched in the FBI\u2019s Integrated  Automated Fingerprint Identification System, with resulting matches  shared with the contributing country for investigative purposes. The FBI  has deployed the system in El Salvador, conducted assessments to  determine how to deploy the system to Belize and Panama, and plans to  conduct more assessments for deploying the system to Guatemala and  Honduras. In addition, beginning in 2008, the FBI, with funding from State,  has implemented the Central American Law Enforcement Exchange  program wherein law enforcement personnel from El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras have visited locations in the United States to  receive antigang training and share investigative practices with U.S. law  enforcement personnel. In exchange, law enforcement personnel from the  United States have visited El Salvador to provide antigang training and  share practices with Central American police. Also related to law  enforcement, ICE, in conjunction with State, established an international  gang task force in Honduras in January 2010. Comprised of four Honduran  police officers and one ICE agent, the task force is charged with  developing intelligence to initiate and support gang investigations in the  United States and Honduras.", "Capacity Enhancement: To help enhance the capacity of Central American  governments to address gangs, beginning in 2006, State, DOJ, DHS, and  other agencies have provided antigang training courses to Central  American law enforcement officials through the International Law  Enforcement Academy in El Salvador. The academy provides law  enforcement training to officials from countries in Central and South  America and the Caribbean. The training courses have focused on various  aspects of gang enforcement efforts, such as police investigative  techniques, prosecution, witness protection, and prison gang management,  and participants have included police, prosecutors, judges, prison staff,  border agents, and prevention and rehabilitation officials from El  Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and Belize. As another  example of capacity enhancement, USAID has provided technical  assistance and training to police, prosecutors, and judges, among others,  to reform justice-sector institutions in El Salvador to help improve the  investigation, prosecution, and prevention of crimes including those  committed by gangs.", "Prevention: USAID has implemented gang prevention, intervention, and  rehabilitation programs in Central American countries to provide youth  with alternatives to joining gangs and assist former gang members\u2019 reentry  into society. For example, through partnerships with faith-based and  nongovernmental organizations and local governments in Central America,  USAID has started youth centers in specific communities to provide a safe  environment for recreational and vocational opportunities for young  people. Figure 2 shows individuals participating in activities at these youth  centers in El Salvador.", "Additionally, USAID has sponsored a community-based policing program  in Guatemala to improve the relationship between the police and local  citizens by establishing collaborative partnerships between law  enforcement and the communities they serve to solve problems and  increase trust. According to USAID, the agency plans to expand the  community policing program to five new communities in Guatemala as  well as five communities each in El Salvador and Panama."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Coordinated Their Antigang Programs through Various Mechanisms, but Could Strengthen Coordination by Examining the Establishment and Composition of a Salvadoran-Based Law Enforcement Unit", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have taken action to coordinate their antigang programs  and share information with each other through various interagency and  coordinating groups. For example, DOJ has established several entities to  coordinate and share information on gang enforcement efforts, including  transnational gangs, among DOJ and DHS component agencies. These  entities include the Anti-Gang Coordination Committee that is comprised  of representatives from a variety of DOJ components and agencies, as well  as representatives from DHS\u2019s ICE, and meets at least quarterly each year  to report on the status of antigang efforts and disseminate information for  coordination. Another entity used to coordinate, share information and  intelligence on gangs, and serve as a deconfliction center for gang  operations is the National Gang Targeting, Enforcement, and Coordination  Center (GangTECC). GangTECC is comprised of participants from the  FBI, ATF, DEA, and ICE, among other DOJ and DHS components, and has  responsibility for coordinating multijurisdictional investigations of all  gangs except FBI-led investigations involving the MS-13 and 18th Street  gangs. In addition, the FBI\u2019s MS-13 National Gang Task Force has only FBI  participants and is responsible for coordinating FBI\u2019s multijurisdictional  investigations involving MS-13 and 18th Street gangs. Further, within  Central American countries, federal agencies have mechanisms for  coordinating and sharing information on antigang programs. For example,  in El Salvador at the U.S. embassy, U.S. government agency officials who  are involved in implementing antigang programs, such as officials from  DOJ, DHS, State, USAID, and DOD, hold regular meetings to discuss  antigang activities and coordinate their implementation efforts. Appendix  IV provides additional information on the roles and responsibilities of  these and other headquarters-level coordinating entities as well as task  forces that coordinate antigang efforts at the field level within the United  States.", "In July 2009, we reported on the benefits and challenges associated with  some of these various coordinating mechanisms. Specifically, we reported  that entities such as the Anti-Gang Coordination Committee, GangTECC,  and the MS-13 National Gang Task Force provide DOJ and DHS with a  means to operate across agency boundaries and facilitate communication  among participating agencies at the headquarters level. However, we also  reported that while some overlaps in mission may be appropriate, the  entities had not clearly identified their roles and responsibilities, resulting  in possible gaps or unnecessary overlaps in agencies\u2019 coordination and  sharing of information on gang enforcement efforts, including those  involving transnational gangs. Specifically, we reported that GangTECC  and the MS-13 National Gang Task Force had overlapping missions and  responsibilities for coordination and deconfliction of multijurisdictional  investigations involving the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs. The two entities  had these overlaps in part because the MS-13 National Gang Task Force  already existed when GangTECC was established in 2006 and was not  dismantled or folded into GangTECC at that time. We reported that both  entities risked unnecessary federal resource expenditures to fund two  entities when a single group could be more efficient. We recommended  that DOJ, in consultation with DHS, articulate and differentiate roles,  responsibilities, and missions of headquarters-level entities, which would  strengthen headquarters-level coordination efforts to help ensure that they  are not expended on overlapping missions. DOJ agreed with our  recommendation and as of February 2010, DHS and DOJ officials reported  that they are discussing ways to streamline processes, modify policies, and  establish cross-cutting performance measures for federal gang programs.", "At the field level, FBI and ICE could strengthen their coordination and  sharing of information on gang members and investigations specifically in  El Salvador by reaching agreement on ICE\u2019s participation in the TAG. In  El Salvador, both ICE and FBI contact the Salvadoran national police to  request information and intelligence on gangs to assist in the agencies\u2019  gang investigations. The FBI makes its requests directly through its agents  assigned to the TAG, while ICE\u2019s requests for Salvadoran national police  information on gangs or gang members are sent through ICE\u2019s country  attach\u00e9 in El Salvador who forwards them to the FBI agents at the TAG.  The FBI agents then pass the requests to Salvadoran national police  officials if the FBI agents do not have the information needed to fulfill  ICE\u2019s requests. FBI and ICE officials stated that this process for  coordinating information requests for the Salvadoran national police  through the TAG has worked well, but that the process could be further  strengthened by ICE\u2019s participation in the TAG unit. Our work on effective  interagency coordination has shown that collaborating agencies should  organize joint and individual efforts and facilitate information sharing.  Collaborating agencies also look for opportunities to leverage each others\u2019  resources, thus obtaining additional benefits that would not be available if  they were working separately. Coordinating in this way could yield  benefits in terms of leveraging efforts already underway and minimizing  any potential unnecessary duplication in federal agencies\u2019 requests for  information on gang members or gang investigations. Various U.S. and  Salvadoran officials have cited potential benefits that could be gained  from ICE and FBI both participating in the TAG. The director of El  Salvador\u2019s national police stated that he would like to see federal law  enforcement agencies other than the FBI involved in the TAG unit,  particularly ICE, because of ICE\u2019s role in managing the removal of gang  members from the United States to El Salvador. The unit chief of FBI\u2019s MS- 13 National Gang Task Force stated that the FBI would also benefit from  ICE participating in the TAG to assist in deconflicting enforcement  operations between the FBI and ICE in El Salvador. ICE\u2019s El Salvador  country attach\u00e9 stated that having an ICE agent at the TAG would  streamline the current process since an ICE agent would be working  directly at the TAG and be able to better identify possible connections  between FBI and ICE gang cases and requests for information, thereby  expediting information sharing.", "The FBI and ICE have discussed signing a joint memorandum of  understanding to provide parameters for ICE\u2019s participation in the TAG.  According to the unit chief of the FBI\u2019s MS-13 National Gang Task Force,  in 2008 the FBI presented ICE with a memorandum of understanding for  ICE to participate in the TAG unit in which the FBI legal attach\u00e9 would  manage the TAG and coordinate TAG gang investigations with ICE. The  FBI memorandum required ICE to coordinate all of its activities related to  the TAG with the FBI legal attach\u00e9. However, according to the head of  ICE\u2019s National Gang Unit, ICE would like to participate in the TAG more  as an equal partner as opposed to being subordinate to the FBI. ICE  officials stated that clarification is needed in regards to the administrative  details on placing an ICE agent at the TAG such as housing and the  location of the ICE agent\u2019s office, as well as agreement on the extent to  which an ICE agent assigned to the TAG could focus on work for ICE- specific investigations as needed.", "To help obtain this clarification and try to reach consensus on ICE  participation in TAG, ICE officials stated that as of February 2010 they  have not yet completed the process of drafting language to clarify their  points of concern in the memorandum of understanding and plan to  provide this draft language, once completed, to the FBI for its  consideration. Further, the FBI and ICE have initiated discussions to  conduct an assessment of ICE\u2019s possible participation in TAG by having an  ICE agent who would conduct the assessment assigned to the unit on a  temporary basis. However, as of February 2010, ICE and FBI have not yet  reached agreement on this temporary assignment and ICE\u2019s plans to  conduct the assessment because the two agencies disagree about the type  and scope of the work that the agent would conduct for the assessment.  The FBI and ICE could strengthen their coordination on gang  investigations and enhance the efficiency of their existing process for  exchanging information through the TAG by reaching consensus on ICE\u2019s  participation in the unit. By reaching agreement on ICE\u2019s role, which the  FBI and ICE have been considering since 2008, the two agencies would be  in a better position to leverage their existing resources and information- sharing processes for gang investigations with a nexus to El Salvador."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Established Performance Measures for Their Own Antigang Programs, but Some Programs Are in the Early Stages of Collecting Performance Data", "paragraphs": ["Earlier in this report, we discussed federal government efforts to measure  the results achieved with the overall Strategy. Separately, federal agencies  have established performance measures, such as numbers of arrests of  gang members, for assessing their own individual antigang efforts.  However, as most of these programs are in the early stages of  implementation, agencies\u2019 data on their programs\u2019 performance cannot yet  be used to assess the level of activity or program results across time. For  example, USAID officials said that because most of the M\u00e9rida Initiative  funding for its Central American programs was not released to USAID field  missions until July and August 2009, programs funded by the M\u00e9rida  Initiative have yet to have any appreciable results to measure. In addition,  several antigang programs in Central America have yet to be fully  implemented. For example, ICE and the FBI are seeking to establish the  Criminal History Information Program in El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras pending the hiring of needed analysts and completion of  interagency agreements\u2014expected to occur by the summer of 2010.", "Although federal agencies\u2019 performance data do not yet indicate the level  of progress or results achieved over time, federal agencies have begun to  report data on their levels of activity to date.

According to State, the  academy has offered 10 gang-related training courses since 2006 with a  total of 416 participants from various countries including El Salvador,  Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico. In addition to these measures, State  asks participants to complete course evaluations and uses these  evaluations to make modifications to the antigang training courses, such  as changes in curriculum.", "USAID has also established measures for its own antigang programs, as  shown in table 2. For example, USAID has established measures for its  community policing program, such as the number of communities that  have implemented community policing programs.", "USAID also requires program contractors to develop performance indexes  for their respective programs. For example, the private contractor  conducting USAID\u2019s Community-based Crime and Violence Prevention  Project plans to review local government records to measure the crime  rate in project-targeted communities. For other efforts related to youth  outreach centers, performance indicators tracked by program contractors  include measures such as the number of youth who have received a job  through the support of the outreach center or because of the skills  acquired through the center.", "With regard to its gang enforcement efforts, ICE reports on the number of  gang-related criminal and administrative arrests, among other measures.  As shown in figure 3, the number of criminal and administrative gang- related arrests made by ICE has generally increased since fiscal year 2006,  the first full year that it compiled this information.", "As shown in table 3, the FBI has also established various measures for  each of its primary programs to combat transnational gangs. Among  others, these measures include the number of gang cases worked and the  number of countries and officials participating in the Central American  Law Enforcement Exchange Program.", "In addition to these measures, the FBI has prepared after-action reports  for the Central American Law Enforcement Exchange Program that  summarize the results of the exchanges, including feedback from program  participants, and has used these reports to modify the program. For  example, according to the FBI, future exchange classes will include more  practical and operational experiences (such as ride-alongs with local  police officers and observation of police operations). Moreover, future  classes will include more allowances for travel time and representation  from more U.S. and foreign police departments.", "For the TAG, the FBI did not start to collect data for the unit\u2019s measures,  such as the number of requests for assistance the unit receives, until April  2008, about 6 months after the unit was established. According to FBI  officials, no systematic log or other mechanism was used to track and  record data on the TAG\u2019s activities from September 2007 through April  2008, because, at the start-up of the unit, agents were assigned on a  temporary basis and were primarily focused on establishing and initiating  the operations of the unit. Thus, the FBI lacks information about the unit\u2019s  activity levels for its first 6 months of operation. Since FBI agents have  been stationed at the TAG for 2-year, long-term rotations, these agents  have developed and maintained a log to track the unit\u2019s activities and  assistance provided to FBI offices and other law enforcement agencies.  This data maintained by the TAG is used by FBI, particularly the MS-13  National Gang Task Force, to identify trends in where transnational gang  members are located and traveling to and proactively target specific  geographic areas for gang education or enforcement activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Factors Affect U.S. Efforts to Implement Antigang Programs in Central American Countries", "paragraphs": ["Even as agencies have worked to implement antigang programs in Central  America, various factors in the region largely outside of the control of U.S.  agencies pose challenges to the implementation of the programs. These  factors include: the ability of host countries to sustain programs after U.S.  support ends; Central American law enforcement personnel issues; and  legal restrictions in Central American countries, such as El Salvador, that  diminish the benefits of efforts.", "Sustainability of programs by host countries: Federal agencies have  identified challenges facing Central American countries in sustaining  antigang programs currently being initiated and implemented in the  region. Specifically, State officials identified several factors outside the  control of U.S. agencies that contribute to the uncertainty as to whether  Central American countries will be able to sustain antigang programs over  the long term. These officials reported that the ability of partner countries  to take responsibility for managing and supporting U.S.-funded antigang  programs is hampered by the fact that these countries often do not have  the financial resources to sustain the programs in the absence of U.S.  funds. State officials said that the ability of foreign countries to sustain  antigang programs is hindered by other factors as well, such as corruption  throughout the countries\u2019 police and judiciary structures; a lack of  investment in police training to make the countries\u2019 police forces more  professional and accountable; the countries\u2019 inability to provide police  forces with equipment such as communications gear and transportation  assets; and the ability of the gangs to quickly adapt to law enforcement  strategies.", "To help address these issues, federal agencies have taken steps prior to  implementing these programs to plan for how the programs will be  sustained, particularly after U.S. federal funding ends. For example, State  officials said that when the department first developed and implemented  these programs, it took into account the ability of foreign countries to take  over and manage antigang programs initially funded and managed by the  United States. Specifically, the officials noted that they worked directly  with host country officials to gain an understanding of what programs or  efforts the countries needed and what the countries might be able to  support, both in terms of resources available and a supportive political  climate, and then used that as a starting point to identify and shape the  efforts that would receive U.S. support. According to USAID officials,  USAID also took similar steps to work with host country officials to  identify antigang efforts the countries had planned or were already  underway for which USAID could provide additional support. Officials  stated that they chose this approach because they sought to support local  initiatives and programs whenever possible, as programs already planned  or implemented by the host countries are more likely to be sustained by  the countries themselves. Rather than setting up similar programs that  would compete for resources, providing support for the host countries\u2019  programs helped to broaden the reach of the programs into additional  areas that the host countries may not have had resources for otherwise.  Further, USAID officials reported that they coordinated with the host  countries and other donors to ensure that the host countries would  assume responsibility for the activities when USAID funding expires. In  regard to FBI-led efforts such as the TAG, FBI officials stated that they  also considered the ability of the foreign government to support these  efforts during negotiations between the foreign governments, such as El  Salvador, and the FBI to establish the units.", "To help prepare for sustaining antigang programs over the long term,  federal agencies have also taken action after these programs have been  implemented. For example, at the country level, USAID officials work  directly with host government partners and with other donors through  regular donor coordination groups and meetings to identify best practices  for sustaining efforts and incorporating those practices into programs.  Further, FBI officials have discussed with the Salvadoran government  ways for the government to provide the resources and commitment  needed to help sustain the TAG unit over the long term. According to the  unit chief of the MS-13 National Gang Task Force who manages the TAG,  other than what the FBI pays for in the salaries and living expenses of the  FBI agents based at the TAG, the Salvadoran government provides the  other resources necessary to sustain the TAG\u2019s operations.", "Screening process for law enforcement personnel and transfer of  personnel: Finding a sufficient number of Central American law  enforcement personnel who can pass the screening process required to  participate in U.S. investigative and information-sharing programs can  complicate the implementation of those programs. For example, in order  to become part of the FBI\u2019s TAG unit, police officers must receive a  background screening before initially joining the unit and undergo a  polygraph every 6 months thereafter. Under the rules of the TAG, if  officers fail the polygraph, they must leave the unit. FBI officials stated  that, as was the case in El Salvador when they set up the TAG in that  country, they expect to face challenges in identifying and successfully  screening a sufficient number of Guatemalan and Honduran police officers  to participate in the units planned for those countries. To address this  challenge, the FBI is planning to establish smaller TAG units in Guatemala  and Honduras (10 officers each instead of the 20 stationed at the  Salvadoran TAG) and set aside more time and resources for screening  Guatemalan and Honduran police officers for the units. FBI officials also  stated that one disadvantage of the first officer exchange with El Salvador  was that of the four participating Salvadoran police officers, only two  officers continued to work on gang investigations in El Salvador after the  exchange was completed with the other two being transferred to different  areas within the Salvadoran police force. Although the FBI has an  agreement with participating countries that requires exchange participants  to be involved in gang investigations for at least 2 years after the exchange  has concluded so they can put into practice the training they received and  share it with their colleagues, FBI officials noted that there is little they  can do to ensure participating countries abide by this requirement.", "Legal restrictions: According to officials we interviewed from the FBI and  DOJ\u2019s Criminal Division, Central American countries\u2019 laws can also pose  challenges for conducting gang investigations in the region, or for federal  agencies that may seek the extradition of individuals to face trial for  crimes committed in the United States. According to an FBI official with  the MS-13 National Gang Task Force, legal restrictions in countries such as  El Salvador do not permit law enforcement to conduct electronic  surveillance or wiretaps as part of their investigations. According to this  official, while this restriction has not hindered the ability of the  Salvadoran national police to conduct investigations, it takes more time  and effort to develop and corroborate the evidence through the use of  other investigative methods. According to an official from DOJ\u2019s Criminal  Division, a recent amendment to the Salvadoran constitution now allows  the use of electronic surveillance as a tool in criminal investigations and  the Salvadoran National Assembly is currently considering implementing  legislation. In regard to the extradition of gang members wanted in the  United States, FBI officials noted that countries such as El Salvador have  laws that prohibit the extradition of individuals to other countries where  they could face a more severe punishment than would be given in El  Salvador for the same crime. As an example, the unit chief of the MS-13  National Gang Task Force stated that the FBI had requested the  extradition of a gang leader imprisoned in El Salvador for prosecution in  Baltimore, Maryland, where the individual would have likely faced a  longer prison sentence for the crime. However, the FBI\u2019s request for  extradition was denied, preventing the gang leader from facing the charges  against him in the United States.

The Strategy to Combat the Threat of  Criminal Gangs from Central America and Mexico (the Strategy) provides  a roadmap for federal departments and agencies to follow in designing and  implementing efforts to combat the gangs. However, while individual  federal agencies may be familiar with the implementation of their own  antigang programs, or those in the Strategy for which they are responsible,  they do not necessarily have the visibility across the Strategy\u2019s categories  to determine the extent to which the broader strategy is being  implemented. Regardless as to whether it remains a separate effort or is  incorporated into the broader CARSI being developed, incorporating an  approach for overseeing the interagency effort to combat transnational  gangs would help provide visibility by designating an agency or entity to  ensure that the Strategy is being implemented as planned. In addition, as  the Strategy and related antigang efforts are implemented, it will be  important to be able to track the effect the Strategy as a whole is having  against the transnational gang problem. By establishing performance goals  and measures or other mechanisms to evaluate the progress made in  implementing the Strategy, federal agencies, Congress, and other  stakeholders could have more specific information relating to agencies\u2019  performance under the Strategy, thereby enabling them to make more  informed decisions as to what adjustments to the Strategy might be  necessary, if any, to achieve its desired effect. Relatedly, while federal  agencies have taken various actions to collaborate on their transnational  antigang efforts, agencies such as the FBI and ICE can take steps to  further resolve their roles and participation in the TAG unit in El Salvador,  especially given that the FBI and ICE have been discussing this  participation since 2008.

These leaders  communicate by cell phones or coded written messages that are smuggled  in and out of the prisons. Of the five U.S. locations we visited to discuss  gang investigations with federal, state, and local law enforcement, three  reported instances in which gang leaders incarcerated in El Salvador  directed gang members to organize new cliques, coordinate with cliques in  other parts of the country, and carry out criminal activities, including  murder. For example, an investigation in Charlotte, North Carolina, found  that MS-13 clique leaders were sent to establish cliques at the behest of  leaders in El Salvador.

For example, in its  2006 Central America and Mexico Gang Assessment, U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) reported that gang activity has  transcended the borders of Central America, Mexico, and the United  States and evolved into a transnational concern. USAID reported that  while gang activity used to be territorially confined to local  neighborhoods, globalization, sophisticated communications technologies,  and travel patterns have facilitated the expansion of gang activity across  neighborhoods, cities, and countries. Further, the 2009 National Gang  Threat Assessment indicated that U.S. street gangs are expanding their  influence in most regions and broadening their presence outside the  United States to develop associations with criminal organizations in  Mexico and Central America. According to federal agencies, major cross- border criminal activities in which transnational gangs engage include  drug trafficking and distribution, human smuggling, and extortion, among  others.", "With regard to drug trafficking and distribution, assessments conducted by  the National Gang Intelligence Center, the National Drug Intelligence  Center, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicate that connections exist between  drug trafficking organizations and MS-13 and 18th Street gangs and these  connections may be expanding. Several agencies also suggested that both  gangs\u2019 connections with prison gangs such as the Mexican Mafia may  provide a link to drug trafficking organizations, as one of the prison gangs\u2019  main sources of income is extorting money from drug distributors outside  prison and distributing various narcotics within and outside the prison  system. Further, the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) has reported  that drug trafficking organizations have worked with MS-13 and 18th  Street gangs to distribute their narcotics in Central America and the  United States. MS-13 and 18th Street gangs have also been identified as  engaging in retail street distribution of narcotics in the United States, for  example. Although connections between gangs and drug trafficking  organizations exist and may be growing, these connections may not yet  reflect large-scale, organized cooperation between gangs and drug- trafficking organizations. For example, Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA) officials stated that while individual gangs and gang members might  work with drug trafficking organizations for their own personal gain, DEA  has not observed or obtained evidence of high-level, organized  cooperation between gangs and drug trafficking organizations. Likewise,  the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has reported that because  the Central American drug market is too small for gangs to develop into  major distributors, the gangs lack the maritime capabilities required for  the transport of drugs from Central America, and gangs have limited  involvement in the U.S. narcotics market, the link between Central  American gangs and drug trafficking organizations may not yet be well- developed.", "In addition to their involvement in drug trafficking and distribution,  transnational gangs have also been involved in other cross-border crime,  including alien smuggling and extortion. For example, the 2009 National  Gang Threat Assessment indicated that U.S.-based gang members are  increasingly involved in cross-border criminal activity that includes  smuggling illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States. Moreover, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection and the FBI reported that MS-13 is known  to smuggle persons from Central America into the United States from  Mexico. The FBI has also reported that 18th Street may be involved in  human trafficking and alien smuggling. However, the FBI stated that it is  difficult to determine gang members\u2019 roles\u2014whether they are organizing  the border crossings, smuggling other aliens into the country, or being  smuggled themselves.", "In addition, federal agencies have reported that extortion and retail drug  distribution provide financial support for both MS-13 and 18th Street.  Cliques have been reported to extort those who conduct illicit activities  themselves, such as prostitution or drug distribution entities, within the  gangs\u2019 territory. In the United States, transnational gang members are  known also to extort money from businesses that operate within gang  territory in exchange for not inflicting harm on the businesses or those  businesses\u2019 owners, family members, or workers. Both MS-13 and 18th  Street gangs also conduct extortion across international borders. For  example, gang members in the United States may extort immigrants with  threats that they will retaliate against family members in Central America  if law enforcement is notified. In some instances, the gangs have coupled  extortion with kidnapping. The FBI has reported that MS-13 has kidnapped  illegal immigrants and then extorted money from their families for the  immigrants\u2019 safe return.", "Finally, with regard to links to terrorists, federal agencies have found no  indication that U.S. gangs with transnational ties have routine  relationships."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Characteristics of Other Transnational Gangs", "paragraphs": ["According to the National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC), three basic  types of gangs have been identified by gang investigators: street gangs,  prison gangs, and outlaw motorcycle gangs.

Additionally, DOJ\u2019s Gang Unit  has assisted with the prosecution of MS-13 and 18th Street gang cases in  the United States. For example, in one location we contacted, the Gang  Unit assisted the local U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office with the prosecution of a  gang case under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.  The Gang Unit provided this assistance because, according to the U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Office, the office did not have enough experienced attorneys  who were familiar with using the Act to prosecute gang members.", "At the field level, federal law enforcement agencies utilize task forces to  coordinate their gang enforcement efforts.

To assess the  reliability of statistical information we obtained, such as data on program  performance and outcomes, we discussed the sources of the data with  agency officials and reviewed documentation regarding the compilation of  data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. In addition, we examined federal agencies\u2019 funding  allocated to transnational antigang programs.

To  understand the process of how ICE handles and removes gang members  who are in the United States illegally, we visited ICE\u2019s South Texas  Detention Facility in Pearsall, Texas, and interviewed officials with ICE\u2019s  Office of Detention and Removal Operations. We selected the U.S.  locations and El Salvador and Guatemala based on a mix of criteria that  included locations (1) along the U.S. borders, (2) where U.S. federal  agencies have implemented antigang programs, and (3) where federal law  enforcement agencies have conducted operations involving gangs with  connections to Central America. For our site visits to foreign locations, we  consulted with officials of federal agencies to identify in which foreign  locations their agencies had efforts underway. Of the countries in the  region, agency officials suggested we visit El Salvador and Guatemala  because more antigang initiatives were underway and further along as  compared to efforts in other countries. Given this, we selected these  countries to obtain more information on these efforts and evaluate the  effect they have had on the gang problem. We selected the South Texas  Detention Facility because it was the facility identified by ICE officials for  handling the most gang members awaiting removal. More specifically, in  the U.S. locations we interviewed officials from some of the following  federal agencies: the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives (ATF); Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 Office; ICE; and in Laredo, Texas, U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP). We also interviewed a mix of state and local law  enforcement officials in Charlotte, North Carolina; Los Angeles, California;  Nashville, Tennessee; and Omaha, Nebraska. In Guatemala and El  Salvador, we interviewed a mix of officials from the following federal  agencies: DOJ\u2019s Office of International Affairs, FBI, DEA; ICE; State;  USAID; the State-sponsored International Law Enforcement Academy; and  DOD. We also interviewed a mix of officials from Salvadoran and  Guatemalan government agencies, including the countries\u2019 national police  and the Salvadoran prosecutors\u2019 office. We also observed some of the  activities related to USAID-sponsored prevention efforts in El Salvador  and Guatemala such as the youth centers and interviewed participants,  local government officials involved in the efforts, and members of the  community about their views and the effect of the programs. Additionally,  we interviewed officials from intergovernmental and nongovernmental  organizations such as the Organization of American States, Washington  Office on Latin America, the Central American Coalition for Prevention of  Youth Violence, the Centro de Formacion y Orientacion, and the Instituto  Universitario de Opinion Publica to obtain their perspectives on the gang  problem in Central America. We also interviewed officials from  contractors and companies such as Creative Associates International, Inc.,  and Pepsi Co. that have partnered with USAID or participated in USAID  efforts to establish gang prevention programs and provide employment  opportunities for ex-gang members in countries such as El Salvador and  Guatemala. The information we obtained from interviewing officials in the  U.S. and Central American locations cannot be generalized across all  locations in the United States or Central America. However, because we  selected these locations based on a variety of factors, they provided us  with an overview of the agencies\u2019 antigang programs, examples of  coordination and measurements to assess results, and any challenges with  implementation of the programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2008 through April 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Justice", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the United States Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Rebecca Gambler, Assistant  Director; Heather Dowey; Sally Gilley; Mike Harmond; Chris Hatscher;  Michael Lenington; Amanda Miller; Janet Temko; and Adam Vogt made  significant contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
