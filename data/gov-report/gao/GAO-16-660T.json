As of May 2016, our analysis indicates that ONDCP and federal agencies have made moderate progress toward achieving one goal, limited progress on three goals, and no progress on the three other three goals. Overall, none of the goals in the Strategy have been fully achieved. In March 2013, GAO reported that ONDCP established the Performance Reporting System to monitor and assess progress toward meeting Strategy goals and objectives. GAO reported that the system's 26 new performance measures were generally consistent with attributes of effective performance management.

In recent years, policy makers, health care providers, and the  public at large are turning their attention to the current drug epidemic and  its impact on our nation. Deaths from drug overdose rose steadily over  the past two decades to become the leading cause of injury or death in  the United States, surpassing the annual number of traffic crash fatalities  in recent years. In 2013, approximately 120 people died every day from  drug overdoses. ONDCP is responsible for, among other things,  overseeing and coordinating the implementation of national drug control  policy across the federal government to address illicit drug use. In this  role, the Director of ONDCP is required annually to develop a National  Drug Control Strategy (the Strategy), which is to set forth a  comprehensive plan to reduce illicit drug use through programs intended  to prevent or treat drug use or reduce the availability of illegal drugs.  ONDCP is also responsible for developing a National Drug Control  Program Budget proposal for implementing the Strategy. In fiscal year  2017, a total of $31.1 billion was requested to support the Strategy. This  represents an increase of more than $500 million over the enacted fiscal  year 2016 level of $30.6 billion.", "Today, I will discuss (1) what progress has been made toward achieving  National Drug Control Strategy goals and how ONDCP monitors progress  and (2) trends in federal drug control spending.

In March 2013 we made a recommendation to ONDCP to  assess overlap in drug prevention and treatment programs. ONDCP  concurred and has implemented it. For our December 2015 testimony  statement, we analyzed ONDCP\u2019s reported progress on Strategy goals in  its 2015 Strategy and performance report. More detail on our scope and  methodologies can be found in our March 2013 report and December  2015 statement. For updates to these reports, we analyzed publically  available data sources, ONDCP reports on progress toward the  Strategy\u2019s goals and objectives, and reviewed ONDCP\u2019s Fiscal Year 2015  and Fiscal Year 2016 Budget and Performance reports, and interviewed  ONDCP officials. We previously reported on progress toward meeting  Strategy goals in our December 2015 testimony based on results  provided in ONDCP\u2019s 2015 Strategy and performance report, which were  issued in November 2015. To assess progress on Strategy goals, we  updated results for the goals using publically available data sources as of  May 2016. The data sources for the goals were determined by ONDCP  when developing the 2010 Strategy, based on their availability and  quality.

According to  ONDCP officials, it sought a comprehensive approach to drug policy,  including an emphasis on drug abuse prevention and treatment efforts  and the use of evidence-based practices\u2014approaches to prevention or  treatments that are based in theory and have undergone scientific  evaluation. Drug abuse prevention includes activities focused on  discouraging the first-time use of controlled substances and efforts to  encourage those who have begun to use illicit drugs to cease their use.  Treatment includes activities focused on assisting regular users of  controlled substances to become drug free through such means as  counseling services, inpatient and outpatient care, and the demonstration  and provision of effective treatment methods.", "ONDCP established two overarching policy goals in the 2010 Strategy for  (1) curtailing illicit drug consumption and (2) improving public health by  reducing the consequences of drug abuse, and seven subgoals under  them that delineate specific quantitative outcomes to be achieved by  2015, such as reducing drug-induced deaths by 15 percent. To support  the achievement of these two policy goals and seven subgoals  (collectively referred to as goals), the Strategy included seven strategic  objectives and multiple action items under each objective, with lead and  participating agencies designated for each action item. Strategy  objectives include, for example, Strengthen Efforts to Prevent Drug Use in  Communities and Disrupt Domestic Drug Trafficking and Production.  Subsequent annual Strategies provided updates on the implementation of  action items, included new action items intended to help address  emerging drug-related problems, and highlighted initiatives and efforts  that support the Strategy\u2019s objectives.", "ONDCP is required annually to develop the National Drug Control  Strategy, which sets forth a plan to reduce illicit drug use through  prevention, treatment, and law enforcement programs, and to develop a  Drug Control Budget for implementing the strategy. National Drug  Control Program agencies follow a detailed process in developing their  annual budget submissions for inclusion in the Drug Control Budget,  which provides information on the funding that the executive branch  requested for drug control to implement the strategy. Agencies submit to  ONDCP the portion of their annual budget requests dedicated to drug  control, which they prepare as part of their overall budget submission to  the Office of Management and Budget for inclusion in the President\u2019s  annual budget request. ONDCP reviews the budget requests of the drug  control agencies to determine if the agencies have acceptable  methodologies for estimating their drug control budgets, and includes  those that do in the Drug Control Budget. In FY 2016, the budget  contains 38 federal agencies or programs.", "There are five priorities for which resources are requested across  agencies: substance abuse prevention and substance abuse treatment  (both of which are considered demand-reduction areas), and drug  interdiction, domestic law enforcement, and international partnerships  (the three of which are considered supply-reduction areas) as shown in  figure 1. ONDCP manages and oversees two primary program accounts:  the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program and the Other  Federal Drug Control Programs.

Table 1 shows the 2010 Strategy goals and progress  toward meeting them.", "ONDCP and federal drug control agencies have made mixed progress  but have not fully achieved any of the four Strategy goals associated with  curtailing illicit drug consumption. For example, progress has been made  on the goal to decrease the 30-day prevalence of drug use among 12- to  17-year-olds by 15 percent. The data source for this measure\u2014 SAMHSA\u2019s National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)\u2014 indicates that in 2014, 9.4 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds reported having  used illicit drugs in the past month. This represents a 7 percent decrease  from the 2009 baseline for this measure. However, progress has not been  made on the goal to decrease the 30-day prevalence of drug use among  young adults aged 18 to 25 by 10 percent. Specifically, the rate of drug  use for young adults increased from 21.4 percent in 2009 to 22 percent in  2014, moving in the opposite direction of the goal. This increase was  primarily driven by marijuana use. According to the 2014 NSDUH, 19.6  percent of young adults reported having used marijuana in the past month  and 6.4 percent reported having used illicit drugs other than marijuana.  The rates of reported marijuana use for this measure increased by 8  percent from 2009 to 2014 while the rates of reported use of illicit drugs  other than marijuana decreased by 24 percent.", "Progress has also been mixed on the remaining three Strategy goals  associated with reducing the consequences of drug use. For example, the  goal to reduce drug-related morbidity by 15 percent has two measures,  and progress has been made on one but not the other. Specifically, HIV  infections attributable to drug use decreased by 34 percent from 2009 to  2014, exceeding the established target. However, the number of  emergency room visits for substance use disorders increased by 19  percent from 2009 to 2011. The data source for this measure\u2014 SAMHSA\u2019s Drug Abuse Warning Network\u2014indicates that  pharmaceuticals alone were involved in 34 percent of these visits and  illicit drugs alone were involved in 27 percent of them. According to the  2013 Drug Abuse Warning Network report, the increase in emergency  room visits for drug misuse and abuse from 2009 to 2011 was largely  driven by a 38 percent increase in visits involving illicit drugs only. In  addition, progress has not been made on the goal to reduce drug-induced  deaths by 15 percent. According to the CDC\u2019s National Vital Statistics  System, 49,714 deaths were from drug-induced causes in 2014, an  increase of 27 percent compared to 2009. This represents a significant  departure from the 2015 goal.

For  example, one of the six performance measures under the Strategy\u2019s first  objective\u2014Strengthen Efforts to Prevent Drug Use in Our Communities\u2014 is the average age of initiation for all illicit drug use, which has a 2009  baseline of 17.6 years of age and a 2015 target of 19.5 years of age.  These PRS measures were established to help assess progress towards  each objective. According to ONDCP, they are a tool to help indicate  where the Strategy is on track, and when and where further attention,  assessment, evaluation, and problem\u2010solving are needed.", "As part of our review for our March 2013 report, we assessed the PRS  measures for the Strategy\u2019s seven objectives and found them to be  generally consistent with attributes of effective performance management  identified in our prior work as important for ensuring performance  measures demonstrate results and are useful for decision making. For  example, we found that the PRS measures for the objectives were clearly  stated, with descriptions included in the 2012 PRS report, and all 26 of  them had or were to have measurable numerical targets. In addition, the  measures were developed with input from stakeholders through an  interagency working group process, which included participation by the  Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services,  among others.

However, it notes that accelerated  effort is needed to prevent youth marijuana use and counter youth  perceptions that marijuana (including synthetic marijuana) use is not  harmful. The report shows that the percent of respondents aged 12 to  17 who perceive a great risk in smoking marijuana once or twice a  week decreased from 2009 to 2013, moving in the opposite direction  of the 2015 target.", "Objective 3\u2014Integrate Treatment for Substance Use Disorders into  Health Care and Expand Support for Recovery. The report shows that  the percent of treatment facilities offering at least four specified  recovery support services, such as child care, employment  assistance, and housing assistance, increased from 2008 to 2013 and  exceeded the 2015 target. However, the report states that challenges  persist in the integration of substance abuse treatment services into  mainstream health care. For instance, the percent of the Health  Resources and Services Administration\u2019s Health Center Program  grantees providing substance use counseling and treatment services  decreased from 2009 to 2013. According to the report, implementation  of the Affordable Care Act presents opportunities to provide greater  access to treatment for substance use disorders by, for example,  efficiently integrating such treatment into the health care system and  providing non-discrimination for coverage for preexisting conditions.", "Objective 5\u2014Disrupt Domestic Drug Trafficking and Production.", "According to the report, progress is being achieved in domestic law  enforcement and efforts to disrupt or dismantle domestic drug  trafficking organizations. The 2015 targets for both measures related  to these efforts have been exceeded. The report also indicates that  progress has been made on reducing the number of  methamphetamine lab seizure incidents (a proxy for lab activity) from  2009 to 2013 but accelerated progress is needed to meet the 2015  target.", "Objective 6\u2014Strengthen International Partnerships and Reduce the  Availability of Foreign Produced Drugs in the United States. According  to the report, key source and transit countries continue to demonstrate  increased commitment to reducing drug trafficking and use through  demand and supply reduction efforts. The targets for the two  measures related to such commitments have both been met.  However, the report states that accelerated progress is needed in  working with partner countries to reduce the cultivation of drugs and  their production potential in Afghanistan, Burma, Laos, Mexico, and  Peru.", "See attachment I for performance measures under each Strategy  objective, progress toward 2015 targets, and ONDCP\u2019s assessment  categorizations.

For  Domestic Law Enforcement, ONDCP noted that federal, state, local, and  tribal law enforcement agencies play a key role in the Administration\u2019s  approach to reduce drug use and its associate consequences. ONDCP  also stated that interagency drug task forces, such as the High Intensity  Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program, are critical to leveraging limited  resources among agencies. Allocated funding for domestic law  enforcement in FY 2016 is approximately $9.7 billion, a 4 percent  increase from FY 2015 funding. Regarding Interdiction, the United States  continues to face a serious challenge from the large scale smuggling of  drugs from abroad which are distributed to every region in the Nation.
