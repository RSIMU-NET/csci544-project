In general, safeguards are temporary import restrictions of limited duration that provide an opportunity for domestic industries to adjust to increasing imports. U.S. law includes a number of other safeguards including a communist country safeguard, known as \"section 406,\" and a global safeguard, known as \"section 201,\" which have both applied to China. In light of increased concern about Chinese trade practices and the U.S. government response to them, the conference report on fiscal year 2004 appropriations requested that GAO review the efforts of U.S. government agencies responsible for ensuring free and fair trade with that country. In this report, which is one of a series, GAO (1) describes the China safeguard, (2) describes how it has been used thus far, and (3) examines issues related to the President's discretion to apply the safeguard.

In the United States, the China safeguard is implemented under section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows U.S. firms to petition for relief and establishes a three-step process. This process involves the International Trade Commission (ITC), Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and the President and determines whether Chinese imports are causing market disruption to domestic producers and whether a remedy is in the national economic interest. The entire process takes about 150 days. Under the terms of China's WTO accession agreement, WTO members may use the China safeguard until 2013. To date, the United States has not applied the China safeguard in five cases brought by domestic producers. In a sixth case, ITC has not yet reached a decision. In two cases, ITC found no market disruption. In three cases, ITC found market disruption and USTR evaluated the pros and cons of various options and made a recommendation to the President. In all three cases, the President declined to provide relief to the domestic industry after he found it would not be in the national economic interest because the costs would outweigh the benefits. The success rate for China safeguard petitions is similar to communist country safeguard petitions, but differs from that of global safeguard petitions. The President's decisions not to provide import relief after ITC found market disruption generated controversy, including a lawsuit claiming that he exceeded his authority. The relevant House committee intended that the law create a presumption in favor of relief upon an ITC injury finding. Nonetheless, the U.S. Court of International Trade found the President has broad discretion not to apply a China safeguard. Moreover, the President considers the question of whether to provide relief from a broader perspective than ITC. The President weighs the benefits of relief against the costs and considers factors such as the effect on consumers and downstream users, which ITC does not. The President cited third-country imports in all his decisions denying relief under both the Chinese and communist country safeguards. Under the global safeguard, third-country imports generally cannot diminish the potential benefits of import relief to the domestic industry and the President has often provided relief, especially since 1988 when U.S. trade laws were revised."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Imports from China have grown rapidly over the last decade, from a total  value of about $42 billion in 1995 to over $196 billion in 2004.

To ensure our understanding of relevant laws,  procedures, and agreements, we spoke with officials from the Office of the  United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the International Trade  Commission (ITC). In addition, we interviewed officials from the WTO and  officials from the government of China. Finally, we spoke with law firms  that had direct experience in China safeguard cases, as well as law firms  with broad experience in trade actions against China.", "To describe how the safeguard has been applied thus far, we examined  each phase of the process. For the ITC phase, we reviewed and analyzed  each of the determinations the ITC commissioners issued during the five  China safeguard injury investigations completed as of July 31, 2005, to  understand the rationale behind them. We further obtained private sector  views of the ITC process by speaking with law firms that had represented  petitioners and/or respondents in each of the five China safeguard injury  investigations. For the USTR phase of the process, we spoke with law  firms that had represented petitioners and/or respondents that  participated in each of the three China safeguard remedy investigations  and reviewed the transcripts of all three USTR hearings. USTR neither  made the documents related to their analyses nor their recommendations  available to us. Instead, we relied on detailed briefings from USTR officials  on the nature and substance of their deliberations culminating in a  recommendation to the President. For the presidential phase of the  process, we reviewed each of the President\u2019s three determinations made  under the China safeguard. To compare the use of the China safeguard  with the communist country and global safeguards, we reviewed ITC  import injury investigation statistics and presidential determinations in the  China, communist country, and global safeguard cases. We found the ITC  injury statistics to be sufficiently reliable for presenting and contrasting  ITC\u2019s final disposition of cases brought under these statutes.", "To examine the issues related to the application of presidential discretion,  we analyzed the reasons the President gave in his decisions not to provide  import relief. Additionally, we reviewed the legislative history of the China  safeguard and written and oral testimony before Congress and the U.S.- China Economic and Security Review Commission. We reviewed the Court  of International Trade\u2019s decision in the Motion Systems case against the  government and the submissions of parties to the case. Finally, we  analyzed the presidential determinations made under the communist  country and global safeguards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Adam R.
