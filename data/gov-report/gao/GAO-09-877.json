To help them do so, the agencies in recent years have reduced hazardous fuels, in an effort to keep wildland fires from spreading into the wildland-urban interface and to help protect important resources by lessening a fire's intensity; sponsored efforts to educate homeowners about steps they can take to protect their homes from wildland fire; and provided grants to help homeowners carry out these steps. The agencies have also made improvements that lay important groundwork for enhancing their response to wildland fire, including adopting new guidance on how managers in the field are to select firefighting strategies, improving the analytical tools that assist managers in selecting a strategy, and improving how they acquire and use expensive firefighting assets. Despite the agencies' efforts, much work remains. GAO has recommended several key actions--including development of an overarching fire management strategy--that, if completed, would substantially improve the agencies' management of wildland fire. Nonetheless, the agencies have yet to: (1) Develop a cohesive strategy laying out various potential approaches for addressing the growing wildland fire threat, estimated costs associated with each approach, and the trade-offs involved. Such information would help the agencies and Congress make fundamental decisions about an effective and affordable approach to responding to fires. (2) Establish a cost-containment strategy that clarifies the importance of containing costs relative to other, often-competing objectives. Without such clarification, GAO believes managers in the field lack a clear understanding of the relative importance that the agencies' leadership places on containing costs and are therefore likely to continue to select firefighting strategies without duly considering the costs of suppression. (3) Clarify financial responsibilities for fires that cross federal, state, and local jurisdictions. Unless the financial responsibilities for multijurisdictional fires are clarified, concerns that the existing framework insulates nonfederal entities from the cost of protecting the wildland-urban interface--and that the federal government would therefore continue to bear more than its share of the cost--are unlikely to be addressed. (4) Take action to mitigate the effects of rising fire costs on other agency programs. The sharply rising costs of managing wildland fires have led the agencies to transfer funds from other programs to help pay for fire suppression, disrupting or delaying activities in these other programs. Better methods of predicting needed suppression funding could reduce the need to transfer funds from other programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s wildland fire problems have worsened dramatically over the  past decade, threatening communities as well as important natural and  cultural resources. Both the average acreage burned annually and federal  appropriations for wildland fire management activities have more than  doubled, with appropriations reaching more than $2.9 billion annually, on  average, during fiscal years 2001 through 2007. State and local  governments have likewise spent hundreds of millions of dollars to  suppress fires during severe fire years. A number of factors have  contributed to these increases. Uncharacteristically dense, continuous  accumulations of vegetation, due in part to past fire suppression policies  and land management practices, and severe regional weather and drought  have led to higher-intensity fires and longer fire seasons. At the same time,  continued development in and near wildlands, an area often called the  wildland-urban interface, has placed more homes at risk. Five federal  agencies\u2014the Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture and the  Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife  Service, and National Park Service within the Department of the Interior\u2014 are responsible for managing wildland fires on federal lands. State  forestry agencies and other entities\u2014including tribal, county, city, and  rural fire departments\u2014have primary responsibility for managing wildland  fires on nonfederal lands and share responsibility for protecting homes  and other private structures.", "A series of damaging wildland fires in the 1990s led the Forest Service and  the Interior agencies to reassess their approach to managing fire. It also  prompted a sustained effort, known as the National Fire Plan, on the part  of the federal agencies and Congress to improve fire suppression  capabilities, reduce potentially hazardous vegetation that can fuel wildland  fires, restore fire-adapted ecosystems, and help communities better  withstand wildland fire. Growing recognition of the long-term fiscal  challenges facing the nation has also led Congress, the agencies, and  others to focus on ensuring that federal wildland fire activities are  appropriate and carried out in a cost-effective manner. Over the last  decade, this focus led federal agencies (including the Forest Service,  Interior, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Office of Inspector General, and  us) and other organizations (including the National Association of State  Foresters and the National Academy of Public Administration) to conduct  numerous reviews of federal wildland fire programs. For example, we  have reported or testified more than 50 times since 1999 on issues related  to wildland fire management, recommending more than 50 actions the  Forest Service and the Interior agencies could take to improve the  programs. The agencies have taken\u2014and continue to take\u2014steps to  address the shortcomings the reviews identified and to otherwise improve  their fire management programs, but concerns persist over the agencies\u2019  response to the deteriorating fire situation.", "In this context, and to provide the administration and the 111th Congress  with an overview of the agencies\u2019 efforts to address the wildland fire  problem, this report provides information on (1) the progress the Forest  Service and the Interior agencies have made in managing wildland fire and  (2) key actions we previously recommended and believe are still necessary  to improve the agencies\u2019 management of wildland fire.

To further our understanding of  these issues, we interviewed various agency officials, including officials in  Washington, D.C., and at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise,  Idaho. To address our second objective, we reviewed our prior reports and  testimonies to identify steps we previously recommended that the  agencies take to improve their wildland fire programs and reviewed  relevant agency documents and interviewed agency officials to determine  the status of the agencies\u2019 implementation of those recommendations.

These fires  shape the composition of forests and grasslands, periodically reduce  vegetation densities, and stimulate seedling regeneration and growth in  some species. Over the past century, however, various land use and  management practices\u2014including fire suppression, grazing, and timber  harvesting\u2014have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many forest and  rangeland ecosystems and contributed to abnormally dense, continuous  accumulations of vegetation. Such accumulations not only can fuel  uncharacteristically large or severe wildland fires but also\u2014with more  homes and communities built in or near areas at risk from wildland fire\u2014 threaten human lives, health, property, and infrastructure. Moreover, the  introduction and spread of invasive nonnative species (such as  cheatgrass), along with the expanded range of certain flammable native  species (such as western juniper) have also altered natural fire regimes,  contributing to wildland fires\u2019 burning in some areas with uncharacteristic  frequency or intensity.", "The Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management,  Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service are responsible for  wildland fire management. These five agencies manage about 700 million  acres of land in the United States, including national forests, national  grasslands, Indian reservations, national parks, and national wildlife  refuges. The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management manage  the majority of these lands. The Forest Service manages about 190 million  acres; the Bureau of Land Management manages about 260 million acres;  and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National  Park Service each manage less than 100 million acres. Figure 1 shows the  distribution of land among the five agencies. Each agency has from 7 to 12  regional or state offices that oversee field units.", "The federal wildland fire management program has three major  components: preparedness, suppression, and fuel reduction. To prepare  for a wildland fire season, the agencies acquire firefighting assets\u2014 including firefighters, fire engines, aircraft, and other equipment\u2014and  station them either at individual federal land management units (such as  national forests or national parks) or at centralized dispatch locations. The  primary purpose of these assets is to respond to fires before they become  large\u2014a response referred to as initial attack\u2014thus forestalling threats to  communities and natural and cultural resources. The agencies fund the  assets used for initial attack primarily from their wildland fire  preparedness accounts.", "When a fire starts, current federal policy directs the agencies to consider  land management objectives\u2014identified in land and fire management  plans developed by each land management unit\u2014and the structures and  resources at risk when determining whether or how to suppress the fire. A  wide spectrum of strategies is available to choose from, and the land  manager at the affected local unit is responsible for determining which  strategy to use. In the relatively rare instances when fires escape initial  attack and grow large, the agencies respond using an interagency system  that mobilizes additional firefighting assets from federal, state, and local  agencies, as well as private contractors, regardless of which agency or  agencies have jurisdiction over the burning lands. Federal agencies  typically fund the costs of these activities from their wildland fire  suppression accounts.", "In addition to preparing for and suppressing fires, the agencies attempt to  reduce the potential for severe wildland fires, lessen the damage caused by  fires, limit the spread of flammable invasive species, and restore and  maintain healthy ecosystems by reducing potentially hazardous vegetation  that can fuel fires. Approaches used for managing vegetation include  setting fires under controlled conditions (prescribed burns), mechanical  thinning, herbicides, certain grazing methods, or combinations of these  and other approaches. The agencies fund these activities from their fuel  reduction accounts.", "Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, federal agency officials,  and others have expressed concern about mounting federal wildland fire  expenditures. Federal appropriations to the Forest Service and the Interior  agencies to prepare for and respond to wildland fires, including  appropriations for reducing fuels, have more than doubled, from an  average of $1.2 billion from fiscal years 1996 through 2000 to an average of  $2.9 billion from fiscal years 2001 through 2007. Adjusting for inflation, the  average annual appropriations to the agencies for these periods increased  from $1.5 billion to $3.1 billion (in 2007 dollars). The Forest Service  received about 70 percent, and Interior about 30 percent, of the  appropriated funds; table 1 shows the agencies\u2019 combined fire  appropriations for fiscal years 1996 through 2007.", "Analysis of structures damaged during past fires and experimental  research have identified a number of relatively simple steps that can  reduce the risk of damage to structures from wildland fire. Minimizing or  preventing damage requires understanding the different types of wildland  fire and how they can ignite structures. Surface fires\u2014which burn  vegetation or other fuels, such as shrubs, fallen leaves, small branches,  and roots, near the surface of the ground\u2014can ignite a home or other  building by burning nearby vegetation and eventually igniting flammable  portions of the building, including exterior walls or siding; attached  structures, such as a fence or deck; or other nearby flammable materials,  such as firewood or patio furniture. Crown fires\u2014which burn the tops, or  crowns, of trees\u2014place homes at risk because they create intense heat,  which can ignite portions of structures even without direct contact from  flames. Embers, or \u201cfirebrands\u201d\u2014which can be carried on the wind a mile  or more from a fire\u2014can ignite a structure by landing on the roof or by  entering a vent or other opening.

For decades, the agencies  were often successful in this approach. This emphasis on suppression led  to a substantial decline in the average number of acres burned annually  from the 1930s through the 1970s. A number of damaging fires in the  1990s, however, led the agencies to fundamentally reassess their  understanding of wildland fire\u2019s role on the landscape. Their view of fire\u2019s  ecological role began to expand, from seeing benefits in a few ecosystems,  like certain grasslands and forest types, to realizing that in many  locations\u2014particularly the arid West\u2014fire was inevitable. In addition,  they recognized that by allowing brush, small trees, and other vegetation  to accumulate, their past success in suppressing fires was in part  responsible for making recent fires more severe.", "The agencies\u2019 increased awareness of fire\u2019s benefits, as well as of the  unintended negative consequences of suppression, led them in 1995 to  develop the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, a policy they  reaffirmed and updated in 2001. Under the policy, the agencies  abandoned their attempt to put out every wildland fire, seeking instead to  (1) make communities and resources less susceptible to being damaged by  wildland fire and (2) respond to fires so as to protect communities and  important resources at risk but also to consider both the cost and long- term effects of that response. As a result, the agencies have increasingly  emphasized firefighting strategies that focus on land management  objectives, which may lead them to use less aggressive firefighting  strategies that can not only reduce costs in some cases but also be safer  for firefighters by reducing their exposure to unnecessary risks, according  to agency fire officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Laid Important Groundwork through Their Efforts to Reduce Damage to Communities and Resources and to Improve Their Responses to Wildland Fire", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the Forest Service and the Interior agencies have taken  steps to help them better achieve the Federal Wildland Fire Management  Policy\u2019s vision.

They have also improved  their ability to respond efficiently and effectively to wildland fires that  occur, including taking steps to (1) implement the federal wildland fire  management policy, (2) improve decisions regarding fire management  strategies, and (3) improve how they acquire and use firefighting assets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Have Taken Steps Intended to Reduce Wildland Fire Damage to Communities and Resources", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to reduce damage to communities and resources from  wildland fire, the agencies have continued to reduce fuels and foster fire- resistant communities, but the extent to which these efforts have reduced  risk is unknown.", "Reducing hazardous fuels. Reducing hazardous fuels\u2014to keep wildland  fires from spreading into the wildland-urban interface and to help protect  important resources by lessening a fire\u2019s intensity\u2014is one of the primary  objectives of the National Fire Plan. The agencies reported reducing fuels  on more than 29 million acres from 2001 through 2008. The agencies have  also improved the data they use to help identify lands where fuels need to  be reduced and have taken steps to improve their processes for allocating  fuel reduction funds and setting priorities for fuels projects. The agencies  have nearly completed their geospatial data and modeling system,  LANDFIRE, as we recommended in 2003. LANDFIRE is intended to  produce consistent and comprehensive maps and data describing  vegetation, wildland fuels, and fire regimes across the United States. Such  data are critical to helping the agencies (1) identify the extent, severity,  and location of wildland fire threats to the nation\u2019s communities and  resources; (2) predict fire intensity and rate of spread under particular  weather conditions; and (3) evaluate the effect that reducing fuels may  have on future fire behavior. LANDFIRE data are already complete for the  contiguous United States, and the agencies have reported they expect to  complete the data for Alaska and Hawaii in 2009. Because vegetative  conditions change over time for a variety of reasons, including landscape- altering events such as hurricanes, disease, or wildland fires themselves,  the agencies also plan several processes for updating the data, including  selective updates every 2 years to reflect changes due to fires, fuel  treatments, and other disturbances and a comprehensive update every 10  years.", "In addition, the agencies have begun to improve their processes for  allocating fuel reduction funds to different areas of the country and for  selecting fuel reduction projects, as we recommended in 2007. The  agencies have started moving away from \u201callocation by tradition\u201d toward a  more consistent, systematic allocation process. That is, rather than relying  on historical funding patterns and professional judgment, the agencies are  developing a process that also considers risk, effectiveness of fuel  reduction treatments, and other factors. The Forest Service uses this  process to allocate funds to its nine regions and has directed the regions to  use it to allocate funds to their respective national forests. Interior uses a  similar process to allocate funds to its four agencies, and the agencies in  turn use it to allocate funds to their respective state or regional offices.  The agencies have been increasing their use of this process, in fiscal year  2009 applying the results to help them determine how to allocate their fuel  reduction dollars. Interior, however, kept its agencies and regions from  gaining or losing more than 10 percent in funds relative to fiscal year 2008.  Agency officials told us they expect to continue to improve their processes  and to increasingly rely on them to allocate fuel reduction funds.", "Despite these improvements, further action is needed to ensure that the  agencies\u2019 efforts to reduce hazardous fuels are directed to areas at highest  risk. The agencies, for example, still lack a measure of the effectiveness of  fuel reduction treatments and therefore lack information needed to ensure  that fuel reduction funds are directed to the areas where they can best  minimize risk to communities and natural and cultural resources. Forest  Service and Interior officials told us that they recognize this shortcoming  and that efforts are under way to address it. The Joint Fire Science  Program, for example, has funded almost 50 studies examining the  effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments in different locations and has  begun a comprehensive effort to evaluate the effectiveness of different  types of fuel treatments, as well as the longevity of those treatments and  their effects on ecosystems and natural resources.  Efforts like these are  likely to be long term, involving considerable research investment, and  have the potential to improve the agencies\u2019 ability to assess and compare  the cost-effectiveness of potential treatments in deciding how to optimally  allocate scarce funds.", "Fostering fire-resistant communities. Protecting the nation\u2019s  communities is both one of the key goals of wildland fire management and  one of the leading factors contributing to rising fire costs. Increasing the  use of protective measures to mitigate the risk to structures from wildland  fire is a key goal of the National Fire Plan\u2014a goal which also may help  contain the cost of managing fires in the long term. This plan, developed  by federal wildland fire agencies and state governors, encourages, but  does not mandate, state and local governments to adopt laws requiring  homeowners and homebuilders to take measures to help protect  structures from wildland fires. Because these measures rely on the actions  of individual homeowners and homebuilders or on laws and land-use  planning affecting private lands, achieving this goal is primarily a state and  local government responsibility. Nonetheless, the Forest Service and the  Interior agencies have helped sponsor the Firewise Communities program,  which works with community leaders and homeowners to increase the use  of fire-resistant landscaping and building materials in areas of high risk.  Federal and state agencies also provide grants to help homeowners pay for  creating defensible space around private homes.", "A few relatively simple steps can reduce the risk of damage to structures  from wildland fire. Experts from a symposium convened for us in 2004 by  the National Academy of Sciences emphasized that the two most critical  measures for protecting structures from wildland fires are (1) reducing  vegetation and flammable objects within an area of 30 to 100 feet around a  structure, often called creating defensible space (see fig. 3), and (2) using  fire-resistant roofing materials and covering attic vents with mesh  screens. Analysis of structures damaged during past fires and  experimental research have shown these two steps to be key determinants  of whether or not a structure is damaged by wildland fire.", "Nevertheless, use of protective measures is inconsistent. We reported in  2005 that many homeowners in the wildland-urban interface have not used  such measures to mitigate fire risk because of the time or expense  involved. State and local fire officials estimated that the price of creating  defensible space, for example, can range from a negligible amount, if  homeowners can do the work themselves, to $2,000 or more. Competing  concerns also influence the use of protective measures. For example,  although modifying landscaping to create defensible space has proved to  be key in protecting structures from wildland fire, officials and  researchers have reported that homeowners are more concerned about  the effect of landscaping on their property\u2019s appearance, privacy, or  habitat for wildlife. Defensible space can, however, be created so as to  alleviate many of these concerns. Leaving thicker vegetation away from a  structure and pruning plants close by it, for instance, can help protect the  structure and still be attractive, private, and wildlife-friendly.  Misconceptions about fire behavior and the effectiveness of protective  measures can also influence what people do to protect structures from  wildland fires. For example, homeowners may not know that homes can  be more flammable than the surrounding trees, shrubs, or other vegetation  and therefore do not recognize the need to reduce the flammability of the  structure itself (see fig. 4). Fire officials told us that few people realize that  reducing tree density close to a structure can return a wildland fire to the  ground, where it is much easier to keep away from structures, or that fire- resistant roofs and screened attic vents can reduce the risk of ignition  from firebrands. Finally, homeowners may not use protective measures  because they believe that firefighters are responsible for protecting their  homes and do not recognize that they share this responsibility.", "Implementing the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy. The  Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy directs each agency to develop  a fire management plan for all areas they manage with burnable  vegetation. Without such plans, agency policy does not allow use of the  whole spectrum of wildland fire response strategies, including less  aggressive strategies\u2014meaning that, for areas without such plans, the  agencies must attempt to suppress fires regardless of any benefits that  might come from allowing them to burn. We reported in 2006 that about 95  percent of the agencies\u2019 1,460 individual land management units had  completed the required plans. We also reported, however, that the  agencies may not always find it easy to update these plans; a Forest  Service official told us, for example, that, if the introduction of new data  into a fire management plan results in the development of new fire  management objectives, the agency might need to conduct a new  environmental analysis of that plan, requiring additional time and  resources. Moreover, in examining 17 fire management plans, a May 2007  independent review of large wildland fires managed by the Forest Service  in 2006 identified several shortcomings in the plans, including that most of  them examined did not contain current information on fuel conditions and  that many did not provide sufficient guidance on selecting firefighting  strategies. If fire management plans are not updated to reflect the most  current information on the extent and distribution of fire risks and the  most promising methods for dealing with these risks, the plans will be of  limited use to the agencies in managing wildland fire.", "The Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy also states that the  agencies\u2019 responses to wildland fires are to be based on the circumstances  of each fire and the likely consequences to human safety and to natural  and cultural resources. Interagency guidance on implementing the policy,  adopted in 2009, clarifies that the full range of fire management strategies  and tactics are to be considered when responding to every wildland fire  and that a single fire may be simultaneously managed for different  objectives. Previous guidance required each fire to be managed either for  suppression objectives\u2014that is, to put out the fire as quickly as possible\u2014 or to achieve resource benefits\u2014that is, to allow the fire to burn to gain  certain benefits such as reducing fuels or seed regeneration. Both the  Department of Agriculture\u2019s Inspector General and we criticized the  previous guidance, in part because it did not allow the agencies the  flexibility to switch between these strategies as fire conditions changed or  to manage parts of a single fire differently. By allowing this flexibility, the  new guidance should help the agencies achieve management objectives on  more acres and help contain the long-term costs of fire management.", "Improving decisions about fire management strategies. The agencies  have recently undertaken several efforts to improve decisions about  firefighting strategies. In 2007 we reported that previous studies had found  that officials may not always consider the full range of available strategies  and may not select the most appropriate strategy, which would account  for the cost of suppression; the value of structures and other resources  threatened by the fire; and, where appropriate, any potential benefits to  natural resources.", "Managers of the agencies\u2019 individual land management units\u2014typically  known as line officers and including national forest supervisors, BLM  district managers, and others\u2014are responsible for making strategic  decisions about how to manage a fire. A 2000 review by the National  Association of State Foresters, however, concluded that many line officers  have little wildland fire experience and may select fire management  strategies that lead to unnecessarily high suppression costs. Fire officials  told us such strategies may also have a low likelihood of success,  unnecessarily exposing firefighters to risk of injury. The Forest Service  initiated a program in 2007 designed to add to line officers\u2019 knowledge and  experience through a series of certifications at three competency levels,  certifying the officer to manage a fire of low, medium, or high complexity.  If a fire exceeds the line officer\u2019s certification level, a more experienced  officer is assigned to coach the less experienced officer; final decisions on  strategies, however, remain the responsibility of the line officer of the unit  where the fire is burning.", "To help line officers and fire managers in making on-the-ground  decisions about how to manage a particular fire, the agencies in 2009  began to use a new analytical tool, known as the wildland fire decision  support system. This new tool helps line officers and fire managers  analyze various factors\u2014such as the fire\u2019s current location, adjacent fuel  conditions, nearby structures and other highly valued resources, and  weather forecasts\u2014in determining the strategies and tactics to adopt. For  example, the tool generates a map illustrating (1) the probability that a  particular wildland fire, barring any suppression actions, will burn a  certain area within a specified time and (2) the structures or other  resources that may therefore be threatened. Having such information can  help line officers and fire managers understand the resources at risk and  identify the most appropriate response\u2014for example, whether to devote  substantial resources to attempt full and immediate suppression or instead  to take a less intensive approach, which may reduce risks to firefighters  and be less costly.", "The agencies have also established four teams, known as national incident  management organization teams, staffed with some of the most  experienced fire managers. These teams have several purposes, including  managing some of the most complex and costly fires; identifying and  disseminating best management practices throughout the agencies; and,  during periods of low fire activity, working with staff at the national  forests where large fires are particularly likely to occur, to better prepare  staff to respond. Fire officials said that over time they expect these teams  will improve decisions about firefighting strategies, both for fires the  teams manage directly and those where they worked with staff ahead of  time.", "In addition, the agencies, following congressional committee direction,  require an independent review of all fires whose costs exceed $10 million,  including an examination of the strategic decisions affecting suppression  costs. Although these reviews may identify instances where the agencies  could have used more cost-efficient firefighting strategies, and may  provide long-term benefits by helping the agencies identify and  disseminate best practices, the reviews are typically conducted after the  fires have been suppressed and therefore are not intended to help fire  managers change strategies while fires are still burning, before managers  have taken ineffective or unnecessary suppression actions.", "To influence strategic firefighting decisions while fires are still burning,  the Forest Service (which, among the responsible federal agencies, most  often manages the most expensive fires) has experimented in recent years  with several approaches for identifying ongoing fires where suppression  actions are unlikely to be effective and for influencing strategic decisions  made during those fires that might help contain costs and reduce risk to  firefighters. A senior Forest Service official told us that these efforts have  helped raise awareness of the importance of basing strategic decisions on  (1) the resources at risk of damage and (2) the likelihood that suppression  actions will be effective, but that the agency was still working to improve  its ability to quickly identify strategic firefighting decisions likely to be  ineffective. This official told us that the concept of reviewing strategic  decisions while a fire is still burning is new, as is the concept of  considering the probability of success, and not just the resources at risk,  in making those decisions; he added that he believed the agency was  making strides in implementing this approach but that it would be a long  process dependent on managers in the field gaining a better understanding  of the benefits of the new approach.", "According to this official, the agency\u2019s approach in 2009 is to identify  ongoing fires for which the cost of suppression\u2014estimated using  information from the wildland fire decision support system\u2014is expected  to be higher than the cost predicted by a measure known as the stratified  cost index, based on the costs of previous fires with similar  characteristics. On those fires for which suppression costs are expected  to be substantially higher than costs for similar fires in the past, Forest  Service officials will consult with local line officers and fire management  officials to ensure that the most appropriate firefighting strategies are  being implemented. The basis for this comparison\u2014the stratified cost  index of previous fires\u2014is not entirely reliable, however; our 2007 report  identified several shortcomings with it, including the lack of data from  many fires where less costly firefighting strategies were used (because the  agencies have only recently emphasized the importance of using less  aggressive suppression strategies). As a result, using the index as the  basis for comparison may not allow the Forest Service to accurately  identify fires where more, or more-expensive, resources than needed are  being used.", "Although these efforts are new and we have not fully evaluated them, we  believe they have the potential to help the agencies strengthen how  firefighting strategies are selected. The efforts, however, do not address  certain critical shortcomings. We reported in 2007, for example, that  officials in the field have few incentives to consider cost containment in  making critical decisions affecting suppression costs, and that previous  studies had found that the lack of a clear measure to evaluate the benefits  and costs of alternative firefighting strategies fundamentally hindered the  agencies\u2019 abilities to provide effective oversight. Although the agencies  have made progress in other areas, they still lack such a measure.", "Acquiring and using firefighting assets effectively. In 2007 we reported  that (1) federal agencies lacked a shared or integrated system for  effectively determining the appropriate type and quantity of firefighting  assets needed for a fire season; (2) the agencies\u2019 processes and systems  for acquiring firefighting assets lacked controls to ensure that the agencies  were procuring assets cost-effectively; and (3) the agencies sometimes  used firefighting assets ineffectively or inefficiently, often in response to  political or social pressures. Despite continued improvement, further  action to address these shortcomings is needed.", "First, to address congressional committee direction that they improve  their system for determining needed firefighting assets, the agencies in  2009 began deploying an interagency budget-planning system known as  fire program analysis (FPA). FPA was intended to help the agencies  develop their wildland fire budget requests and allocate funds by, among  other objectives, (1) providing a common budget framework to analyze  firefighting assets without regard for agency jurisdictions; (2) examining  the full scope of fire management activities, including preparing for fires  by acquiring and positioning firefighting assets for the fire season,  mobilizing assets to suppress fires, and reducing potentially hazardous  fuels; (3) modeling the effects over time of differing strategies for  responding to wildland fires and treating lands to reduce hazardous fuels;  and (4) using this information to identify the most cost-effective mix and  location of federal wildland fire management assets. In 2008, we reported  that FPA showed promise in achieving some of the key objectives  originally established for it but that the approach the agencies have taken  hampers FPA from meeting other key objectives, including the ability to  project the effects of different levels of fuel reduction and firefighting  strategies over time. We therefore concluded that agency officials lack  information that would help them analyze the extent to which increasing  or decreasing funding for fuel reduction and responding more or less  aggressively to fires in the short term could affect the expected cost of  responding to wildland fires over the long term. Senior agency officials  told us in 2008 that they were considering making changes to FPA that  may improve its ability to examine the effects over time of different  funding strategies. The exact nature of these changes, or how to fund  them, has yet to be determined. Officials also told us the agencies are  currently working to evaluate the model\u2019s performance, identify and  implement needed corrections, and improve data quality and consistency.  The agencies intend to consider the early results of FPA in developing  their budget requests for fiscal year 2011, although officials told us they  will not rely substantially on FPA\u2019s results until needed improvements are  made. As we noted in 2008, the approach the agencies took in developing  FPA provides considerable discretion to agency decision makers and,  although providing the flexibility to consider various options is important,  doing so makes it essential that the agencies ensure their processes are  fully transparent.", "Second, we also reported in 2007 that the agencies were planning  improvements to their acquisition processes to ensure they were  procuring assets cost-effectively. The agencies rely on private contractors  to provide many firefighting assets and have begun implementing a new  system for determining which contractors to use. This system considers  the capabilities of the equipment or personnel, as well as the cost, and is  intended to help the agencies identify the \u201cbest value\u201d and not just the  lowest cost or closest asset. A Forest Service official said that the agencies  are also evaluating how the equipment and personnel from each  contractor perform in the field and, once they have gathered enough data,  plan to apply that information in selecting contractors. The agencies are  already using this system to select contractors for many kinds of  frequently used equipment, including firefighting crews, fire engines,  aircraft, and water trucks, and plan to expand the system to include other  equipment in future years.", "Third, the agencies have taken several steps to improve their efficiency in  using firefighting assets. As we reported in 2007, for example, the agencies  implemented a computer-based dispatching system called the resource  ordering and status system. The agencies had been using a manual,  paper-based system for requesting and assigning firefighting assets, and  the new system was meant to allow them to more effectively and  efficiently monitor firefighting assets during a fire or other incident. We  reported that although the system\u2019s benefits had not been quantified, it had  likely reduced suppression costs by making it easier to use local  firefighting assets\u2014which could hasten response and thus perhaps reduce  fire size\u2014and by reducing the personnel needed to dispatch resources.  The agencies can also use the system to identify individuals qualified and  available to serve in various firefighting positions, which may help  increase the agencies\u2019 use of local incident commanders and reduce the  need to mobilize more-costly incident management teams.", "We also reported in 2007 that the agencies required that an \u201cincident  business advisor\u201d be assigned to fires expected to cost more than $5  million and recommended that an advisor be assigned to fires expected to  cost more than $1 million. An incident business advisor represents the line  officer\u2019s interest in containing costs by observing firefighting operations  and working with the incident management team to identify ways those  operations could be more cost-effective. For example, an incident  business advisor may observe the types and quantity of firefighting  personnel and equipment assigned to a fire and how they are used;  observe how equipment and supplies are procured; and, as a fire comes  under control, ensure that the most expensive personnel and equipment  are released first.", "In 2008, the agencies also changed how they determined where to send  certain firefighting assets to ensure that assets perform the highest-priority  work. Agency officials told us they instituted a new practice to increase  the likelihood that firefighting assets perform the highest-priority actions.  Under this practice, certain assets that are often in high demand (including  some of the most experienced firefighting crews) are assigned to perform  only the highest-priority actions on a particular fire or set of adjacent fires  and are then reassigned to perform high-priority actions on other fires,  rather than being assigned for several weeks to a single fire, as has been  typical. This practice should help the agencies address a shortcoming  previous studies have identified\u2014that firefighting assets may sit idle at a  fire rather than be released for use elsewhere because managers are  concerned that they will be unable to recall an asset if they need it later, a  practice that unnecessarily increases a fire\u2019s cost and prevents those  assets from helping to protect communities and resources from fires  burning elsewhere. In addition, the officials said it can be important to  ensure that assets are sufficiently flexible to respond to new fires, even if  many fires are already burning. Responding quickly can substantially  increase the likelihood that firefighters will be able to contain fires before  they become large, which is particularly important when fires start in  weather and fuel conditions that can cause them to burn intensely and  spread rapidly. Agency officials also said they have improved their ability  to predict when an unusually high number of fires might start and have  emphasized the need to keep some firefighting assets in reserve to  respond to new fires quickly.", "Previous studies also found that agencies sometimes use more, or more- costly, firefighting assets than necessary, often in response to political or  social pressures to demonstrate they are taking all possible action to  protect communities and resources. Consistent with these findings, fire  officials told us they were pressured in 2008 to assign more firefighting  assets than could be effectively used to fight fires in California. More  generally, previous studies have found that air tankers may drop flame  retardants when on-the-ground conditions may not warrant such drops.  Aviation activities are expensive, accounting for about one-third of all  firefighting costs on a large fire. Providing clarity about when different  types of firefighting assets can be used effectively could help the agencies  resist political and social pressure to call up more assets than they need."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Yet to Take Certain Key Actions That Would Substantially Improve Their Management of Wildland Fire", "paragraphs": ["Despite the important steps the agencies have taken, much work remains.  We have previously recommended several key actions\u2014including  development of an overarching investment strategy for addressing the  wildland fire problem\u2014that, if completed, would improve the agencies\u2019  management of wildland fire. In addition to completing the overarching  strategy (which we have termed a cohesive strategy), we have  recommended that the agencies clarify the importance of containing costs  relative to other, often-competing objectives and clarify financial  responsibilities for fires that cross federal, state, and local jurisdictions.  Finally, we have identified several steps the agencies should take, and  Congress could consider, that could mitigate the effects on the agencies\u2019  other programs of rising fire management costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Develop a Cohesive Strategy", "paragraphs": ["If the agencies and Congress are to make informed decisions about an  effective and affordable long-term approach for addressing wildland fire  problems that have been decades in the making, the agencies need a  cohesive strategy that identifies the options and associated funding for  reducing excess vegetation and responding to fires. By laying out various  potential approaches for addressing the growing wildland fire threat, the  estimated costs associated with each approach, and the trade-offs  involved, a cohesive strategy would help Congress and the agencies make  informed decisions about how to invest scarce funds.", "We first recommended a cohesive strategy for addressing excess  vegetation in 1999. Subsequently, after evaluating a number of related  wildland fire management issues, we reiterated the need for a cohesive  strategy in 2005 and 2006 and broadened our recommendation to better  address the interrelated nature of fuel reduction efforts and wildland fire  response. The agencies have concurred with our recommendations to  develop a cohesive strategy but have yet to develop a strategy that clearly  formulates different approaches and associated costs. In July 2009,  agency officials told us they had begun planning how to develop a  cohesive strategy but were not far enough along to provide further  information. We were therefore unable to determine the extent to which it  might provide the information the agencies and Congress need to make  fundamental decisions about the best way for the nation to respond to the  growing wildland fire problem. Because of the critical importance of this  step in improving the agencies\u2019 overall management of wildland fire, we  continue to believe that the agencies should complete a strategy, and  begin implementing it, as quickly as possible. The Federal Land  Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act, introduced in 2009,  would require the agencies to produce, within 1 year of its enactment, a  cohesive strategy consistent with our previous recommendations.", "A document that included the critical elements of a cohesive strategy was  created in 2002: an analysis by a team of Forest Service and Interior  experts estimated the funds needed to implement each of eight different  fuel reduction options for protecting communities and ecosystems across  the nation over the next century. The team determined that reducing the  risks to communities and ecosystems across the nation could require an  approximate tripling of funding for fuel reduction, to about $1.4 billion  annually, for an initial period of several years. These initially higher costs  for fuel reduction would decline after fuels had been sufficiently reduced  to make it possible to use less expensive prescribed burning methods in  many areas. More important, the team estimated that the reduction in fuels  would allow the agencies to suppress more fires at lower cost and would  reduce total wildland fire management costs and risk after 15 years.  Alternatively, the team concluded, maintaining the then-current level of  investment in fuel reduction would increase costs, as well as risks to  communities and ecosystems in the long term.", "The Office of Management and Budget raised concerns about the accuracy  of the long-term funding estimates used by the strategy document,  however, and Office of Management and Budget officials told us in 2006  that the agencies needed to have sufficiently reliable data before they  could publish a strategy with long-term funding estimates. Since that time,  the agencies have continued to improve their data by nearly completing  their LANDFIRE and FPA projects, laying important groundwork for  future progress. Our 2008 review of FPA, however, recognized that  although FPA represented a significant step forward and showed promise  in meeting several of its objectives, it had limited ability to examine the  long-term effects of differing funding allocation strategies\u2014a shortcoming  that could limit FPA\u2019s ability to contribute to the agencies\u2019 development of  a cohesive strategy. In addition, the agencies\u2019 abilities to develop  effective long-term options for reducing fuels will improve if they succeed  in their current efforts to measure the effectiveness and durability of  different fuel reduction treatments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establish a Cost- Containment Strategy", "paragraphs": ["We reported in 2007 that although the Forest Service and the Interior  agencies had taken several steps intended to help contain wildland fire  costs, they had not clearly defined their cost-containment goals or  developed a strategy for achieving those goals\u2014steps that are  fundamental to sound program management. Since our 2007 review, the  agencies have continued to implement individual cost-containment steps,  including the wildland fire decision support system and updated guidance  for implementing the federal wildland fire management policy, but they  have yet to develop clear cost-containment goals or a strategy for  achieving them, as we recommended in our 2007 report. Without such  goals and a strategy, we believe the agencies will have difficulty  determining whether they are taking the most important steps first, as well  as the extent to which the steps they are taking will help contain costs.", "The Forest Service and Interior generally disagreed with the  characterization of many of our 2007 findings. In particular, they identified  several agency documents\u2014including the 2001 Review and Update of the  1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and their 10-year  strategy to implement the National Fire Plan\u2014that they argued clearly  define goals and objectives and that make up their strategy to contain  costs. Although the documents cited by the agencies provide overarching  goals and objectives, they lack the clarity and specificity needed by land  management and firefighting officials in the field to help manage and  contain wildland fire costs. Interagency policy, for example, established an  overarching goal of suppressing wildland fires at minimum cost,  considering firefighter and public safety and the importance of resources  being protected, but the agencies have established neither clear criteria by  which to weigh the relative importance of the often-competing elements of  this broad goal, nor measurable objectives by which to determine if the  agencies are meeting the goal. As a result, despite improvements the  agencies continue to make to policy, decision-support tools, and oversight,  we believe that managers in the field lack a clear understanding of the  relative importance that the agencies\u2019 leadership places on containing  costs and\u2014as we concluded in our 2007 report\u2014are therefore likely to  continue to select firefighting strategies without due consideration of the  costs of suppression. Forest Service officials told us in July 2009 that  although they are concerned about fire management costs, they are  emphasizing the need to select firefighting strategies on the basis of land  management objectives and reducing unnecessary risks to firefighters, an  emphasis that, in the long run, may also help contain costs. Nonetheless,  we continue to believe that our recommendations, if effectively  implemented, would help the agencies better manage their cost- containment efforts and improve their ability to contain wildland fire  costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clearly Define Financial Responsibilities for Fires That Cross Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, we reported that federal and nonfederal officials had concerns  about how costs for suppressing fires that burn across federal, state, and  local jurisdictions were shared among federal and nonfederal entities and  that these concerns may reflect a more fundamental issue\u2014that those  entities had not clearly defined their financial responsibilities for wildland  fire suppression, particularly those for the often costly efforts to protect  the wildland-urban interface. Nonfederal entities\u2014including state  forestry entities and tribal, county, city, and rural fire departments\u2014play  an important role in protecting communities and resources and  responding to fires. We reported in 2006, however, that federal officials  were concerned that the existing framework for sharing suppression costs  among federal and nonfederal entities, coupled with the availability of  federal emergency assistance, insulated state and local governments  from the cost of providing wildland fire protection in the wildland-urban  interface. As a result, state and local governments had less incentive to  adopt laws (such as building codes requiring fire-resistant building  materials in areas at high risk of wildland fire) that, in the long run, could  help reduce the cost of suppressing wildland fires. We therefore  recommended that the federal agencies work with relevant state entities to  develop more-specific guidance as to when particular cost-sharing  methods should be used and to clarify their respective financial  responsibility for fires that burn, or threaten to burn, across multiple  jurisdictions. The agencies have updated their guidance on when  particular cost-sharing methods should be used, although we have not  evaluated the effect of this guidance. Still, the agencies have yet to clarify  the financial responsibility for fires that threaten multiple jurisdictions.", "Our 2006 report identified two primary ambiguities regarding financial  responsibilities for fire suppression.", "Federal wildland fire management policy states that protecting structures  is the responsibility of state, tribal, and local entities but it also states that,  under a formal fire protection agreement specifying the financial  responsibilities of each entity, federal agencies can assist nonfederal  entities to protect the exterior of structures threatened by wildland fire.  Forest Service guidance defines actions to protect the exterior of  structures to include removing fuels in the vicinity of structures and  spraying water or retardant on structures or surrounding vegetation.  Federal and nonfederal officials agreed that federal agencies can assist  with such actions, but they did not agree on which entities are responsible  for bearing the costs. Federal officials told us that the purpose of this  policy is to allow federal agencies to use their personnel and equipment to  help protect homes but not to bear the financial responsibility of providing  that protection. Nonfederal officials, however, said that these actions are  intended to keep a wildland fire from reaching structures, and financial  responsibility should therefore be shared between both federal and  nonfederal entities. The Forest Service developed new \u201cstructure  protection principles\u201d in 2009, but these principles do not clarify the  financial responsibilities for suppression actions intended to protect  structures.", "The presence of structures adjacent to federal lands can substantially alter  fire suppression strategies and raise costs. A previous report and agency  officials have questioned which entities are financially responsible for  suppression actions taken on federal lands but intended primarily or  exclusively to protect adjacent wildland-urban interface areas. Fire  managers typically use existing roads and geographic features, such as  rivers and ridgelines, as firebreaks to help contain wildland fires. If,  however, homes and other structures are located between a fire and such  natural firebreaks, firefighters may have to construct other firebreaks and  rely more than they would otherwise on aircraft to drop fire retardant to  protect the structures, thereby increasing suppression costs. Nonfederal  officials in several states questioned the appropriateness of assigning to  nonfederal entities the costs for suppression actions taken on federal  lands. They said that an accumulation of fuels on federal lands is resulting  in more-severe wildland fires and contributing to the increased cost of fire  suppression. They also said that federal agencies are responsible for  keeping wildland fires from burning off federal land and should therefore  bear the costs of doing so. Federal officials recognized this responsibility,  but some also said that with the growing awareness that wildland fires are  inevitable in many parts of the country, policy should recognize that  wildland fires will occur and are likely to burn across jurisdictional  boundaries. In their view, those who own property in areas at risk of  wildland fires share a portion of the financial responsibility for protecting  it. Previous federal agency reports have also recognized this issue and  called for clarifying financial responsibility for such actions.", "Agency officials, in conjunction with officials from nonfederal entities,  including the National Association of State Foresters, have initiated an  effort intended to help clarify federal and nonfederal financial  responsibilities, although it is too early to determine if the effort will  succeed. Yet the continuing expansion of the wildland-urban interface and  the rising costs for protecting these areas make resolving these issues ever  more urgent. Unless the financial responsibilities for multijurisdictional  fires are clarified, the concerns that the existing framework insulates  nonfederal entities from the cost of protecting the wildland-urban  interface from fire\u2014and that the federal government therefore continues  to bear more than its share of that cost\u2014are unlikely to be addressed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigate Effects of Rising Fire Costs on Other Agency Programs", "paragraphs": ["Rising wildland fire costs have led the Forest Service and the Interior  agencies to transfer funds from other programs to help pay for fire  suppression. The year-to-year variability in the number, location, and  severity of fires makes it difficult to estimate needed suppression funds  accurately, and when appropriated funds are insufficient to cover actual  suppression expenditures, the agencies are authorized to use funds from  their other programs to pay for emergency firefighting activities. We  reported in 2004 that from 1999 through 2003, the agencies transferred  more than $2.7 billion from these other programs. The Forest Service  transferred funds from numerous programs, including construction and  maintenance; the national forest system; and state and private forestry  programs that provide grants to states, tribes, communities, and private  landowners for fire and insect management, among other purposes.  Interior transferred funds primarily from its construction and land  acquisition programs. We have not examined this issue in detail since our  2004 report, but in 2009 we testified that funding transfers continued, with  the agencies transferring funds in fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008.", "Although the agencies received additional appropriations to cover, on  average, about 80 percent of the funds transferred, we found that the  transfers caused the agencies to cancel or delay some projects and fail to  fulfill certain commitments to their nonfederal partners. We reported, for  example, that funding transfers delayed planned construction and land  acquisition projects, which in some cases led to higher project costs due to  revised budget and construction plans or higher supply and land  acquisition costs. In one instance, the Forest Service delayed purchasing a  65-acre property in Arizona that it had planned to acquire for  approximately $3.2 million in 2002; it was able to purchase the property  about a year later, but the cost of the property had increased by $195,000.  Also, although funds were transferred to help the agencies suppress  wildland fires, among the delayed projects were ones to reduce fuels to  lower the fire risk to communities, construct new firefighting facilities,  and provide firefighting training courses.", "To help the agencies address the impacts of funding transfers on other  agency programs, we recommended in 2004 that they take a number of  steps, including improving their methods for estimating annual  suppression costs. Typically, the agencies base their estimates of needed  suppression funding on the 10-year rolling average of fire costs\u2014a  method with known problems. Although we noted in our 2004 report that  better estimates of the costs of suppressing fires in a given year would  reduce the likelihood that the agencies would need to transfer funds from  other accounts, the agencies continue to use the 10-year rolling average as  the foundation of their budget requests. Interior stated at the time that it  believed that the 10-year average was a \u201creasonable and durable basis for  suppression budgeting.\u201d The Forest Service, however, concurred with our  recommendation. Nevertheless, a Forest Service official told us in 2008  that the agency had analyzed alternative methods for estimating needed  suppression funds but determined that no better method was available.  While we recognize that the accuracy of the 10-year average is likely to  improve as recent years with higher suppression costs are included in that  average, the need to transfer funds in each of the last 3 years suggests that  the agencies should continue to seek a more accurate method for  estimating needed suppression costs.", "In addition to the actions we believe the agencies need to take, we have  also suggested that Congress consider legislating alternative approaches to  funding wildland fire suppression that could help reduce the need for the  agencies to transfer funds. As we reported in 2004, for example, Congress  could consider alternative funding approaches for wildland fire  suppression, including establishing a reserve account that the agencies  could access when their suppression accounts are depleted. Such an  account could provide either a specified amount (a definite appropriation)  or as much funding as the agencies need to fund emergency suppression  (an indefinite appropriation).", "Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. Establishing a reserve  account with a definite appropriation would provide the agencies with  incentives to contain suppression costs within the amount in the reserve  account, but depending on the size of the appropriation and the severity of  a fire season, suppression costs could still exceed the funds reserved, and  the agencies might still need to transfer funds from other programs. An  account with an indefinite appropriation, in contrast, would eliminate the  need for transferring funds from other programs but would offer no  inherent incentives for the agencies to contain suppression costs.  Furthermore, both definite and indefinite appropriations could raise the  overall federal budget deficit, depending on whether funding levels for  other agency or government programs are reduced. The Federal Land  Assistance, Management, and Enhancement bill would establish a  wildland fire reserve account; the administration\u2019s budget for fiscal year  2010 also proposes a $282 million reserve account for the Forest Service  and a $75 million reserve account for Interior to provide funding for  firefighting when the appropriated 10-year average is exhausted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The agencies responsible for managing wildland fires on federal lands  have unquestionably improved their understanding of the nation\u2019s  wildland fire problem and have positioned themselves to respond to fire  more effectively.
