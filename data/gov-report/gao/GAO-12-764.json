These examples cannot be generalized beyond those presented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2010, 117,000 individuals received concurrent cash benefit payments from the Disability Insurance (DI) and Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs of more than $850 million, which is allowable in certain circumstances under current program authority. While these individuals represented less than 1 percent of the total beneficiaries of both programs, the cash benefits they received totaled over $281 million from DI and more than $575 million from UI. One individual GAO selected for further investigation received over $62,000 in overlapping benefits in a year. Based on GAO inquiries, state UI officials are reviewing the person\u0092s UI eligibility because of earnings that may be related to work that makes the person ineligible for UI benefits.", "Under certain circumstances, individuals may be eligible for concurrent cash benefit payments due to differences in DI and UI eligibility requirements. Specifically, the Social Security Administration\u0092s (SSA) definition of a disability involves work that does not rise to the level of substantial gainful activity (SGA). In 2010, a monthly income of $1,000 or more for a non-blind beneficiary generally demonstrated SGA. In contrast, the Department of Labor allows states\u0092 determination of \u0093able and available for work\u0094 eligibility criteria for UI benefits to include work that does not rise to the level of SGA. Therefore, some individuals may have a disability under federal law but still be eligible for UI under state law because they are able and available for work that does not rise to the level of SGA. Although DI and UI generally provide separate services to separate populations\u0097and thus are not overlapping programs\u0097the concurrent cash benefit payments for individuals eligible for both programs are an overlapping benefit when both replace lost earnings. While SSA must reduce DI benefits for individuals receiving certain other government disability benefits, such as worker\u0092s compensation, no federal law authorizes an automatic reduction or elimination of overlapping DI and UI benefits. As a result, neither SSA nor DOL has any processes to identify these overlapping payments. Reducing or eliminating overlapping or improper payments could offer substantial savings, though actual savings are difficult to estimate because the potential costs of establishing mechanisms to do so are not readily available."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DOL should work with SSA to (1) evaluate overlapping DI and UI cash benefit payments, taking appropriate action for any improper payments, and (2) assess whether cost savings or other benefits might be achieved by reducing or eliminating overlapping DI and UI cash benefit payments being made within the existing laws and regulations, seeking congressional authority to do so as appropriate. DOL and SSA agreed with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Both the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Unemployment  Insurance (UI) trust funds face serious fiscal-sustainability challenges.  The Social Security Board of Trustees projects that the DI trust fund will  be exhausted in 2016 and notes that changes designed to improve the  financial status of the DI program are needed soon. In fiscal year 2010,  more than 10 million beneficiaries received DI cash benefits. Total  benefit payments for fiscal year 2010 were $121.6 billion, and the aging of  the baby-boom generation is set to further strain the program. Similarly,  we reported in April 2010 that state UI trust funds were at historically  weak levels, with most requiring federal loans to pay benefits. In fiscal  year 2010, 11.3 million beneficiaries received UI cash benefits totaling  $156 billion, $93 billion of which was paid by the federal government.", "In addition to other services, the DI and UI programs both provide cash  benefits to their targeted populations to replace lost earnings. The DI  program, which is administered by the Social Security Administration  (SSA), provides cash benefits to replace earnings for workers who are  unable to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of physical  or mental impairments expected to last at least 12 months or expected to  result in death. SGA is defined as work activity that involves significant  physical or mental activities performed for pay or profit. The federal-state  UI program, which is federally administered by the Department of Labor  (DOL), provides temporary cash benefits to eligible workers who are able  to work but remain involuntarily unemployed.", "In response to your request, we determined the extent to which  individuals received DI and UI benefits concurrently by comparing  disability benefit files to national records of work-related income and  unemployment insurance. Under certain circumstances, individuals can  legitimately receive DI and UI concurrently, but concurrent receipt could  also be an indicator of improper payments. Although excluded from the  scope of this report, we plan to conduct subsequent work to evaluate the  internal controls of the DI program.", "To determine the extent to which individuals received both DI and UI  benefits in fiscal year 2010, we matched the National Directory of New  Hires (NDNH) unemployment files with our extracts of SSA disability files  of DI beneficiaries as of December 2010, the most current data at the  time we began our work. To determine the subset of recipients who  received DI and UI benefits at the same time during fiscal year 2010, we  identified individuals who received DI benefits in all 3 months of the  quarter for which they received UI benefits. For example, to be  considered in receipt of overlapping DI and UI benefits under our criteria,  an individual must have records in SSA disability files indicating the  monthly receipt of DI benefits in January, February, and March of 2010,  and must also have records in the NDNH indicating the quarterly receipt  of UI benefits in the corresponding quarter of fiscal year 2010, which is  the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Because our population of  overlapping DI and UI beneficiaries includes only those individuals who  received DI in all 3 months of the quarter for which the NDNH reports the  receipt of UI, our analysis understates the population of individuals who  received overlapping DI and UI benefits in fiscal year 2010. For example,  individuals who received overlapping DI and UI payments in only 1 or only  2 months of a quarter are not included in our population of individuals  who received overlapping DI and UI benefits in fiscal year 2010. Because  of differences in the timing of DI and UI payments, the amount of  overlapping DI and UI payments for our population is estimated. For each  instance of concurrent DI and UI benefits, we used the monthly DI benefit  amounts in SSA\u2019s disability files and the quarterly UI benefit amounts in  the NDNH to estimate the total amount of overlapping DI and UI benefits  in fiscal year 2010. Our estimate of overlapping DI benefits is understated  because it includes DI benefits payable for only 1 of the 3 months in a  quarter for which an individual also received UI benefits. Thus,  overlapping DI benefits that were payable in more than 1 month of a  quarter are not included in our estimate.", "We also reviewed detailed DI and UI case files for a nongeneralizable  selection of eight individuals who received concurrent DI and UI benefits  to corroborate SSA DI data and UI data in the NDNH. To do this, we drew  a stratified random, nongeneralizable sample of eight individuals from two  different populations. The first four individuals we selected were from a  population comprising the top 50 recipients of concurrent DI and UI  benefits in fiscal year 2010. The second four individuals we selected were  from a population comprising the individuals who appeared to receive  concurrent DI and UI benefits, the latter from multiple states in fiscal year  2010. Because we selected a small number of individuals for further  investigation, the results cannot be projected to the population of  individuals receiving concurrent DI and UI benefits. For these eight  individuals, we obtained DI information from SSA and UI information from  state UI offices to determine the total amount of DI and UI benefits  received from 2008 to April 2012, the time frame for those benefits, and  any applicable employment information that illustrate instances of  individuals receiving concurrent DI and UI benefits. Although identifying  improper payments was not the primary purpose of this audit, some  individuals we selected for further review received improper DI or UI  payments.", "To determine the reliability of the SSA disability records and NDNH UI  records, we reviewed documentation related to these databases and  interviewed officials responsible for compiling and maintaining relevant DI  and UI data. In addition, we performed electronic testing to determine the  validity of specific data elements in the databases that we used to  perform our work. We also reviewed detailed DI and UI case files for the  nongeneralizable selection of eight individuals selected as described  above who received concurrent DI and UI benefits to corroborate SSA DI  data and UI data in the NDNH. On the basis of our discussions with  agency officials and our own testing, we concluded that the data elements  used for this report were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2011 through July  2012 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

An individual is eligible to receive DI benefits if he or  she has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that (1)  has lasted (or is expected to last) at least 1 year or is expected to result in  death and (2) prevents the individual from engaging in SGA. SGA is  defined as work activity that involves significant physical or mental  activities performed for pay or profit. For individuals whose impairment is  anything other than blindness, earnings averaging over $1,000 a month  for calendar year 2010 generally demonstrate SGA. For blind individuals,  earnings averaging over $1,640 a month for the year 2010 generally  demonstrate SGA for DI. The amount of earnings that generally  demonstrates SGA can vary from year to year. For example, the SGA  amount for individuals with disabilities, other than blindness, was $980 in  2009. Individuals with disabilities must also have a specified number of  recent work credits under the Social Security program at the onset of  medical impairment. An individual may qualify on the basis of the work  record of a deceased spouse or the work record of a parent who is  deceased, retired, or considered eligible for disability benefits, meaning  one disability beneficiary can generate multiple monthly disability  payments.", "DI benefits are financed by payroll taxes paid into the Federal Disability  Insurance Trust Fund by covered workers and their employers, on the  basis of each worker\u2019s earnings history. Cash benefits are payable  monthly, as long as the worker remains eligible for benefits, until the  worker reaches full retirement age or dies. In fiscal year 2010, more than  10 million beneficiaries received DI benefits totaling $121.6 billion, and  the program\u2019s average monthly benefit was about $922. As directed by  federal law, SSA must reduce DI benefits for individuals receiving certain  other government disability benefits, such as worker\u2019s compensation.  However, SSA may not reduce DI benefits for individuals receiving UI or  for individuals earning less than SGA.

To be eligible for UI  benefits, unemployed workers must meet eligibility requirements  established by state laws that conform to federal law, including that they  have worked recently, be involuntarily unemployed, and be able and  available for work. Whereas federal statutes and regulations provide  broad guidelines on UI eligibility, the specifics of UI eligibility are  determined by each state. According to DOL, all states require that a  claimant must have earned a specified amount of wages, worked a  certain number of weeks in covered employment, or must have met some  combination of the wage and employment requirements within his/her  base period. To be eligible for benefits, claimants must also be free from  disqualification for acts such as voluntary leaving without good cause,  discharge for misconduct connected with the work, and refusal of suitable  work. In addition to these eligibility requirements, all states require that a  claimant must be able and available for work. However, \u201cable and  available for work\u201d requirements vary among the states, according to  DOL. For example, a few states specify that a worker must be physically  able, or mentally and physically able, to work. Likewise, while some  states require that a worker must be available for work, other states  require that a worker must be available for suitable work; still other states  require that a worker be available for work in the worker\u2019s usual  occupation or for work in which the worker is reasonably fitted by training  and experience. According to DOL, in addition to being able and available  for work, all states require by law or by practice that a worker be actively  seeking work or making a reasonable effort to obtain work.

These taxes are deposited in the appropriate accounts within the Unemployment Trust Fund, which consists of 53 state accounts  and other federal accounts dedicated to special purposes. The severity  and length of the recent recession, and the slow pace of recovery, have  placed a heavy demand on state UI trust funds, resulting in very large  numbers of workers receiving benefits for very long periods of time. Since  mid-2008, Congress and the states have temporarily extended the period  of time that displaced workers can receive UI benefits to up to 99 weeks,  though the maximum number of weeks of available benefits varies among  the states.

We define overlaps as programs that have similar  goals, devise similar strategies and activities to achieve those goals, or  target similar users. Our prior work on overlapping government programs has found that, in some instances, overlapping programs or  activities have led to inefficiencies, and we have determined that greater  efficiencies or effectiveness might be achievable.

Similarly,  some individuals receiving UI benefits may be receiving improper DI  payments because they no longer have a disability as defined by SSA.  Specifically, being \u201cable and available\u201d for work may indicate that an  individual\u2019s medical condition no longer prevents him or her from  performing work that rises to the level of SGA.
