GAO analyzed data on intercity passenger rail performance and studied reform efforts in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The existing intercity passenger rail system is in poor financial condition and the current structure does not effectively target federal funds to where they provide the greatest public benefits, such as transportation congestion relief. Routes of 750 miles or more, while providing service for some rural areas and connections between regions, show limited public benefits for dollars expended. These routes account for 15 percent of riders but 80 percent of financial losses. \"Corridor\" routes (generally less than 500 miles in length) have higher ridership, perform better financially, and appear to offer greater potential for public benefits. The countries GAO studied varied in their reform approach, but their experience shows the United States needs to consider three key elements in attempting any reform: (1) define national policy goals, (2) define the roles of government and other participants, and (3) establish stable funding. Countries found these elements important in setting the role of passenger rail in the national transportation system and increasing the benefit from investing in passenger rail. Currently, however, the United States is not well positioned to address these key elements. The goals or expected outcomes of intercity passenger rail policies are ambiguous, participants' roles are unclear, and there is widespread disagreement about the level of funding to devote to this effort. Amtrak is taking actions within its authority to reduce costs and increase efficiency, but Amtrak is not in a position to address all key elements. To undertake reform, federal leadership is needed. Addressing key elements of reform poses many challenges, because those who have a stake in the process have divergent goals or points of view. Amtrak workers, freight railroads that own much of the rail system over which passenger trains operate, and federal and state governments would be among those affected. The diversity of viewpoints poses challenges for determining both the overall goal for passenger rail in the United States and the federal role in achieving this goal. Funding-related challenges include identifying how to pay for achieving these goals and how to overcome disadvantages intercity passenger rail faces relative to leveraging of federal funds. Although federal-state cost sharing is common in highway and transit programs, states face difficulty leveraging their expenditures on rail service. There are four main options for the federal role in intercity passenger rail service: (1) keep the existing structure and funding, (2) make incremental changes to improve financial or operational performance, (3) discontinue federal involvement, or (4) fundamentally restructure the system. Each option has advantages and disadvantages, and each faces its own challenges. Each requires some level of federal funding, a clear articulation of expected goals, and, except for the status quo option, substantial time to implement. Of these options, the fourth--fundamental restructuring--would allow for effectively integrating rail into the national transportation system and substantially improving overall performance and accountability."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The future of intercity passenger rail service in the United States has come  to a critical juncture. The National Railroad Passenger Corporation  (Amtrak) continues to rely heavily on federal subsidies\u2014over $1 billion  annually in recent years\u2014and operating losses have remained high. In  addition, Amtrak will require billions of dollars to address deferred  maintenance and achieve a \u201cstate of good repair.\u201d These needs for Amtrak  come at a time when the nation faces long-term fiscal challenges. As we  reported in February 2005, the federal government\u2019s financial condition and  long-term fiscal outlook present enormous challenges to the nation\u2019s ability  to respond to emerging forces reshaping American society, the United  States\u2019 place in the world, and the future role of the federal government.  Addressing the projected fiscal gaps will require policy makers to examine  the affordability and sustainability of all existing programs, policies,  functions, and activities throughout the federal budget.", "Our February 2005 report outlines some of the criteria that should be  considered in reexamining the future federal role toward intercity  passenger rail in this country. These criteria include: (1) the relevance of  and purpose for the federal role, (2) measures of success, (3) targeted  benefits, and (4) the affordability and cost effectiveness of federal  expenditures. A reexamination will include asking questions such as: Does  intercity passenger rail have a clear federal role and mission? Does  intercity passenger rail have outcome-based performance measures? Do  intercity passenger rail expenditures target areas with the greatest needs  and least capacity? Do federal expenditures and investments encourage  state and local governments, and the private sector, to invest resources? Do  these expenditures appear affordable and sustainable in the long term?  Considering the performance of the current system relative to all these  factors will be critical in deciding the future of intercity passenger rail, the  federal role in intercity passenger rail, and how intercity passenger rail is  structured, operated, and funded in the United States.", "Reexamining the federal role and expenditures on intercity passenger rail  service will be particularly difficult because of the divergent opinions about  what this service should be. Some advocate a greatly expanded federal role  and the expansion of intercity passenger rail to relieve growing congestion  on highways and airways and (as energy prices increase) to provide more  fuel-efficient transport; others believe the federal role should be scaled  back, and that at least some federal operating subsidies should be  eliminated. Specific proposals vary\u2014while one proposal would keep  Amtrak largely intact and provide more funding for capital and other  improvements, another proposal would significantly restructure the  management and accountability for intercity passenger rail with regional,  state, and local entities making fundamental decisions about what intercity  passenger rail services are justified and will receive public financial  support. Amtrak itself has proposed a new vision for intercity passenger  rail service that would include a greater role for states in planning and  developing passenger rail corridors. The acting president of Amtrak told us  that, in his view, Amtrak itself is not a substitute for a national intercity  passenger rail policy and that Congress needs to develop such a policy. One  of the primary difficulties in developing a clear national intercity passenger  rail policy will be reconciling the wide diversity of views about what  intercity passenger rail service should be and what it should achieve.", "To assist Congress as it assesses the future of intercity passenger rail  service in the U. S., and the federal role in such service, you asked us to  identify critical issues and options that Congress should consider in  deciding the future federal role. In response to your request, this report  addresses the following:  the characteristics of the current U.S. intercity passenger rail system  and the potential benefits obtained from this system;  foreign experiences with passenger rail reform and observations for the   how well the United States is positioned for reforming its intercity   challenges the United States faces in overcoming obstacles to reform;   potential options for the future of intercity passenger rail service.", "To address these issues, we collected information on the characteristics of  Amtrak\u2019s routes, including ridership, costs, and the extent of public  subsidies provided on routes. We conducted extensive analyses of both  long-distance routes and short-distance corridor routes. We analyzed data  on passenger demographics, financial performance, on-time performance,  and connectivity between routes, and synthesized the results to determine  the actual and potential benefits provided by both types of routes. We also  collected and analyzed data on passenger rail operations and restructuring  efforts in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom (U.K.).", "This included interviews with government and private sector officials in  these countries, and reviews of passenger-rail-related policies and funding.  We interviewed officials from Amtrak as well as the Federal Railroad  Administration (FRA), states, various travel and tour associations, rail  labor unions, freight railroads, and the operator of a luxury passenger rail  service in the United States. We also compared Amtrak\u2019s current  accountability and financial reporting mechanisms to the basic  requirements and practices for federal entities and public companies in the  United States. Finally, we reviewed studies on passenger rail reform efforts  around the world and consulted with international rail experts  knowledgeable about passenger rail reform efforts.

Today, Amtrak continues to be the main provider of  intercity passenger rail service in the United States, operating a 22,000-mile  network that provides service to 46 states and Washington, D.C., primarily  over tracks owned by freight railroads. Federal law requires that freight  railroads typically give Amtrak trains priority access and, in general, charge  Amtrak the incremental cost\u2014rather than the full cost\u2014associated with  the use of their tracks. Amtrak also owns about 650 miles of track,  primarily on the Northeast Corridor (NEC), which runs between Boston,  Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C. Access to this corridor is also critical  for the operations of nine commuter railroads run by state and local  governments serving 1.2 million passengers each work day. According to  Amtrak, four freight railroads also use the corridor each day. Amtrak  employs about 19,000 people.", "The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 gave Amtrak significant  flexibility with respect to its route system, but directed it to continue to  operate \u201ca national passenger rail transportation system which ties  together existing and emergent regional rail passenger service and other  intermodal passenger service.\u201d To meet this mandate, Amtrak currently  operates 41 intercity passenger rail routes that fall into two distinct types,  long-distance routes and short-distance corridors (see fig. 1). There are 14  long-distance routes, which generally travel over 750 miles and include an  overnight component. Twenty-seven routes are short distance, or  \u201ccorridor\u201d services, and are further classified into two distinct categories.  The first is the NEC. According to Amtrak, about two-thirds of its ridership  is either wholly or partially on this corridor. The second category of  corridor service is primarily comprised of routes partly funded by states,  but also includes several other routes that Amtrak continues to operate as  part of the original or \u201clegacy\u201d system. These corridor services have  several similarities, such as a relatively high frequency of service and route  distances generally under 500 miles.", "The 1997 act also established a Reform Board (to assume the  responsibilities of Amtrak\u2019s Board of Directors) and a Reform Council (to  review and recommend changes in Amtrak's route structure). The act  provided for the Reform Board to serve for 5 years and then be replaced by  a new Amtrak Board of Directors; meanwhile, the Reform Council\u2019s  mandate was to look at \u201cAmtrak\u2019s operation as a national passenger rail  system which provides access to all regions of the country and ties together  existing and emerging rail passenger corridors.\u201d In November 2001, the  Reform Council reported that Amtrak would not achieve operational self- sufficiency by December 2, 2002, as envisioned by the act and, in 2002, the  Reform Council recommended restructuring and rationalizing the national  intercity passenger rail system\u2014a move that envisioned, among other  things, breaking up Amtrak and introducing competition to provide rail  service. As of October 2006, Congress was still considering Amtrak issues,  such as its funding level, the size of its network, the introduction of  competition for routes, and Amtrak restructuring.", "Since Amtrak\u2019s inception, it has struggled to become financially solvent.  Amtrak has run a deficit each year and required federal assistance to cover  operating losses and capital investment. Amtrak has received  approximately $1.2 billion in annual appropriations since fiscal year 2003  for operational support, capital improvements, and debt obligations.  Amtrak, like other intercity transportation systems, is capital-intensive.  From fiscal years 1971 through 2006, Amtrak has received just over $30  billion in federal support, of which about $11 billion has been for  infrastructure improvements and equipment overhauls. Additional capital  funding has also been obtained from state and local governments, generally  for specific capital investments required to support corridor routes  operating within their jurisdiction.", "The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 removed Amtrak from  the list of government corporations under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 9101. While listed,  Amtrak was required to submit annual management reports to Congress  under the Government Corporation Control Act of 1945. Relieved from this  requirement, Amtrak remains a government-established private  corporation which is neither an agency nor instrumentality of the U.S.  government, nor an issuer of securities to the public. Therefore, since 1997,  Amtrak has not been subject to the basic accountability requirements of  either federal entities or public companies. Such requirements cover  financial reporting, internal control, and governance. Through its loan  agreement and grant agreements for operating and capital expenses,  Amtrak is subject to a variety of reporting requirements\u2014including  providing a monthly performance report to its board, the Department of  Transportation (DOT), and Congress; providing FRA with a daily cash  balance report; and providing FRA with a monthly progress report on  actions addressing our previous recommendations. Due to Amtrak\u2019s long- term challenges, several reform proposals and legislation have recently  been introduced to address Amtrak\u2019s financial problems. The suggested  reforms vary in the level of federal subsidies proposed and the extent to  which the current U.S. intercity passenger rail system would be  restructured. Among these proposals is the administration\u2019s 2005 proposal,  which would phase out federal operating subsides for long-distance trains  and split Amtrak into three entities: an oversight company to manage the  restructuring process, a private infrastructure management company, and a  train operating company. This proposal would ultimately give states  greater decision-making authority with respect to rail service and capital  improvements. Conversely, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science,  and Transportation proposed a reauthorization bill in 2005 that would  authorize just under $2 billion per year over a 6-year period to fund  Amtrak\u2019s capital and operating expenses to maintain current operations,  upgrade equipment, and return the NEC to a state of good repair. Although  operating subsidies over the life of this bill would be reduced 40 percent  through cost cutting and other actions, capital funding to Amtrak and  states would increase. See table 1 for key aspects of recent intercity  passenger rail reform proposals and legislation.", "The U.S. system is not the only intercity passenger rail system that has  experienced financial deficits and economic inefficiencies. Many countries  have undertaken efforts to reform their systems in order to alleviate  financial and structural problems. While the intercity passenger rail  experiences of other countries are often cited in the debate over the U.S.  system, there are some key differences between the U.S. system and other  foreign systems, including:  Infrastructure ownership. In the United States, nearly all of the  infrastructure that intercity passenger rail operates on is owned by  private freight rail companies and is located on private land. Although  Amtrak, by law, has a statutory right of access to infrastructure at  incremental cost, it enters into operating agreements with freight and  other railroads to use their lines. In contrast, in most of the countries in  Europe, infrastructure is publicly owned.", "Freight and passenger railroad industry. In addition to owning the  infrastructure, freight rail dominates the rail industry in the United  States. This is a stark contrast to most other countries, where passenger  rail is the primary component of the rail industry and freight plays a  more secondary role.", "Geography and demographics. Geographic and demographic factors  also make the United States significantly different from other countries,  in particular those in Europe and Japan. The United States is relatively  larger geographically than most of these other countries. Europe and  Japan are more compact than the United States, making more intercity  travel by rail between major cities as fast as by air. Additionally, experts  and prior research highlight the greater population density of European  cities\u2014making rail a more attractive option for transportation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing U.S. Intercity Passenger Rail System Is in Poor Financial Condition and Appears to Provide Limited Benefits for Federal Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["The existing U.S. intercity passenger rail system remains in poor financial  condition, characterized by continued high operating losses and substantial  levels of deferred capital and maintenance projects. Moreover, the current  structure does not appear to effectively target federal funds where they  may achieve the greatest level of public benefits. That is, many services  are not focused on the markets where rail may have a comparative  advantage over other modes and is most likely to be a viable and cost- effective option to meet public transportation demands.", "Amtrak operates two types of intercity routes\u2014long distance and  corridors\u2014that provide service to a wide range of passengers across the  country; however, each of these route types exhibit markedly different  financial and operating characteristics. Long-distance routes account for  about 80 percent of Amtrak\u2019s financial losses although they serve about 15  percent of Amtrak\u2019s total ridership, and are characterized by poor on-time  performance. These routes are often associated with a number of public  benefits, including offering service to a number of rural residents and  providing national connectivity; however, these benefits may be limited by  infrequent or inconvenient service and are provided at high cost to the  federal government. In contrast, corridor routes account for most of  Amtrak\u2019s ridership and appear to offer greater potential to provide  passenger transportation benefits and public benefits. For example, these  services tend to be more time- and cost-competitive with other modes of  transportation\u2014potentially mitigating highway and air congestion\u2014and  they offer greater flexibility over long-distance rail services to adapt  schedules and services to the demands of the traveling public. While  several challenges related to funding and capacity constraints exist,  corridors appear to be where the comparative strength for intercity  passenger rail services lies and where the greatest potential exists for rail  to provide increased public benefits for federal expenditures.

Amtrak continues to incur substantial operating deficits and is faced with  billions of dollars in deferred capital maintenance and debt obligations. No  combination of service cuts or productivity improvements can fully  eliminate the need for public operating and capital subsidies, particularly if  Congress continues to mandate that Amtrak operate a national system.

Although Amtrak has made some progress in  containing operating expenses in recent years, it continues to run an  annual operating deficit (total operating revenues minus operating  expenses) of over $1 billion dollars and relies heavily on federal subsidies  to cover this deficit. In fiscal year 2005, Amtrak reported a net operating  loss of $1.2 billion, including an annual cash loss of $450 million (see fig.  2). Although exhibiting a slight decrease from the record deficit in fiscal  year 2004, operating losses have shown few signs of substantial long-term  improvement. In fact, Amtrak projected in its 2005\u20132009 Strategic Plan  that, under the existing structure, annual operating losses will increase to  over $1.5 billion by 2009.", "While Amtrak has experienced a steady increase in ridership over the last  decade, there has not been a corresponding increase in total annual  revenues. Between fiscal years 2002 and 2005, passenger revenues  remained relatively stable\u2014declining from $1.34 billion to $1.29 billion (3.3  percent)\u2014despite growth in annual ridership of nearly 2 million passengers  during this period, an increase of 8.2 percent (see fig. 3). These results  suggest that it is unlikely that Amtrak can grow its way out of financial  difficulty through additional increases in ridership. Further, these trends of  continued high operating losses and stagnating passenger revenues,  despite a number of cost-cutting efforts, have led the DOT Inspector  General and others to conclude that Amtrak also cannot \u201csave its way to  financial health\u201d and\u2014in the absence of increased federal funding\u2014may  require long-term structural operating reforms.", "In addition to the burden of its annual operating deficit, the intercity  passenger rail system is faced with substantial financial obligations related  to capital repairs and infrastructure maintenance, as well as accumulated  debt. Both of these obligations have received substantial federal subsidies  each year and are likely to continue affecting the financial outlook of  Amtrak into the foreseeable future.", "Capital needs and deferred maintenance. Lacking the funds to  complete all of its identified capital repair and maintenance projects,  Amtrak has deferred an estimated $6 billion in capital and infrastructure  maintenance spending. In addition to increasing the risk of a major  failure on the system, the deteriorated condition of Amtrak\u2019s rolling  stock and infrastructure may contribute to higher operating costs and  reduced reliability of service. Further, over 60 percent of this deferred  maintenance is attributable to Amtrak\u2019s mainstay NEC service.  Disruptions of service on this corridor, due to needed repairs or safety  concerns, would have significant financial impacts. While Amtrak has  identified the restoration of rail infrastructure to a state of good repair  as one of its primary goals, the cost and extent of the needed  improvements remain a significant burden to the financial viability of  the existing intercity passenger rail system. Although the level of federal  capital funding has increased in recent years, there remains a  fundamental mismatch between the level of investment Amtrak and the  DOT Office of Inspector General (DOT OIG) have estimated is needed to  maintain the existing network and the amount of funding provided. For  example, in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, Amtrak identified capital funding  needs of nearly $800 million dollars annually; however, actual funds  appropriated for capital projects in those years totaled $369 million and  $495 million, respectively.", "Debt obligations. Significant federal funds are also spent each year to  service Amtrak\u2019s substantial debt burden. At the end of fiscal year 2005,  Amtrak carried a total of $3.6 billion in debt and capital lease  obligations. Principal and interest payments on these accumulated  debts is estimated at $295 million for fiscal year 2007 and will likely  remain at about this level for the foreseeable future. These payments  accounted for over 20 percent of Amtrak\u2019s total federal appropriation  for fiscal year 2006 and, in light of Amtrak\u2019s other financial obligations,  are likely to continue to require funding from other sources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Funding", "paragraphs": ["Given high annual deficits, deferred capital spending, and debt obligations,  the current levels of federal subsidies are likely insufficient to maintain the  existing level of passenger rail service being provided by Amtrak.

For  example, Amtrak submitted budget requests of approximately $1.8 billion  for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. However, the average amount of federal  funding received over this period totaled about $1.24 billion per year\u2014 enough to keep the system operating but not enough to meet the level  Amtrak estimated is needed to prevent the continued deferral of significant  maintenance projects (see fig. 4).

This figure represents approximately  15 percent of Amtrak\u2019s total reported ridership of 25.4 million passengers in  fiscal year 2005. Since many of these passengers travel longer distances  than passengers on corridor routes, long-distance routes accounted for 47  percent (2.5 billion) of Amtrak\u2019s total of 5.4 billion passenger miles in fiscal  year 2005. However, many of the trips taken on these routes are for  relatively shorter distances as opposed to end-to-end trips, with riders  often traveling between city pairs on existing Amtrak corridors or planned  corridor routes. For example, the DOT OIG issued a statement in 2003  which estimated that the share of trips taken on long-distance routes that  were corridor in nature was 34 percent. In fiscal year 2005, nearly 30  percent of all trips on long-distance routes were for fewer than 300 miles  and 46 percent were for fewer than 500 miles (see fig. 5). In this regard,  many passenger trips on long-distance routes may be similar to those on  Amtrak\u2019s corridor services, where rail service is more likely to be time- and  cost-competitive with other modes of intercity transportation.

This figure also accounts for nearly 95 percent of the  total federal appropriated operating grant of $570 million provided to  Amtrak for that year. Based on data provided by Amtrak, operating losses  on long-distance routes averaged $154 per passenger with considerable  variation illustrated between the individual routes. Financial performance  over the past several years also indicates that Amtrak is unlikely to  substantially reduce these losses through increased revenue or cost  reductions. Between fiscal years 2002 and 2005, Amtrak reported a nearly  30 percent decline in annual long distance revenue. However, during this  time period, operating costs decreased only about 9 percent. As a result,  the budget gap between revenues and costs shows no sign of improvement  (see fig. 6).", "Contributing to the high operating losses on many of Amtrak\u2019s long- distance trains are the costs of extra services and amenities, such as  sleeper services and dining cars. While these auxiliary services generate  additional revenue over coach-class seats, the additional revenues do not  cover incremental costs. In fact, passengers traveling in first-class sleeper  cabins on Amtrak long-distance trains are actually more heavily subsidized  than coach passengers. The DOT OIG estimated that sleeper services  increase the operational loss over coach class seats by an average of $109  per passenger. When capital costs for providing such services are also  included, these additional losses average $206, with losses on some routes  as high as $358 per passenger (see app. II). Amtrak is currently evaluating  several alternatives to their existing sleeper services in an aim to eliminate  incremental financial losses.

Intercity bus  and air services have the deepest penetration within rural America\u2014at 89  and 71 percent of the population, respectively\u2014and rail services were  reported to cover approximately 42 percent of the rural population. While  many of these residents have access to more than one transportation  option, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics estimated that intercity  passenger rail (i.e., Amtrak) is the sole public transportation option for  approximately 350,000 people nationwide. Georgia and South Carolina  were reported as the two states with the largest number of rural residents  (with a combined total of 94,000) that were solely dependent on scheduled  intercity passenger rail. In contrast, scheduled intercity air and bus services  provide the sole transportation option for 2.4 million and 14.4 million rural  residents nationwide, respectively. In addition, it appears that if rural  transportation were a targeted public policy objective, other modes of  transport could be better positioned to provide this benefit to a greater  number of residents at lower cost. For example, in fiscal year 2004, federal  grants available to the intercity bus industry to support rural service  amounted to just $22 million, with rural coverage for that mode exceeding  twice the level provided by rail. However, as the DOT reported in 2005, the  goal of rural mobility should be to offer flexible and sustainable travel  options to those with the greatest mobility needs\u2014and not necessarily to  preserve or promote use of any specific transportation mode. Achieving  this goal may require the establishment of objective criteria by which to  evaluate the needs of these communities. It may also require the awarding  of competitive franchise agreements to whatever mode that could provide  service with the least amount of subsidy.", "Intercity passenger rail also provides connectivity between different  regions of the country and other rail routes; however, alternatives may  exist to meet passenger demands at reduced cost. Federal law currently  directs Amtrak to tie together existing and emerging regional rail passenger  service. On a system wide basis, relatively few passenger trips (8 percent)  include a train-to-train connection\u2014that is, a passenger changing from one  train to another. However, on long-distance routes the percentage of train- to-train connections is somewhat higher (an estimated 22.6 percent in  fiscal year 2004). Consequently, national interconnectivity provided by  long-distance routes appears to be a potential benefit to approximately 3.5  percent of Amtrak\u2019s total annual passengers. While this population is a very  small proportion of the overall intercity passenger market, some rail  proponents believe national connectivity may also provide public benefits  by providing transportation redundancy to the country. Such redundancy  may be important, particularly if air services were grounded as they were in  the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  However, to the extent that transportation redundancy is a meaningful  policy option, intercity passenger rail may not be positioned to provide  cost-effective service to the greatest number of people. As previously cited,  intercity buses currently provide much greater coverage across the United  States without federal operating assistance. Therefore, determining  whether these public benefits warrant federal subsidies involves  consideration of the substantial costs required to achieve them, as well as  evaluation of alternative options, such as intercity buses, that may be better  positioned to provide these benefits.", "Amtrak\u2019s long-distance services are often infrequent and hindered by poor  on-time performance, which may further diminish the benefits provided by  these services and offer reduced potential to meet the public\u2019s  transportation demands. For example, nearly all of the long-distance trains  have limited frequencies\u2014typically one daily departure in each direction\u2014 and, due to increased travel times, they are often scheduled to arrive  outside of convenient traveling hours. For example, many of Amtrak\u2019s  long-distance trains operating within Georgia and South Carolina\u2014the  states with the most rural residents dependent solely on rail\u2014are  scheduled to arrive at the station between 3:20 a.m. and 6:50 a.m. The  infrequent and inconvenient nature of many long-distance schedules is  likely to severely limit rail as a viable transportation option for many  passengers. While increased frequency of service may potentially address  these limitations, this option could be costly due to the increased level of  federal subsidies that more frequent service would entail if the population  and other characteristics of long-distance corridors did not warrant  increased frequency of service.", "On-time performance also continues to be a major limitation affecting the  potential benefits provided by Amtrak\u2019s long-distance services. In fiscal  year 2005, Amtrak reported an average on-time performance of 41.4  percent for long-distance routes, ranging from a low of 7.1 percent on the  Sunset Limited to a high of 83 percent on the City of New Orleans (see  app. II). While several factors contribute to the wide variation in  performance, Amtrak attributes operating delays on the six host  railroads\u2014on which Amtrak trains operate\u2014as the largest single factor  affecting Amtrak on-time performance, contributing as much as 75 to 80  percent of the delay minutes. Since fiscal year 2000, average on-time  performance for all long-distance trains has been in decline (see fig. 7).", "On average, in fiscal year 2005, trains on long-distance routes arrived at  their final destinations approximately 98 minutes late. Trains on the  poorest performing route, the Sunset Limited, averaged nearly 5 hours  late. Such poor on-time performance is likely to significantly affect the  extent that passengers choose rail services to meet their transportation  needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corridor Services Appear to Provide More Public Benefits at Reduced Cost, but Opportunities for Improvement Remain", "paragraphs": ["Corridor rail services\u2014which include NEC operations, as well as state  supported and legacy corridor routes\u2014appear to offer increased potential  to provide transportation benefits and public benefits to a greater number  of people at reduced cost to the federal government. Corridor routes  comprise most of Amtrak\u2019s annual ridership\u2014providing service to a wide  variety of business and leisure travelers\u2014and they account for much of the  growth in passenger rail in recent years, particularly on the state-supported  routes (see app. II for a list of states and associated corridor services).  Relative to the long-distance routes, corridor services also operate with  lower costs and better on-time performance. They also appear to be better  aligned to provide more cost-effective transportation benefits and public  benefits. For example, they are generally more time- and cost-competitive  with other transport modes and offer increased flexibility over long- distance rail services, adapting schedules and services to changing  demographics and passenger travel demands. However, despite their  relative financial and operating performance, many of the corridor routes  face challenges such as capacity constraints and funding issues, which may  limit opportunities for rail to increase market share and play a more  significant role in the nation\u2019s transportation system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ridership and Financial Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["Corridor routes account for most of the intercity passenger rail travel in the  United States and they illustrate substantially reduced financial losses  relative to the long-distance routes. Most intercity passenger rail travel in  the United States is comprised of relatively short trips on a small number of  corridor routes. In fiscal year 2005, the average trip length for all routes\u2014 both long distance and corridor\u2014was 213 miles, with corridor routes  servicing approximately 85 percent of the total Amtrak ridership. Among  these corridor routes, over half of the ridership in fiscal year 2005\u2014nearly  11 million passengers\u2014occurred on the NEC alone. The Washington\u2013New  York City\u2013Boston main line of the NEC remains the most heavily utilized  rail route in the country, forming an essential link for intercity passenger  and freight transportation, as well as nine different commuter rail  operations in the Northeast. On an average weekday, over 1,800 commuter  and Amtrak trains operate over the NEC.", "On the 26 non-NEC corridors, ridership in fiscal year 2005 was 10.6 million,  with 52 percent of this total generated on the four most heavily traveled  routes. These corridor services, namely the state supported routes, also  represent the market that is exhibiting the strongest ridership growth.  Since fiscal year 2002, there has been an 18-percent increase in ridership on  state-supported routes as states continue to increase spending for  operations and capital improvements of corridor rail services (see fig. 8).", "Given the high number of passengers and the relative importance of the  NEC, passenger profiles for Amtrak-operated trains on this corridor  illustrate some clear distinctions from those on long-distance routes. For  example, a much higher percentage of ridership is comprised of  commuters and business travelers in comparison to the long-distance  routes, particularly on the higher-end NEC trains, the Acela Express and  Metroliner. Amtrak survey data indicates that in fiscal year 2004, 82 percent  of travel on these services was business-related. Passengers on Amtrak\u2019s  Regional Service\u2014the other primary NEC trains\u2014reported that 49 percent  were traveling or commuting for business or school; 50 percent reported  traveling for personal or family business, or traveling primarily for leisure  purposes.", "For non-NEC corridors, the designated trip purpose varied widely between  the routes because they operate in a number of different states and  passenger markets. For example, the Empire service in New York caters to  a number of business travelers and commuters, while the California  corridor routes are characterized by a larger share of leisure and personal  travel.", "As for financial performance, the Acela Express and Metroliner trains  operating on the NEC are Amtrak\u2019s only services in which passenger  revenues cover the cost of operation (excluding depreciation and interest).  In fiscal year 2005, Amtrak reported a positive total annual contribution of  $65.3 million for this service. However, Amtrak\u2019s other scheduled trains on  the NEC ended the year with operating losses, resulting in a net  contribution of approximately $45 million for intercity passenger rail  service on this corridor. While these results indicate relative financial  success, they do not take into account the substantial amount of capital  spending invested to fund infrastructure improvements and maintain  operations on the NEC. For example, in fiscal year 2005, Amtrak reported a  capital allocation to the NEC of $190.4 million\u2014over four times the  reported operating contribution. In addition, Amtrak has an estimated  system backlog of up to $6 billion in deferred maintenance and  infrastructure improvements, with the NEC comprising more than 60  percent of this total.", "All of the non-NEC corridor routes also incur financial losses to Amtrak;  however, considerable variation exists among them. In fiscal year 2005,  Amtrak reported a total annual loss from all non-NEC corridor services of  approximately $164 million, with losses on individual services ranging from  a low of $200,000 (Illinois Zephyr) to a high of $23.3 million (Empire  Service). In the aggregate, these losses represent an average operating  subsidy of about $20 per passenger for non-NEC operations. One reason for  the wide variance in Amtrak\u2019s financial performance among these corridor  routes is the level of state support provided. Overall, state payments to  Amtrak for operating and capital costs have increased considerably in  recent years\u2014rising from $148 million to $272 million between fiscal years  2000 and 2005 (see fig. 9). However, states have generally not been required  to pay the full subsidies for these routes. Moreover, many states that have  corridor services have not paid anything at all, thus producing issues of  equity among states. For example, Amtrak operates a number of weekly  departures of the Hoosier State service\u2014between Indianapolis and  Chicago\u2014although it has the lowest cost recovery of any short-distance  route and neither state contributes any level of operating support.", "Both types of Amtrak\u2019s corridor routes illustrate significant potential to  provide transportation benefits and public benefits, but they each illustrate  a number of unique attributes and opportunities for improvement.  Transportation experts generally agree that intercity passenger rail services  that serve large, relatively close population centers\u2014and that are time- and  cost-competitive with other transportation modes\u2014represent the greatest  potential markets for rail worldwide. Moreover, these markets are the ones  most likely to offer the greatest opportunity to mitigate pollution and  reduce the growth of highway congestion through increased rail use.  However, the ability of intercity passenger rail to generate these benefits  depends on the likelihood that travelers will choose rail service over other  modes of transportation. As we have reported previously, congestion is  most likely to be alleviated when rail routes run parallel to congested  roadways and where travelers view rail as a more attractive \u201cdoor-to-door\u201d  travel option (in terms of price, time, comfort, and safety) than driving.  Similarly, rail becomes less competitive with other modes of  transportation, particularly air services, as travel time and prices increase  over longer distances (see app. II). For these reasons, corridor services  appear to be most competitive with automobile and air travel in markets  between 100 and 300 miles. In this regard, many existing and developing  corridor rail services appear to be well positioned to provide a viable  alternative to other modes of transport and potentially offer a number of  public benefits:  NEC. With over 30 million metropolitan residents, the NEC has a  population density of over 65,000 residents per route mile. According to  the American Association of State Highway and Transportation  Officials, such a large population density helps to explain why the NEC  accounts for such a large proportion of Amtrak\u2019s total corridor  ridership. Many of the rail services on the NEC are very competitive  with air and auto travel in several markets. For example, Amtrak serves  50 percent of the combined air/rail market between Washington, D.C.,  and New York, and 40 percent between New York and Boston.  Moreover, in fiscal year 2005, Amtrak reported air/rail market shares  greater than 90 percent for other shorter distance city pairs such as  Philadelphia\u2013New York and Philadelphia\u2013Washington, D.C. The  Northeast region also illustrates characteristics of the type of urban  congestion and capacity constraints that may benefit the most from  travelers being diverted away from the highways and onto rail.", "State-Supported Corridors. State-supported routes are the fastest  growing routes and illustrate significant potential to provide a viable  transportation option; however, further development of new and  existing rail corridors may require funding beyond what has been  previously provided. A growing number of individual states and groups  of states have made the public policy decision to utilize state funds to  subsidize additional corridor rail service and invest in related capital  projects. Some of the potential benefits cited for such expenditures  include the potential for rail to accommodate regional growth and  enhance economic competitiveness. Over 80 percent of the nation\u2019s  population now lives in a metropolitan area. Officials in many states are  interested in identifying and developing regional rail corridors that link  these economies and provide a viable transportation option to large  numbers of residents. Officials in several states with whom we spoke  also indicated that corridor rail services are an important component of  state and local transportation plans. For example, in Washington State,  corridor rail service between Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon,  comprised over 60 percent of the air/rail market share in fiscal year 2005  and was identified for its potential role in reducing the growth rate of  highway congestion within the region. The nine member states of the  Midwest Regional Rail Initiative also identified where potential public  benefits may be provided through additional funding for increased train  frequencies and extensions of existing corridor routes. In addition, this  group has set out a \u201cgrand vision\u201d to link all of the major industrial  centers in the region with high-speed rail service (operating at speeds up  to 110 miles per hour). If completed, this network would reach over 35  million residents\u2014a number that exceeds the entire metropolitan  population of the NEC. An additional benefit attributed to increased  development of corridor services is that the state (or other public  authority) has the ability to contract for the specific services that it  chooses to subsidize, including scheduling, frequency, and the stations  served. In this manner, services can be adjusted over time according to  regional growth patterns and changing population demographics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Opportunities for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["While Amtrak\u2019s corridor routes serve millions of passengers each year and  appear to provide a number of public benefits, there may be additional  opportunities to further develop rail corridors to improve existing services  and reach new markets. For example, a number of issues associated with  infrastructure improvements and capacity constraints may need to be  addressed to ensure that rail services continue to provide an effective  alternative to other transport modes. To be successful, corridor trains must  operate with adequate on-time performance to provide competitive travel  times and reasonably predictable schedules. In addition, overcoming  funding issues will likely be required in order to realize the opportunities  identified by states for the further development of regional rail corridors.", "Infrastructure improvements and capacity constraints are critical issues on  the NEC. Although it is Amtrak\u2019s most viable route, the NEC faces a high  level of unmet infrastructure spending, maintenance spending, and growing  capacity constraints, which may affect its ability to effectively compete  with other transportation modes in the future. Amtrak\u2019s most recent  legislative grant request asks for $730 million in fiscal year 2007 to  complete major projects such as replacing bridges, ties, power supply  systems, and overhauling the existing fleet of rolling stock, with the NEC  being targeted as a critical priority for such investments. In addition, the  many users operating on the NEC present a constraint on capacity that may  impact the ability of Amtrak trains to reach their destinations on time.  Backups are becoming more common among freight, commuter, and  Amtrak trains, causing delays that result in dissatisfaction among riders.  Delays affecting on-time performance may be particularly important on the  NEC, where a high number of business and commuter travelers rely on  these services.", "In fiscal year 2005, Amtrak reported that train services on the NEC reached  their destinations on time an average of 78 percent of the time. While this  represents a slight improvement over fiscal year 2004 levels, this indicator  has decreased from fiscal year 2000 levels (see fig. 10). Recognizing that  the deteriorated condition of the infrastructure contributes to increased  operating costs and reduced reliability of services, Amtrak has committed  to developing a NEC master plan in conjunction with the states and  commuter agencies that utilize it. This effort aims to identify long-term  needs and service improvements, and work together to fund such  projects. An example of such a project designed to address capacity  constraints and improve service is illustrated by Amtrak\u2019s current efforts  working with the state of Virginia to develop an additional track dedicated  to passenger trains between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia.  The benefits identified by Amtrak for projects such as this one include  increased capacity, potentially higher speeds, reduced trip times, and  overall improvement in reliability and on-time performance.", "Non-NEC corridor routes also face a number of the same infrastructure and  capacity challenges affecting train speeds and the predictability of travel  times as the NEC services. In fiscal year 2005, on-time performance for  these services was reported at 70.4 percent, reflecting a 6-percent decline  since fiscal year 2000. A state official in New York cited the Empire Service  as an example of one such corridor facing significant congestion and  capacity constraints associated with heavy use by freight trains, commuter  services, and Amtrak trains. A recent study estimated that $700 million  would be needed just to complete infrastructure improvement projects on  one segment of this corridor, the 141-mile line between Albany and New  York City. Similar projects to reduce congestion and increase speeds have  been identified on a number of other state supported and \u201clegacy\u201d corridors  in Pennsylvania, California, and the Midwest.", "Overcoming funding challenges is another issue that needs to be addressed  if Amtrak and state partners are going to work together to continue  developing and expanding intercity passenger rail services. Although some  states have identified where additional corridor services may provide  significant transportation benefits and public benefits, these projects often  require substantial levels of public funding. For example, the total cost  required to develop the 3,000-mile high-speed rail network as envisioned by  the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative is estimated at $4.8 billion. All the state  officials with whom we spoke indicated that any additional state funding  for rail will require some type of federal match program similar to other  transportation modes. Moreover, Amtrak\u2019s plans to recover additional  overhead and other shared costs expended on state-supported corridor  routes beginning in 2008 will place further demands on limited state  funding for rail. Undertaking the significant infrastructure improvement  projects needed to expand capacity and improve operational performance  on existing corridors would also be expensive. For example, a report  issued by a coalition of rail stakeholders in the Mid-Atlantic region  estimated that funding to address major congestion bottlenecks in that  region would cost approximately $6.2 billion over 20 years. In addition, a  report issued by state transportation officials in 2002 estimated that capital  investment projects outlined for 21 corridors across the country could cost  as much as $60 billion over a 20-year period. Regardless of which projects  are ultimately funded, it appears that, if rail is to play a more significant  role in the nation\u2019s transportation system, overcoming issues of funding  and capacity will be an important component."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Current Intercity Passenger Rail System Is Not Adequately Focused Where It Can Be the Most Financially Viable and Provide the Most Public Benefits", "paragraphs": ["The current intercity passenger rail system is not adequately focused on its  comparative strengths; it exists much as it did when Amtrak began over 35  years ago. While Amtrak has made notable upgrades along the NEC and  implemented a number of contractions and expansions of its route  structure over the years, the system remains similar in its size and  endpoints as the original \u201cbasic system\u201d that the DOT designated in 1971  (see app. II for a map of Amtrak\u2019s routes in 1971). As the DOT General  Counsel recently testified, this system has not effectively adapted to  shifting demographics and market demands over time, as other  transportation modes have done. While the current model may provide  limited service offerings across the country\u2019s broad geography, it does so at  a very high cost to the federal government. Amidst a number of fiscal  constraints and increased pressure to reduce or better target federal rail  subsidies in the future, this model may no longer be viable. However,  intercity passenger rail continues to illustrate the potential to become an  important element with greater integration into the nation\u2019s overall  transportation system if it is focused on the markets where rail exhibits  comparative strength. As reported by the Congressional Budget Office  (CBO) in September 2003, these opportunities are most likely to be found  on routes of about 100 to 300 miles that connect cities with large  populations. In these markets, rail is most likely to be both time- and cost- competitive with highway and air travel, and may be best positioned to  meet both the demands of the traveling public and the demands of  sponsoring public authorities.", "As our work illustrates, the current intercity passenger rail system targets  substantial resources toward the operation of long-distance services,  which the CBO and others have reported is an area of comparative  weakness for rail services. In addition to accounting for about 80 percent of  Amtrak\u2019s operating losses, these services do not appear to be meeting  Amtrak\u2019s goal of providing \u201cbasic transportation\u201d very effectively. Services  are often unreliable\u2014averaging 41 percent on-time performance\u2014and  serve communities infrequently or at inconvenient times (often one train  daily in each direction).", "While these characteristics do not serve Amtrak\u2019s long-distance passengers  well, the several distinct \u201cclient\u201d markets on these routes are also not  efficiently targeted. For example, many passengers on long-distance trains  travel relatively short distances\u2014400 miles or less\u2014suggesting that a  substantial share of long-distance service may actually be corridor service.  However, these services are not managed like corridors, which are  characterized by higher speeds and more frequent train service. Passengers  in rural communities along these routes also do not appear to be effectively  targeted by rail services. These services are inherently limited to those  communities fortunate enough to be located next to historical rail lines.  Further, there is reason to believe that alternative modes of transportation  may be better positioned to provide much greater rural coverage at  potentially lower cost to the government. Finally, for those passengers  traveling longer distances, Amtrak often operates costly amenities (e.g.,  sleeper and dining cars) which account for even higher levels of federal  subsidies than coach-class seats. Amtrak survey data also suggests that, on  average, the 16 percent of riders on long distance trains who utilize sleeper  services are typically the most affluent passengers. For example,  passengers in Sleeper/First Class reported an average household income  over one-third higher than coach-class passengers. Consequently,  substantial federal dollars are currently being spent to subsidize costly  services to individuals with higher-than-average incomes. All of these  characteristics raise questions about the appropriate federal role in long- distance service, such as whether federal expenditures should be used to  subsidize leisure services to affluent travelers, and whether there may be  more cost-effective alternatives to provide corridor services and efficient  rural transportation.", "In contrast, the current intercity passenger rail system also includes  corridor services, which have been identified as the comparative strength  of passenger rail and where passenger rail services hold the most promise  to be financially viable and provide a number of potential public benefits.  There has been a relative growth of passenger rail ridership on corridor  routes, especially state-supported corridors, and 85 percent of Amtrak\u2019s  riders live and work along corridors. Aside from the heavily populated NEC  where Amtrak has achieved its best results, a number of other corridors\u2014 such as those in California, New York, the Midwest, and the Pacific  Northwest\u2014exhibit many of the key characteristics that indicate there may  be potential public benefits that could justify public subsidies for passenger  rail services, namely clusters of densely populated areas within 300 miles  of each other. Moreover, many officials with whom we spoke agreed that  the promise of intercity passenger rail is likely along corridors, not over  long distances. States have further supported this view by providing  substantial funds to support corridor operations and/or capital investments  on these routes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Foreign Experiences Illustrate Various Approaches to Restructuring and Key Reform Elements", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 20 years, several countries have employed a variety of  approaches in reforming their intercity passenger rail systems in order to  meet national intercity passenger rail objectives.

Despite the variation or  combination of approaches used, during the restructuring process these  countries addressed several key elements of reform, such as establishing  clear goals for intercity passenger rail, clearly defining stakeholder roles  that are necessary in implementing any approach, and establishing stable  sustainable funding.", "Prior to implementing these new approaches, many countries\u2019 passenger  rail systems consisted of \u201cmonolithic\u201d state-owned and state run  organizations in which customer service and financial performance were  not the main concerns of the railroad. Rather, other concerns, such as  socioeconomic issues (e.g., providing employment) were more important.  Similar to the current situation in the United States, passenger rail in many  countries was losing market share to other modes of transportation and  this loss of market share, along with mounting dependence on public  subsidies and decreasing transparency with respect to where public funds  were being spent, prompted change in the passenger rail industry. Table 2  discusses the different passenger rail structures that existed in the five  countries in which we conducted site visits for this report. These countries  were chosen because they have transitioned from state-owned fully  integrated organizations to more consumer driven market-dependent  entities. While it is important to be aware of the key differences between  these countries and the United States (e.g., infrastructure ownership,  geography, and political culture) the general catalyst for reform\u2014the need  to deliver a better value for the expense of public funds\u2014is the same as the  current passenger rail environment in the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Various Approaches Have Been Used Abroad to Support a Broad Range of National Intercity Passenger Rail Objectives Aimed at Improving Value for Funds Spent", "paragraphs": ["The foreign countries we visited have met a broad range of national  objectives by implementing various approaches to improve the cost  effectiveness of their intercity passenger rail systems. All the countries we  visited reformed their systems in large part to improve the value of service  they were receiving for the amount of public money being spent on the  service. For example, the desire for increased transparency in the use of  public funds, mounting public subsidies and rail-related debt, and a desire  for economic efficiency were all key factors in the European Union\u2019s 2001  directive requiring all member states to improve the efficiency of their rail  systems. Three of the five countries we visited\u2014France, Germany, and the  U.K.\u2014are members of the European Union and have all begun  implementing changes to meet these goals. Similarly, Canada and Japan  both reformed their systems to increase the value in service they were  receiving for the funds being spent. While the countries we studied  reformed their systems in order to meet financial objectives, the national  governments of these countries still provided heavy financial support to the  system after the reforms. Table 3 shows the current levels of financial  support provided by these governments.", "Passenger rail reform in the countries we visited was also undertaken to  achieve a number of other objectives. For example, reform was used as an  opportunity to provide viable transportation benefits and public benefits  that might not otherwise be achieved. The Canadian, Japanese, and French  governments all financially support passenger rail service to areas of the  country that have small or isolated populations and that may not be well  served by other means of transport. For the most part, this service is  unprofitable and would not otherwise be provided. Another objective was  to address growing urban congestion through enhanced passenger rail  service. In the European Union member countries we visited passenger rail  reform was used to address environment and urban congestion issues.  Finally, the countries we visited used reform to improve the operational  performance of existing intercity passenger rail systems. For example, in  Germany, a large part of its reform was to consolidate the two highly  inefficient rail systems that existed after the country was reunified into one  cost-efficient rail system. Similarly, in Canada a major reexamination of  long-distance intercity passenger rail service took place in order to better  market these routes and, therefore improving the routes\u2019 financial  performance. Additionally, Germany and France have established  performance metrics such as on-time performance and train cleanliness,  which result in bonuses or penalties for the rail operators based on their  ability to meet the standards established in the metrics.", "These reform objectives have been addressed through various approaches.  Each approach reorganized a different aspect of the existing intercity  passenger rail system. See figure 11 for a summary of the approaches each  country took.

For example, in France and Germany, government-owned  private companies were established to manage and maintain the entire  rail infrastructure, including granting access to operators and collecting  access fees. In the U.K., a member-owned private company handles  infrastructure matters. By moving away from the day-to-day  management of the infrastructure, governments are able to put those  tasks in the hands of individuals best suited to manage the  infrastructure, while still being able to set the strategic direction.  Shifting away from day-to-day management allows the government to be  more of a customer of the infrastructure manager, thereby enhancing  transparency in costs as well as accountability in the financial  performance of the infrastructure companies.", "Devolving decision-making authority to local and regional  governments. One of the most prevalent changes made in two of the  three European Union countries we visited was the devolution of  specific roles and responsibilities from the national government to local  or regional governments. These roles included decision making (e.g.,  selecting the operator through a bidding process), as well as  determining the quantity and frequency of intercity passenger rail  service. By letting governments that were geographically closest to the  service make decisions about it, the national governments have been  able to be more cost effective by targeting public and transportation  benefits to the specific preferences of the localities. In cases where the  localities are able to select their operator through competitive bidding,  service can be purchased for the lowest bid\u2014as opposed to having no  choice if there were only one operator to choose from. For example, in  Germany, all of the national operation subsidies are given directly to the  L\u00e4nder (analogous to U.S. states); the L\u00e4nder are then able to issue a  request for proposal outlining specific service needs, and receive  competing bids for the level of service they request.", "Shift from service operator to customer. The U.K. and Germany, as well  as France and Canada, have transitioned their relationships with rail  operators from that of operator to that of customer\u2014the governments  determine what type of service they want to make available to their  citizens, and then purchase that service from the rail operators.  Frequently, the governments establish performance metrics to hold the  operators accountable. In the U.K. and Germany there are multiple  operators that can bid to provide this service, but in France and Canada  the service is provided by a single national operator. By taking on a  customer role\u2014even if the national provider is still fully owned by the  government\u2014these nations have been better able to define the type of  service they want, and then pay for those services. This can lead to more  cost-effective service, and better provision of public benefits and  transportation benefits. For example, officials in the Ile de-France  region (greater Paris area) told us that they have received better service  from the national operator since they were able to deal with them  directly, and in 2004 the operator received 1.8\u20ac million in bonus  payments from the region for meeting metrics such as the handling of  passenger claims and station cleanliness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changing the Public Funding Structure Used to Support Intercity Passenger Rail", "paragraphs": ["Another approach taken by some of the countries we visited involved  changing the public funding structure used to support intercity passenger  rail.", "Changes to government commitment to funding. In all the countries we  visited, the national governments made commitments to fund intercity  passenger rail. Four of these countries dedicated annual funding  towards investing in the intercity passenger rail system in order to  provide the resources needed to achieve a desired level of rail service.  Japan established a one-time fund for its railroads that needed financial  assistance, allowing the railroads to invest these funds in order to  operate off the interest earned on these investments. Changing the  commitment to funding allows these countries to get the best value for  their money by requiring rail operators to provide specified levels of  service for the amount of funds required to conduct these services. Also,  as shown by Canada, cuts to the level of annual funding can push an  operator to improve its operations, reduce costs, and grow revenues in  order to operate within its funding limits.", "Changes to funding mechanisms for infrastructure. Another major  funding change made in the three European Union countries we visited  was the establishment of new funding mechanisms (i.e., grants and  loans) for intercity passenger rail operations and infrastructure. By  splitting the funding sources for these two distinct functions, the  governments are better able to determine what the subsidy is being used  for and increase the transparency in the use of public funds; in addition,  constant and expensive infrastructure projects now have a specific  source of funding, allowing infrastructure managers to better plan for  future projects.", "Changes to funding dissemination. Another funding change made by  both France and Germany occurred in conjunction with the devolution  of decision making to local and regional governments. These two  countries now provide national funds directly to local and regional  governments in order to support the purchase of intercity passenger rail  service. By doing this, these countries have enabled local and regional  governments to be more flexible and purchase service that best fits the  preferences of the users; funds can therefore be targeted at the  transportation benefits and public benefits preferred by local areas.", "In addition to these changes in the structure of the public funds, another  factor played an important role in changing the funding structure\u2014a  national commitment to provide stable sustainable funding. For example,  in Germany, part of the motor fuel excise tax was dedicated to rail;  meanwhile, Japan created Business Stabilization Funds in order to support  operations and capital improvements of the three island railway companies  with smaller passenger rail markets. In Canada, officials told us the  national government has informally made an ongoing commitment to  support intercity passenger rail operations by consistently providing the  same level of funding each year. By committing to provide the funds each  year, all the national governments above allowed rail operators to better  manage their resources and planning capabilities.", "As part of this commitment, four of the five countries we visited  transferred or reduced the debt that the railways were carrying. In  Germany, reform took place in 1994 and the debt was transferred to the  government; a new public agency was then created to take over and pay off  the 35\u20ac billion in debt (about $39 billion) incurred by the preexisting  railways, as well as by the employees of the former railways. In Japan,  during the 1987 reform, the national government relieved the railway of its  \u00a537.1 trillion debt (about $257 billion) by transferring most of it\u2014along  with part of the railway\u2019s employee pensions\u2014to the national government,  and splitting the remainder of the debt among the operators. In France,  the 1997 reform resulted in 20\u20ac billion in debt (about $24 billion) being  transferred to the new infrastructure manager. In exchange, the new  manager received the country\u2019s entire rail infrastructure at no cost; the  remaining 10\u20ac billion in debt (about $12 billion) was transferred to the  national operator. While the British government wrote off the initial debt  of the railway in 1994, the U.K. is currently carrying an infrastructure debt  of about \u00a318 billion (currently about $34 billion). According to U.K. officials  we interviewed, this amount is expected to increase to \u00a321 billion  (currently about $39 billion) by 2009. Officials with U.K.\u2019s infrastructure  manager noted, though, that borrowing is limited to 85 percent of the value  of its regulatory asset base. Canada did not have debt at the time of their  restructurings. Relieving the debt of the rail operators created a viable  capital structure for the new railways to operate in, and has been an  important factor in their ability to move forward more cost effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changing the Organization of Existing Passenger Rail Systems", "paragraphs": ["Restructuring the organization of existing passenger rail systems is another  approach often taken by governments when reforming their rail systems.  Historically, most national rail systems have been comprised of monolithic  government-owned and government-managed entities, where the two  major functions\u2014managing infrastructure (e.g., tracks and stations) and  managing daily operations\u2014were integrated. The three European  countries we visited began their reform by separating the operational and  infrastructure functions of their passenger rail systems. Separating these  two functions from each other can result in more transparency and a better  estimate of what the costs for each function are.", "This separation can take place in a variety of ways. For example, the U.K.  went from a government monopoly with full control over both functions to  a private company owned by \u201cmembers\u201d that own and manage all of the rail  infrastructure; operations were turned over to private operators in 1993. In  France, the government monopoly was separated into two separate  government-owned companies. One company is responsible for managing  all rail operations and the other is responsible for managing the  infrastructure. In Germany the government rail monopoly was turned over  to a private state-owned holding company, with separate independent  subsidiary business units in charge of infrastructure and operations.  Additionally, in Germany, although the same holding company that owns  the infrastructure also includes the primary passenger rail operator, other  private operators are permitted to provide intercity passenger rail service  on their tracks. Conversely, in Japan, the infrastructure and operational  function of the passenger rail system have remained integrated\u2014instead,  the country divided its rail system into six distinct geographic regions  allowing each area of the country to address issues specific to its passenger  markets. Restructuring the rail system is generally implemented to create  more transparency in the costs incurred by the rail companies; once  accurate costs are known, companies can better gauge how much to  charge for their services, as well as identify opportunities for cost savings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introducing Competition and Privatization in Intercity Passenger Rail Operations", "paragraphs": ["The introduction of competition and/or privatization in rail operations is  another approach to reform intercity passenger rail. This approach was  used by some of the countries we visited. Over the past two decades,  countries have been reforming their railway systems through various forms  of privatization in order to improve the quality of service and efficiency  offered to customers, and to reduce costs. Competition and privatization  are two market mechanisms that are often used to improve service  efficiency while meeting financial objectives. The use of competition and  privatization can lead to a market that is more responsive to customers as  well as investors. However, regardless of the degree of success, deep and  continuing government involvement will likely continue to be necessary in  order to balance the financial needs of the railways with the transportation  coverage desired by the state.", "Competition and privatization have been particularly prevalent in Europe,  where a European Union directive requires the existence of competition in  the freight rail industry; an additional directive has been proposed  requiring the allowance of competition in the international passenger rail  industry as well, although some countries have already opened their  markets to multiple operators. Germany makes extensive use of private  operators, with over 300 operators providing rail service on many regional  routes. In the U.K., all passenger rail services are franchised and open to  competitive bidding by operators. The introduction of competition and  privatization is largely dependent on the government changing its role to  that of a customer, with the primary focus on purchasing the best service  for the best price. In Germany, the dissemination of national funding to  regional governments has facilitated the extensive presence of multiple  operators. Japan, meanwhile, aims to have its passenger rail system  completely privatized; currently three of Japan\u2019s six passenger rail systems  are managed by individual private companies.

Based on our review, implementing these  approaches appears to improve the cost effectiveness of intercity  passenger rail service. For example, officials with the primary operator in  Germany told us that their company has seen a 187-percent increase in staff  productivity between 1993 and 2004; at the same time, the company was  able to reduce its workforce by 40 percent. These officials stated that the  German rail reform resulted in taxpayers paying 44\u20ac billion less during this  time period than what they would have been expected to pay if there had  been no reform. The key reform elements addressed throughout  implementation of these approaches include:   Establishing clearly defined national policy goals. In making major  changes to an intercity passenger rail system, it is essential that the  national government establish a clear vision for what the goals of the  system should include while making decisions to implement new  approaches to meet these goals. During our review of the five countries  we visited, we observed that each country established goals that their  reforms were intended to achieve. As we reported in February 2005, a  key component in reforming a national program includes determining if  there is a clear federal role and mission. All of the approaches taken by  the five countries we visited were tailored to meet the specific national  policy goals established by those countries. For example, in the U.K.,  there was a national goal to reduce the role government played in  managing the passenger rail system. To meet this national goal, the U.K.  used approaches such as introducing competition in its system, and  changing the role of the national government from service operator to  that of a customer of private rail operating companies.", "Clearly defining government and stakeholder roles. The second key  reform element we learned about during our site visits is that  government and stakeholder roles should be clearly defined prior to (or  during) implementation of any reform approach. Deciding what these  roles should be was the first step in several of the approaches. For  example, in order to shift the national government\u2019s role, the  responsibilities of the government first needed to be defined; it then had  to be decided which of these responsibilities would continue to be  government functions, and which would be those of other stakeholders.", "Establishing consistent, committed funding. Consistent, committed  funding is the final reform element key to successful implementation of  a new approach to intercity passenger rail. In the five countries we  visited, the national governments made a commitment to provide  intercity passenger rail service. The governments also committed to  provide the system, on an annual basis, with the funds necessary to  maintain this service. Whether the approach taken was to increase the  annual subsidy, provide subsidies to regional levels of government, or  establish a consistent subsidy for each year, all of these governments  made financial commitments to provide intercity passenger rail service.", "See app. III for more detailed information about each of the countries we  reviewed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The United States is Not Well Positioned for Reform", "paragraphs": ["The United States is not well positioned to reform or restructure intercity  passenger rail service.

The national  governments of the countries we visited addressed three main elements  through the process of reforming or restructuring their intercity passenger  rail systems: (1) clearly defining national policy goals, (2) clearly defining  the various roles and responsibilities of public and private sector entities  involved, and (3) establishing consistent committed funding for intercity  passenger rail.

For example, a specific goal of the reform  process in France, Germany and the U.K. was to increase transparency in  the use of public funds and restructuring included separating the  management of their rail infrastructure and passenger operations. In  Germany, the government\u2019s objectives in consolidating two state railways  into one private holding company, Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), was to improve  efficiency, and to allow DB to function independently of the government  and manage its railway like a private business. During the restructuring  process in Japan, by defining specific goals and outcomes for the system,  the national government was able to determine an overall structure for the  system. Some of the goals Japan defined for the railway before  restructuring it were reducing the accumulated debt, minimizing the  national government\u2019s role in maintaining the railway, increasing efficiency,  and strengthening competitiveness. Additionally, a desired outcome of  restructuring the state-owned provider into six private regional passenger  rail operating companies was to better position rail service to compete for  passengers.", "Goals provided by Congress focus narrowly on Amtrak management,  rather than providing guidance and direction for the entire U.S intercity  passenger rail system. The current legislation governing Amtrak directs it  to operate a national passenger rail transportation system that ties together  existing and emerging regional corridors and other intermodal service.  However, it does not provide specific objectives for the system Amtrak is  required to operate, such as defining transportation benefits and public  benefits or increasing the transparency of public funds, nor does it specify  how the system should be structured to achieve certain outcomes. This  broad mandate, as previously discussed, has resulted in the current  intercity passenger rail system\u2014a system that does not target markets  where rail may have a comparative advantage over other transportation  modes nor makes the most cost-effective choices to meet public  transportation needs. In April 2005, Amtrak released a set of proposed  strategic reform initiatives, which included a vision for the future of  intercity passenger rail service and Amtrak\u2019s role. Recently, Amtrak  developed a mission statement, which aims to improve financial and  operational performance by tying specific goals to the mission statement.  Although the vision and mission statement provide a direction for the  company, senior Amtrak officials told us that this mission for the company  should not be a substitute for Congress setting a national intercity  passenger rail policy. Furthermore, they said that a national rail policy  should be explicit and clearly indicate the transportation services that the  federal government wants operators to offer; Congress should then provide  funding for the desired level of service.", "Determining the system\u2019s structure, as well as determining how to position  passenger rail within the entire U.S. transportation system, will remain  uncertain without specific goals and outcomes for intercity passenger rail.  To change the current structure of intercity passenger rail, policy decisions  need to be made. As the Congressional Research Service (CRS) reported in  December 2004, maintaining the status quo of passenger rail policy allows  policymakers to avoid making decisions, such as shutting down Amtrak  and eliminating its long distance routes or alternatively, committing to a  major financial program.

Each of these organizations  has defined responsibilities and is transparent with respect to the  responsibility of achieving specific goals. According to a U.K. official, in  privatizing some of these organizations, the U.K. sought greater efficiency,  tighter cost control, a reduction in government interference in the railway  industry, and more consistent and reliable funding. Our study also showed  that clarifying stakeholder roles and responsibilities may require the  creation of new entities. For instance, when Japan National Railways  restructured its railways in 1987, the government created the Japan  National Railways Settlement Corporation to settle the accumulated debt  of Japan National Railways. In addition, an official from Japan\u2019s Ministry of  Land, Infrastructure, and Transport told us that the railway split into six  passenger railroads in order to have more efficient regional service.", "In the United States, stakeholder roles and responsibilities for managing,  operating, and funding intercity passenger rail services are unclear.

Only recently has  the Secretary of Transportation been tasked with overseeing these  funds, but such funding has been tied to Amtrak\u2019s business plan and not  a national policy or vision that articulates goals, objectives, and  outcomes for intercity passenger rail services.", "Current law offers states a narrow role in decision making, but permits  states to subsidize additional intercity passenger rail service. Some  states see benefits to subsidizing intercity passenger rail and choose to  spend their own funds for additional service not provided as part of  Amtrak\u2019s national route system\u2014a system that has not had substantial  changes since 1971. Those states have had a role in making decisions,  such as what stations will be served and whether food service will be  provided on the subsidized route, unlike states that do not provide  funding. Forty-two states receive basic long distance service with no  state support, while 13 of these states have decided to subsidize  additional corridor services based, partly, on demand. For example,  Amtrak\u2019s legacy route system has provided service on some corridors  without state support, (e.g., from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to New York  City), but on other corridors, states have subsidized additional service,  such as Washington state paying for additional frequencies for the  Cascades Service between Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon.  Additionally, in December 2004, CRS reported that there are those who  view that state governments may be better positioned to make regional  service decisions. The administration\u2019s proposal also favors giving  states a greater role in decision making with respect to rail service and  capital improvements.", "The role that freight railroads should play in shaping the future of  intercity passenger rail service is not defined. Management of and  access to infrastructure is dominated by the freight railroads. Since  passenger railroads and freight railroads must often share access to  privately owned tracks, the freight railroads\u2019 control over infrastructure  has an influence on both national passenger rail policy and day-to-day  passenger rail operations. Specifically, freight railroads may be  concerned with intercity passenger rail policy decisions that affect  access to their rights-of-way and capacity on existing tracks; these  decisions could potentially affect the freight business.

An official in the U.K. Department  for Transport told us that this funding cannot be reallocated for other  purposes without great political and financial risk. In addition, a 2002 CRS  report observed that reorganization of the railways in several countries  required substantial political and financial commitment over an extended  period.  Besides establishing funding tied to goals, countries we visited  also devoted funds to capital improvements separate from operating  subsidies. In France, about 2\u20ac billion per year (currently this is  approximately $2.5 billion) is provided for new rail lines: additionally, the  government also offers interest-free loans to support new infrastructure  projects. In addition to providing funding specifically for capital  improvements, three of the five countries disseminate the national subsidy  to regional governments, allowing passenger rail subsidy options to be  decided by regional governments instead of the national governments. For  instance, about 7\u20ac billion per year (about $8.9 billion) in operating  subsidies is divided among the 15 German L\u00e4nder to be used at their  discretion, and in France a 2\u20ac billion per year (currently this is about $2.5  billion) subsidy is divided among the 21 regions to support operations.", "The U.S. federal government has annually subsidized Amtrak since its  inception. The funding for intercity passenger rail has been constrained  due to competing priorities; possibly, funding has also been constrained  due to the inability to reach consensus over the federal role in intercity  passenger rail, which is demonstrated in the status of Amtrak\u2019s  reauthorization. Grants to Amtrak have not been expressly reauthorized  since its previous 5-year authorization expired in 2002, despite the number  of proposals presented to the Congress. Nonetheless, Amtrak developed a  5-year strategic plan (covering the period of fiscal years 2005 to 2009) that  was designed to address its immediate needs. (The plan identified  inadequate and uncertain levels of funding as a risk.) In recent years,  Amtrak has received over $1 billion in annual operating grants and capital  grants through the annual appropriations process.

According to the Federal Transit Administration, dependable levels of  funding for the full-funding grant agreements have improved the ability of  transit agencies to finance, plan, and execute projects.

But the projected incremental operating savings from  full implementation of Amtrak\u2019s operational changes over the next 5 or 6  years will not be sufficient to fund needed improvements to the intercity  passenger rail system such as addressing capital and maintenance needs,  returning the system to a state-of-good repair, and promoting corridor  development. In April 2005, Amtrak estimated that the strategic reform  initiatives could achieve total operating savings of nearly $550 million by  fiscal year 2011. Amtrak said achieving these savings would require a  number of legislative actions, such as the enactment of an 80 percent  federal capital match for state intercity passenger rail funds, as well as  realizing increased revenues from passengers, obtaining additional state  operating contributions for corridor trains, and having the federal  government cover Amtrak\u2019s legacy debt obligations. Some or all of these  could increase federal costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits of the Legislative Freedoms Are Limited by Constraints", "paragraphs": ["The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 provided Amtrak with  greater flexibility to alter its route network and undertake other cost saving  changes to meet the goal of operating self-sufficiency by the end of  December 2002, which Amtrak did not achieve. However, the benefits that  Amtrak can achieve from these provisions are limited by practical  constraints. For example, while the act eliminated the statutory ban on  Amtrak contracting out or outsourcing work, except for food and beverage  service that could already be contracted out, it made outsourcing a part  of the collective bargaining process. Amtrak officials also told us that this  provides less flexibility rather than more since it is more difficult to change  collective bargaining agreements with unions than for Congress to change  a statutory requirement. This could limit the extent to which Amtrak  could contract out services, depending on the outcome of negotiations with  unions. Amtrak officials told us that little progress has been made on labor  negotiations since only three contracts (of the 24 collective bargaining  agreements Amtrak maintains with its agreement employees) have been  signed and these all technically expired on December 31, 2004. As a result,  Amtrak is currently in negotiations with all of its unions and employee  councils over collective bargaining agreements.", "The benefits of making route changes to better meet the demands of the  public may also be limited as a result of labor protection requirements,  which are also part of the collective bargaining process. The Amtrak  Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 relieved Amtrak from getting  approval from the Secretary of Transportation to make changes to its route  structure and allowed Amtrak to discontinue routes without having to  preserve the \u201cbasic system\u201d formerly mandated by Congress, as long as the  remaining route structure tied existing and emergent regional rail  passenger service and other intermodal passenger service. One Amtrak  official told us that while Amtrak is legally allowed to change the route  network, decisions are often met with a variety of reactions including  resistance by Congress. In addition, if route changes result in the  elimination of jobs, Amtrak employees may be entitled to labor protection  benefits. As we reported in September 2002, if Amtrak had been liquidated  on December 31, 2001, potential Amtrak employee claims for immediate  labor protection payments could have been as much as $3.2 billion.", "Further, if an employee loses his or her job as a result of a reduction in  service on a route or closing of a maintenance shop, then he or she could  receive labor protection benefits for up to 5 years.", "Finally, several potential constraints exist in gaining benefits from Amtrak  adopting a \u201cuser pays\u201d principle for the provision of its services. Under the  user pay concept, costs to build and maintain rail infrastructure, including  along the NEC, would be paid for by the full range of users of the system,  including states, commuter rail agencies, freight railroads, and the public. If  adopted, a better matching of fees paid to costs incurred by the diverse  users of the NEC could provide incentives for both public and private users  to make modal choices and transportation options based on true costs.  One issue in implementing this approach is Amtrak\u2019s ability to accurately  define the true costs of intercity passenger rail services. We discussed  examples of this issue in two recent reports. In October 2005, we reported  concerns with how Amtrak captured and reported financial information,  such as Amtrak\u2019s overreliance on indirect cost allocation methods. In  April 2006, we reported that it is difficult to determine Amtrak\u2019s revenues  and costs associated with providing services and access to infrastructure to  commuter rail agencies, in part due to the limitations of Amtrak\u2019s  accounting practices. Since then, Amtrak has made some changes to its  reporting and financial systems, but according to Amtrak officials and  progress reports, more work is needed. A senior Amtrak official told us that  identifying direct route costs may be difficult since Amtrak uses many  different systems to capture costs.", "Another constraint may be the ability and willingness of users to pay  additional fees. For example, we recently reported that the ability and  willingness of private rail companies to invest in infrastructure capacity to  meet projected future demand for freight rail transportation is uncertain.  While some states see a benefit to intercity passenger rail and pay for  additional service, two state officials we spoke with opined that a proposal  which required states to further subsidize existing intercity passenger rail  service would face political opposition at the state level unless a federal  capital matching program comparable to other transportation modes is  enacted. In addition, commuter rail agencies that use the NEC raised  several concerns about FRA\u2019s efforts to establish a fee on them as  mandated in Amtrak\u2019s fiscal year 2006 appropriations. Among other  concerns, these agencies stated that their usage of the NEC is different  from Amtrak\u2019s, which should dictate different levels of payment for use of  the same infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amtrak Is Not Positioned to Address the Three Key Reform Elements", "paragraphs": ["Amtrak, as an operator, is not in a position to adopt and ultimately  implement key elements to begin reforming intercity passenger rail in the  United States.

Currently,  states are challenged to leverage their expenditures on such service.  However, federal-state cost sharing is common in highway and transit  programs where investment is encouraged through matching grants. Other  challenges include freight railroad concerns about infrastructure access  and capacity, workforce issues, and the role of the private sector.  Addressing funding issues will also present challenges. This includes  identifying funding sources to achieve national policy goals and developing  incentives for state participation.

As we reported in October 2005, FRA officials have told us  that, even though FRA has a seat on Amtrak\u2019s Board of Directors, the  agency has historically refrained from advocating a particular approach to  running Amtrak; neither has it specifically held Amtrak management  accountable for meeting particular goals. In addition, an FRA official told  us that the agency must be careful about its involvement with management  decisions since, legally, Amtrak is a private for-profit corporation. Since  fiscal year 2003, Congress has imposed measures to increase the Secretary  of Transportation\u2019s responsibility for providing oversight of, and  accountability for, the federal funds used for intercity passenger rail  service. Among other things, these measures require Amtrak to transmit a  business plan to the Secretary of Transportation and Congress and provide  monthly reports about this plan. In response to these measures, FRA has  entered into grant agreements with Amtrak. Although measures are in  place to increase FRA\u2019s oversight of Amtrak\u2019s operations through grant  agreements, FRA attributed the lack of resources for its limited and  focused approach to Amtrak oversight.

For example, one recent congressional  proposal would largely keep Amtrak intact and instead focus on various  reforms related to improving financial management, corporate governance,  and the development of metrics and standards for measuring performance  and the quality of service. This proposal would, among other things, require  Amtrak to develop a capital spending plan for restoring the NEC to a state  of good repair, and would allow freight railroads to bid for operating long- distance trains. In contrast, a proposal by the administration would  significantly restructure Amtrak. This proposal includes splitting Amtrak  into three functionally independent entities: a corporate entity to oversee  the restructuring and manage residual responsibilities; a passenger  operating company; and an infrastructure management company. It would  also, among other things, encourage the creation of an interstate compact  made up of northeastern states and the District of Columbia, to operate the  NEC. Amtrak itself has recognized the need for change. In April 2005,  Amtrak\u2019s management released a proposed set of strategic reform  initiatives that, if fully implemented, could substantially change how it is  operated.

One is the number of states that have the interest or willingness to  participate in intercity passenger rail. On the one hand, there are a number  of states that are willing to participate in subsidizing intercity passenger  rail and have made commitments to do so. In fiscal year 2005, 13 states paid  about $140 million to subsidize additional service from Amtrak. Amtrak  also received about $130 million from 8 states and 3 state agencies for  capital improvements on passenger rail corridors and at stations. In  addition, a coalition of 27 states\u2014called the States for Passenger Rail\u2014 have come together to promote the development, implementation, and  expansion of intercity passenger rail services with the involvement and  support from state governments. This organization\u2019s policy statement  indicates that states have taken, and will continue to take, a lead role in the  planning and development of new, expanded and enhanced regional  passenger rail corridor services. The states in the organization maintain  that these systems cannot be fully programmed and implemented without a  federal\u2013state funding partnership similar to existing highway, transit, and  aviation programs. On the other hand, there are a number of states that  receive the benefits of intercity passenger rail service but do not subsidize  such service, and may or may not be willing to do so. This situation reflects  the legacy service that existed when Amtrak was created in the early 1970s.  For example, as of April 2006, there were 12 Amtrak trains scheduled to  operate daily Monday through Friday between New York City and Albany,  New York. The state subsidizes only 1 of these trains\u2014the Adirondack.  Even on this train the state only subsidizes service north of Albany to  Montreal, Canada. New York City to Albany is part of the legacy service  that dates to when Amtrak began service in 1971. The extent to which  states would be willing to pay for the intercity passenger rail service  currently received for free is an open question.", "Another federal\u2013state challenge is the leveraging of financial assistance to  intercity passenger rail. Recent surface transportation acts have authorized  some federal financial assistance for the development of high-speed rail  and other passenger rail corridors. In addition, states can finance  passenger rail projects through the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s  Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program when the  project will result in demonstrable air quality improvements. However,  states are challenged to leverage their expenditures on intercity passenger  rail. In general, states work directly with Amtrak to obtain service above  the basic service provided. Some states also work directly with Amtrak to  finance intercity passenger rail capital improvement projects that benefit  their state. An FRA official told us that states could start their own intercity  passenger rail service, but doing so would be difficult given the potential  cost and lack of statutory access to infrastructure at the incremental cost  that Amtrak currently enjoys. Some other transportation programs\u2014such  as the interstate highway program and the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s  New Starts program for transit systems\u2014share responsibility for planning,  design, and funding between the federal government and state and local  governments. Federal agencies generally set the design and quality  standards for projects and encourage investment through matching grants.  State and local governments prepare transportation plans which identify  the need for investment, develop a business case for the investment, and  contribute a portion of the funding.", "Finally, reform initiatives designed to increase state roles in intercity  passenger rail will likely face the challenge of finding mechanisms for  states to work cooperatively together in the development of routes and  corridors that cross state lines. One mechanism is an interstate compact.  Interstate compacts for intercity passenger rail were proposed in the  Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. Interstate compacts are  agreements between states that are constitutionally permitted when  approved by Congress. Several interstate compacts are currently being  used to study the feasibility of, or advocate for, intercity passenger rail  service. These include the Midwest Interstate Rail Passenger Compact and  the Interstate High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Compact. Currently,  however, there are few passenger rail systems being operated under an  interstate compact. State officials have told us that interstate compacts are  a very difficult mechanism to use when more than two states are involved.  They said that not only do compacts take a substantial amount of time and  burden to create, but, in the context of passenger rail, there are practical  issues involved\u2014such as deciding what service is provided, how the costs  of such service are allocated to participants, and what happens when one  or more states do not fulfill their financial obligations to the compact.", "There may be other mechanisms available for states to work cooperatively  with each other. For example, the Appalachian Regional Commission  (ARC) is a federal\u2013state partnership that, in general, was created to  promote economic development in Appalachia. Although the current  definition of Appalachia includes 13 states, the governance structure is  made up of only two co-chairs\u2014one representing the federal government  and one representing the collective interests of 13 member states. Each co- chair has one vote on ARC matters. ARC officials told us that because of  the governance structure of ARC, virtually all decisions are reached by  consensus. In fact, they said that one of the advantages of ARC is that more  can be accomplished together than separately. They also cited as a  disadvantage the difficulties in reaching decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Freight Railroad Issues and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Freight railroads play an integral role in intercity passenger rail. Over 95  percent of Amtrak\u2019s route system operates over lines owned by freight  railroads. As such, the freight railroads have a keen interest in the volume  of passenger rail service provided and the potential impacts of such service  on their business. One of the main challenges associated with passenger  and freight railroads is infrastructure access and the cost of such access.  Since Amtrak\u2019s creation, federal law has generally required freight railroads  to give Amtrak trains priority access and charge Amtrak an incremental  cost\u2014rather than the full cost\u2014associated with the use of their tracks.  These legal rights currently apply only to Amtrak. However, efforts to  reform intercity passenger rail service raise questions about the status of  Amtrak\u2019s priority access and incremental charge rights\u2014that is, can, or  should, these rights be transferred to non-Amtrak operators or will some  other arrangement need to be made? Other arrangements could  significantly increase both the difficulty and cost of introducing non- Amtrak operators, possibly through competitive bidding for subsidies, to  provide intercity passenger rail service.", "Commuter rail service offers an example of access negotiations on  commercial, rather than incremental, cost terms. As we reported in  January 2004, unlike Amtrak, commuter rail agencies do not possess  statutory rights of access to freight railroad track. As a result, commuter  rail agencies must negotiate with freight railroads to purchase, lease, or pay  to access the railroads\u2019 right-of-way. Negotiations for these agreements can  last from a few months to several years. Our report noted that when  negotiating a lease or access agreement, freight railroads typically want to  be compensated for all operating, capital, and other costs associated with  hosting commuter and other trains. These costs would include direct costs,  such as dispatching trains and maintaining the rights-of-way, and indirect  costs, such as the cost of foregone opportunities (e.g., the incremental  value of \u201clost\u201d train slots). Infrastructure access is also difficult from the  perspective of a freight railroad company. Since freight service is the  companies\u2019 core business, the ability to move freight through the system  must be protected. Freight railroad officials with whom we spoke for our  earlier report insisted that they must protect their systems\u2019 capacity to  handle both today\u2019s freight traffic as well as future traffic projections.  Protecting capacity becomes difficult when passenger trains, either  intercity or commuter, consume available capacity without some sort of  infrastructure enhancement, expansion, or market-based compensation for  line capacity used.", "In addition to infrastructure access, capacity and capacity-availability  issues\u2014that is, the ability of rail lines and infrastructure to handle current  and future traffic volumes\u2014are also of concern to freight railroad  companies. After years of reducing infrastructure and rationalizing their  property, plant, and equipment, freight railroads have recently experienced  a substantial growth in traffic\u2014a growth that some project will continue  into the future. In January 2006, the CBO reported that total freight carried  by all modes of transportation in the United States has been growing.  CBO indicated that railroads, in particular, experienced a sharp increase in  traffic in the 1990s, with traffic increasing more than 50 percent between  1990 and 2003 (from about 1 trillion ton-miles to about 1.6 trillion ton- miles). This growth is expected to continue. For example, the  Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration has projected  that railroad ton-miles will increase 1.7 percent annually between 2004 and  2030, reaching about 2.4 trillion ton-miles in 2030. Other organizations  have similarly predicted increases. This growth has acted to limit available  capacity on the rail network, at least in some locations. In April 2006  testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure, Subcommittee on Railroads, the president and chief  executive officer of the Association of American Railroads said that the  traffic density (i.e., ton-miles per route-mile owned) for Class I railroads  had more than doubled from 1990 to 2005 (see fig. 12). He went on to say  that the traffic increases had resulted in capacity constraints and service  issues at certain junctions and corridors within the rail network. These  constraints and service issues will all affect the ability of both passenger  and freight rail carriers to provide the quality and frequency of service the  carriers may be asked to provide.", "Any reform that changes the type and frequency of intercity passenger rail  service will need to address system infrastructure access and capacity  issues. In doing so, any federal policy responses regarding freight  infrastructure should consider several things in this regard: (1) subsidies  can distort the performance of markets; (2) the federal fiscal environment  is constrained; (3) policy responses should occur within the context of a  National Freight Policy that reflects system-performance-based goals and a  framework for intergovernmental and public-private cooperation; and (4)  federal involvement should occur where demonstrable wide-ranging public  benefits\u2014and mechanisms to appropriately allocate the cost of financing  these benefits\u2014exist between the public and private sectors. In addition,  federal involvement should focus on benefits that are more national than  local in scope.", "Freight railroads have other concerns as well. These include concerns  about liability issues\u2014that is, adequate protection against the risks of  accidents involving passenger trains using their lines. In general, freight  railroads seek full indemnification against any risks that might exist  because of passenger rail service. See appendix V for a more complete  discussion of infrastructure access, capacity, and liability issues.", "Workforce Issues and Challenges Finally, efforts to reform intercity passenger rail require consideration of  workforce issues. That is, having enough people with the requisite  knowledge and skills to provide the amount and type of service called for in  a reformed system. There are several issues that need to be considered in  this regard, including the following:  Availability of a qualified labor pool. The reform of intercity passenger  rail resulting in new services or operators will require that there be  sufficient staff to provide service, conduct maintenance, and perform  other duties related to running passenger railroads. In the short term,  obtaining sufficient staff could be a challenge. As we reported in April  2006 (in the context of commuter railroad services), if Amtrak were to  abruptly cease to provide service, some commuter railroad agencies  would be able to replace Amtrak employees dedicated to their particular  commuter rail service with employees from another railroad.  However, there were a number of agencies that said they would not be  able to quickly replace current Amtrak employees because of workforce  limitations, such as the availability of a qualified labor pool.", "Workforce flexibility and productivity. Reform of intercity passenger  rail resulting in new services or operators will also require consideration  of workforce flexibility and the extent that labor productivity can be  increased. One key to providing cost effective intercity passenger rail  service is to have high levels of labor productivity. Collective bargaining  agreements and their related work rules specify the work that  employees are expected to do and the amount of compensation they will  receive for performing this work. Although such agreements can and do  include changes designed to increase employee productivity by  increasing or broadening the types of tasks that employees can perform,  such agreements can also affect productivity by limiting the amount or  type of work that employees can perform.", "Potential labor protection payments. If, as the result of a reform of  intercity passenger rail, Amtrak employees lose their jobs, there could  be liability for labor protection payments. In general, labor protection  payments are made to employees who lose their jobs as a result of a  discontinuation of service. The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act  of 1997 made a number of changes to labor protection, including  eliminating the statutory right to such protection; this made labor  protection subject to collective bargaining, and required Amtrak to  negotiate new labor protection arrangements with its employees.  Amtrak labor-relations officials observed that bringing labor protection  under collective bargaining (and therefore subject to the constraints of  the Railway Labor Act), as opposed to being statutorily mandated, has  actually limited Amtrak\u2019s flexibility to respond to marketplace changes.  They observed that their flexibility was reduced because it is generally  easier to change a statutory requirement than it is to change a collective  bargaining agreement. With regard to the potential magnitude of labor  protection payments, in September 2002 we reported that Amtrak would  have had potential unsecured labor protection claims of about $3.2  billion had it been liquidated on December 31, 2001.   Although any  restructuring might not involve a bankruptcy, potential labor protection  payments could still be substantial if employees lose their jobs.", "Workforce challenges also include determining how a potentially reformed  intercity passenger rail system fits into the current scheme of railroad- specific labor\u2013management relations, retirement, and injury-compensation  systems. Amtrak is currently subject to, among other laws, the Railway  Labor Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, and the Federal Employers\u2019  Liability Act, which govern labor\u2013management relations, retirement, and  injury compensation, respectively, in the railroad industry. Amtrak\u2019s  collective bargaining agreements generally do not expire and are subject to  requirements designed to reduce labor strikes; Amtrak participates in, and  provides financial contributions to, the railroad retirement-system  (approximately $400 million annually); and Amtrak and its employees are  subject to a tort-based injury compensation system under the Federal  Employers\u2019 Liability Act. We have reported that these legal requirements  raise railroad costs compared to nonrailroad industries. Amtrak\u2019s April  2005 Strategic Reform Initiatives also suggested that meaningful reform of  intercity passenger rail will require changing how some of these  requirements apply to passenger rail. On the other hand, rail labor has  argued for the importance of these laws in protecting employee rights,  providing critical retirement benefits, and adequately compensating  employees injured on the job.", "State officials with whom we spoke expressed general concerns about the  potential impact of Amtrak\u2019s labor agreements and obligations on the  future of passenger rail. Some state officials viewed Amtrak\u2019s labor  agreements as a significant barrier to restructuring. One official stated that  serious labor reform is needed for intercity passenger rail reform to  succeed. State officials also questioned whether alternative operators  would be bound by Amtrak\u2019s labor agreements and thought that it was  unlikely another operator could provide significant improvements in cost  savings if they were. Another official stated that Amtrak\u2019s labor agreements  would put Amtrak at a considerable disadvantage over alternative  operators in a competitive market if the alternative operators were not  bound by the same agreements.", "Rail labor union officials with whom we spoke expressed several concerns  about the effects any potential reform of intercity passenger rail might have  on their members. First and foremost, union officials told us of their  concern about the history of Amtrak\u2019s successive reforms and said these  reforms had a detrimental effect on union employees. In their view, past  Amtrak reforms have brought fewer union jobs and the loss of health and  safety programs with no real improvement in Amtrak\u2019s financial  performance or service to the public. Union officials also told us that any  reform should attempt to make Amtrak, among other things, find new  leadership dedicated to working with employees and growing the business,  fix basic business practices, and improve customer service. Finally, union  officials emphasized that rail labor is the monopoly workforce for  passenger rail. Any reforms of intercity passenger rail would still require  any operator\u2014Amtrak, alternative operators, or a successor to Amtrak\u2014to  work through the unions to maintain a labor force. Rail union officials  noted the success of the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad, which  provides commuter rail service in and around Boston, Massachusetts. In  this instance, a private operator took over operations from Amtrak and was  able to maintain existing work rules (collective bargaining agreement  provisions that specify tasks employees can perform) while offering a 24- percent increase in wages.", "See appendix VI for more information about workforce issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Sector Issues and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Private sector issues and challenges primarily focus on what role, if any,  the private sector will play in any reformed intercity passenger rail system.  Currently, there is little private sector involvement beyond the  infrastructure provided by freight railroads to operate intercity passenger  rail service. Amtrak is the sole operator of intercity passenger rail service,  and, although organized as a private, for-profit corporation, is heavily  dependent on federal subsidies to remain solvent. In general, there are no  other private sector operators outside of leisure travel providers such as  GrandLuxe Rail Journeys (previously American Orient Express). This  contrasts with the pre-1971 situation when, before Amtrak began service,  freight railroads provided all intercity passenger rail service.", "There are suggestions that the private sector could play a larger role,  including being contract operators under a system in which competition  and bidding is used to select service providers. For example, Amtrak\u2019s April  2005 Strategic Reform Initiatives suggests that there are opportunities for  increased competition, and part of Amtrak\u2019s vision for itself under these  initiatives is to evolve into one of a number of competitors for contracts to  provide passenger rail service. However, there are a number of issues  associated with increasing the private sector role in intercity passenger  rail. These issues include the following:  Availability of potential private sector operators. Since Amtrak is the  sole provider of intercity passenger rail service, there has been little  opportunity to test the market for potential new operators. However,  there are indications that potential operators may exist and may be  willing to participate in any opportunities that might arise, especially  corridor service. For example, an official of one firm with worldwide  rail and transportation operations said he believes there is a U.S. market  for rail service in corridors\u2014especially corridors with city-pairs 100 to  300 miles apart. An official from another firm with extensive passenger  rail operations in the U.K. said his firm is very much interested in  entering the U.S. passenger rail market, especially in operating the NEC.  In his opinion, the NEC is a very viable corridor and could be wholly or  partially privatized.", "Costs of private sector operators and the need for public subsidies. One  of the key questions associated with competition and the use of private  sector operators is how costs will change, and whether public subsidies  can be reduced or eliminated. Again, since the U.S. market has not been  tested, it is difficult to know what the specific cost or subsidy impacts  from competition might be. On the one hand, European experience has  shown that franchising and competitive bidding has not necessarily  reduced the need for government subsidies. In fact, in 2 of the European  countries we visited (Germany and the U.K.) there is substantial  government financial involvement in competitively bid systems. On the  other hand, in the U.K., some franchise operators have recently been  financially successful enough to allow them to pay the  government a premium for excess profits they have made. Aside from  government financial assistance, foreign officials also pointed to other  things\u2014such as increases in ridership and quality of service\u2014as the  benefits of a more competitive system. For example, data from the  Association of Train Operating Companies indicate that passenger rail  ridership in the U.K. increased about 38 percent over roughly the last  decade (from about 745 million trips to just over 1 billion trips  annually). The largest growth was in the long-distance market.  Similarly, government data show that the number of complaints per  100,000 passenger trips in the U.K. generally decreased from about 120  in April 1999 to 70 in April 2005.", "Potential requirements to encourage private sector participation.", "There may be certain requirements for encouraging private sector  participation in providing intercity passenger rail service. These  requirements may include maintaining Amtrak\u2019s current statutory rights  of infrastructure access. An official from one firm with worldwide  transportation operations with whom we spoke emphasized that access  to tracks, stations, rights-of-way, and maintenance facilities would be  key for his firm and other operators to be successful participants in the  intercity passenger rail market. This firm would look to states or Amtrak  to provide these access arrangements prior to their taking over  operations. Officials from all 5 states we talked to agreed there would be  a number of barriers to competition and that access issues would be a  critical issue. Flexibility in allowing firms to branch into nonrail  operations may also be important. In Japan, passenger rail officials told  us that their firms not only provide passenger rail service but are also  involved in other activities such as real estate development, retail  stores, and light manufacturing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Funding Issues also Present Challenges", "paragraphs": ["There are also a number of challenges associated with funding for intercity  passenger rail service. One is identifying funding sources to meet long-term  funding needs. Being in a capital intensive business, intercity passenger rail  has substantial ongoing and long-term funding needs. For example, Amtrak  is currently receiving over $1 billion annually in federal subsidies and it has  an estimated $6 billion in deferred capital backlog of infrastructure  improvements, including about $4 billion on the NEC. In March 2006, the  DOT OIG reported that, for fiscal year 2007, Amtrak would need about $1.4  billion just to maintain Amtrak and keep its system from falling into further  disrepair. This would not include amounts to address the backlog of  capital maintenance, invest in short-distance corridors, or renew  equipment. This official went on to say that none of the corridors around  the country, including the NEC, can provide the type of mobility needed  without significant capital investment. This limitation applies to the  development of new corridors as well, including high-speed rail corridors.  As we testified in April 2003, the total cost to develop high-speed rail  corridors is unknown because these types of corridors are in various stages  of planning. However, the costs could be substantial. The American  Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials\u2014a trade  association of state and local transportation officials\u2014has reported that  about $60 billion would be required to develop these corridors, including  Amtrak\u2019s NEC, over a 20-year period.", "Funding challenges also include finding funding sources to meet whatever  national intercity passenger rail policy goals are established. Currently,  virtually all federal funding for intercity passenger rail comes from general  appropriations; therefore, intercity passenger rail must compete with a  myriad of other needs to obtain funding. This practice allows Congress to  set spending priorities. As discussed earlier, the existence of funding  sources to meet national policy goals was a component in many foreign  passenger rail reform efforts. Even in Canada, where there was no major  restructuring, the government was willing to commit, albeit not on a formal  basis, to identifying funding amounts so as to provide a stable level of  annual operating funding for its intercity passenger rail provider, VIA Rail.  This commitment has continued for about 8 years and through several  changes in government. According to Transport Canada officials, this  commitment allowed VIA Rail management some stability in planning.  They also said that, while there was no explicit rationale for the amounts  provided, the objective was clearly to \u201cset VIA\u2019s feet to the fire\u201d by not  increasing the subsidy. However, reducing the level of support would make  it difficult to preserve services. Finding funding sources to meet national  policy goals for intercity passenger rail will not be easy, especially as the  nation faces increasing fiscal constraints at the federal level. As discussed  earlier in this report, the federal government faces significant fiscal  challenges in future years and will need to reexamine its role and financial  support for virtually all federal programs, including intercity passenger rail.  The challenge will be in finding a funding source(s) that can meet long-term  needs while retaining the accountability of an annual appropriations  process.", "Funding challenges include aligning the decision making for, and the  benefits of, intercity passenger rail service with the responsibility for  paying for such service. Currently, there is a basic misalignment in these  elements. Historically, states have not been required to subsidize basic  intercity passenger rail service. States may subsidize additional service that  would benefit residents. As discussed earlier, in fiscal year 2005, 13 states  paid about $140 million to subsidize additional service from Amtrak.  However, there were over 30 states that did not subsidize intercity  passenger rail service even though such service was provided in their state.  In general, Amtrak is the focal point for decision making about what  intercity passenger rail service is provided and where. Under this  structure, some states benefit from having intercity passenger rail service  but play little role in deciding what service is provided or in subsidizing the  services received. Some states are aware of the benefits of this structure\u2014 for example, an official from one state we contacted told us that Amtrak is  \u201ca great deal\u201d for the state because the state pays nothing for service, even  though there are numerous Amtrak trains that operate daily within the  state. This official said his state would like to see additional service, but the  state has little voice in the matter because the state does not pay. On the  other hand, an official with another state said his state believes it is paying  an inequitable amount for service compared to other states. As we reported  in April 2003, the willingness and ability of states to provide and maintain  financial support for intercity passenger rail is unknown. This willingness  and ability is a challenge that will need to be considered in aligning the  decision making and benefits of intercity passenger rail with payment for  such benefits.", "Finally, funding challenges will involve developing incentives to ensure  participation and cost sharing by states and other stakeholders. Currently,  there are few means for cost sharing of federal and nonfederal  expenditures on intercity passenger rail. The current funding structure  provides appropriations for both federal operating and capital  improvement funds directly to Amtrak by way of grant agreements. These  grant agreements specify what federal funds are to be used for but do not  require Amtrak or others to contribute matching funds, either for operating  or capital purposes. Some other federal surface transportation programs  require matching contributions to create incentives and leverage federal  funds. For example, the Federal-aid Highway program generally limits the  federal financial share of the cost of highway projects (generally 80 percent  of costs) and requires states or others to contribute matching funds for the  remaining cost of such projects. Similarly, federal statute limits the  maximum federal share for some mass transit projects and requires project  sponsors to contribute matching funds. In fact, one of the criteria the  Federal Transit Administration considers in selecting new transit projects  to finance under its New Starts program is the amount of local financial  commitment. The absence of similar cost sharing mechanisms makes it  difficult for intercity passenger rail projects to compete for federal or state  dollars.", "The equitable and sustainable response to funding challenges is more  complex than providing some \u201ccomparable\u201d funding for intercity passenger  rail to that provided for other transport modes. First, while advocates for  increased federal support for passenger rail often cite the billions of dollars  provided to highways and airports, in fact these funds are derived from  explicit taxes or user fees. Second, in spite of the historical user-based  funding of these modes, we have recently reported that commitments made  are no longer sustainable; there is an urgent need for identifying new, more  sustainable, and adequate funding to support the defined federal role.  Finally, the modal comparisons of the magnitude of federal funding are  most appropriately grounded in the magnitude of current and potential  public benefits. As such, the order of magnitude of public funds to support  intercity passenger rail would appropriately be grounded in the role  intercity passenger rail does (or could) play in national mobility, relative to  the dominance of highway and air travel for medium- and long-distance  travel and the public benefits that would result. Any consideration of  dedicated funding for intercity passenger rail also needs to account for the  potential downsides of such funding. In May 2006, we reported that, despite  the advantages of dedicated funding, there are risks of revenue volatility  and loss of budgetary flexibility. That is, there is a risk that revenues may  fluctuate and not meet funding expectations; and, that setting government  funds aside for a specific use may affect the funding available for other  spending priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Not Addressing Challenges Will Hinder Opportunities to Increase the Benefits of Federal and Nonfederal Intercity Passenger Rail Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["Not addressing the challenges discussed earlier may very well hinder  opportunities to increase the benefits of both federal and nonfederal  expenditures on intercity passenger rail. Amtrak has efforts under way to  analyze and implement various changes to its operations to reduce costs,  increase efficiency, and move states closer to paying for the services they  receive. Although these efforts are a step in the right direction, they are  expected to have only marginal impacts on the financial performance of  intercity passenger rail service. These efforts will not, and should not be  expected to, address some of the more fundamental reform elements (e.g.,  clearly defining both a national policy and stakeholder roles for intercity  passenger rail service, and finding funding to support national policy goals)  associated with increasing public benefits provided by intercity passenger  rail service. Amtrak itself has said that its existence is not a substitute for a  national policy. The incremental changes being taken by Amtrak do not  necessarily go to the root of the challenges that policymakers need to  address to bring about increased public benefits of any federal expenditure  on intercity passenger rail service.", "Not addressing the challenges makes it likely that a well-defined role for  federal subsidies for intercity passenger rail in the United States will also  remain elusive. As CRS reported in June 2006, Congress has essentially  reached a stalemate with respect to Amtrak and intercity passenger rail.  This stalemate was illustrated by the fact that both the 107th and 108th  Congresses were unable to reauthorize funding for Amtrak or reach  consensus on what kind of passenger rail system it would be willing to  fund. This stalemate has largely continued in the 109th Congress. As  discussed earlier, part of this stalemate has resulted from the wide diversity  of views and opinions on how the intercity passenger rail system should be  structured, what role the federal government, states, and others should  play in the system, and required funding levels. All of these speak to the  fundamental challenges described above.", "Finally, addressing challenges has been integral to reform efforts elsewhere  in the world. Although passenger rail reform efforts worldwide are still  largely evolving and continue to face challenges, addressing such  challenges has been part of moving forward. For example, in the early  2000s, the U.K. realized it faced problems with insufficient infrastructure  investment and rising costs of train operators. In response, a new structure  was developed that changed the infrastructure manager and the  governance structure of this manager, and significantly increased  government involvement in specifying the services to be provided by train  operating franchises. The U.K. has also established a process that will  develop expected national outputs for its passenger rail system in 2007,  develop a cost estimate for these outputs, and ensure that adequate funds  are available to support these outputs. Accompanying this output  document will be a broader and longer-term strategy document looking  ahead to about 2035. Similarly, to address the costs of intercity passenger  rail service and growing federal budget pressures, Canada initially  considerably reduced VIA Rail\u2019s annual subsidy from 1992 to 1998 from  $344 million (Canadian) to $171 million (Canadian), then imposed informal  caps on VIA Rail\u2019s operating subsidy. Along with the caps came informal  funding commitments designed to facilitate management stability in  planning. The funding also came with incentives by allowing VIA Rail to  finance capital improvements or meet operating shortfalls by retaining any  annual operating subsidy amounts not used. Further, Japan addressed  funding challenges associated with financially weak passenger rail systems  by establishing a business stabilization fund that is expected to provide  sufficient income to continue operations without using an annual federal  subsidy. Japanese rail officials told us that the business stabilization fund  has allowed smaller railroads to operate more independently of  government interference."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options for the Future of Intercity Passenger Rail Will Determine the Level of Federal Involvement", "paragraphs": ["As the federal government is the primary provider of funds, oversight, and  direction for intercity passenger rail service, federal policy makers should  take the lead in deciding what the federal government\u2019s role in intercity  passenger rail service should be and what changes, if any, need to be made  to its goals, structure, and funding. Using our previous work, the work of  other government agencies, and our review of other selected countries, we  defined four basic options that represent the potential range of options for  reforming intercity passenger rail service in the United States. They are  maintaining the status quo, introducing incremental changes within the  existing structure, discontinuing federal support, and restructuring the  entire intercity passenger rail system. This section discusses each option  separately, although some combination of these options could also be  implemented. All four options for the future of intercity passenger rail  present challenges that could impede both their selection and their  effectiveness once chosen. Of the four options, however, restructuring  presents the opportunity to substantially improve the intercity passenger  rail system. This option would allow Congress and policymakers to  establish intercity passenger rail\u2019s goals, define the roles of stakeholders,  and develop funding mechanisms that provide performance and  accountability for intercity passenger rail expenditures. Any substantial  reorganization of intercity passenger rail will be difficult and can be  expected to occur over a long period of time.", "In the sections that follow, we (1) lay out the framework for examining the  options, (2) describe each option in more detail, and (3) offer observations  on the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges associated with each  option."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fundamental Reexamination Criteria and Key Components of Decision-Making Framework Could Help Guide Consideration of Options for Future Federal Role in Intercity Passenger Rail", "paragraphs": ["It is important for federal policy makers to determine whether or not the  federal government should be involved in intercity passenger rail and, if so,  how federal participation can be both cost-effective and sustainable,  particularly in light of the federal government\u2019s long-term structural fiscal  imbalance. In our report on 21st century challenges facing the federal  government, we defined a set of fundamental reexamination criteria that  are useful for evaluating the federal role in any government program,  policy, function or activity. The criteria are designed to address the  legislative basis for the program, its purpose and continued relevance, its  effectiveness in achieving goals and outcomes, its efficiency and targeting,  its affordability, its sustainability, and its management. These fundamental  criteria can be used to inform and evaluate the continued federal  involvement in intercity passenger rail service (see table 4 below for an  example of how these criteria may be applied).", "If policy makers determine that there is a clear federal role in subsidization  of intercity passenger rail service, the implementation of that role should  have several essential elements.

Some examples of ways that substantial  restructuring could be implemented could include the following:   continuing corridor intercity routes where the benefits of intercity  passenger rail are higher while discontinuing long distance routes where  the benefits are lower;  restructuring Amtrak into separate companies;  transferring Amtrak-owned infrastructure to a compact or commission  of states to oversee its operations and improvements;  creating competition for federal- and state-subsidized routes between  private operators and Amtrak;   providing a one-time endowment to Amtrak as an incentive for it to run  as a more market-oriented business without continued federal  involvement and support; or   providing states flexible capital matching grants to create their own  solutions to transportation needs, including intercity passenger rail  service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establish Goals for Restructured Intercity Passenger Rail Service", "paragraphs": ["Under this option, policy makers would determine that there are sufficient  public benefits at a national level to justify subsidies for an intercity  passenger rail service that is different from the current structure.

For  example, furthering this goal could include using federal subsidies for  intercity passenger rail to: reduce highway congestion, increase intermodal  connectivity, provide environmental benefits, or increase redundancy in  regional or urban transportation. Specifically, one of the goals under this  option could be to increase the use of intercity passenger rail service  between major cities with trip times under 3 hours. Two examples of how  this goal could be achieved include the U.K. model of intercity passenger  rail service or the German model for regional rail service. In both  models, passenger rail operating companies openly bid for the lowest  amount of government subsidy to operate a specific route. These franchise  agreements are multiyear contracts backed by either national or regional  government subsidies. The operator would collect ticket revenues and the  agreed-upon government subsidy to operate a specific level of service over  the route. This approach makes the government an explicit buyer of  intercity passenger rail services from a private operator and increases the  transparency of costs for a given level of service. Contracts for service  could include operational and capital expenditures and specify such things  as service frequency, trip length, stops, a payment schedule, and  performance metrics.", "Importantly, spending federal funds for intercity passenger rail service to  increase public benefits will not necessarily lower the cost of providing  intercity passenger rail service.

In order to  ensure that intercity passenger rail service does not significantly interfere  with freight rail service, any restructuring approach should also take into  consideration the national freight transportation policy currently being  developed by DOT.", "One of the more challenging areas to define roles is the NEC, where  Amtrak is the owner of most of the infrastructure while many other  railroads are the main users. As discussed above, participation is uneven  and the vital infrastructure is not being maintained effectively. One  structure that could facilitate a federal\u2013state partnership to manage the  NEC could resemble the Delta Regional Commission or the Appalachian  Regional Commission. These commissions consist of a group of states and  a federal representative to foster partnerships between state and federal  government entities and distribute economic development funds  throughout a specified economically distressed region.

However,  the scarcity of federal funds puts a premium on sharing costs of equipment,  infrastructure, and service.

For example, some funding to subsidize federal and state intercity  passenger rail service could be provided through taxes paid by, or franchise  payments received from, private operators on those routes that may be  profitable and not require a subsidy (as is the case for some railroads in  Japan). Capital funds used to increase capacity, reduce bottlenecks, and  increase train speeds (especially on freight railroad owned track) could  come from existing federal taxes, including taxes on railroads or fuel taxes.  For example, regional governments in Germany are allocated funds from a  federal automobile fuel tax to support regional (i.e., short-distance,  intraregion) passenger rail service. This is not necessarily a new tax\u2014 rather, it is a change in how these funds are allocated by the German  federal government. Another funding option would be for the federal  government to create an endowment or \u201cbusiness stabilization fund,\u201d such  as was used in Japan, to stabilize its smaller privatized railroads. This  endowment would help Amtrak transition from being dependent on federal  support to being a more market-based company. Any funding for a  stabilization fund would need to recognize the fiscal constraints on the  federal government and competing priorities. During the privatization of its  national railroad system, the Japanese national government identified the  railroads that were least likely to be profitable and provided them with a  one-time set-aside of government funds to provide continuous interest  income for those railroads.

Rather, the scope of our work was intended to identify a  series of options that might exist for addressing the future federal role in  intercity passenger rail service.", "To determine the characteristics of the current U.S. intercity passenger rail  system we collected information on all of the National Railroad Passenger  Corporation\u2019s (Amtrak) routes, including ridership, revenues and costs,  federal grants and state payments to Amtrak, and on-time performance for  fiscal years 2000 through 2005. We also gathered and analyzed data  provided by Amtrak to determine passenger demographics, connectivity  between routes, and the potential transportation benefits and public  benefits provided by Amtrak\u2019s different route types. We utilized route  ridership data provided by Amtrak from their \u201cdata warehouse\u201d database.  To assess the reliability of this data and address discrepancies from figures  reported in Amtrak\u2019s Route Profitability System (RPS), we conducted  interviews with Amtrak officials and assessed the methodology used to  develop this database. Based on this assessment, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To evaluate the financial  performance of Amtrak\u2019s routes, we utilized information from the RPS  database. Due to previously identified concerns regarding the reliability of  this database, we conducted an interview with Amtrak\u2019s Chief Financial  Officer, reviewed documentation of RPS\u2019s sources and methodology, and  compared route-related financial information to Amtrak\u2019s \u201cdata  warehouse\u201d database to determine any major discrepancies. While these  databases exhibit some variation due to the reporting format and source  information, we determined that the financial information provided by the  RPS database was sufficiently reliable to illustrate aggregate route-related  costs, and general trends between Amtrak\u2019s different route types, for the  purposes of this report. For the purposes of reporting on-time performance  we utilized data provided by Amtrak. We compared these figures to other  reports issued by Amtrak and the Department of Transportation (DOT) and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To  determine passenger demographic information, we utilized survey data for  all long-distance routes and select corridor routes in the Northeast and  California in 2004 and 2005; these data were provided by Amtrak and  collected by a third party contractor to Amtrak. We did not independently  determine the accuracy or precision of Amtrak's survey estimates,  however, based on our understanding of the overall survey methodology,  we determined that the estimates were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes in illustrating general demographic differences in riders across  route types. Finally, to identify potential transportation benefits and public  benefits provided by intercity passenger rail, we spoke with officials in five  states; private transportation companies; and transportation officials in  several foreign countries.

We  conducted interviews with World Bank and European Commission  officials, and using these reports and interviews, we developed criteria for  selecting countries for site visits. These criteria included: the extent of rail  privatization or competition introduced, geographic characteristics, market  characteristics, national funding levels and sources, and the legislative  regulatory environment. We reviewed data for Australia, Canada, France,  Germany, Japan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (U.K.).

We used the three key lessons learned from the five  countries as our criteria for assessing how well the United States is  positioned to reform intercity passenger rail; these criteria were (1) clearly  defining national policy goals; (2) clearly defining the various roles and  responsibilities of all government entities involved; and (3) establishing  consistent committed funding for intercity passenger rail. For example, we  compared the current U.S. intercity passenger rail policy to policies formed  in other countries during the process of reform. A limitation of our  assessment is that we only focused on comparing the United States to five  countries with relatively different compositions in railroad infrastructure  ownership, freight and passenger railroad markets, geography, and  demographics. To determine the extent to which Amtrak\u2019s efforts address  the three criteria, we obtained and analyzed a list of planned and under-way  initiatives from Amtrak. We also reviewed Amtrak\u2019s April 2005 Strategic  Reform Initiatives, congressional hearings on intercity passenger rail, and  DOT\u2019s financial study on Amtrak\u2019s initiatives. In addition, we interviewed  Amtrak officials about the status of reform initiatives and intercity  passenger rail reform in general.", "To address the challenges associated with addressing reform elements we  reviewed pertinent legislation related to federal involvement with Amtrak  and intercity passenger rail issues. We also reviewed various legislative  proposals that have been introduced in recent years addressing intercity  passenger rail issues and reviewed Amtrak\u2019s April 2005 Strategic Reform  Initiatives to identify the wide diversity of views on what intercity  passenger rail service can and should be. We also obtained data from  Amtrak showing state payments in fiscal year 2005 for additional passenger  rail service and state contributions for capital improvement projects. We  reviewed our previous reports addressing, among other things,  infrastructure access and workforce issues, as well as Amtrak management  and performance issues. We also reviewed reports from the CBO and the  Department of Energy, and testimony from the Association of American  Railroads on infrastructure capacity issues.

We used the types and  amounts of costs incurred by Amtrak and the commuter railroads to  develop a comparison that highlights the differences between Amtrak\u2019s  access agreements and access agreements negotiated under commercial  arrangements. We did not perform a quantitative analysis of the differences  in access charges between Amtrak and commuter railroads. Rather, our  focus was limited to a qualitative description of the types and ranges of  costs. Finally, we interviewed officials from Amtrak, the Federal Railroad  Administration (FRA), state departments of transportation, rail labor  unions, and freight railroads about issues they see in addressing the  potential reform of intercity passenger rail.

Thus far, 15 operational  initiatives have been developed, which are described as either corporate or  business-line initiatives (see table 9). Recently, to further develop these  initiatives, Amtrak has begun to refine the structure of these initiatives into  five issue areas: (1) business efficiencies, (2) service levels, (3) cost  recovery, (4) labor, and (5) legislative. According to Amtrak, most of the 15  initiatives will fall into the business efficiency category, which the company  views as having greater control over. The labor, long-distance, corridor, and  infrastructure initiatives will fall within more than one of the categories,  and full implementation of these initiatives would require legislative action.  In addition, initiatives associated with each of the train operations business  lines (long distance, NEC, and state corridor) will fall under all five  categories.", "Amtrak\u2019s 15 initiatives are largely designed to reduce costs, increase  revenue, and improve its financial reporting.

The NEC operations initiative is designed to increase revenue, partly  through the implementation of revenue management on NEC\u2019s Regional  Service, by charging variable rates.  The management information  initiative calls for reforming how Amtrak currently reports financial and  operating information. Amtrak\u2019s Chief Financial Officer told us that reports  to management will focus more on performance outcomes, such as  performance per passenger mile.

In addition, the potential liability associated with operating  passenger rail must be accounted for, as must statutory and contractual  workforce requirements. Currently, the liability framework surrounding  intercity passenger rail is complex, with statutory exceptions and  negotiated indemnification agreements altering default negligence rules."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Infrastructure Access and Capacity Issues", "paragraphs": ["Amtrak\u2019s statutory access and priority rights for intercity passenger  service\u2014and the subsequent impact on freight capacity\u2014is a source of  contention in the rail industry. Amtrak owns very little of the infrastructure  that it uses, and, in fact, most of the 22,000 miles of rail lines that Amtrak  uses are owned by four private, U.S.-based Class I freight companies\u2014CSX,  Union Pacific, BNSF, and Norfolk Southern. Amtrak has three statutory  rights to privately owned rail infrastructure that no other operator has: (1)  access to tracks and facilities of railroads and regional transportation  authorities; (2) access charges at incremental cost; and (3) priority over  freight trains.", "No other passenger rail service receives the benefit of statutory rights. For  instance, commuter rail agencies must negotiate with host railroads for  infrastructure access. Similarly, any private operator of intercity passenger  rail in the United States would have to negotiate for access to host-railroad  infrastructure without the benefit of these statutory rights. Because other  operators do not have these statutory rights, one state official said that his  state feels \u201cstuck\u201d with Amtrak. This state official said his state is  frustrated because there is no real alternative to Amtrak as long as these  rights belong solely to Amtrak. The freight railroad industry is adamantly  opposed to permitting a transfer of Amtrak access and incremental charge  rights to non-Amtrak operators, which was confirmed by officials from  freight railroads with whom we spoke.", "One state official told us that, without Amtrak\u2019s access rights, passenger  rail access fees are a \u201cseller\u2019s market\u201d\u2014that is, freight railroads can charge  whatever they want. State officials with whom we spoke generally estimate  that Amtrak\u2019s per train-mile costs are approximately one quarter to one half  of what the freight railroads would charge another operator. Similarly, an  official from one freight railroad estimated that infrastructure access costs  for an intercity passenger rail operator negotiating \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d would  be three to four times Amtrak\u2019s current costs, and possibly as high as ten  times as much as current rates. According to this official, even these rates  would not capture the full impact of passenger trains on freight line  capacity.", "While Amtrak\u2019s access costs cannot be directly compared with a competing  intercity passenger rail operator, a comparison with commuter rail access  costs is informative. According to information provided by Amtrak, on  average, Amtrak paid $1.16 per train-mile for access to freight-owned  infrastructure in fiscal year 2005. In contrast, commuter rail agencies with  whom we spoke that operate primarily on freight railroad infrastructure  identified three types of access charges: per train-mile fees, fixed-access  fees, and capital contributions. All of these commuter agencies reported  paying per train-mile access fees for each line, with a range from $3.38 to  $40 per train-mile. These agencies reported paying either a one-time up  front access fee or an annual access fee for most lines as well (see table  10). In addition, all four commuter rail agencies with whom we spoke made  capital contributions to freight infrastructure for each line, either to gain  initial access to the freight infrastructure or to expand established  commuter rail operations. According to Amtrak, commuter rail trains\u2014 which are concentrated in the morning and evening weekday peak periods  and have long track occupancy due to frequent stops\u2014require greater rail  line capacity, and therefore, impose much higher costs on the track owner  than a comparable number of intercity passenger rail trains that are spread  throughout the day or week.", "According to several state officials, increases in intercity passenger rail  service, particularly corridor services, could conflict with freight rail traffic  for line capacity. For example, one state official stated that the rail lines  between New York City and Albany, New York, are heavily used by freight  railroads, commuter rail service, and Amtrak. Even today this line has  congestion problems, leading to delays for both passenger and freight  traffic. Desired improvements to address capacity restrictions will cost  about $700 million in capital improvements. An official with another state,  talking about the line between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia,  said that\u2014between freight, Amtrak, and commuter service\u2014the amount of  traffic on the corridor is increasing and delays are becoming more  common. Further, capacity constraints are causing delays that cause  dissatisfaction among riders.", "Freight railroad officials have emphasized the growing challenge  associated with infrastructure capacity issues. An official at one railroad  said that, while freight traffic on his railroad had grown and decreased  capacity, nothing in the Amtrak model had changed, which he described as  increasing his railroad\u2019s subsidy to Amtrak. An official of another railroad  stated that under the current Amtrak model\u2014with guaranteed access to  track at incremental cost\u2014freight railroads do not recover the lost value  created when freight trains are delayed because of passenger train priority.  He also stated that the current Amtrak model skews the incremental value  of freight and passenger train slots on a line in such a way that freight  railroads cannot capture the difference in value between low value  passenger train slots and higher value freight train slots. This official went  on to say that, without new capacity, there would be ripple effects  throughout the entire freight railroad industry as both freight and  passenger railroads try to accommodate ever-increasing traffic on a fixed- infrastructure network. He also stated that for intercity passenger rail to be  successful it must be attractive, efficient, and reliable.", "In addressing capacity issues associated with passenger rail reform it will  be important to recognize balancing public and private investment with  public and private benefits. An official with the Washington State  Department of Transportation said his state is willing to pay for capital  projects that benefit passenger rail, and that freight railroads should pay  for projects, or parts of projects, that benefit their operations. This official  said most states use the \u201cbut for\u201d argument in determining public rail  infrastructure investments\u2014that is, would there be a need for investment  but for the passenger rail service? Similarly, the state of Virginia works with  host railroads to fund rail projects that increase both the freight and  passenger rail capacity of privately owned rail infrastructure in the state to  achieve public benefits. As we testified in June 2006, federal involvement  with rail infrastructure should depend on identifying wide-ranging public  benefits from potential projects and appropriately allocate the cost of  financing these benefits between public and private sectors, and, to the  extent possible, focus investments that yield national rather than just local  benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Liability against Accident Risks", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the access-to-infrastructure issues, there are also challenges  associated with liability against accident and other train-related risks. If a  passenger rail accident should occur, injured passengers may sue the  transportation provider for their damages. As our January 2004 report on  commuter rail noted, freight railroads have been traditionally sheltered  from this exposure when they haul freight. However, when a freight  railroad allows a commuter rail service (or intercity passenger rail service)  to operate over its rights-of-way, the freight railroad becomes exposed to  these risks\u2014as passengers may sue the commuter rail\u2019s (or intercity  passenger rail\u2019s) provider and owner of the tracks. Consequently, freight  railroads do not want to allow such service on their rights-of-way unless  they are protected from liability. Freight railroads often use the \u201cbut for\u201d  argument for requiring passenger rail operators to assume all risks  associated with their presence\u2014that is, but for the presence of the service,  the freight railroad would not be exposed to certain risks and therefore  should be held harmless. Freight railroad officials have stated that they  must take this position to protect their businesses and shareholders from  lawsuits. As a result, passenger rail operators must contractually indemnify  freight railroads against all liability and obtain insurance as a guarantee  that payments will be made for any damages.", "Amtrak currently has no fault liability agreements with most freight  railroads to cover risks associated with its operations. Under these  agreements, Amtrak indemnifies the host railroads against liability  resulting from any damages that occur to Amtrak passengers, equipment,  or employees regardless of fault if an Amtrak train is involved. Similarly,  the host railroads indemnify Amtrak against any liability resulting from  damages to host railroad employees and property regardless of fault. At  one time, Amtrak compensated the host railroads for the risk that they bear  by paying a negotiated risk charge of 7.34 cents per train-mile to the host  railroad. Amtrak has subsequently negotiated away this charge for all but  one line. In contrast, commuter rail operators with whom we spoke  manage liability with the freight railroads their own way. In the view of one  commuter rail official, the host railroads charge his company more per  train-mile for infrastructure access that Amtrak to compensate for the  liability costs associated with commuter rail operations. Another  commuter rail official stated that in addition to the per train-mile fees, his  agency purchases an insurance policy that indemnifies the host railroads  against all liability, including gross negligence and willful misconduct.", "Both railroad and state officials with whom we spoke believe liability will  be a major issue should competition for intercity passenger rail service be  introduced. Officials from all 5 states cited concerns about liability issues,  particularly the potential cost of liability coverage. An official from one  state, Washington, told us that his state would not be able to pay for the  liability coverage freight railroads would require if Amtrak ceased  operating intercity passenger rail service and this service was taken over by  the state\u2014the cost would be too prohibitive. An official from California  also said that liability would be a significant issue associated with  competition. Besides cost, this official said California is prohibited by law  from providing full indemnification to third parties. Consequently, any non- Amtrak passenger rail operators would have to provide their own liability  coverage that would indemnify not only the state, but also any freight  railroads they operated over. Freight railroad operators also expressed  concern about liability issues. An official from one freight railroad said his  company would not \u201cbet the company\u201d on the liability risk that could exist  with multiple passenger rail operators, and that his company would expect  full indemnity against liability risks created by passenger rail operators. It  would also be expected that this indemnity be backed up with sufficient  insurance coverage similar to the arrangement this company currently has  with Amtrak. Similar sentiments were expressed by another freight  railroad official.", "Recognizing the freight railroads\u2019 exposure to liability when hosting  passenger rail trains, Congress established liability provisions in the  Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. Specifically, the act limits  the aggregate overall damages that may be awarded to all passengers for all  claims (including punitive damages) from a particular rail accident to $200  million. The act also permits Amtrak and other providers of rail  transportation to enter into indemnification agreements allocating financial  responsibility for passenger claims arising from accidents involving  passenger rail. As we reported in January 2004, our review of this  legislation concluded that the liability cap applies to commuter rail  operations on the basis of the plain language of the statute and our review  of pertinent legislative history. Our review of the statute and legislative  history also indicates this cap would apply to non-Amtrak providers of  intercity passenger rail service. However, our report goes on to note that  there are limitations to the protections provided by the legislation, such as  the fact that the legislation does not limit damages for claims brought by  nonpassengers; in addition, the application of the liability cap has not been  tested in federal court. As a result of these limitations many carriers are  being \u201csuper cautious\u201d in requiring high levels of insurance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Workforce Issues Associated with Intercity Passenger Rail Reform", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to reform or restructure intercity passenger rail require  consideration of workforce issues that is, having enough people with the  requisite knowledge and skills to provide the amount and type of service  called for in a restructured system. This may not be as easy as it seems.", "Amtrak employees currently provide a number of services that are integral  to operation of intercity passenger rail. This includes train and engine  crews that operate trains, on-board staff such as conductors and attendants  that take tickets and arrange for sleeping accommodations, and  maintenance staff that repair equipment and maintain the rights-of-way  over which trains operate. In addition, Amtrak employees dispatch trains  and maintain communication and signal systems, among other things. Over  the last several years Amtrak has reduced its employment levels as it has  tried to control costs (see fig. 17). In fiscal year 2005, 87 percent of  Amtrak\u2019s workforce was unionized (14 unions and two councils covering a  variety of crafts and skills) and covered by collective bargaining  agreements. These employees are referred to as agreement employees. The  collective bargaining agreements specify not only wage and benefit rates  but also specific duties (defined in work rules) that employees can  perform. Between fiscal years 2001 and 2005 the number of unionized  employees decreased from 22,163 to 16,687 (a 25 percent decrease). There  has also been an overall 7 percent decrease in non-union employees over  this time period, with a slight increase in the number of non-union  employees between fiscal years 2003 and 2005. While these decreases  might have benefits in terms of cost reduction, they might also limit the  pool of qualified people available to operate intercity passenger rail under a  restructuring scenario.", "There are several workforce issues that will likely present challenges in  efforts to reform or restructure intercity passenger rail. These include:  Availability of a qualified labor pool. Reform of intercity passenger rail  that results in new services or operators will require that there be  sufficient staff to provide service, conduct maintenance, and perform  other duties related to running passenger railroads. In the short term,  obtaining sufficient staff could be a challenge. As we reported in April  2006, in the context of commuter railroad service, if Amtrak were to  abruptly cease to provide service, some commuter railroad agencies  might be able to replace Amtrak employees dedicated to their particular  commuter rail service with employees from another railroad. However,  according to agency officials, a number of agencies would not be able to  quickly replace current Amtrak employees because of workforce  limitations, such as the availability of a qualified labor pool. In part, this  is because of strains on the current workforce due to growth in the  demand for freight rail transportation. In addition, it was estimated that  it could take months to train replacements if Amtrak train crews were  unavailable. Over the short term it is feasible that a restructuring that  resulted in new intercity passenger rail services could face a shortage of  qualified employees if (1) Amtrak employees did not transfer to the new  services or operators, (2) they retire or leave the railroad industry, or (3)  there are insufficient applicants with necessarily skills to provide the  employees needed.", "Workforce flexibility and productivity. Reform of intercity passenger  rail resulting in new services or operators will also require consideration  of workforce flexibility and the extent labor productivity can be  increased. One key to providing cost-effective service is to have high  levels of labor productivity. Collective bargaining agreements and their  related work rules specify the work that employees are expected to do  and the amount of compensation they will receive for performing this  work. Although such agreements can and do include changes designed  to increase employee productivity by increasing or broadening the types  of tasks that employees can perform, such agreements can also affect  productivity by limiting the amount or type of work that employees can  perform. Foreign passenger rail reform efforts have included actions to  increase workforce flexibility and productivity. For example, from 1993  to 1998, as a result of revenue growth and an increased focus on cost  control, VIA Rail entered into negotiations with rail labor in order to  obtain more flexibility in its workforce. Among other things, these  negotiations resulted in a significant consolidation of jobs. According to  VIA Rail, union members got enhanced pension benefits in return for  reduced employment levels and increased job responsibility. The latter  included consolidating a number of on-board service and conductor  positions into one customer-service manager who has the flexibility to  interchange positions for on-board service staff and is responsible for  everything that goes on inside a train.", "Potential labor protection payments. If, as the result of reforming  intercity passenger rail, Amtrak employees lose their jobs, there could  be liability for labor protection payments. In general, labor protection  payments are made to employees who lose their jobs as a result of a  discontinuation of service. The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act  of 1997 made a number of changes to labor protection, including  eliminating existing rights to such protection\u2014again subjecting labor  protection to collective bargaining, and requiring Amtrak to negotiate  new labor protection arrangements with its employees. As we have  previously reported, after Amtrak and its employees could not reach  agreement, an October 1999 arbitration decision (1) capped labor  protection payments at a 5-year maximum (rather than 6 years under the  statutory arrangement), (2) made employees with less than 2 years of  service ineligible for payments, and (3) based payments on a sliding  scale that provided less payout for each year worked than did the  previous system. Even with these changes, in September 2002, we  reported that Amtrak would have had unsecured labor protection claims  of about $3.2 billion had Amtrak been liquidated on December 31, 2001.    Although a reform of intercity passenger rail may or may not involve a  liquidation of Amtrak, it is clear that should Amtrak employees lose  their jobs as the result of a discontinuation of service there could be  substantial financial obligations as a result. To the extent that Amtrak  employees can and do accept jobs elsewhere (whether in the railroad  industry or not) this obligation could be reduced. In general, should this  be the case, then labor protection payments would be limited to the  differences, if any, between what the employees were previously making  at Amtrak and their wages at the new jobs.", "Amtrak labor-relations officials state that a significant barrier to any  attempts to reform\u2014or to negotiating their collective bargaining  agreements even in the absence of broader corporate restructuring\u2014is the  lack of flexibility in the current labor agreements. First, the provision of the  Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 that altered rail labor  protection\u2014eliminating the statutory labor protection provision and  allowing Amtrak and the affected labor unions to negotiate contractual  labor protection arrangements in their place\u2014did not give Amtrak as much  flexibility as it had hoped. Although significant changes resulted from  negotiations about new labor protection arrangements (such as limiting the  maximum number of years\u2019 wages that could be received in the event of job  loss to 5 years instead of 6), Amtrak is still bound by expensive labor  protection obligations if jobs are lost because of route cancellations or  service reductions. Amtrak officials referred to rail labor protection as the  \u201clast of the last\u201d of the old type of unemployment benefits. As such, labor  protection continues to be a stumbling block in Amtrak\u2019s internal  restructuring efforts, as well as collective bargaining. In addition, Amtrak  officials stated that Amtrak would like additional flexibility in the work  rules that define the tasks that employees can perform to improve  productivity. The current work rules allow most employees to perform  tasks outside their enumerated work duties only 2 hours per day.  According to Amtrak labor relations officials, current work rules allow  Acela employees 4 hours of flexibility per day. Amtrak would like to extend  this to all labor contracts. Amtrak officials stated that Amtrak wants the  increase to 4 hours of flexibility to gain desired improvements in efficiency  of operations. Without the work rule change, these improvements will be  difficult to achieve.", "Workforce challenges also include determining how a potentially reformed  intercity passenger rail system fits into the current scheme of railroad- specific labor-management, retirement, and injury compensation systems.  Amtrak is currently subject to, among other things, the Railway Labor Act,  the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act,  which govern labor-management relations, retirement, and injury  compensation, respectively, in the railroad industry. Amtrak\u2019s collective  bargaining agreements generally do not expire and are subject to  requirements designed to reduce labor strikes; Amtrak participates in, and  provides financial contributions to, the railroad retirement-system  (approximately $400 million annually); and Amtrak and its employees are  subject to a tort-based injury compensation system under the Federal  Employers\u2019 Liability Act. We have reported that these legal requirements  raise railroad costs compared to nonrailroad industries. Amtrak\u2019s April  2005 Strategic Reform Initiatives also suggested that meaningful reform of  intercity passenger rail will require changing how these apply to passenger  rail. On the other hand, rail labor has argued for the importance of these  laws in protecting employee rights, ensuring a sustainable retirement  system, and adequately compensating employees injured on the job.", "State officials we interviewed expressed more general concern about the  potential impact of Amtrak\u2019s labor agreements and obligations on the  future of passenger rail. Some state officials viewed Amtrak\u2019s labor  agreements as a significant barrier to reform. One official stated that  serious labor reform is needed for intercity passenger rail reform to  succeed. Some state officials with whom we spoke also questioned  whether alternative operators would be bound by Amtrak\u2019s labor  agreements and thought that it was unlikely another operator could  provide significant improvements in cost savings or quality of service if  they were. Another official stated that Amtrak\u2019s labor agreements would  put Amtrak at a considerable disadvantage over alternative operators in a  competitive market if the alternative operators were not bound by the same  agreements.", "Rail labor union officials with whom we spoke expressed several concerns  about the effects any potential reform of intercity passenger rail might have  on their members. Foremost, union officials expressed concern about the  history of Amtrak\u2019s successive \u201creforms\u201d and the detrimental effects on  labor\u2013management relations and employee morale. In their view, past  Amtrak reforms have brought fewer union jobs and the loss of health and  safety programs with no improvement in Amtrak\u2019s service to the public,  while it continues to flounder with funding uncertainty. A union official  stated that the first step should be getting Amtrak to operate like other for- profit businesses, including the freight railroads. The emphasis should be  on applying basic business principles, including transparent accounting,  and repairing its relationship with the unions and improving national  railroad passenger service\u2014rather than on reducing the federal subsidy.", "This should be addressed before moving on to something other than the  current system and route structure. In addition, union officials emphasized  that some union members are highly skilled and highly specialized and  cannot be easily replaced. Any restructuring of intercity passenger rail  would still require any operator\u2014Amtrak, alternative operators, or a  successor to Amtrak\u2014to work through the unions to maintain a labor force  or to train additional workers. Total compensation for employees moving  forward is another concern; however, union officials told us, where  alternative operators have succeeded Amtrak in operating commuter  railroads, unionized employees have been offered more compensation than  they received from Amtrak with no accompanying change in work rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Reporting, Internal Control, and Governance Requirements and Practices for Federal Entities and Public Companies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Accountability Requirements and Practices", "paragraphs": ["The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 removed Amtrak from  the list of government corporations subject to the Government Corporation  Control Act of 1945.

Our report is not intended to imply that Amtrak\u2019s mission is to generate  profits rather than provide services that produce public benefits on a  break-even basis. In fact, the first section of the report discusses the  characteristics (both financial and non-financial) of the types of service  provided by intercity passenger rail in the United States and the types  of service that could increase the transportation benefits and public  benefits of intercity passenger rail. Regarding operating losses, we  recognize that Amtrak\u2019s operating loss is projected to decrease in fiscal  year 2006 and have changed the report to reflect that, instead of  increasing, operating losses continue to remain high. Finally, we do not  believe our report is inconsistent in how operating loss is portrayed.  Non-cash items such as depreciation and interest expenses are  legitimate expenses to the business and were reported based on  Amtrak\u2019s audited financial statements. The report also includes a figure  excluding these items to illustrate their relative contribution over  Amtrak\u2019s reported cash losses. In our discussion of the financial  performance of routes, we used the route financial data provided to us  by Amtrak, which does not include non-cash items such as depreciation  charges. 2. The trend in passenger rail revenue between fiscal years 2002 and 2005  was stable. Based on data provided by Amtrak we included a footnote  to recognize the projected increase in passenger rail revenue in fiscal  year 2006. We have eliminated any reference to \u201cpromotional pricing\u201d  being the reason for revenue decreases.  3. We recognize that a significant percentage of long distance passengers  that are not traveling for work purposes may be traveling for family or  personal/family business reasons. This is still a form of leisure travel  and we have modified our definition of \u201cleisure\u201d to include travel for  family or personal business reasons. Regarding long distance  passengers traveling less than 500 miles, our report notes that many\u2014 but certainly not all\u2014of these passenger trips may have characteristics  similar to those on corridor routes. The example cited in the report, on  the Empire Builder route, is intended to illustrate the type of  circumstances where this may apply. Regarding the financial  performance of long distance routes, we agree that on a per passenger  mile basis the difference between long distance service and other non- NEC trains may be attributable to state subsidies. Our report notes that  one reason for the wide variance in financial performance among  corridor routes is the level of state support. 4. Our report also recognizes the growth in state-supported services and  that these services are the fastest growing in terms of ridership and  illustrate the significant potential for further growth. Finally, we agree  that on state-supported routes, states play a much greater decision  making role. We have changed our report to recognize this role. 5. We agree that rail network capacity is an important national policy  issue and that freight and passenger railroads, as well as governments  at all levels need to work together to address this issue. This will be  particularly important in the future as rail infrastructure capacity  continues to become constrained. Our report discusses the challenges  associated with addressing this issue. We also address the issue of cost  sharing between the federal and state governments and how this is  common in some transportation modes other than intercity passenger  rail. Moreover, we identify factors that need to be considered in making  federal investments in private infrastructure. Finally, the report  identifies some of the factors as to why commuter railroads pay  amounts different from incremental cost to access freight and other  privately owned infrastructure.
