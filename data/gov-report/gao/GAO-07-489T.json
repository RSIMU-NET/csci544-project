The Coast Guard expects to meet its performance goals in 6 of 11 mission areas in fiscal year 2006, down from 8 in 2005. Trends indicate increased homeland security activities have not prevented meeting non-homeland security goals. Two new reorganization efforts are under way. One creates a single command for all specialized deployable units, such as those for responding to pollution or terrorist incidents. However, experience with an effort to reorganize field units suggests there may be challenges in such matters as merging different operating approaches and addressing resource issues. The other effort merges the Coast Guard's various acquisition management efforts under a single Chief Acquisition Officer. The reorganization of acquisition management is in part a response to past troubled acquisition efforts. This change in the acquisition structure is too new to assess. Current major acquisitions include Deepwater for cutters and aircraft, the Rescue 21 communication system, and the National Automatic Identification System for vessel tracking. Deepwater and Rescue 21 have had schedule delays and performance reductions in the past, but the Coast Guard has been taking actions to improve oversight. Installation of equipment for the first phase of the National Automatic Identification System is under way, but the Coast Guard is still determining which types of vessels will have to participate. All three programs have also accumulated sizeable carryover balances of unspent moneys from previous years. Competing funding priorities have placed aging polar icebreakers and aids-to-navigation assets at risk. Many aids-to-navigation vessels are near the end of their service lives. The Coast Guard is exploring alternatives for replacement or extending their service. Similarly, high maintenance costs prompted the Coast Guard to take one of two Antarctic icebreakers out of service, increasing reliance on the remaining one."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to provide this statement for the record about the President\u2019s  fiscal year 2008 budget request for the Coast Guard.

To accomplish its  responsibilities, the Coast Guard is organized into two major commands  that are responsible for overall mission execution\u2014one in the Pacific area  and the other in the Atlantic area. These commands are divided into 9  districts, which in turn are organized into 35 sectors that unify command  and control of field units and resources, such as multimission stations and  patrol boats. In fiscal year 2005, the Coast Guard had over 46,000 full-time  positions\u2014about 39,000 military and 7,000 civilians. In addition, the  agency had about 8,100 reservists who support the national military  strategy or provide additional operational support and surge capacity  during times of emergency, such as natural disasters. Furthermore, the  Coast Guard also had about 31,000 volunteer auxiliary personnel help with  a wide array of activities, ranging from search and rescue to boating safety  education. The Coast Guard has responsibilities that fall under two broad  missions\u2014homeland security and non-homeland security. The Coast  Guard responsibilities are further divided into 11 programs, as shown in  table 1.", "For these 11 programs, the Coast Guard has developed performance  measure to communicate agency performance and provide information for  the budgeting process to Congress, other policymakers, and taxpayers.

The program is eventually to include 10 major classes of new or  upgraded vessels and aircraft. The Coast Guard also has an acquisition  program called the National Automatic Identification System to identify  and track vessels bound for or within U.S. waters. Another acquisition  program is called Rescue 21, a program to replace the Coast Guard\u2019s 30- year-old search and rescue communications systems.

No new funds have been requested for this initiative. This  initiative is discussed in more detail later in this testimony. The second  reallocation involves an $80.5 million transfer from AC&I into the  operating expense appropriation. The operational aspect of this  reallocation is associated with creating a new consolidated acquisition  function, also discussed in further detail below.

The Coast Guard also recognizes  that it is carrying significant unobligated balances for a number of its  acquisition projects. These balances reflect money appropriated but not  yet spent for projects included in previous years\u2019 budgets. During our  work for this testimony, we reviewed budget data and Coast Guard  documentation showing the current status of the agency\u2019s unobligated  balances. We found, for example, that the current unobligated balances  total $1.96 billion for all acquisition projects. The Deepwater acquisition  alone has $1.6 billion in total unobligated balances, which is nearly double  the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2008 request for the Deepwater project.  Other acquisition programs, such as the Nationwide Automatic  Identification System and Rescue 21, also have unobligated balances, but  these are considerably lower (see table 2). The unobligated balance for  Rescue 21, for example, is $30.5 million.", "These unobligated balances have accumulated for a variety of reasons as  the Coast Guard has found itself unable to spend previous-year acquisition  appropriations. For example, we and others have documented technical  design issues involving the Coast Guard\u2019s 123-foot patrol boat and the Fast  Response Cutter. These problems have led to major delays in some  programs and outright cancellations in others. We asked Coast Guard  officials about their plans to spend these unobligated balances either in  fiscal year 2008 or beyond, but at this point they were unable to provide us  with detailed plans for doing so. To the agency\u2019s credit, steps have been  taken to address the issue, including reporting quarterly acquisition  spending levels. Since these unobligated balances represent a significant  portion of the Coast Guard\u2019s entire budget, the degree to which the Coast  Guard spends these balances in fiscal year 2008 could have a substantial  impact on the overall level of capital spending for the year.", "According to senior Coast Guard officials, each acquisition project is now  receiving more scrutiny and oversight of how previous funds are spent.

Coast Guard\u2019s performance did not improve  sufficiently for the Coast Guard to meet as many of its higher performance  targets in 2006 as it did in 2005. In fiscal year 2006, the Coast Guard  reported that 5 of its 11 programs met or exceeded program performance  targets. In addition, agency officials reported that the Coast Guard  expected to meet the target for 1 additional program when results become  available in August 2007, potentially bringing the total met targets to 6 out  of 11 (see fig. 4).

Such  challenges include comprehensiveness (that is, using a single measure per  mission area may not convey complete information about overall  performance) and external factors outside agency control, (such as  weather conditions, which can affect the amount of ice that needs to be  cleared or the number of mariners who must be rescued).

At each of these sectors,  the Coast Guard has placed management and operational control of these  units and their associated resources under the same commanding officer.  Coast Guard officials told us that this change helped their planning and  resource allocation efforts. For instance, Coast Guard field officials told us  the sector command structure has been valuable in helping to meet new  homeland security responsibilities, and in facilitating their ability to  manage incidents in close coordination with other federal, state, and local  agencies. Our follow-up work found, however, that work remains to  ensure the Coast Guard is able to maximize the potential benefits of sector  realignment. In particular, Coast Guard officials reported that some  sectors had yet to colocate their vessel tracking system (VTS) centers with  the rest of their operational command centers.

According to Coast Guard officials, the agency is making this change  based on lessons learned from the federal response to Hurricane Katrina.  They said the response highlighted the need to improve effectiveness of  day-to-day operations and to enhance flexibility and interoperability of  forces responding to security threats and natural disasters. Currently,  there are five different types of Coast Guard specialized forces, totaling  about 2,500 personnel. Their roles and missions vary widely, ranging from  conducting antiterrorism operations to conducting environmental  response and cleanup operations (see table 3).", "The Coast Guard\u2019s existing structure divides operational control of  specialized forces into three different command authorities\u2014 headquarters, Pacific Area, and Atlantic Area.

The Coast Guard plans to establish operating  capability for this unified approach by July 20, 2007, with an initial  command center located in Ballston, Virginia. Officials told us they were  well under way in planning for this reorganization. Officials expect about  100 staff will be assigned to the center when it reaches its initial operating  capability, growing to about 150 personnel once the command structure is  completed. According to officials, all administrative staff selected for the  center will be drawn from headquarters, district, and area levels.", "We have not studied this reorganization, but our prior work on other  aspects of Coast Guard operations suggests that the Coast Guard may face  a number of implementation challenges. Some may be similar to those that  Coast Guard faced when it created its sector commands, such as obtaining  buy-in from personnel that will be affected by the reorganization or  addressing realignment issues at the district level. Another challenge is to  ensure that the change does not adversely affect mission performance at  the sector and field unit levels. Currently, for example, sector commanders  make use of available local MSST units\u2014made available by district and  area commanders\u2014to help meet shortfalls in resource availability for  everyday missions, such as conducting high-risk vessel escorts and harbor  security patrols. If these units were not available to support mission needs,  additional strain could be put on the performance of these local units.", "These changes to the command structure are part of plans that extend  beyond fiscal year 2008. In his recent State of the Coast Guard speech, the  Commandant of the Coast Guard unveiled a proposal to combine the  Coast Guard\u2019s Atlantic and Pacific Area command functions into a single  Coast Guard operations command for mission execution. In addition, the  Coast Guard plans to establish a new mission support command, which  will have responsibility for nationwide maintenance, logistics, and supply  activities. According to Coast Guard officials, the current structure is not  well suited to responding to post-September 11 transnational threats. For  example, Coast Guard officials said the current structure at times works  against the Coast Guard in operations with Joint Interagency Task Forces,  whose operating areas are not the same as the Coast Guard\u2019s established  area boundaries. Coast Guard officials told us a working group had  developed a blueprint of the new operational force structure, but the  Coast Guard is not ready to release it.

For example, a  February 2007 independent analysis found that the Coast Guard does not  possess a sufficient number of acquisition personnel or the right level of  experience needed to manage the Deepwater program. Headquarters  officials told us the reorganization would address retention problems by  creating a new acquisitions specialty career ladder that could attract new  pools of talent. Still, given its past history of staff shortages and difficulties  retaining acquisition staff, the Coast Guard will face challenges  maintaining an appropriately sized acquisition staff, at least in the near  term. Coast Guard headquarters officials told us the Deepwater program  had pushed other important acquisitions priorities aside, and this new  organization would help the Coast Guard advance these other priorities,  such as boats, piers, and other shoreside physical infrastructure.

Several factors add to the uncertainty about the delivery schedule of  Deepwater assets. First, the Coast Guard is still in the early phases of the  25-year Deepwater acquisition program and the potential for changes in  the program over such a lengthy period of time make it difficult to forecast  the ability of the Coast Guard to acquire future Deepwater assets  according to its published schedule. For example, technology changes  since the award of the original Deepwater contract in 2002 have already, in  part, delayed delivery of the VUAV, and the Coast Guard is currently  studying the potential use of an alternative unmanned aerial vehicle.  Second, changes to funding levels can impact the future delivery of  Deepwater assets. For example, despite earlier plans, the fiscal year 2008  Department of Homeland Security congressional budget justification  indicates that the Coast Guard does not plan to request funding for some  Deepwater assets in FY 2008, such as the OPC and the VUAV.  Acquisition  of these two Deepwater assets has now been delayed until FY 2013, at the  earliest. Finally, the Coast Guard has recently made a number of program  management and asset-specific changes that could impact the delivery  schedules for its Deepwater assets. For example, the Coast Guard has  begun to bring all acquisition efforts under one organization. Further, the  Coast Guard announced that it has terminated acquisition of the FRC-B, an  off-the-shelf patrol boat that is intended to serve as an interim replacement  for the Coast Guard\u2019s deteriorating fleet of 110-foot patrol boats, through  the system integrator and plans to assign responsibility for the project to  the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition directorate.

The Coast Guard used a system-of-systems approach to  replace or upgrade assets with a single, integrated package of aircraft,  vessels, and unmanned aerial vehicles, to be linked through systems that  provide C4ISR and supporting logistics. In a system of systems, the  deliveries of Deepwater assets are interdependent, thus schedule slippages  and uncertainties associated with potential changes in the design and  capabilities of any one asset increases the overall risk that the Coast  Guard might not meet its expanded homeland security missions within  given budget parameters and milestone dates. The Coast Guard also used a  systems integrator\u2014which can give the contractor extensive involvement  in requirements development, design, and source selection of major  system and subsystem subcontractors.

If performance-based acquisitions are not appropriately  planned and structured, there is an increased risk that the government  may receive products or services that are over cost estimates, delivered  late, and of unacceptable quality.", "In 2004 and in subsequent assessments in 2005 and 2006, we reported  concerns about the Deepwater program related to three main areas\u2014 program management, contractor accountability, and cost control. The  Coast Guard\u2019s ability to effectively manage the program has been  challenged by staffing shortfalls and poor communication and  collaboration among Deepwater program staff, contractors, and field  personnel who operate and maintain the assets. Despite documented  problems in schedule, performance, cost control, and contract  administration, measures for holding the contractor accountable resulted  in an award fee of $4 million (of the maximum $4.6 million) for the first  year. Through the first 4 years of the Deepwater contract, the systems  integrator received award fees that ranged from 87 percent to 92 percent  of the total possible award fee (scores that ranged from \u201cvery good\u201d to  \u201cexcellent\u201d based on Coast Guard criteria), for a total of over $16 million.  Further, the program\u2019s ability to control Deepwater costs is uncertain  given the Coast Guard\u2019s lack of detailed information on the contractor\u2019s  competition decisions. While the Coast Guard has taken some actions to  improve program outcomes, our assessment of the program and its efforts  to address our recommendations continues, and we plan to report on our  findings later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deepwater Performance and Design Problems Creating Operational Challenges for Coast Guard", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the program management issues discussed above, there  have been problems with the performance and design of Deepwater patrol  boats that have created operational challenges for the Coast Guard. The  Deepwater program\u2019s bridging strategy to convert the legacy 110-foot  patrol boats into 123-foot patrol boats has been unsuccessful. The Coast  Guard had originally intended to convert all 49 of its 110-foot patrol boats  into 123-foot patrol boats in order to increase the patrol boats\u2019 annual  operational hours and to provide additional capabilities, such as small  boat stern launch and recovery and enhanced and improved C4ISR.  However, the converted 123-foot patrol boats began to display deck  cracking and hull buckling and developed shaft alignment problems, and  the Coast Guard elected to stop the conversion process at eight hulls upon  determining that the converted patrol boats would not meet their  expanded post-September 11 operational requirements.", "These performance problems have had operational consequences for the  Coast Guard. The hull performance problems with the 123-foot patrol  boats led the Coast Guard to remove all of the eight converted normal 123- foot patrol boats from service effective November 30, 2006. The  Commandant of the Coast Guard has stated that having reliable, safe  cutters is \u201cparamount\u201d to executing the Coast Guard\u2019s missions. Thus,  removing these patrol boats from service affects the Coast Guard\u2019s  operations in its missions, such as search and rescue and alien and  migrant interdiction. The Coast Guard is taking actions to mitigate the  operational impacts resulting from the removal of the 123-foot patrol boats  from service. Specifically, in recent testimony, the Commandant of the  Coast Guard stated that the Coast Guard has taken the following actions:    multicrewing eight of the 110-foot patrol boats with crews from the   123-foot patrol boats that have been removed from service so that  patrol hours for these vessels can be increased;    deploying other Coast Guard vessels to assist in missions formerly  performed by the 123-foot patrol boats;    securing permission from the U.S. Navy to continue using three 179- foot cutters on loan from the Navy (these were originally to be returned  to the Navy in 2008) to supplement the Coast Guard\u2019s patrol craft; and    compressing the maintenance and upgrades on the remaining 110-foot  patrol boats.", "The FRC, which was intended as a long-term replacement for the legacy  patrol boats, has experienced design problems that have operational  implications as well. As we reported in 2006, the Coast Guard suspended  design work on the FRC due to design risks such as excessive weight and  horsepower requirements. Coast Guard engineers raised concerns about  the viability of the FRC design (which involved building the FRC\u2019s hull,  decks, and bulkheads out of composite materials rather than steel)  beginning in January 2005. In February 2006, the Coast Guard suspended  FRC design work after an independent design review by third party  consultants demonstrated, among other things, that the FRC would be far  heavier and less efficient than a typical patrol boat of similar length, in  part, because it would need four engines to meet Coast Guard speed  requirements.", "One operational challenge related to the FRC is that the Coast Guard will  end up with two classes of FRCs. The first class of FRCs to be built would  be based on an adapted design from a patrol boat already on the market to  expedite delivery. The Coast Guard would then pursue development of a  follow-on class that would be completely redesigned to address the  problems in the original FRC design plans. Coast Guard officials recently  estimated that the first FRC delivery will slip to fiscal year 2009, at the  earliest, rather than 2007 as outlined in the 2005 Revised Deepwater  Implementation Plan. Thus, the Coast Guard is also facing longer-term  operational gaps related to its patrol boats."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Initial Deployment of Nationwide Automatic Identification System Is Under Way, with Decisions Still to Come about Extending Coverage to Additional Vessels", "paragraphs": ["Outside Deepwater, one acquisition project included in the fiscal year 2008  budget is the Nationwide Automatic Identification System, a system  designed to of identify, track, and communicate with vessels bound for or  within U.S. waters and forwarding that information for additional analysis.  NAIS uses a maritime digital communication system that transmits and  receives vessel position and voyage data. The Coast Guard describes NAIS  as its centerpiece in its effort to build Maritime Domain Awareness, its  ability to know what is happening on the water.", "NAIS is not expected to reach full capability until 2014, when the system  will be able to track ships as far as 2,000 nautical miles away and  communicate with them when they are within 24 nautical miles of the U.S.  coast. It is being implemented in three phases, the first of which is  scheduled to be fully operational in September 2007. At that time, the  Coast Guard expects to have the ability to track\u2014but not communicate  with\u2014vessels in 55 ports and 9 coastal areas. The largest areas of the  continental U.S. coastline that will remain without coverage after this first  phase are the Pacific Northwest and Gulf coasts. The second phase calls  for being able to track ships out to 50 nautical miles from the entire U.S.  coast and communicate with them as far as 24 nautical miles out. This is  the phase addressed in the fiscal year 2008 budget.", "The $12 million fiscal year 2008 AC&I request for NAIS is expected to pay  for implementing the initial operating capability for phase two. The Coast  Guard has received approval from the Department of Homeland Security  to issue solicitations and award contracts for this initial capability, and the  agency has held information sessions to gauge industry interest in  participating and to help refine its statement of work for the initial  solicitation. The initial solicitation will provide requirements for full  receiving and transmitting capability for two sectors within one Coast  Guard area and one sector in another area. With this infrastructure in  place the Coast Guard expects to be able to test identification, tracking,  and communication performance, including such features as the ability to  determine if the vessel transmissions are accurately reflecting the actual  location of a vessel.", "The Coast Guard is considering whether to require additional types of  vessels to install and use the equipment needed for the Coast Guard to  track vessels and communicate with them. Current regulations require  certain vessels (such as commercial vessels over 65 feet in length)  traveling on international voyages or within VTS areas to install and  operate the transmission equipment. Vessels that are not subject to  current regulations generally include noncommercial and fishing vessels  and commercial vessels less than 65 feet long. This means that many  domestic vessels are not required to transmit the vessel and voyage  information and therefore will be invisible to the NAIS. The Coast Guard  has indicated in the Federal Register that it is considering expanding the  requirements to additional vessels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Has Taken Actions to Improve Oversight of Rescue 21 Contracts, but System Coverage Has Been Reduced", "paragraphs": ["Another non-Deepwater project covered in the budget request is Rescue  21, the Coast Guard\u2019s command, control, and communication  infrastructure used primarily for search and rescue. The fiscal year 2008  AC&I budget includes $81 million for continued development of Rescue  21. In May 2006 we reported that shortcomings in Coast Guard\u2019s contract  management and oversight efforts contributed to program cost increases  from $250 million in 1999 to $710.5 million in 2005 and delays in reaching  full operating capability from 2006 to 2011. Our recommendations  included better oversight of the project, completion of an integrated  baseline review of existing contracts, and development of revised cost and  schedule estimates. According to the Coast Guard, it has taken a series of  actions in response, including program management reviews and oversight  meetings, conducting integrated baseline reviews on existing contracts,  and meeting regularly to assess project risks.", "According to the Coast Guard officials we met with, the contractor is  currently on time and on budget for installing the full system in 11 Rescue  21 regions, including such regions as New Orleans, Long Island/New York,  and Miami. The last of the 11 regions covered by current contracts is  scheduled to be completed by October 2008. Contracts for the 25 regions  that remain have not been signed. To keep to current project cost and  schedule baselines, however, the Coast Guard has reduced the required  performance of the system. Originally, Rescue 21 was supposed to limit  coverage gaps to 2 percent, meaning that the system had to be able to  capture distress calls in 98 percent of the area within 20 nautical miles of  the coast and within navigable rivers and other waterways. The current  contract calls for coverage gaps of less than 10 percent. Rescue 21 was  also intended to have the capability to track Coast Guard vessels and  aircraft and provide data communication with those assets.

More  than half of these assets have reached or will be approaching the end of  their designed service lives. In 2002, the Coast Guard proposed options for  systematically rehabilitating or replacing 164 cutters and boats in these  fleets after determining that the age, condition, and cost of operating these  assets would diminish the capability of the Coast Guard to carry out ATON  and domestic icebreaking missions. We noted that no funds had been  allocated to pursue these options, apparently due to competing needs for  replacing or rehabilitating other Coast Guard assets. These competing  needs, reflected largely in the Coast Guard\u2019s expensive and lengthy  Deepwater asset replacement program, will continue for some time, as will  other pressures on the federal budget. The Coast Guard is requesting no  additional spending for ATON assets or infrastructure in fiscal year 2008.", "Without specific funding to move forward, the Coast Guard has attempted  to break the project into smaller components and pursue potential funding  from within the Coast Guard\u2019s budget, focusing on the assets most in need  of maintenance or replacement. In February 2006, the Coast Guard began  a project to replace its fleet of 80 trailerable aids-to-navigation boats with  new boats that have enhanced capabilities to do ATON work as well as  other missions. According to a Coast Guard official, this acquisition  would cost approximately $14.4 million if all 80 boats are purchased and  would bring on new boats over a 5-year period as funds allow. The Coast  Guard official responsible for the project said the Coast Guard intends to  make the purchases using a funding stream appropriated for the  maintenance of nonstandard boats that can be allocated to the boats with  the most pressing maintenance or recapitalization needs. Availability of  these funds, however, depends on the condition and maintenance needs of  other nonstandard boats; if this funding has to be applied to meet other  needs, such as unanticipated problems, it may not be available for  purchasing these boats.", "In addition to carrying out their primary missions of ATON and domestic  icebreaking, these assets have also been used in recent years for other  missions such as homeland security. The Coast Guard\u2019s ATON and  domestic icebreakers saw a sharp increase in use for homeland security  missions after the attacks of September 11, and while this trend has  moderated somewhat, the use of some assets in these missions continues  well above pre-September 11 levels. This increase is most prominent for  domestic icebreakers, which are being operated more extensively for  other purposes at times of year when no icebreaking needs to be done.  Newer ATON vessels, which have greater multimission capabilities than  older vessels, tend to be the ATON assets used the most for other  missions.", "In addition to considering options for replacing or rehabilitating its ATON  assets, the Coast Guard also has examined possibilities for outsourcing  missions. In 2004 and 2006, the Coast Guard completed analyses of what  ATON functions could be feasibly outsourced. Although possibilities for  outsourcing were identified for further study, Coast Guard officials noted  that outsourcing also carries potential disadvantages. For example, they  said it could lead to a loss of \u201csurge\u201d capacity\u2013that is the capacity to  respond to emergencies or unusual situations. Coast Guard officials noted  that outsourcing or finding a contractor to do work after an event such as  Katrina is difficult due to the increased demand for their services as well  as the fact that the labor pool may have been displaced. When a contractor  is found, it usually takes a long time to get the work completed due to the  backlog of work and tends to be very expensive. In addition, this surge  capability may be needed for other missions, such as those that occur  when ATON assets can be used to support search and rescue efforts. In  the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, for example, some ATON assets  provided logistical support for first responders or transported stranded  individuals. Coast Guard officials stated that after Hurricane Katrina, its  own crews were able to begin work immediately to repair damaged aids  and get the waterways open to maritime traffic again. Coast Guard  officials also indicated that outsourcing may adversely affect the Coast  Guard\u2019s personnel structure by reducing opportunities to provide  important experience for personnel to advance in their careers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Faces Decision on Future of Polar Icebreakers", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard confronts ongoing maintenance challenges that have left  its polar icebreaking capability diminished. The Coast Guard has two  Polar-class icebreakers for breaking channels in the Antarctic. Both are  reaching the end of their design service lives, and given the funding  challenges associated with maintaining them, the Coast Guard decided to  deactivate one of the two, the Polar Star, in 2006. This reduced  icebreaking capability since only one Polar-class icebreaker, the Polar  Sea, was available, and for the Polar Sea it increased maintenance needs  while reducing time available to conduct maintenance.", "Coast Guard officials and others have reported that failure to address  these challenges could leave the nation without heavy icebreaking  capability and could jeopardize the investment made in the nation\u2019s  Antarctic Program. According to Coast Guard officials, the remaining  Polar-class icebreaker\u2019s age and increased operational tempo have left it  unable to continue the mission in the long term without a substantial  investment in maintenance and equipment renewal. One option,  refurbishing the two existing Polar-class icebreakers for an additional 25  years of service, is estimated to cost between $552 million and $859  million. Another option, building new assets, would cost an estimated $600  million per vessel, according to Coast Guard officials.", "Coast Guard officials have begun planning a transition strategy to help  keep the sole operating Polar-class icebreaker mission-capable until new  or refurbished assets enter service, which would take an estimated 8 to 10  years.
