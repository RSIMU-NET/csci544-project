Some stakeholders have expressed concerns that these regulations could increase electricity prices and compromise reliability\u0097the ability to meet consumers' demand. FERC and others have oversight over electricity prices and reliability. DOE can order a generating unit to run in certain emergencies. GAO was asked to examine: (1) actions power companies may take in response to these regulations; (2) their potential electricity market and reliability implications; and (3) the extent to which these implications can be mitigated.

Some regions may see more significant levels of retirements. For example, one study examined 11 states in the Midwest and projected that 18 percent of coal-fueled capacity in that region could retire. EPA and some stakeholders GAO interviewed stated that some such retirements could occur as a result of other factors such as lower natural gas prices, regardless of the regulations. Power companies may also build new generating units, upgrade transmission systems to maintain reliability, and increasingly use natural gas to produce electricity as coal units retire and remaining coal units become somewhat more expensive to operate.", "Available information suggests these actions would likely increase electricity prices in some regions. Furthermore, while these actions may not cause widespread reliability concerns, they may contribute to reliability challenges in some regions. Regarding prices, the studies GAO reviewed estimated that increases could vary across the country, with one study projecting a range of increases from 0.1 percent in the Northwest to an increase of 13.5 percent in parts of the South more dependent on electricity generated from coal. According to EPA officials, the agency\u0092s estimates of price increases would be within the historical range of price fluctuations, and projected future prices may be below historic prices. Regarding reliability, these actions are not expected to pose widespread concerns but may contribute to challenges in some regions. EPA and some stakeholders GAO interviewed indicated that these actions should not affect reliability given existing tools. Some other stakeholders GAO interviewed identified potential reliability challenges. Among other things, it may be difficult to schedule and complete all retrofits to install controls and to resolve all potential reliability concerns associated with retirements within compliance deadlines.", "Existing tools could help mitigate many, though not all, of the potential adverse implications associated with the four EPA regulations, but the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Department of Energy (DOE), and EPA do not have a joint, formal process to monitor industry\u0092s progress in responding to the regulations. Some tools, such as state regulatory reviews to evaluate the prudence of power company investments, may address some potential price increases. Furthermore, tools available to industry and regulators, as well as certain regulatory provisions, may address many potential reliability challenges. However, because of certain limitations, these tools may not fully address all challenges where generating units needed for reliability are not in compliance by the deadlines. FERC, DOE, and EPA have responsibilities concerning the electricity industry, and they have taken important first steps to understand these potential challenges by, for example, informally coordinating with power companies and others about industry\u0092s actions to respond to the regulations. However, they have not established a formal, documented process for jointly and routinely monitoring industry\u0092s progress and, absent such a process, the complexity and extent of potential reliability challenges may not be clear to these agencies.

According to some stakeholders we  interviewed, several broad trends are affecting the use of coal and  contribute to the retirement of coal-fueled generating units. First, in some  areas of the country, it has become less economically attractive to use  coal to produce electricity, as the regional prices of coal have increased,  and prices for natural gas have fallen and the availability of natural gas  has increased.

Burning coal for electricity production results in the  emission of pollutants such as SO, NO, mercury and other metals, and  acid gases. Coal-fueled electricity generating units are among the largest  emitters of these pollutants. This air pollution has adverse health and  environmental effects. For example, SO emissions contribute to  the formation of fine particulate matter, and NO contributes to the  formation of ozone. Fine particulate matter may aggravate respiratory and  cardiovascular diseases and is associated with asthma attacks and  premature death. Ozone can inflame lung tissue and increase  susceptibility to bronchitis and pneumonia. In addition to affecting health,  SO and NO reduce visibility and contribute to acid rain, which can  acidify streams and change the nutrient balance in coastal waters and  large river basins, affecting their ability to support fish and other wildlife.  Mercury is a toxic element, and human intake of mercury, for example,  through consumption of fish that ingested the mercury, has been linked to  a wide range of health ailments. In particular, mercury can harm fetuses  and cause neurological disorders in children, resulting in, among other  things, impaired cognitive abilities. Other toxic metals emitted from power  plants, such as arsenic, chromium, and nickel can cause cancer. Acid  gases cause lung damage and contribute to asthma, bronchitis, and other  chronic respiratory diseases, especially in children and the elderly.", "The Clean Air Act requires EPA to establish national ambient air quality  standards that states are primarily responsible for attaining. States  generally develop state implementation plans that detail how the  standards will be attained and maintained. In addition, the act\u2019s Good  Neighbor provision requires state implementation plans to prohibit  emissions of air pollutants in amounts that will contribute significantly to  nonattainment or interference with maintenance of a national ambient air  quality standard in any other state. Electricity generating units contribute  to pollution that affects the ability of downwind states to attain and  maintain these standards because some of these pollutants may travel in  the atmosphere hundreds or thousands of miles from the areas where  they originate. If a state fails to develop and submit a state  implementation plan that satisfies all Clean Air Act requirements,  including the Good Neighbor provision, by specified deadlines, EPA is  required to issue a federal implementation plan. EPA issued regulations  interpreting and clarifying the Good Neighbor provisions in 1998 and  2005, but a federal court found the 2005 regulation and its federal  implementation plans to be unlawful.

In 2005, EPA reversed  this finding and finalized a regulation under section 111 of the Clean Air  Act regulating mercury emissions from certain electricity generating units,  which a federal court later struck down. Pursuant to a settlement  agreement to resolve a lawsuit for failing to meet the statutory deadline  for issuing a section 112 regulation, EPA published the final MATS  regulations in February 2012. Among other things, MATS establishes  numerical emissions limitations for mercury, filterable particulate matter  (as a surrogate for all toxic nonmercury metal pollutants), and hydrogen  chloride (as a surrogate for all toxic acid gas pollutants) at certain new  and existing generating units.

In June 2010, to address risks from the disposal of coal  combustion residuals generated at electricity generating units, EPA  proposed CCR to regulate coal combustion residuals for the first time.  EPA co-proposed two alternative regulations. Under the first, EPA would  list residuals as a special waste and regulate them as a hazardous waste  by establishing requirements for their management from generation to  disposal. Under the second option, EPA would regulate coal combustion  residuals as nonhazardous solid waste and establish national minimum  standards for their disposal in surface impoundments or landfills.  Regulation as a special waste would occur through a federal or  authorized state permitting program with requirements for its storage,  transport, and disposal, among other things. Regulation as a special  waste would also allow for federal enforcement. Regulation as a  nonhazardous solid waste would not require the establishment of a permit  program and would not be federally enforceable. Instead, states or private  parties could bring lawsuits against alleged violators. EPA estimated the  annualized benefits of its special waste option would be $207 to $1,342  million with $1,549 million in annualized costs and that the nonhazardous  waste option would generate annualized benefits of $88 to $596 million  with $606 million in annualized costs.issuing a final CCR regulation.", "Damage to Aquatic Life: 316(b)", "Coal and other types of electricity generating units often draw in large  volumes of water from nearby rivers, lakes, or oceans to use for cooling,  which can damage aquatic life.

To avoid system security  challenges, system operators make real-time changes in the  operation of the electricity system, for example, by increasing or  decreasing the amount of electricity generated in particular locations   or by changing power flows on the transmission system in order to  maintain suitable operating conditions.", "System planners attempt to avoid reliability problems through advance  planning of transmission and, in some cases, generation resources. The  role of a system planner can be carried out by individual power  companies or regional entities called Regional Transmission  Organizations (RTO). Figure 3 shows the territories of the seven RTOs  in the United States. System planners\u2019 responsibilities include analyzing  expected future changes in generation and transmission assets, such as  the retirement of a generating unit; customer demand; and emerging  reliability issues. For example, once a system planner learns that a power  company intends to retire a generating unit, the system planner generally  studies the electricity system to assess whether the retirement would  cause reliability challenges and identify solutions to mitigate any impacts.  The solutions could be in the form of replacement capacity (generation or  demand-side resources) and new transmission lines or other equipment,  each with its own associated permitting and construction timelines.", "When reliability challenges cannot be avoided through prior planning,  system operators take measures to resolve the problem by rebalancing  supply and demand. The role of the system operator is also fulfilled by  different entities, including individual power companies and RTOs. In the  event of an urgent reliability challenge, system operators may take  immediate steps to lower demand through public appeals to reduce use;  interrupting or lowering electricity supply to customers who have  negotiated prior agreements with the power company, which are referred  to as reliability-driven demand-response programs; as well as rotating  blackouts of limited duration. For example, during a period of sustained  high summer temperatures in 2011, the system operator in Texas called  upon the public to reduce electricity use during hours of peak demand to  prevent the need for rotating blackouts. When reliability challenges  cannot be adequately managed by system operators, unplanned,  uncontrolled interruption of customer\u2019s electricity use can occur. These  interruptions may be confined to a localized area or widespread. For  example, in August 2003, an electricity blackout affected millions of  people across eight U.S. states and parts of Canada when, among other  things, system operators were unable to keep outages in northern Ohio  from cascading to interconnected portions of the electric grid.

DOE has used this authority in the past to, among other  things, ensure electricity could be provided to the District of Columbia in  the event of a transmission line failure, as well as to provide electricity to  customers during the California energy crisis.

This is because the final CCR and 316(b)  regulations might differ from the proposed regulations and because of  current and potential future legal challenges. For example, CSAPR and  MATS\u2014the two regulations that have been finalized\u2014face legal  challenges and may change depending on how the court rules. In  addition, some of the regulatory requirements, such as some aspects of  316(b), will not be specified until the relevant permits are issued.  Furthermore, several bills have been introduced in Congress that would  affect some or all of the regulations. Some power companies may delay  taking actions to respond to these regulations until there is additional  certainty about their final regulatory requirements.", "Several other factors also contribute to the uncertain environment in  which power companies will respond to the new regulations. Among  these is uncertainty about the future demand for electricity. EIA projects  that demand for electricity will grow slowly over the next few years. This  means power companies may be less inclined to make, and state  electricity regulators may be less willing to approve of, investments in  electricity generating units that may not be needed as often. On the other  hand, if the economic recovery is more robust, there could be more  electricity demand than expected, which might increase the need for  additional generating capacity in some areas. Another factor that  contributes to uncertainty is the price of fuels. Natural gas prices have  decreased in recent years, and coal prices have increased, narrowing the  historical cost advantage of using coal to produce electricity in some parts  of the country. As a result of these changing prices, among other things,  the use of natural gas to produce electricity has increased and is  expected to continue to increase. For example, EIA recently projected  that the use of natural gas to produce electricity in 2012 could increase by  24 percent, and that, in turn, electricity generation from coal could decline  by 15 percent. However, some stakeholders we interviewed raised  concerns about the prospects for continued low natural gas prices, citing  the potential increased future use of natural gas for electricity or more  strict regulation of natural gas production that could affect the long-term  outlook for domestic natural gas production and prices.", "Another factor that contributes to uncertainty is the increased focus on  renewable energy production and other potential future regulations. In  recent years, there have been federal and state efforts to encourage the  development of renewable energy sources\u2014particularly wind and solar\u2014 to produce electricity. For example, 30 states have laws or regulations  requiring power companies to increasingly rely on renewable sources for  electricity. renewable sources increasing from 10 percent in 2010 to 16 percent of  total electricity generation by 2035, potentially diminishing the demand for  electricity from fossil fuels, including coal, in the future.

All 12 of the studies we  reviewed suggest that power companies may retrofit many coal-fueled  generating units with new or upgraded controls to respond to the four  key regulations. EPA\u2019s analyses and two other studies we reviewed  report national projections of how companies may reduce emissions  of air pollutants to meet the finalized MATS and CSAPR  requirements. Projections in these studies suggest that one-third to  three-quarters of all coal-fueled capacity could be retrofitted or  upgraded with some combination of controls, including the following:  (1) fabric filters or electrostatic precipitators to control particulate  matter; (2) dry sorbent injection or flue gas desulfurization units\u2014also  known as scrubbers\u2014to control SO and acid gas emissions; (3)  selective catalytic reduction or selective non-catalytic reduction units  to control NO; and (4) activated carbon injection units to reduce  mercury emissions.

These two studies projected that companies could  convert 96-98 and 158 power plants to dry ash handling  respectively.

DOE found that,  assuming prompt action by regulators and generators, the timelines  associated with retrofits and new construction are generally comparable  to EPA\u2019s regulatory deadlines. EPA reported that a reasonable,  moderately paced effort would result in the majority of needed retrofits  being installed by 2015 with the possibility of some retrofits needing up to  an additional year for completion. In addition, EPA\u2019s analysis stated that  past experience may not reflect industry\u2019s ability to deploy controls at a  faster pace in the future using overtime, additional off-site modularization  and prefabrication.", "At the same time, power company representatives and other stakeholders  suggested that it might be challenging to complete retrofits or retirements  by the compliance deadline for MATS in some cases. In this regard, an  analysis by the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a voluntary group whose  members include power companies, found that about 30 percent of  projects to install fabric filters might be completed by the 2015 MATS  compliance deadline and almost 70 percent of projects might be  completed by the 2016 deadline, with the 1-year extension available from  permitting authorities. EPA's study of the final MATS regulation  indicates that fewer fabric filters may be needed than were assumed by  the Utility Air Regulatory Group, and the group's results suggest that it  may be possible to complete these by the 2016 deadline with the 1-year  extension. Similarly, actions to mitigate capacity loss and other  challenges due to generating unit retirements could take time as they  could involve building new generating units or upgrading transmission  systems. If these actions cannot be completed before compliance  deadlines, a reliability challenge could arise unless steps are taken to  keep generating units that are critical for the reliability of the electricity  system from retiring. There have been examples of efforts to conduct  transmission upgrades to address reliability challenges that have taken  longer than the 4 years that may be available to meet the MATS  compliance deadline assuming a 1-year extension. For example,  transmission upgrades were necessary to allow several generating units  with total capacity of 790 MW to retire at the Benning Road and Buzzard  Point power plants on the Potomac Electric Power Company system,  which serves 788,000 customers in Maryland and the District of  Columbia. In 2007, the plants\u2019 owner notified the system planner of its  desire to retire the units by mid-2012. The needed transmission  upgrades, including new transformers and circuits, are expected to be  completed in mid-2012.", "Retrofits of generating units, transmission system upgrades, and the  construction of new generating units can be major engineering  undertakings, and several power company representatives and other  stakeholders we interviewed said that completing some of these  undertakings by compliance deadlines may be challenging in some  cases. Stakeholders expressing concerns highlighted the following three  reasons meeting these deadlines could be challenging, particularly for  MATS compliance:", "Regulatory approvals can take time. Retrofits, transmission line  upgrades, and construction of new generating units will require  various state and local regulatory approvals, which may include  construction permits and modifications of air pollution permits, which  can extend the completion time of such projects. In traditionally  regulated markets, power companies that decide to undertake a  retrofit or new construction may also need to obtain a review by the  state utility commission in order to include associated costs in  electricity rates. Some of these approvals can be pursued  concurrently with or be obtained after design, construction, and start- up, but some may extend completion times.", "Site-specific concerns for retrofits. In addition, some of the power  company representatives we interviewed told us that power plants  may have site-specific physical constraints that can slow completion  of work. For example, according to representatives at one company, it  took the company about 5 years to install fabric filters on four units at  one plant, in part because the site did not have space to place the  needed controls. The fabric filter for one of the units had to be  constructed 1,200 feet away and connected via ductwork. Figure 6  illustrates another power plant with site-specific concerns, constrained  by a river on one side and a highway and mountain on the other.  Officials from the power company owning this plant told us that they  generally construct a separate new stack for retrofitted scrubbers, but  this was not possible due to space constraints at this site. Instead, the  power company is installing ductwork from the scrubber through the  cooling tower in order to use the cooling tower as a stack.", "Supply chain concerns. Some power company representatives and  other stakeholders stated that, because of the large number of  potential retrofits, they had concerns about the availability of specific  skilled laborers or equipment needed to install some controls. The  installation of some controls could entail significant retrofit efforts  industry-wide. For example, according to EPA, companies could  install fabric filters on an additional 102,000 MW of coal-fueled  capacity in response to MATS. This is almost double the coal-fueled  capacity that currently has fabric filters. The simultaneous installation  of air pollution controls has strained supply chains in the past. For  example, EPA stated that, from 2007 to 2008, when a significant  number of power plants installed scrubbers, delays as long as 18  months occurred for plants to obtain such key engineered equipment  as large pumps, motors, and chimneys that were needed. (See app.  IV for additional information on the controls installed on coal-fueled  units.) Some other stakeholders have said that there are sufficient  resources available and did not identify concerns related to supply  chain issues.

In addition, CSAPR would cover 28 states in the eastern  half of the United States, so generating units in the remaining states  would not be affected. Second, power companies in certain areas may  have already installed some of the needed controls on their coal-fueled  units for a variety of reasons. For example, at least 18 states have  enacted laws or regulations to limit mercury emissions from electricity  generation. To satisfy these state requirements, power companies with  coal-fueled generating units in these states may have already installed, or  be planning to install, controls that are also capable of meeting MATS  limits.

Retirements and retrofits could contribute to  such concerns if generating units have not been able to retrofit on time or  because efforts to mitigate reliability effects are not completed in time.  According to EPA documents and some stakeholders we interviewed,  there are expected to be few such situations, and existing tools should be  sufficient to address issues that do arise.

(For such  situations, regulatory or other tools may provide flexibility for resolving  challenges. These are discussed in the following section.)", "Retrofits. Two aspects of retrofits can cause potential reliability  challenges. First, in certain cases, generating units will need to be  temporarily shut down to connect new controls, and some  stakeholders said that scheduling these shutdowns while maintaining  reliability could be challenging in certain areas. According to DOE,  shutdowns for the types of controls that may be undertaken in  response to MATS and CSAPR usually take less than 8 weeks. In  addition, these shutdowns can often be scheduled during regular  maintenance periods, and therefore may not require units to be shut  down for additional time. More time may be needed for some units,  however, because of site specific conditions\u2014such as when a single  control device must be connected to multiple generating units\u2014or  because installation involves the types of controls that take longer to  connect. For example, connecting activated carbon or dry sorbent  injection units may require less than a 1-week shutdown. Installing  scrubbers, which are more complex, typically requires a 3- to 8-week  shutdown, and these installations can sometimes take longer  according to information presented by DOE. Scheduling a large  number of these longer shutdowns may pose challenges. For  example, one system planner told us that companies typically try to  schedule such shutdowns during periods of normally low demand,  such as the spring and fall, but it may be difficult to schedule all of  these longer shutdowns during those periods between now and the  compliance date for MATS. Second, if power companies cannot install  controls in time to respond to MATS and CSAPR regulations, they  may have to shut some units down until such installations are  completed, also potentially posing reliability challenges. EPA officials  said that large numbers of air pollution controls were installed in  response to past regulatory requirements without raising major  reliability issues. However, NERC and two of the RTOs we  interviewed have expressed concerns about having sufficient  generating capacity as companies undertake retrofits that require  short-term shutdowns.", "Retirements. It is not certain what portion of the 2 to 12 percent of  coal-fueled generating units expected to retire could cause reliability  challenges that would need to be addressed. Several stakeholders  said it could be difficult to resolve all potential reliability challenges  that may arise because of retirements before the 3-year MATS  compliance deadline established by statute. There have been  examples in the past of efforts to resolve reliability issues as a result  of retirements that have taken multiple years to resolve, and two of  the RTOs we spoke with have identified similar challenges going  forward. For example, PJM Interconnection (PJM), an RTO system  planner in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, received 116 requests from  power companies to retire units, as of May 30, 2012\u2014representing  16,184 MW of capacity and almost 9 percent of capacity under PJM\u2019s  authority. PJM has identified reliability concerns with 101 of these  retirement requests because they may cause violations of reliability  standards. PJM has identified solutions to these potential violations,  including transmission upgrades and operational changes, and stated  that it expects the resolution of its reliability concerns with 16 of these  retirements to take past April 2016\u2014the MATS compliance deadline  for units with a 1-year extension. Similarly, as of May 3, 2012, MISO  has identified reliability challenges with 8 of the 62 unit retirement  notifications it has received and completed evaluations on. MISO  expects 5 of these to take until 2018 to resolve.", "Increasing reliance on natural gas. Several stakeholders said that  increasing dependence on natural gas to produce electricity could  pose potential reliability challenges because there could be  interruptions in the delivery of natural gas to generating units. In  particular, one stakeholder said that there can be other natural gas  users on pipelines, such as homeowners in regions of the country  where natural gas is used as a home heating fuel, who may also  consume natural gas during periods of peak demand. In these areas,  constructing pipelines to improve the supply of natural gas to existing  or new natural gas-fueled generating units could take time because of  a range of financial and regulatory steps that must be taken. Without  such upgrades, there may be inadequate natural gas supply in certain  locations where it is needed for electricity generation. While pipeline  capacity is being expanded in some regions of the country to  accommodate rising demand, several stakeholders raised concerns  about gas-electric coordination in the industry. To better understand  and prepare for these challenges, MISO recently completed a study  on the availability of natural gas pipeline infrastructure to support  increased use of natural gas-fueled capacity. The study found that  some of the region\u2019s pipelines that deliver natural gas to power plants  may be close to capacity and that further investments in pipeline  capacity and additional natural gas storage may be needed to ensure  the delivery of reliable natural gas supplies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Existing Tools Could Mitigate Many Adverse Implications, but Agencies Do Not Have a Formal Process to Monitor Industry Progress Toward Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Various tools available to industry and regulators could help mitigate  potential adverse electricity market implications, including some price  increases, associated with requirements in the four key regulations.

In traditionally regulated markets, in order to determine  whether to allow power companies to recover the costs of responding to  the regulations, public utility commissions will hold proceedings to review  whether power companies\u2019 investments in response to the four key EPA  regulations are prudent. These proceedings could involve consideration  of whether a power company\u2019s compliance strategy\u2014whether to invest in  controls, modify a unit to produce electricity using a different fuel source,  retire a unit, or build a new unit\u2014is defensible. They could also include a  review of the actual costs involved in installing controls. Once approved  by the regulator, ratepayers in these markets primarily bear the risk  associated with actions to comply with the regulations.

In addition, to ensure these markets  remain competitive and that prices reflect the cost of producing electricity,  FERC officials told us that RTOs and FERC have processes in place to  identify, investigate, and prosecute manipulative behavior in wholesale  electricity markets, as well as to ensure that prices are set in well- functioning markets representing the interplay of supply and demand.  Several stakeholders we spoke with said these processes should be  effective at keeping power companies from using actions they may take in  response to the EPA regulations as an opportunity to manipulate the  electricity markets.", "However, these tools in traditionally regulated and restructured markets  do not limit power companies from passing on to consumers any  legitimate costs they incur in responding to the EPA regulations, such as  the costs of installing controls, procuring CSAPR allowances, constructing  transmission lines to address reliability challenges, and acquiring power  from other sources to compensate for retiring generating units. Two of the  state public utility commission representatives we spoke with from  traditionally regulated markets said it would be unlikely for a public utility  commission to deny cost recovery for prudent investments needed to  respond to these EPA regulations. In restructured markets, power  companies will attempt to recover the costs they incurred in responding to  the regulations through the electricity markets. To the extent that price  increases are the result of prudent steps in response to the EPA  regulations rather than market manipulation, federal or state regulators  may have little authority to mitigate them.", "EPA has designed the regulations with some provisions that provide  flexibility and allow power companies to minimize the costs of responding  to them, which may reduce consumer electricity price increases. For  example, by making CSAPR allowances tradable rather than requiring all  generating units to individually meet a particular emissions threshold,  EPA may enable power companies to achieve overall emissions limits at  a lower cost. Additionally, EPA requested public comment on several  regulatory provisions in the proposed CCR regulation which, according to  EPA officials, could help lower industry compliance costs and reduce  price increases.", "In addition, some tools could lower demand for electricity, which may  offset potential price increases. For example, some states have provided  incentives for consumers to purchase more energy efficient household  appliances as part of an effort to avoid constructing additional generating  units. Furthermore, electricity pricing and other programs can encourage  customers to adjust their usage in response to changes in prices or  market conditions, which can affect reliability. These programs are  collectively referred to as \u201cdemand-response\u201d programs, and two types\u2014 \u201dmarket-based pricing\u201d and \u201creliability-driven\u201d\u2014are in use. Market-based  pricing programs enable customers to adjust their use of electricity in  response to changing prices. Reliability-driven programs, on the other  hand, enable system operators to request that customers reduce  electricity use when needed, such as if hot weather or system  malfunctions mean that demand will probably exceed supply and cause a  blackout. In August 2004, we reported that demand-response programs  promote greater efficiency in supplying electricity by postponing the need  to construct new generating units and reducing the need to use the  generating units that are the most costly to operate. We recommended  that FERC consider the presence or absence of demand response when  making key decisions about electricity markets, including whether to allow  some buyers to participate in wholesale markets. In response to our  recommendation, FERC has taken steps to facilitate broader use of  demand-response programs among RTOs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Tools Could Address Many, but Not All, Reliability Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Tools available to industry and regulators may also help address many,  but not all, potential reliability challenges. For example, planning, market,  and operational tools used by system planners and operators to ensure  the availability of adequate transmission and generation will help address  many potential reliability challenges associated with these regulations.  System planners and operators, whether RTOs or individual power  companies, manage the electricity system in accordance with NERC  reliability standards. With respect to transmission, system planners  compare the long-term demand for electricity at various points throughout  the system to the location, capacity, and operating limits of generation  and transmission resources. These activities require timely information  on, among other things, planned retirements and new additions. EPA  provided one mechanism through which system planners may receive  this information in a more timely way when it instructed power companies  seeking Clean Air Act administrative orders\u2014orders to give units up to an  additional year to come into compliance with MATS\u2014to provide  compliance plans to system planners. In addition, some RTOs have  begun requesting that power companies in their regions voluntarily  provide early information on their plans to respond to the regulations,  including planned retirements, retrofits, and operational changes. With  respect to generation, system planner activities vary, with some areas of  the country planning their future investment in generation and others  using market-based approaches to encourage the development of new  generation. System operators take more immediate actions to ensure the  grid operates in conformance with NERC reliability standards, such as  directing when to bring additional generation online to meet demand or  improve system operating conditions. System planners and operators  must manage changes that power companies make to respond to the  EPA regulations\u2014retiring generating units, changing operating  schedules, or scheduling shutdowns to install controls\u2014in a way that  does not violate NERC\u2019s reliability standards.  For example, system  planners must maintain adequate contingency reserves\u2014such as  additional available generation or electricity consumers willing to lower  their demand for electricity\u2014to address any unexpected operational  problems that arise, even when some electricity generating units retire or  are out of service to install controls. Broader initiatives in the electric  power industry, such as activities to promote demand-response and  energy efficiency, may also help mitigate reliability challenges.", "Although these planning, market, and operational tools could address  many potential reliability challenges, challenges may still arise if  generating units needed for reliability are not in compliance with the EPA  regulations by the deadlines. For example, local reliability challenges  could occur if generating units that need to operate in a local area to  ensure resource adequacy or system security do not meet these  regulations\u2019 compliance deadlines\u2013\u2013either because they have not been  able to retrofit on time or because system planners have not yet  completed efforts to mitigate the reliability effects of the units\u2019 planned  retirement. However, according to EPA officials and documentation, most  units should be able to complete steps to respond to the regulations prior  to their deadlines. Nonetheless, some stakeholders remain concerned  and told us that the loss of reliability-critical units that cannot comply by  the deadlines could have an adverse impact on reliability.", "These administrative orders are authorized by section 113(a) of the Clean Air Act and,  by statute, cannot last for longer than a year or be renewed. year. According to EPA\u2019s MATS enforcement memo, EPA does not  intend to seek civil penalties for violations of the MATS regulation that  occur as a result of operation in conformance with these  administrative orders. Power companies that intend to seek these  orders must, among other things, notify system planners by April 16,  2013, of their MATS compliance plans, which EPA expects to help the  system planners better manage possible reliability challenges.  However, EPA officials told us that such notifications are not required  if a power company does not intend to seek additional time to  respond, such as if it plans to retire its generating units. Furthermore,  some stakeholders have raised concerns that administrative orders do  not shield power companies from private parties suing them for  violating the MATS regulation.address situations in which units need more than 5 years to comply.  EPA officials told us that, if generating units need additional time to  respond, EPA will make case-by-case decisions about how to  proceed by using, for example, the consent decree process described  below.", "In addition, this tool would not", "Clean Air Act consent decrees.", "These consent decrees are authorized by section 113(b) of the Clean Air Act. develop it. In addition, according to EPA officials, power companies  must be willing to enter into consent decrees. However, in the case of  a retiring generating unit, it may be the system planner, rather than  the power company, that wants to keep the unit operating. As a result,  a power company that wants to retire a reliability-critical generating  unit may have little incentive to enter into a consent decree,  particularly if it means paying a penalty to do so.", "Reliability must-run agreements. Reliability must-run agreements\u2014 which provide cost-based payments to the owners of reliability-critical  generating units to cover the cost of operating these units past when  their owners were planning to retire them\u2014are another possible tool  for addressing some reliability challenges. These agreements have  been used in the past to address occasional retirements of individual  generating units due to changing economic conditions, such as when  operating a unit became unprofitable. For example, a reliability must- run agreement was used to keep Hudson Unit 1, a 383 MW unit in  New Jersey, operational for reliability reasons for 7 years after the  Public Service Enterprise Group, the power company that owns the  unit, had requested to retire it. A reliability must-run agreement was  needed for so long, in part, because of delays in the construction of a  transmission line that was being developed to address potential  reliability violations that could occur without the new line. However,  these agreements may not be an option for responding to all types of  reliability challenges that could arise when power companies seek to  retire reliability-critical generating units in response to the four key  regulations. According to representatives from some RTOs we spoke  to, reliability must-run agreements have historically been used to  reimburse power companies for their operating expenses rather than  major capital and other expenditures, such as the installation of  controls to reduce pollution, or financial penalties for violating  environmental laws and regulations. As such, in situations where a  power company plans to retire a generating unit, reliability must-run  agreements may be useful if an administrative order or consent  decree can be obtained. If not, reliability must-run agreements may be  less applicable because those units would either have to install  controls in order to comply or risk financial penalties for  noncompliance.", "DOE emergency authority. DOE\u2019s authority under section 202(c) of  the Federal Power Act to order a power company to generate  electricity in certain emergencies is another tool through which  reliability challenges resulting from actions to comply with the four  regulations may be addressed. For example, DOE could use this  authority to require a retiring electricity generating unit that emits more  mercury than allowed by MATS to continue to operate after the MATS  compliance deadline if the unit was needed to respond to an  emergency because of an electric shortage. However, DOE officials  told us that they expect to use their section 202(c) authority to  address reliability concerns associated with the EPA regulations rarely  and as a tool of last resort. Further, in some circumstances, this  authority may not provide for timely resolution of potential reliability  challenges associated with the four EPA regulations. DOE has used  its section 202(c) authority six times in the past, and officials told us  that, in most instances, DOE has been able to issue section 202(c)  orders quickly.where it is less obvious whether there is a reliability emergency, it  could take time for officials to analyze whether the requirements for an  order are met and issue the order.", "However, DOE officials explained that, in situations  In addition, although DOE may coordinate with EPA and state  environmental regulators to ensure the section 202(c) order that is  issued does not result in a violation of environmental requirements,  some power company representatives expressed concern that  operating under a section 202(c) order could still result in a potential  conflict between DOE\u2019s order and environmental laws and  regulations. This could occur if DOE issued a section 202(c) order  before agreement could be reached with EPA and state  environmental regulators on how to operate the unit to adequately  respond to the emergency and comply with applicable environmental  laws and regulations.told us that, in these situations, it is unclear whether the power  company would (1) refuse to generate electricity and risk electricity  reliability or (2) operate in violation of the environmental laws and  regulations and risk enforcement action and legal liability. A legal  representative at one power company we spoke with explained that  he could not advise company officials to operate a unit in violation of  the Clean Air Act without additional legal protection. Representatives  from another power company said that power companies in such a  situation may defer to the courts\u2014a potentially time-intensive  solution\u2014to avoid legal liability and determine what course of action  they should take. Moreover, power companies may have to negotiate  with, or seek approval from, multiple additional parties, including the  relevant RTO and FERC, for an agreement outlining the payment  terms for the unit\u2019s operation under the section 202(c) order, as well  as with EPA and state environmental authorities to avoid financial  penalties if operation results in violation of environmental laws and  regulations. Getting these agreements in order can also be time- consuming which, if the process is not started well in advance, may  delay steps to address reliability. EPA staff commented that the  agency will be closely tracking cases where extensions and orders  are used.", "Representatives from two power companies", "Clean Air Act section 112 presidential exemption authority. The broad  authority provided to the President to exempt power companies from  complying with MATS is a potential tool to avoid reliability challenges,  but this authority has never been used, and uncertainties exist as to  how this tool would apply to reliability challenges that arise under  MATS. Section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act authorizes the President  to exempt any generating unit from compliance with MATS for a  period of not more than 2 years under certain circumstances.", "Specifically, the President must make two determinations to use this  authority: (1) that the technology to implement the regulation is not  available and (2) that the exemption is in the national security  interests of the United States. As of May 2012, this authority has  never been used, and there is uncertainty about whether these  conditions could be met. For example, as to the first determination,  EPA established emissions standards for mercury and other  pollutants that can be met with technology that has been available for  a significant time. However, according to EPA staff, EPA\u2019s rulemaking  was not intended to and did not consider the interpretation of the term  \u2018available\u2019 as used in the presidential exemption provision.  Furthermore, regarding the second determination, EPA staff explained  that the record supporting EPA\u2019s rulemaking includes some  information that others might consider relevant in making any such  determination. EPA officials also noted, however, that section  112(i)(4) authorizes the President, not EPA, to act. Regarding these  determinations, according to one stakeholder, it would be implausible  to claim that technology to comply with MATS is not available, and  there is not currently evidence of a sufficient threat to national  security. Another stakeholder, however, has argued that the statute is  sufficiently broad to allow the exemption authority to be used in some  situations when a power company does not have the physical ability  to obtain, purchase, and install technology by the deadlines and that  the true extent of reliability challenges' threat to national security  interests cannot be fully known until specific reliability studies are  completed based on specific compliance plan proposals. Several  stakeholders we spoke to during this review indicated that the  presidential exemption authority can be used, though two said the  statute establishes a high threshold that must be met.", "In addition to these six tools, some provisions in two of the regulations\u2014 CSAPR and 316(b)\u2014help address electric reliability. For example,  CSAPR allows power companies to run existing controls more often,  install additional controls, or acquire allowances by purchasing them from  another source or using allowances saved from prior years. According to  EPA officials, this flexibility can help power companies plan and manage  their operations in a manner that ensures system reliability. With respect  to 316(b), as indicated in the preamble to the proposed regulation,  permitting authorities have flexibility to tailor compliance timelines to  enable installation without negatively impacting the reliability of electric  supply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Begun Taking Steps to Monitor Industry\u2019s Progress but Have Not Documented Their Process, and FERC Has Not Proactively Reviewed RTO Rules", "paragraphs": ["FERC, DOE, and EPA have begun taking steps to monitor industry\u2019s  progress in responding to the regulations but have not established a  formal, documented process for joint and routine monitoring, and FERC  has not taken steps to proactively assess RTO rules in the context of the  regulations. FERC, DOE, and EPA officials said they have taken initial  steps to understand the status of industry\u2019s plans to respond to the  regulations, and officials from each agency told us they have periodically  met with affected stakeholders\u2014for example, power companies, state  public utility commissions, and all of the RTOs, among others\u2014to discuss  the regulations\u2019 impact and the status of industry compliance. For  example, staff from all three entities said they have had multiple  conference calls with RTOs in areas affected by the regulations. In  addition, FERC hosted a technical conference in 2011 to discuss policy  issues related to the EPA regulations with industry stakeholders, and  FERC and state public utility regulators have established a forum to  explore reliability challenges related to the EPA regulations.Furthermore, according to EPA staff, the agency had multiple meetings  with all of the major utility trade associations, as well as a number of large  power companies with substantial coal-fueled generating capacity, to  discuss compliance plans and issues that are emerging. However, each  agency\u2019s efforts are varied in scale and scope, and none of the agencies  has developed a formal, documented process for routinely monitoring  industry progress, including goals for any monitoring activities, data to be  collected and analyzed, and how the agencies will use this information.  Officials from FERC and DOE told us they had not formalized their  processes for monitoring industry\u2019s progress since power companies  were in the process of finalizing their approach for responding to the  regulations.", "As discussed, actions power companies take in response to the four  regulations may present potential reliability challenges, or risks. In a  December 2005 report on risk management, we reported that monitoring  is essential in ensuring that a risk management approach is current and  relevant. Without a formal, documented process that the three agencies  have agreed on for monitoring industry\u2019s progress toward meeting the  compliance deadlines, it is uncertain how comprehensive the agencies\u2019  monitoring efforts will be and whether they will adequately address such  specific issues as the status of required regulatory approvals, the  availability of key materials and skilled workers, the likelihood of potential  reliability challenges, and the adequacy of existing tools for addressing  these challenges. Without a formal, documented process for monitoring,  it is also uncertain whether the agencies\u2019 future monitoring activities will  be sufficiently comprehensive to alert them in advance if a larger than  expected number of reliability challenges arise so they can assess  whether internal agency resources are available to carry out their  responsibilities. For example, if there is a larger than expected number of  local reliability challenges, FERC may be less able to effectively and  quickly manage reviewing (1) applications for cost recovery for  transmission investments, (2) the reliability impacts of electricity  generating units whose owners seek an administrative order from EPA for  compliance with MATS, (3) reliability must-run agreements outlining the  payment terms for the operation of a unit that would otherwise retire, and  (4) whether steps should be taken to require RTOs or market participants  to secure additional demand-response resources.", "Furthermore, these three agencies have informally collaborated about the  EPA regulations, but they have not developed a formal, documented  process for coordinating their monitoring efforts. Officials from all three  responsible agencies said they have held periodic discussions with  officials from the other agencies. This informal collaboration also involved  participation in the FERC technical conference on the EPA regulations  and joint agency participation at meetings with industry stakeholders.  EPA officials told us the agencies have agreed to work together to  monitor the progress of industry\u2019s compliance with the regulations in the  future. However, these agencies have not documented their process for  coordination, including the expected frequency of contact with each other  and industry, key agency responsibilities, and how they will share  information. We have previously reported that by using informal  coordination mechanisms, agencies may rely on relationships with  individual officials, which could end once personnel move to their next  assignments. We reported that agencies can strengthen their  commitment to work collaboratively by articulating their roles and  responsibilities in formal documents\u2014such as memorandums of  understanding or interagency planning documents\u2014to facilitate decision  making. These documents can clarify which agencies will be responsible  for particular activities and how they will organize their individual and joint  efforts. Without more formal coordination mechanisms, any assessment  of whether tools are sufficient to mitigate potential reliability challenges  may not fully leverage the perspective of all three agencies, each of which  has a unique area of expertise and ability to perform different analysis.  Each of the three agencies may have knowledge of whether particular  tools are useful for addressing actual reliability challenges, and DOE and  FERC may be able to provide insight into the magnitude and urgency of  such challenges.", "Moreover, according to agency officials, the agencies do not have a  formal, documented process for how they will provide information from  their monitoring efforts to Congress. Without information on whether  existing tools are sufficiently timely, relevant, and effective for addressing  any adverse implications that arise, Congress may not be sufficiently  informed about whether additional statutory authority is needed. Through  multiple hearings and an information request to FERC, members of  Congress have already sought additional information on these issues.  Legislation has also been introduced to, among other things, extend the  compliance dates for MATS and CSAPR, to prohibit or invalidate one or  more of the regulations, and establish that compliance with a section  202(c) order cannot be considered a violation of any environmental law or  regulation. Without information such as what could be provided through  EPA, FERC, and DOE\u2019s joint monitoring efforts, Congress will be less  informed when it deliberates these bills about the extent to which actual  reliability concerns arise and whether new statutes are needed to address  them.", "Furthermore, FERC has not taken steps to proactively assess whether  RTO market rules and similar rules at non-RTO system planners will be  adequate to ensure timely, cost-effective mitigation of the potential  reliability challenges associated with the multiple generating unit  retirements and outages that may occur over a short period due to the  EPA regulations and other factors. These rules govern such things as  how these entities schedule temporary shutdowns for retrofits, receive  notifications from power companies regarding retirements of generating  units, and address potential reliability challenges, including how  transmission upgrades and demand response are considered and  pursued. These rules affect how cost-effectively reliability challenges are  managed. Table 3 shows examples of RTOs that have begun reviewing  their rules related to electricity transmission, markets, and other areas  and are considering whether changes are needed in light of the EPA  regulations and other industry factors. Changes under consideration  relate to scheduling outages, unit retirements, and planning for  transmission needs. Many are being considered with the goal of avoiding  unnecessary costs or reliability problems. For example, under current  market rules in the MISO region, power company retirement requests are  binding, meaning once a power company has submitted a request to  retire, it cannot change its mind. MISO stakeholders are discussing  whether changes need to be made to market rules to allow power  companies to submit nonbinding requests for unit retirements, so that  MISO can provide these companies with information on the reliability  impacts of their proposed retirements prior to these companies making a  final decision about whether to retire. According to MISO officials, if a  power company received this information prior to making a retirement  decision, the company might be able to make more cost-effective choices  by comparing the cost of steps to address reliability concerns associated  with a potential retirement to the cost of complying with the regulations by  installing environmental controls.", "FERC officials told us that initial discussions with the RTOs\u2014such as  through the FERC technical conference\u2014indicated that current market  rules are adequate and that FERC will review any proposed changes to  market rules that they receive from RTOs to ensure that the rules  continue to promote just and reasonable rates and, where relevant,  address reliability issues. However, the commission does not have plans  to proactively assess the adequacy of any rules unless RTOs propose  specific changes. Furthermore, FERC officials said the commission does  not plan to evaluate whether changes proposed by one RTO may also be  useful at others. FERC officials said they have also not assessed the  rules of non-RTO system planners because FERC has more limited  authority over non-RTO rules. However, FERC officials acknowledged  that they have the authority to proactively request that RTOs make  changes to rules if FERC believes a rule change is warranted. Under the  current approach\u2014wherein individual RTOs consider potential changes  and request approval from FERC\u2014FERC risks taking a piecemeal  approach to oversight and may miss opportunities to encourage  development of market rules in all regions that are adequately designed  to promote just and reasonable rates in the context of the industry\u2019s  transition."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The four key EPA regulations\u2014two finalized and two proposed\u2014would  reduce adverse health or environmental impacts associated with coal- fueled electricity generating units, potentially avoiding thousands of  premature deaths each year. Aspects of these regulations remain  uncertain, but they, along with other industry trends such as the aging of  coal-fueled generating units and lower prices for natural gas, are  expected to contribute to significant changes in electricity systems in  some parts of the United States in the near future. These potential  changes, which include retrofitting many coal-fueled units and retiring  more coal-fueled capacity than has been retired over the past 22 years,  have implications for electricity prices and reliability. FERC, DOE, and  EPA each have key responsibilities concerning the electricity industry and  all three agencies have taken steps to address potential adverse  implications associated with these regulations.", "Existing tools provide a foundation for mitigating many of the price and  reliability implications of actions power companies may take in response  to the regulations. However, these tools may not fully address all potential  adverse implications in some regions, for example, some reliability  challenges that arise after the compliance deadlines. Knowledge of the  severity and extent to which challenges arise will be key to understanding  whether existing tools are adequate or additional tools are needed.  FERC, DOE, and EPA have taken important first steps to coordinate with  RTOs, other system planners, and state regulators, among others, to  better understand these issues. However, without a formal, documented  process that the three agencies have agreed upon for jointly, routinely  monitoring industry\u2019s progress, it is uncertain whether their activities will  be sufficiently comprehensive and fully leverage their unique areas of  expertise. FERC, DOE, and EPA can build on their initial monitoring  efforts by documenting their process for monitoring, including the  expected frequency of their contact, and how they will organize their  efforts and share information. Moreover, as shown by multiple hearings  and the introduction of legislation that would affect some or all of the  regulations, there has been congressional interest in the potential  reliability and price implications of these regulations. Information from a  coordinated monitoring effort could help inform these ongoing  deliberations and make clear whether additional statutory authority is  needed to cost-effectively address any reliability challenges that actually  arise.", "In addition, rules at system planners, including RTO market rules and, in  some cases, similar rules at non-RTO system planners, govern such  details as how these entities schedule temporary shutdowns for retrofits;  receive notification from power companies regarding retirements of  generating units; and address potential reliability challenges, including  how transmission upgrades and demand-response are considered and  pursued. These rules matter greatly in terms of whether potential  reliability challenges are managed as cost-effectively as possible. FERC  has not proactively evaluated whether RTO rules will be adequate to  ensure timely, cost-effective mitigation of potential reliability challenges  associated with multiple generating unit retirements and shutdowns,  which may occur over a short period in light of the EPA regulations.

FERC disagreed with the recommendation, stating that we did not take  into account a number of actions FERC has taken, including publicly  committing to work closely with industry, states, and other agencies to  address issues that arise. FERC cited several examples of the actions it  has taken, and we made some clarifying changes and, in one case,  added language about an example that we had not previously included in  the report. FERC also stated that it had taken further steps to implement  our recommendation after seeing our draft report. We agree that FERC  has taken positive steps, and we are encouraged that FERC has begun  to implement our recommendations. However, we do not believe these  actions adequately represent the type of formal, documented process  needed for EPA, DOE, and FERC to monitor industry's progress in  responding to the regulations. FERC also said that, as an independent  agency, it cannot dictate the sharing of information with and by other  parts of the government. We acknowledge there may be limits on the  extent to which the three agencies can collaborate and clarified our  recommendation accordingly.

In particular, FERC  noted that it asked participants at a 2011 technical conference to address  whether changes were needed in market rules and that the response  from panelists and commenters was that no significant changes were  needed. Our observation from attending this conference is that it fostered  a useful exchange of ideas and perspectives. However, we do not believe  it is a substitute for an assessment by FERC of the adequacy of rules.  FERC also noted that several recent rulemakings may lead to changes in  rules that may be beneficial in the context of the EPA regulations, such as  in how information is gathered regarding retirements and how demand  response is encouraged.

Some of these studies analyze several scenarios, and we report results  from those scenarios which we felt best reflect the regulations.

We classified  detailed air pollution controls into control types, and reviewed our  classifications with officials at Ventyx, the Department of Energy (DOE),  and EPA. Information regarding planned retrofits and retirements reflect  publicly reported plans as identified by Ventyx. As plans may change,  actual future retrofits and retirements may differ from the data in these  plans. To assess the reliability of the Ventyx data, we reviewed existing  documentation about the data and the system that produced them,  interviewed Ventyx staff who were knowledgeable about the data,  consulted with EPA and DOE officials and other knowledgeable parties,  conducted some electronic testing, and compared data in Ventyx to  information obtained from several power companies and regional  transmission organizations.

We reviewed relevant  laws, regulations, and agency documentation for information on agency  authorities, responsibilities with respect to the EPA regulations, and  options for mitigating adverse reliability concerns.

At coal power  plants, these controls are generally installed in either the boiler, where  coal is burned, or the ductwork that connects a boiler to the stack. A  single power plant can use multiple boilers to generate electricity, and the  emissions from multiple boilers can sometimes be connected to a single  stack. The reduction in emissions from a coal-fueled generating unit by  the use of pollution controls can be substantial, as shown in table 4.  Controls may be capable of removing multiple pollutants. For example, a  wet scrubber can control both sulfur dioxide (SOFigure 9 shows the capacity of coal-fueled generating units that were  retrofitted with select controls from 2000 through 2011, and figures 10  and 11 show the percent of generating capacity with select controls by  region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We recognize that FERC has taken a number of positive actions  related to the EPA regulations, and we have described these in our  draft and final report. We have made some clarifying changes and, in  one case, added language about an example we had not previously  described in the report in response to these comments.  2.  The scope of FERC's policy statement is limited to describing how  FERC intends to provide advice to EPA on requests for administrative  orders to bring a source into compliance with MATS within 1 year. It  provides a useful description of FERC's role with respect to this tool  for addressing potential reliability challenges, but it does not establish  a formal, documented process for FERC's overall monitoring effort or  for its coordination with EPA and DOE. We added a description of  FERC's policy statement where we describe FERC's role with respect  to MATS in response to this comment. 3.  We agree that multiagency coordination can be difficult. When we met  with FERC, EPA, and DOE during the course of our audit work, the  agencies had not documented a formal process for monitoring. In  response to our draft report, these agencies said they are working to  establish such an approach. We commend these agencies for taking  this step and believe it is important that they complete this effort. We  acknowledge there may be limits on the extent to which agencies can  collaborate and clarified our recommendation accordingly. 4.  We acknowledge that FERC has gathered views on the potential  implications of these regulations from various affected parties,  including at formal events such as FERC's 2011 technical conference  and the February 2012 forum with state regulators. Our observation  from attending these events is that they fostered a useful exchange of  ideas and perspectives about the potential implications of the EPA  regulations. However, the actual implications will only be known once  electricity generating unit owners finalize their plans for responding to  the regulations and begin to take steps to retrofit or retire units\u2014which  will occur over the next several years. We believe that additional  monitoring will be important and that the actions noted by FERC do  not represent the type of formal, documented process that will be  needed for successfully monitoring industry's progress in responding  to the regulations or for FERC\u2019s coordination with DOE and EPA in  this effort. We believe there are risks to relying on informal  mechanisms and that a formal, documented process could help  strengthen FERC's future efforts at identifying potential problems. As  such, we made no changes in response to this comment. 5.  We believe that the NERC-overseen reliability assessments, plans  and reports from other stakeholders, as well as conferences and  workshops, can all be useful in an overall monitoring effort. We  encourage FERC to work with NERC and other stakeholders in  monitoring industry progress to the extent that FERC determines such  activities to be useful. We maintain that FERC should formalize this  process and document it if the agency intends for this monitoring to  continue in the future. We made no change in response to this  comment. 6.  We acknowledge that FERC periodically performs various  assessments of the adequacy of existing RTO market rules and  similar rules of non-RTO system planners and, where FERC believes  it is appropriate, encourages changes. However, based on our  conversations with FERC officials, FERC had not proactively  assessed the adequacy of system planner rules in light of the EPA  regulations to determine whether changes are needed or if  improvements at one system planner could be useful at another. We  also acknowledge that there was a useful exchange of ideas and  perspectives about the need for potential changes in market rules at  FERC's technical conference, but we do not believe that the gathering  of these views is a substitute for an assessment by FERC of the  adequacy of these rules. In addition, FERC's recent rulemakings are  positive steps, but they do not reflect an assessment of whether rules  need to be modified in light of the EPA regulations to ensure timely,  cost-effective mitigation of potential reliability challenges that may be  associated with the regulations. We made no change in response to  this comment. 7.  Neither the draft report, nor the final report recommends that FERC  consider the presence or absence of demand response when making  key decisions about electricity markets. FERC\u2019s comment refers to  text in our draft report that referred to a recommendation in our 2004  report on demand response. We made this reference to highlight that  demand response is a tool that could lower demand for electricity to  mitigate the price or reliability implications of the EPA regulations and  to note that FERC has taken a number of steps to facilitate broader  use of demand response among RTOs. As noted in the conclusion of  this report, we believe that demand response could provide an  important mechanism that could mitigate potential reliability  challenges, should they arise. As such, it may be useful for FERC to  consider whether there are certain approaches related to demand  response at one or more RTOs that could be encouraged elsewhere  or whether the presence or adequacy of demand response in a  market should be used when making decisions regarding market  rules. We made no change in response to this comment.  8.  We do not suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach would be best,  and believe efforts to develop the RTOs and other institutions requires  leveraging prior entities' experiences. FERC may have the opportunity  to take a more proactive role in narrowing these differences to the  benefit of market participants overseen by FERC and the consumers  who are ultimately served by these markets. We made no change in  response to this comment. 9.  We do not assert that FERC will be unable to meet its statutory  deadlines for review of transmission investments and reliability must- run agreements. Rather, we suggest that information from a formal,  documented monitoring effort could help alert agencies in advance if a  larger or smaller than expected number of reliability challenges arises,  which could be useful for managing its staffing and operations. We  made no change in response to this comment. 10. We agree that FERC\u2019s policy statement provides clarity about the  process FERC intends to take to provide timely comments to EPA on  requests for administrative orders to bring a source into compliance  with MATS within 1 year. However, we continue to believe that a  documented, formal monitoring process\u2014by giving FERC insight into  the extent of potential reliability challenges\u2014could aid FERC in  managing its process for providing input to EPA.
