The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required GAO to report on the Electronic Prescribing Program. To do so, GAO examined how CMS determines which providers receive incentive payments and avoid penalties from that program and how many providers received incentive payments in 2009. Also, GAO was asked to examine how the requirements of the two programs compare. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, interviewed CMS officials, and analyzed CMS data on incentive payments made for 2009, which were the most recent data available for a full year."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS analyzes information reported by eligible providers on their Medicare Part B claims--which are used to submit charges for covered services--to determine which Medicare providers should receive Electronic Prescribing Program incentive payments or be subject to penalties. In 2009--the first year the program provided incentive payments--CMS paid approximately $148 million in incentive payments to about 8 percent of the approximately 600,000 Medicare providers who had an applicable patient visit--that is, supplied 1 of 33 CMS-designated services typically provided in the office or outpatient setting. For 2009, CMS examined Part B claims to determine whether, after each applicable patient visit, providers marked any one of three electronic prescribing reporting codes used to report information on the adoption and use of electronic prescribing systems. To receive an incentive payment that year, the provider had to report the codes for at least 50 percent of applicable patient visits, and at least 10 percent of the provider's total allowed Medicare Part B charges for the year had to be from the applicable patient visits. CMS made changes in the reporting requirements for 2010. For example, the agency reduced the number of reporting codes to one and required that individual providers report the code after at least 25 applicable visits, instead of for 50 percent of applicable visits. From 2012 through 2014, the Electronic Prescribing Program will assess penalties on providers that do not adopt and use electronic prescribing. Individual providers will have to submit the electronic prescribing reporting code at least 10 times in the first 6 months of 2011 to avoid penalties in 2012. Although GAO found similarities in the technology and reporting requirements for both programs, GAO also found that the requirements of the two programs are inconsistent in several areas. The EHR Program provides incentives from 2011 to 2016 and introduces penalties beginning in 2015, while the Electronic Prescribing Program provides incentives from 2009 to 2013 and provides for penalties from 2012 to 2014, when the program ends. Both the EHR and Electronic Prescribing Programs require providers to adopt and use technology that can perform similar electronic prescribing-related activities. However, the EHR Program requires providers to adopt and use certified EHR systems that meet criteria established by HHS, which include electronic prescribing-related capabilities, while the Electronic Prescribing Program does not have a certification requirement. As a result, providers have no assurance that the systems they invest in will meet the Electronic Prescribing Program's requirements. Additionally, the two programs have established separate reporting requirements related to electronic prescribing, potentially requiring physicians--the largest and only group of providers eligible to earn incentive payments in both programs--to report to both programs from 2011 through 2014. CMS recognizes that this duplication places additional burden on physicians; however, CMS is still in the process of developing a strategy to address this duplication."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the CMS Administrator take four actions, including (1) encourage physicians and other providers in the Electronic Prescribing Program to adopt certified technology and (2) expedite efforts to remove the overlap in reporting requirements for physicians who may be eligible for incentive payments or subject to penalties under both programs. CMS generally agreed with three recommendations and disagreed with a fourth recommendation, which GAO clarified based on CMS's comments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  widespread use of health information technology could improve the  quality of care received by patients and reduce health care costs.

Health  care providers can access electronic prescribing technological capabilities  by adopting stand-alone electronic prescribing systems or electronic  health record systems that include an electronic prescribing component.  Others have reported that stand-alone electronic prescribing systems can  cost up to $2,500 annually per provider, and EHR systems can cost  approximately $25,000 to $45,000 per provider with additional annual costs  to operate and maintain the system.", "Congress has established two programs, administered by the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), that aim to increase the use of  electronic prescribing in Medicare by providing incentive payments or  penalties for certain providers who participate in the Medicare Program.  The time frames for the two programs overlap, and each program has  established the following requirements that providers must meet in order  to receive incentive payments under Medicare and avoid program  penalties: (1) technological requirements that specify the types of health  care information technology providers must adopt; and (2) reporting  requirements that describe the information that providers report to CMS to  demonstrate that they have not only adopted, but also used, the requisite  health care information technology. For both of these programs,  physicians are the largest group of eligible providers that may earn  incentive payments or be subject to penalties.", "The first program, established by the Medicare Improvements for Patients  and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) and referred to here as the Electronic  Prescribing Program, provides incentive payments from 2009 through 2013  to certain Medicare providers\u2014physicians and other health care  providers, such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners\u2014who have  prescribing authority and who adopt and use systems that meet CMS\u2019s  definition of a qualified electronic prescribing system.

With incentive payments scheduled to end in 2013 and penalties  scheduled to end in 2014, the Electronic Prescribing Program will cease to  provide positive and negative incentives to encourage eligible providers to  electronically prescribe after 2014.", "The second incentive program was established by the Health Information  Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, as part of the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).  HITECH established a program, referred to here as the Electronic Health  Records (EHR) Program, that provides incentive payments from 2011  through 2016 to Medicare physicians that adopt and \u201cmeaningfully use\u201d  certified EHR technology, which includes electronic prescribing  technological capabilities. Beginning in 2015, the EHR Program may apply  a payment adjustment, or penalty, on eligible providers that do not adopt  and meaningfully use certified EHR technology.", "MIPPA requires us to report on the implementation of the incentives for  electronic prescribing established by MIPPA by September 1, 2012. In  addition, because of the overlapping time frames of the programs, we were  asked to obtain information on the relationship between the Electronic  Prescribing Program and the EHR Program. As agreed with committee  staff, our specific objectives for this report were to examine (1) how CMS  determines which providers should receive incentive payments and avoid  penalties from the Electronic Prescribing Program and how many  providers received such incentive payments in 2009, and (2) how the  requirements in the EHR Program and the Electronic Prescribing Program  compare to each other. MIPPA also directed us to report on information  related to reductions in avoidable medical errors and estimated savings to  Medicare resulting from the use of electronic prescribing. In response, we  provide information in appendix II on how others have measured whether  or to what extent electronic prescribing improves quality or reduces costs.", "To address both objectives, we reviewed relevant provisions in MIPPA and  the Recovery Act, and regulations and other published material pertaining  to the Electronic Prescribing and EHR Programs. We also interviewed  officials from CMS and from the Office of the National Coordinator for  Health Information Technology (ONC) in HHS. ONC reports to the  Secretary of HHS and plays a role in the EHR Program by establishing the  standards and specifications that providers\u2019 systems must meet for the  EHR Program, coordinating with CMS on the development of the  meaningful use criteria, and creating and administering the certification  program that authorizes organizations to certify EHR technology. To  report how many providers received payments in 2009, we analyzed CMS  data on (1) 2009 Electronic Prescribing Program participation as  determined by CMS and (2) providers\u2019 state locations. For more  information on our data analysis, see appendix III. To ensure the reliability  of the various data we analyzed, we interviewed CMS officials, reviewed  CMS documentation, and conducted electronic testing to identify obvious  errors. On the basis of these activities, we determined that CMS data were  sufficiently reliable for our analysis. To compare the EHR Program and the  Electronic Prescribing Program, we examined similarities and differences  in the two programs\u2019 technology and reporting requirements and identified  inconsistencies that may limit the effectiveness of the programs. Because  the EHR Program is broader than electronic prescribing, we focused our  comparison on the electronic prescribing\u2013related aspects of that  program\u2019s technology and reporting requirements. We also interviewed  knowledgeable stakeholders, including officials from HHS\u2019s Agency for  Healthcare Research and Quality and the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA).

Health care costs are typically paid for by health care  payers, such as CMS in the Medicare Program. In traditional, or paper- based, prescribing, health care providers that are licensed to issue  prescriptions for drugs (e.g., physicians or physician assistants in some  states) write a prescription, and the beneficiary takes that prescription to a  dispenser (e.g., pharmacy) to be filled. In contrast, electronic prescribing  consists of a licensed health care provider using a computer or hand-held  device to write and transmit a prescription directly to the dispenser.  Before doing so, the health care provider can request the beneficiary\u2019s  eligibility, formulary, benefits, and medication history. This information  can be used to improve quality and reduce costs. For example, a health  care provider can use this information to avoid potentially adverse drug  events such as drug-to-drug or drug-to-allergy interactions and to prescribe  less-expensive medications, such as lower-cost generic drugs. Figure 1  illustrates the flow of information during the electronic prescribing  process and identifies areas in this process that may result in  improvements in the quality of health care provided to beneficiaries and  reductions in costs to health care payers.

Incentive payments for the EHR Program begin in 2011 and  may be available until 2016, depending on which calendar year the  provider initially receives an incentive payment from the program.  Incentive payments for both programs are determined by multiplying the  provider\u2019s total allowed charges for provider services covered by Medicare  Part B for the year by the incentive percent authorized by statute.  However, in the EHR Program the year in which the provider first adopts  and meaningfully uses the EHR technology determines the maximum  annual incentive payment a provider can earn and the total number of  years incentive payments are available. For both programs, incentive  payments are disbursed after providers demonstrate that they met the  applicable program requirements. Figure 3 displays the timeline and  maximum incentive payments and penalties for both programs. (App. IV  provides additional detail on the annual and total incentive payments an  eligible provider could receive from the EHR Program based on the initial  year the provider receives an incentive payment.)

For 2009, the three electronic  prescribing reporting codes were:  the provider had a qualified electronic prescribing system and used it to  generate all prescriptions during the visit; the provider had a qualified electronic prescribing system but did not use  it to generate one or more prescriptions during the visit for one of the  following reasons: the patient requested a paper prescription, the  pharmacy could not receive an electronic transmission, or the prescription  was for a narcotic or other controlled substance and could therefore not  be electronically prescribed; and the provider had a qualified electronic prescribing system but did not  generate any prescriptions during the visit.", "By submitting any one of the three electronic prescribing reporting codes  to CMS, providers attested that they met the program\u2019s technology  requirement by adopting a qualified electronic prescribing system and are  eligible to earn incentive payments from the program.", "Second, CMS analyzed the 2009 Part B claims to determine which of the  providers who submitted the electronic prescribing reporting codes also  met or exceeded both components of the following reporting  requirement:  the provider submitted one of the three electronic prescribing reporting  codes at least 50 percent of the time that the provider had an applicable  visit; and   at least 10 percent of the provider\u2019s total allowed Medicare Part B charges  for the year were from the services designated as applicable patient visits.", "If the provider met or exceeded the reporting requirement, CMS gave the  provider an incentive payment for 2009, which the agency calculated as   2 percent of the provider\u2019s total allowed Medicare Part B charges for the  year and by applying a small adjustment factor.", "For 2010, to increase the adoption of electronic prescribing technology,  CMS made some changes to the Electronic Prescribing Program\u2019s  reporting requirement that providers had to meet in order to receive an  incentive payment. CMS eliminated the three electronic prescribing  reporting codes for 2009 and replaced them with a single code for  providers to submit to CMS. The new code indicates that after each  applicable visit the provider generated and transmitted at least one  prescription during the visit using a qualified electronic prescribing  system. The agency stated that it believed that this change would simplify  reporting. CMS also changed the first portion of the reporting requirement  related to how frequently providers must submit the new electronic  prescribing code in order to receive an incentive payment. Instead of  requiring that providers submit the electronic prescribing reporting code  at least 50 percent of the time that they had an applicable visit\u2014the  requirement in 2009\u2014CMS required that an individual provider submit the  new electronic prescribing reporting code for at least 25 visits. CMS noted  that the agency believes that meeting the 2010 reporting requirement is  achievable by a majority of eligible providers. If providers participated in  the Electronic Prescribing Program as a group practice containing 200 or  more providers\u2014a new option in 2010\u2014the practice had to submit the  electronic prescribing reporting code for at least 2,500 applicable visits  before all of the providers in the practice could receive incentive  payments. When it proposed the change to at least 25 and at least 2,500  visits for individual providers and group practices, respectively, CMS  noted that it assumed that once a provider has invested in an electronic  prescribing system, integrated the use of that system into the practice\u2019s  work flows, and used that system to some extent, the provider is likely to  continue to use the electronic prescribing system for most of the  prescriptions generated. The other component of the reporting  requirement remained unchanged from 2009: at least 10 percent of the  provider\u2019s or practice\u2019s total allowed Medicare Part B charges for the year  were from the services designated as applicable visits. Finally, as an  individual or as part of a group practice, providers could report the  electronic prescribing code on their Part B claims, as they did in 2009, or  they could do so using one of two alternative reporting mechanisms CMS  created.", "CMS has described how it will determine which providers should receive  incentive payments for 2011, but the agency has not yet indicated how it  will determine which providers should receive incentive payments for  2012 or 2013. CMS will determine which providers meet the program\u2019s  requirements and should receive an incentive payment in 2011 generally  using the same methods the agency used in 2010. However, one important  change CMS made for 2011\u2014one that is consistent with changes the  agency is making to PQRS\u2014is that CMS expanded the definition of group  practice to include practices containing 2 through 199 individuals and will  require those group practices to report the electronic prescribing code for  a minimum of between 75 and 1,875 applicable visits, depending on the  size of the group practice. The requirement for group practices of 200 or  more providers is unchanged; those practices must report the code for at  least 2,500 applicable visits.", "From 2012 through 2014, the Electronic Prescribing Program will assess  penalties on individual providers and group practices that do not adopt  and use electronic prescribing. To avoid these penalties in 2012, individual  providers and group practices will have to meet certain reporting  requirements. Individual providers will have to submit the electronic  prescribing reporting code on their Part B claims for at least 10 applicable  visits between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2011. However, CMS will  not penalize certain individuals in 2012 if they do not prescribe or do so  infrequently. In addition, both individual providers and groups that  practice in rural areas or areas with a limited number of pharmacies that  accept electronic transmissions will be exempt from penalties. The  reporting requirement for individuals and the exemption criteria are  consistent with the agency\u2019s statement that it does not want to penalize  providers with low prescribing volumes. Group practices will have to  submit the electronic prescribing reporting code on their Part B claims the  same number of times required to receive incentive payments in 2011, but  they must do so within the 6-month period from January 1, 2011, through  June 30, 2011. For example, group practices containing 200 or more  providers will have to submit the electronic prescribing reporting code at  least 2,500 times from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2011. CMS has  noted that it did not think that group practices would be disadvantaged by  having to meet the reporting requirement in a 6-month period to avoid the  penalty in 2012 rather than in a 12-month period to earn an incentive in  2011 because the agency requires group practices to submit the electronic  prescribing reporting code fewer times on average to earn an incentive  payment than it requires for individual providers to submit to earn an  incentive payment.", "CMS has not yet established all the requirements for providers to avoid  penalties in 2013 or 2014. However, for 2013, CMS has indicated that it  will not penalize individual providers or group practices that year if they  reported the electronic prescribing code the minimum number of times  required to qualify for incentive payments in 2011. Additionally, CMS  indicated that it may publish an alternative reporting requirement that  providers could meet to avoid penalties in 2013. A CMS official that we  interviewed told us that the agency could, for example, require individual  providers to submit the electronic prescribing reporting code at least 10  times between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2012, in order to avoid  penalties in 2013.", "CMS is exploring an alternative to using electronic prescribing code  submissions to determine which providers should receive incentive  payments or penalties. As a part of CMS\u2019s Medicare Part D, which provides  outpatient prescription drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, CMS has  required that Part D plan sponsors submit additional data on the claims  they send to Medicare for reimbursement. CMS officials believe that  Medicare Part D data could be used at some point instead of the electronic  prescribing reporting code to determine which providers should receive  incentive payments. However, CMS officials have concerns about the  reliability of data from Part D claims, and note that these concerns should  be resolved before the data can be used.

Further, the agency notes that certifying EHR  technology to these standards enhances the interoperability of health  information technology\u2014that is, the ability of different systems or  components to exchange information and to use the information that has  been exchanged. EHRs that conform to interoperability standards allow  health information to be created, managed, and consulted by authorized  health care providers across more than one health care organization, thus  providing patients and their caregivers the necessary information required  for optimal care.", "The EHR Program\u2019s certification process is designed to produce a list of  certified EHR systems and certified EHR modules, which ONC has made  available to the public on its Web site. Accordingly, this information  should allow providers to identify and adopt systems that meet the EHR  Program\u2019s technological requirements. A module is a component of an  EHR system that meets at least one of the certification criteria established  by ONC. Individual EHR modules can be certified and integrated with  other certified EHR modules to form a complete, certified EHR system. At  the time of our review, technologies certified for use in the EHR  Program\u2014that is, complete EHR systems or combinations of modules that  collectively can perform the capabilities that constitute a qualified  electronic prescribing system\u2014appeared to also meet the Electronic  Prescribing Program\u2019s technological requirements. Although according to  ONC officials, certified EHR technology is not required to provide  information on lower-cost alternatives\u2014which is a component of the  Electronic Prescribing Program\u2019s technology requirement\u2014CMS has  indicated that an electronic prescribing system that does not conform to  that component of the Electronic Prescribing Program\u2019s technology  requirement would still meet the definition of a qualified system in 2011  and until this function is more widely available in the marketplace.", "Although providers seeking incentive payments or trying to avoid penalties  from the Electronic Prescribing Program must adopt and use qualified  electronic prescribing systems, according to a CMS official the Electronic  Prescribing Program does not have a process like the EHR Program\u2019s to  identify and certify which electronic prescribing systems meet the   requirements of a qualified system. As a result, providers may not be  certain which systems meet the program\u2019s technological requirement.", "Reporting requirements. Both the EHR Program and Electronic  Prescribing Program require eligible providers to report certain  information about their electronic prescribing activities to CMS in order to  receive incentive payments, which began in 2009 for the Electronic  Prescribing Program and began in 2011 for the EHR Program. (See   fig. 9 for a summary of the two programs\u2019 electronic prescribing\u2013related  reporting requirements.) However, we also found that the electronic  prescribing\u2013related reporting requirements in the EHR Program are more  rigorous. Providers seeking incentive payments from the EHR Program  have at least five reporting requirements related to electronic  prescribing, while providers in the Electronic Prescribing Program h  Moreover, the EHR Program requires  only one reporting requirement. providers to report more-detailed information\u2014namely, information on  their use of various electronic prescribing\u2013related technological  capabilities\u2014a requirement that should increase their use of these capabilities. Additionally, while CMS has established reporting  ave  requirements providers must meet in order to avoid the penalties under  the Electronic Prescribing Program that begin in 2012, CMS has not yetidentified what providers must report in order to avoid penalties under the  EHR Program, but plans to do so in future rulemakings.", "We also found that the two programs\u2019 reporting requirements are not  consistent because they make certain Medicare providers subject to both  programs\u2019 reporting requirements during the same year. Specifically,  physicians\u2014the largest population among each program\u2019s eligible  providers\u2014may choose to participate in the EHR Program in 2011 because  the potential incentive payment will likely be higher under that program  than under the Electronic Prescribing Program in 2011. However, to  avoid the penalty assessed by the Electronic Prescribing Program in 2012,  CMS will require physicians to meet the Electronic Prescribing Program\u2019s  reporting requirement in 2011, even if they elect to participate in the EHR  Program in 2011. Public comments on the agency\u2019s proposed  requirements for the 2011 Electronic Prescribing Program included the  concern that providers are burdened by having to submit electronic  prescribing data more than once. In response, CMS stated that it will study  possible methods of aligning the two programs and will include this  information in the integration plan it is already required to develop by  January 1, 2012, to integrate the reporting requirements in the EHR  Program and PQRS, CMS\u2019s quality measures program. However, if CMS  adheres to this schedule, the agency will not be able to remove the  reporting burden placed on physicians subject to penalties from the  Electronic Prescribing Program in 2013, given that the requirements for  avoiding penalties in 2013 would likely be proposed in July 2011 and  finalized in November 2011. If CMS includes possible methods of aligning  the two programs in the integration plan, any action to propose and  finalize requirements will take place sometime after January 1, 2012, well  beyond the date for making changes to the program in 2013. In technical  comments provided on a draft of this report, HHS noted that it plans to  include possible methods of aligning the two programs for the 2012  program year (and possibly for the 2013 program year) in rulemaking  during 2011.", "Both the EHR Program and Electronic Prescribing Program require  providers seeking incentive payments to attest that they have met the  programs\u2019 reporting requirements. In the EHR Program, providers will  submit the results of their performance on each of the reporting  requirements once per program year, while providers in the Electronic  Prescribing Program attest that they adopted and used a qualified  electronic prescribing system by reporting the electronic prescribing code  to CMS. At least with reference to the EHR Program, CMS has  acknowledged that attestation may create a potential for fraud and abuse  and noted that the agency is developing an audit strategy to address this  risk. CMS officials from the Office of E-Health Standards and Services  told us they plan to make guidance on this strategy available by May 2011.", "In the case of the Electronic Prescribing Program, an official from CMS\u2019s  Office of Clinical Standards and Quality, which administers that program,  told us that the agency did not audit electronic prescribing codes  submitted by providers for 2009 and does not have plans to develop an  audit strategy for the program. However, this official did tell us that CMS  reserves the right to audit any program participant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Health information technology, such as electronic prescribing, has the  potential to improve the quality of care received by patients and also  reduce costs for the health care system. To help encourage the adoption of  such technologies among Medicare providers, Congress first established  the Electronic Prescribing Program and then the EHR Program, both of  which provide incentive payments to eligible providers that adopt and use  the appropriate health information technologies and impose penalties on  those eligible providers that fail to do so.", "Despite both programs having a goal to expand the adoption and use of  health information technologies by health providers, and in particular,  physicians\u2014the largest and only group of providers eligible to earn  incentive payments in both programs\u2014we found inconsistencies in the  requirements. We believe these inconsistencies may limit the programs\u2019  effectiveness in encouraging the use of health information technologies.  First, we found that because the Electronic Prescribing Program lacks a  certification process like that established for the EHR Program, physicians  and other health care providers who want to obtain incentive payments or  avoid penalties from the former program have no assurance that the  systems they invest in will meet that program\u2019s technology requirements.  In contrast, physicians who invest in certified EHR systems can be assured  that in doing so they would meet the current requirements of both  programs. In addition, physicians that invest in certified EHR modules  integrated together to perform the electronic prescribing\u2013related  capabilities could also be assured that they meet the current requirements  of the Electronic Prescribing Program and that the adopted technology  could later be integrated with other certified modules to form a complete,  certified EHR system. This inconsistency between the programs has the  potential to create uncertainty among physicians as to what technology  they should adopt, because although the Electronic Prescribing Program  ends after 2014, the EHR Program continues; encouraging physicians to  adopt certified electronic prescribing technology now may also help  facilitate their later transition between the programs. Nonphysician health  care providers who are not eligible to earn incentive payments from the  EHR Program could adopt certified technology and in so doing could have  assurance that the electronic prescribing technology they invest in meets  the Electronic Prescribing Program\u2019s technology requirements. Second,  we also found that the two programs have established separate reporting  requirements related to electronic prescribing, requiring some physicians  who elect to report to the EHR Program to report to both programs in  2011 and potentially requiring physicians to report to both programs  through 2014, when penalties for the Electronic Prescribing Program end.  CMS recognizes that this duplication places additional burden on  physicians, and we believe this duplication could affect the decision of  physicians to adopt and use health information technology. However, CMS  is still in the process of studying possible ways to address this duplication,  and if the agency wants to eliminate the burden for providers in 2012, it  would need to do so during its 2011 rulemaking. In addition, CMS has not  been consistent in the steps it has taken to ensure the appropriate use of  these programs\u2019 resources. Namely, CMS plans to establish an audit  program for the EHR Program\u2014under which the maximum incentive  payment for a provider will generally not exceed $18,000 per year\u2014to  address potential fraud and abuse that might arise from the use of self- attestations, but CMS does not have plans to develop a similar approach in  the Electronic Prescribing Program, under which CMS paid providers up  to approximately $67,500 for 2009.", "The Electronic Prescribing Program began before the EHR Program, so  CMS has already had the opportunity to encounter and learn from  challenges in implementation. For example, in the first year of the  Electronic Prescribing Program, only about 8 percent of providers  received incentive payments, and CMS changed some of the program\u2019s  requirements in the second year to encourage greater adoption and use of  electronic prescribing technology. For the EHR Program, it is too soon to  know how many providers will adopt EHR systems. However, given that  the electronic prescribing\u2013related reporting requirements in the EHR  Program are more rigorous than the reporting requirement in the  Electronic Prescribing Program, CMS may find that it needs to modify the  EHR Program requirements to better encourage the adoption and use of  EHR systems. Because implementation of the Electronic Prescribing  Program preceded the EHR Program, CMS has an opportunity to use the  experiences gained in implementing the Electronic Prescribing Program to  inform its implementation of the EHR Program in order to determine how  to best encourage the adoption and use of health information technology  among Medicare providers. One approach could be to incorporate these  experiences into the integration plan the agency is already required to  develop by January 1, 2012, to integrate the reporting requirements in the  EHR Program and PQRS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve the effectiveness of the Electronic Prescribing and EHR  Programs to encourage the adoption of health information technologies  among Medicare providers, the Administrator of CMS should take the  following three actions:    Encourage physicians and other health care providers in the Electronic  Prescribing Program to adopt certified electronic prescribing technology.", "Expedite efforts to remove the overlap in reporting requirements for  physicians who may be eligible for incentive payments or subject to  penalties under both the Electronic Prescribing and EHR Programs by, for  example, aligning the reporting requirements so that successfully  qualifying for incentive payments or for avoiding penalties under the EHR  Program would likewise result in meeting the requirements for the  Electronic Prescribing Program.", "Identify factors that helped or hindered implementation of the Electronic  Prescribing Program to help support the ongoing implementation of the  EHR Program.

A risk- based strategy could, for example, focus on those providers who received  larger incentive payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and External Party Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained written comments on our draft report from HHS on behalf of  CMS, which are reprinted in appendix VI. CMS agreed in full with two  recommendations, agreed in principle with one recommendation, and  disagreed with a fourth recommendation.", "CMS disagreed with our first recommendation that the agency direct  providers in the Electronic Prescribing Program to use technology  certified as an EHR system or module(s). While CMS said that it concurred  with the notion that eligible providers should be able to use certified EHR  systems for the Electronic Prescribing Program, it did not agree that it  should direct eligible providers to use prescribing technology that has  been certified as an EHR system. CMS said that doing so could result in  Electronic Prescribing Program participants having to replace their  qualified electronic prescribing systems with systems certified under the  EHR Program. We do not recommend that CMS direct those providers  who are already participating in the Electronic Prescribing Program to  replace their current systems with certified systems. On the contrary, the  intent of our recommendation is to have CMS encourage providers in the  Electronic Prescribing Program who have not yet adopted electronic  prescribing systems, or who plan on upgrading their existing systems, to  choose systems that have already been certified through the EHR  Program\u2019s certification process. We continue to assert our  recommendation because, as we noted in our draft report, this  certification process identifies a list of available systems that meet the  certification requirements and provides assurance that the technology  physicians and other health care providers adopt would meet the  technology requirements of the Electronic Prescribing Program.  Additionally, the physicians who later participate in the EHR Program  could be assured that the technology also meets the requirements in the  EHR Program. In our draft report, we noted that there is no comparable  process in the Electronic Prescribing Program, and as a result, providers  have no assurance that the systems they invest in for the EHR Program  will meet that program\u2019s technology requirements. Given that the  Electronic Prescribing Program ends after 2014 while the EHR Program  will continue, encouraging providers to adopt certified electronic  prescribing technology now may also help facilitate physicians\u2019 transition  between the programs. We have clarified the recommendation to state that  CMS should encourage physicians and other health care providers in the  Electronic Prescribing Program to adopt certified electronic prescribing  technology.", "CMS agreed with our second recommendation that it expedite efforts to  remove the overlap in reporting requirements for physicians eligible for  both programs, and noted that it plans to address this overlap in  rulemaking during 2011, where applicable. We support CMS\u2019s efforts to  expeditiously remove the overlap in the reporting requirements as we  recommended.", "CMS agreed with our third recommendation that it would be helpful for  the agency to identify factors that helped or hindered implementation of  the Electronic Prescribing Program to help support the ongoing  implementation of the EHR Program. While CMS identified factors that  may be affecting implementation of electronic prescribing, other factors  that may have broader applicability to the implementation of the EHR  Program could include the effect of penalties on technology adoption,  measuring compliance with program requirements, and validating self- reported attestations.", "CMS agreed in principle with our fourth recommendation that CMS  develop a risk-based strategy to audit a sample of providers who received  incentive payments from the Electronic Prescribing Program. In response  CMS said that it agrees that an audit of a sample of providers may be  needed, however, it disagreed that such a strategy should necessarily  focus on eligible providers who received large incentive payments, noting  that such an audit process, if implemented, could select providers at  random. As we recommended, we believe that an audit strategy should be  implemented for this program. We recommended a risk-based audit  strategy because although many providers received modest incentive  payments in 2009, some providers received payments at least three times  as high as the maximum annual incentive payment in the EHR Program.  However, if implemented by CMS, a random audit would be consistent  with the intent of our recommendation. CMS also noted that because it is  considering using Part D data in the future to determine which providers  should receive incentive payments for this program, use of these data  could also alleviate the need for an audit. However, as we noted in our  draft report, CMS officials raised several concerns\u2014concerns echoed in its  comments on our draft report\u2014about the reliability of Part D data to  determine which providers receive incentive payments. As we reported,  CMS officials told us that these data reliability concerns should be  resolved before Part D data can be used to determine which providers  should receive incentive payments for this program.", "HHS has also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.
