For example, two market participants said the net worth criterion, more so than income, likely indicates the investors' ability to accumulate wealth and their investment knowledge. Others noted that some parts of the market might not accept adjustments to the thresholds. For example, an association of angel investors--accredited investors who invest in start-up companies--told GAO that they would be resistant to increased thresholds because it would decrease the number of eligible investors. GAO analysis of federal data on household net worth showed that adjusting the $1 million minimum threshold to approximately $2.3 million, to account for inflation, would decrease the number of households qualifying as accredited from approximately 8.5 million to 3.7 million.", "While citing net worth as the most important criterion, several market participants GAO interviewed said that alternative criteria related to an investor's liquid investments and their use of an investment adviser also could balance investor protection and capital formation. GAO obtained views on eight alternative criteria that focus on investors' financial resources and their understanding of financial risk--criteria that SEC or industry groups previously proposed or that foreign regulators use. Among the financial resources criteria, market participants with whom GAO spoke most often identified a liquid investments requirement--a minimum dollar amount of investments in assets that can be easily sold, are marketable, and the value of which can be verified--as the most important for balancing investor protection and capital formation. Among the understanding financial risk criteria, market participants most often identified the use of a registered investment adviser. Beginning in 2014, SEC must review the accredited investor definition every 4 years to determine whether it should be adjusted. This study provides a reasonable starting point for SEC's review. Specifically, SEC will have the views of market participants about how existing and alternative qualifying criteria could help determine an investor's ability to bear and understand risks associated with unregistered securities offerings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["SEC should consider alternative criteria for the accredited investor standard.

Small businesses (like start- up companies) that exceed these resources, or have additional capital  needs, may seek to sell shares of ownership or securities convertible into  shares of ownership in the business to raise needed cash to be used in  operations. Businesses and public companies can seek capital through  public offerings or nonpublic offerings (private placements).", "The Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) requires companies that are  publicly offering securities for investment to register the offering of the  securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and  provide investors with all material information necessary to make an  investment decision. The Securities Act contains exemptions from  registration and authorizes SEC to provide, by rule, additional  exemptions.", "In particular, Rule 506 under SEC Regulation D exempts offerings from  registration if the issuer conducts a limited offering and restricts sales to  accredited investors and up to 35 nonaccredited investors. Within  Regulation D, SEC sought to facilitate capital formation while protecting  investors\u2014consistent with its mission to protect investors; maintain fair,  orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital. While Regulation D  originated as an effort to assist small businesses with capital formation,  various types of companies rely on registration exemptions in Regulation  D. According to SEC staff, in 2011, the estimated amount of capital raised  in these types of exempt offerings was just over $1 trillion, which is  comparable to the amount of capital raised in registered offerings in that  year. Further, pooled investment vehicles (hedge fund, private equity,  venture capital, and other investment funds) are among the top issuers  under Regulation D, accounting for 29 percent of such offerings in 2011.", "Under Regulation D, SEC defines individual accredited investors as  meeting certain income and net worth thresholds. Based on information  we reviewed, this type of investor is generally a securities purchaser who  possesses knowledge and experience in finance and business matters to  evaluate the risks and merits of prospective investments or one who the  issuer reasonably believes meets this description. On the basis of the  legislative history of the accredited standard, SEC\u2019s mission statement,  and academic literature, we determined that the intended purposes of the  accredited investor standard are to protect investors (by allowing only  those who can withstand financial losses to have access to private  placements) and streamline capital formation for small businesses. SEC\u2019s  thresholds for individual accredited investors were established in the  1980s. The thresholds for income and net worth were intended as a  buffer to protect the investor from potential economic loss of investing in  private placements.

To address these objectives, we reviewed  SEC\u2019s current definition of and legislative history for the accredited  investor standard. We also reviewed SEC\u2019s proposed changes to the  accredited investor standard since 2006, market participants\u2019 comment  letters to SEC on these proposals, academic literature related to  accredited investors and unregistered securities offerings, and applicable  criteria used by foreign regulators. To estimate the impact of changing the  minimum net worth and income thresholds on eligible households, we  analyzed data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) issued by  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal  Reserve). We found the Federal Reserve data to be sufficiently reliable to  evaluate household income and net worth levels. We interviewed staff  from SEC and other federal financial regulators, lawyers knowledgeable  about accredited investor issues, and trade associations to discuss  current and alternative criteria for accredited investor status.

Regulation D is designed to (1)  eliminate any unnecessary restrictions SEC rules place on small business  issuers, and (2) achieve uniformity between state and federal exemptions  to facilitate capital formation consistent with investor protection.", "The accredited investor standard, which is used to adjust exemptive  conditions under Regulation D, has undergone several changes since its  adoption in 1982. As shown in figure 2, the qualifications for investment in  private placements securities went through several interpretations and  changes. For example, in 1953 the Supreme Court ruled that the  applicability of registration exemptions depended on whether the  purchasers of securities could \u201cfend for themselves.\u201d In 1974, SEC  adopted Rule 146, a predecessor to Rule 506, which stated that investors  were financially sophisticated enough to be offered or purchase private  placement securities based on their knowledge and experience, capability  of evaluating the risk and merits, and ability to bear the economic risk of  investment. In 1982, Regulation D\u2014the goals of which included  facilitating capital formation and promoting investor protection\u2014replaced  previous rules, including Rule 146. The income and net worth thresholds  established in Regulation D were intended to serve as proxies for  financial experience, sophistication, and adequate bargaining power.  Since 1982, SEC twice revised the individual accredited investor  standard: it added the $300,000 threshold for joint income in 1988, and  excluded the value of primary residence as part of the net worth  calculation in 2011 as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.", "In recent years, market participants and a regulator have proposed  several changes to the accredited investor standard for individuals. The  proposals were generally based on concerns for investor protection and  capital formation, and consist of adjustments to income and net worth and  alternative ways of measuring investor knowledge. For instance, two  consumer advocacy groups, an investment company association, SEC,  and North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) have  expressed concerns that the number of those eligible to be accredited  investors has grown significantly since the thresholds were established.  According to SEC, when the standard was first created, 1.87 percent of  households qualified as accredited investors. SEC staff estimate that 9.04  percent of households would have qualified as accredited investors under  the net worth standard in 2007; we estimate that removing the primary  residence from households\u2019 net worth, as required in the Dodd-Frank Act,  dropped the percentage to 7.2 percent (based on 2010 data). SEC and  NASAA say that because private placement offerings are generally  illiquid, complex, and not reviewed by state or federal regulators, the risks  of investing in private placement offerings are high and a higher level of  protection may be necessary to protect accredited investors. In contrast,  the angel investor community has expressed concerns about how any  proposed changes could affect capital formation for start-up companies.", "Noting concerns about investor protection, SEC proposed several  changes to Regulation D during the 2000s. In December 2006, SEC  proposed a new standard for individuals with the goal of providing  additional protection to accredited investors investing in certain pooled  investment funds, including hedge funds. An investor would have to meet  either the existing income or net worth criteria and also own at least $2.5  million in investments at the time of the purchase of the securities. SEC  stated that with this proposal, it sought to ascertain that an individual  likely would have sufficient knowledge and experience to evaluate the  merit and risk of certain private placement investments or be able to hire  someone able to do so. In their comment letters on this proposal, some  market participants suggested that SEC adjust the income and net worth  standards for inflation, while others suggested these standards be  lowered or eliminated. Some commentators suggested that SEC use a  percentage of the net worth standard for certain investments. Others  agreed with the proposal but made suggestions such as decreasing the  required investments owned. This proposal was never finalized because,  according to SEC officials, it received competing demands and mixed  comments during the comment period.", "In July 2007, SEC proposed other changes to align its rules with modern  market practices and communications technologies without compromising  investor protection. First, SEC proposed to create a new exemption for  offers and sales for a new category of investors to be designated as  \u201clarge accredited investors.\u201d Under this standard, individuals would have  to own $2.5 million in investments or have an annual income of $400,000  (or $600,000 for married couples). Second, SEC proposed an alternative  criterion for the accredited investor standard (to include $750,000 of  investments owned) and adjusting the dollar-amount thresholds for  investments owned, income, and net worth to reflect future inflation.  According to SEC, it did not finalize its proposals due to, as stated before,  competing demands and the mixed comments it received during the  comment period.", "There are pending changes to Regulation D as a result of the passage of  the Dodd-Frank Act and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS  Act).", "First, Section 926 of the Dodd-Frank Act directs SEC to adopt a rule  that would make the Rule 506 exemption unavailable to securities  offerings in which \u201cfelons or other bad actors\u201d were involved. SEC  proposed a rule in 2011 defining bad actors and prohibiting them from  using the Rule 506 exemptions if they have been convicted of, or are  subject to court or administrative sanctions for securities fraud or  other violations of specific laws. The SEC commission adopted the  final rule in July 2013 which prohibits bad actors, which include the  issuer, certain issuer, officers, significant owners, general partners or  managing members of the issuer, whose actions occurred after the  rule\u2019s effective date from using Rule 506. Actions which occurred  before the effective date must be disclosed but do not act as a  prohibition against using Rule 506.", "Second, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires SEC to review the  \u201caccredited investor\u201d definition in its entirety beginning in 2014 and  every 4 years thereafter and to conduct rulemaking as SEC deems  appropriate after each review.

In August 2012, SEC  proposed a rule permitting companies to advertise and market such  securities offerings provided that the issuer takes reasonable steps to  verify the purchaser\u2019s accredited investor status. Currently, Rule 506  does not specifically require that the issuer verify that accredited  investors meet the requirements. The comment period to the  proposed rule closed in October 2012.

However, one market participant said  that it was more probable that an investor\u2019s income could decline  compared with net worth, and net worth tended to be a better indicator  than income of an investor\u2019s knowledge of the markets. For example, a  wealthy professional would not necessarily have a guarantee that his or  her income would remain the same or have the investment experience or  financial wherewithal, depending on his or her profession, to invest in  private placements.

To better protect  investors, some participants thought the levels should be increased to  adjust for inflation\u2014thus focusing on the original subset of the population  that was targeted when the standards were first implemented. For  example, officials from one industry group said that SEC designated the  existing thresholds to identify a subset of the population that does not  need SEC\u2019s regulatory investor protection and therefore the thresholds  should be readjusted periodically to ensure that the thresholds only  capture the intended population. Others suggested the thresholds are  very outdated and should be raised even higher than inflation.", "However, almost an equal number of market participants (11 of 27) said  the current thresholds should not be adjusted. For example, a number of  participants commented that the net worth threshold already had been  significantly adjusted because the primary residence is no longer  considered as part of the net worth calculation. In addition, officials from  an investor association said that regulators should take into account  regional differences when considering changes to the thresholds as they  represent a significant dollar amount in certain states with lower average  income levels. Thus, adjusting the existing criteria could negatively affect  some regions more than others. For example, in a rural state increased  thresholds could negatively affect investors\u2019 ability to qualify under the  standard and make it harder for local start-up companies to seek  investors and capital inside the state, according to an investor  association.", "Market participants had differing views on the impact of increasing the  thresholds on investor protection (see fig. 3).

An investor association and an academic  acknowledged the importance of establishing thresholds to protect  investors who may not have the knowledge or ability to protect  themselves against making risky investments. Regardless of the  thresholds, a representative from an investor association said that its  investors completed due diligence on potential investments to protect  their financial portfolio. Furthermore, industry associations representing  attorneys and financial advisers involved in private placement generally  agreed that the current qualification criteria were adequate.

A representative of a venture capital association told us that  removing the primary residence from the net worth calculation was a  significant adjustment to the current standard and that any further  changes would further limit the pool of accredited investors, discourage  angel investing, and ultimately hinder the ability of start-up companies to  access capital. For instance, a representative of a network of angel  investors said that he knew other accredited investors in the network who  no longer qualified because of the 2011 change in the net worth  calculation. However, according to an official from the North America  Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) and a former regulator,  start-up companies have other avenues to access capital such as new or  expanded capital formation programs in the JOBS Act.

If  maintaining such a list were possible, the costs of doing so would likely  outweigh the benefits. Therefore, determining the potential impact of  changes to the existing thresholds on the pool of accredited investors is  difficult. To estimate such impacts, we analyzed Survey of Consumer  Finances data, the data that SEC also uses for these purposes. These  data show that changing the thresholds for net worth and income would  affect the pool of eligible accredited investors.

One  market participant noted that increasing the thresholds could be a  problem for some existing investors if they no longer qualified under the  new thresholds, and consideration would have to be given to their existing  investments.", "In our other interviews, market participants said that the current  thresholds provide certainty and said while it is feasible to adjust them  because they have not been adjusted, it would increase costs and  therefore not be well received by all market participants. For example,  one industry expert and two representatives from investor associations  said that the current criteria have the advantage of providing certainty for  the industry, which encourages investments in start-up companies.

For example, one representative from an industry  association told us that an individual\u2019s investment portfolio would  better approximate financial resources than net worth or income and  another representative from an industry association said it would help  to minimize risk posed to investors.", "However, in general, market participants thought that replacing the  existing criteria would not be feasible (18 of 27) and not likely be  accepted by the market (19 of 27). Two market participants  commented that it would be difficult to implement and it might be  burdensome to update and monitor the percentage figure.  Furthermore, one market participant said that if an investor is only  able to invest a small amount due to the fixed-percentage limit  entrepreneurs might not find that small amount helpful.", "Market participants also offered a range of views on alternative criteria  related to an investor\u2019s understanding of financial risk. Figure 7  summarizes participants\u2019 views on these alternatives.", "Registered investment adviser requirement. Of the six alternative  criteria related to an investor\u2019s understanding of financial risk,  participants most often said that the registered investment adviser  criterion should be added to the existing criteria. That is, the criterion  would require an investor who wishes to invest in a private placement  offer to use the services of a registered investment adviser to manage  their investment accounts. A majority of market participants (14 of 27)  thought that adding a registered investment adviser criterion to the  current standard would strengthen investor protection but were  divided about its effects on capital formation (see fig. 7). Some  market participants and an industry association we interviewed noted  that advisers examined the financial needs of their clients. As a result,  they determined this requirement would promote investor protection.", "In addition, most market participants (21 of 27) said that having a  registered investment adviser criterion would be feasible to implement  and that the market would be willing to accept it. For example, two  market participants told us that this criterion could be feasible to  implement because advisers were already vetted (registered and  subject to regulation). Another market participant said that having an  adviser would be a practical and objective way to approximate  understanding of financial risk. However, one market participant said  that this standard represents a new cost to investors because they  would have to pay for the services of a registered adviser. In addition,  representatives from an investment adviser firm and an angel investor  group said that investment advisers might not recommend private  placements because of their asset management role and  compensation structure. That is, investment advisers buy and sell  assets on behalf of their clients and generally base their fees on the  assets managed. Because investments in private placements would  be illiquid, investment advisers would not be able to manage the asset  to generate greater return. As a result, the compensation structure for  investment advisers would not readily accommodate private  placements.", "Self-certification investor designation. While market participants  were divided on the impact of adding a self-certification criterion on  investor protection, they generally agreed on the impact on capital  formation. Through a self-certification process the investor would  self-certify based on standards, such as membership in a network of  investment groups, work experience (director of a company), or  investment experience. Ten market participants told us a self- certification process would weaken investor protection; 11 said it  would have no effect. However, the majority (17 of 27) said it would  promote capital formation. One market participant expressed  concerns that individuals could self-certify to become an investor  without actually meeting the qualification criteria. Another said that  self-certification based on being in an investment group or being a  director would not approximate understanding of financial risk.  Another market participant commented that having a self-certification  option would emphasize to potential investors that they should not  take investments in private placements lightly.", "Market participants had favorable views about the feasibility and likely  market acceptance related to a self-certification criterion. A majority of  market participants said that self-certification was feasible (19 of 27)  and that the market would be willing to accept it (23 of 27). One  market participants said that self-certification was similar to the  current process in which investors self-certify that they meet either  income or net worth thresholds. Moreover, representatives from an  investment company association said that investment and work  experience would demonstrate an individual\u2019s ability to analyze  investments. However, a representative from NASAA cautioned that  the standards for qualifying work experience would have to be  specific.", "License and certification standard. Market participants had  conflicting views about the effect of adding a new licenses and  certification requirement to the existing criteria. Under such a criterion,  an investor would have to demonstrate knowledge of financial risks  related to private placement investments to receive a license from  regulators or authorized third parties. About the same number of  market participants said that adding such a requirement would  strengthen, weaken, or have no effect on investor protection (10, 8,  and 9, respectively). Furthermore, 12 of 27 participants said it would  promote capital formation and 10 of 27 said that it would have no  effect. Five participants said the requirement would limit capital  formation. A market participant said that having a license and  certification requirement would encourage unscrupulous companies to  develop and issue certification without appropriately making  assessments. Another market participant told us that having a license  might not mean that these investors could absorb the loss.", "Many market participants (15 of 27) did not think it would be feasible  to add a license and certification requirement. Three market  participants and two representatives from associations raised a  number of issues including that some investors might be unwilling to  take the steps to be licensed. Nevertheless, 16 of 27 market  participants thought the market would accept it.", "Investor sophistication test. Many market participants told us that  adding the sophistication test criterion to the existing criteria would not  likely be accepted by the market. With this criterion, an investor would  complete SEC-approved investor education classes and pass a test  that would qualify them as accredited. About the same number of  market participants said that adding an investor sophistication test  would either strengthen or have no effect on investor protection.  Furthermore, 11 of 27 participants said that there would be no effect  on capital formation; the remaining were split on whether the test  would promote or limit it.", "While many participants (16 of 27) thought that the market would  accept the addition of a test, market participants were split on whether  a test would be feasible. Representatives from two industry  associations suggested that investors could take the investments  segment of the examination for stockbrokers. However, two market  participants raised questions about whether investors would be willing  to take the test or spend time to prepare for it and take a test to  become a certified sophisticated investor. Furthermore,  representatives from another association said the test could quickly  become overly complex given the variety of investments available and  the frequency of changes in investment products. Also,  representatives from associations questioned who would administer  the test and where the resources to administer the test would come  from.", "Education standard. Under this criterion, an investor would qualify  as accredited based on an advanced degree in business or finance,  or a chartered financial analyst credential or similar designation. While  14 of 27 market participants told us that an education criterion would  have no effect on investor protection, 11 of the participants said  education would promote capital formation. For example, one  market participant said that the education criterion would allow  younger people who might not have financial resources but  understood financial risks to invest in private placement offerings.  However, two market participants said that having an advanced  degree, such as in business, would not necessarily give an investor  the necessary knowledge to invest wisely. A majority of market  participants said that an education criterion would be feasible (23 of  27) and that the market would be willing to accept it (18 of 27).  Representatives from one industry association we interviewed said  verifying education would be a simple process. However, one market  participant said that market acceptance would depend on the  documentation that would be required of the investor.", "Opt-in provision. Market participants\u2019 views were divided about the  inclusion of an opt-in provision. With an opt-in provision, the investor  would sign a statement that waives significant rights to file a complaint  to seek compensation unless there is fraud on the part of the issuer. A  majority (17 of 27) of market participants said that the provision would  decrease investor protection. One market participant commented  that the provision would decrease investor protection because it would  take away the burden of proof from an issuer in relation to fraud. An  equal number of participants said that it would promote or have no  effect on capital formation. Market participants had more favorable  views about the feasibility and likely market acceptance of a new opt- in criterion. A majority of market participants said that it would be  feasible (17 of 27) and that the market would be willing to accept it (21  of 27). For example, one market participant said that an opt-in form  would be easy to implement. However, two market participants noted  that state securities regulators would object strongly to the addition of  this criterion because it decreased protection for investors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The intended purposes of the accredited investor standard are to protect  investors and streamline capital formation for small businesses. However,  beyond excluding an investor\u2019s primary residence in the calculation of net  worth in 2010, the standards for qualifying as an individual accredited  investor have remained unchanged since the 1980s. As a result, some  market participants and policymakers have raised concerns about  diminished investor protection as the numbers of individuals able to  qualify as accredited has increased over the years. Of the existing criteria  for qualifying as an accredited investor, most market participants with  whom we spoke said that net worth was the most important criterion for  balancing investor protection and capital formation. However, these  participants also identified alternative criteria that could also achieve  these goals. Specifically, market participants we spoke with most often  supported adding an investment requirement or use of an investment  adviser as an alternative criterion that would balance investor protection  and capital formation, be relatively feasible to implement, and have some  level of acceptance by the market. SEC must review the definition of  accredited investor every 4 years beginning in 2014. Our report on market  participants\u2019 views on the existing and alternative qualification criteria for  accredited investor status will be published in July 2013. By examining  the potential effects of the existing and alternative criteria when it  conducts its review in 2014, SEC could help ensure that it is using the  most appropriate ones for qualifying investors as accredited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To further advance the goals of balancing investor protection and capital  formation in its accredited investor standard, SEC should consider  alternative criteria, including those in this report, to help determine an  individual\u2019s ability to bear and understand the risks associated with  investing in private placements.

We reviewed SEC\u2019s proposed changes to the accredited  investor standard since 2006, market participants\u2019 comment letters to  SEC regarding these proposals, and academic literature related to  accredited investors and private placements. We interviewed and asked  officials from the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA),  and North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) for  their views about the current and proposed accredited investor standards.  We asked SEC, FINRA, NASAA, the Department of Treasury, Commodity  Futures Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  about any financial literacy efforts directed at individuals who qualify as  accredited investors and they told us that they were not aware of any  relevant financial literacy efforts that we could consider. We interviewed  officials from the Ontario (Canada) Securities Commission and United  Kingdom Financial Services Authority to obtain information about their  investor standards, especially those similar to the U.S. accredited investor  standard. We conducted interviews with academics; lawyers  knowledgeable about accredited investor issues; other securities market  and investment experts; trade associations representing investors, capital  formation groups, small businesses, and private equity groups. These  associations included the Securities Industry and Financial Markets  Association, Angel Capital Association (ACA), National Venture Capital  Association (NVCA), American Association of Individual Investors (AAII),  Investment Adviser Association (IAA), National Small Business  Association, SecondMarket, and the Investment Company Institute.", "To examine market participants\u2019 views on the existing criteria for  accredited investor status, and the potential effects of changes to the  standard on investor protection and capital formation, we conducted  structured interviews by telephone with a judgmental sample of 27 market  participants whom we categorized in four groups intended to represent  different segments of the accredited investor population: (1) attorneys  who have experience in private placement transactions, (2) accredited  investors who invest in private placement securities, (3) retail investors  who meet the current accredited investor criteria but do not actively invest  in private placement securities, and (4) investment advisers and broker- dealers who work with accredited investors. We asked the participants of  the structured interviews (market participants) about the feasibility,  likelihood of market acceptance, and impact on investor protection and  capital formation of adjusting the existing criteria. We worked with  associations to identify market participants to interview. We identified  seven associations that represent the types of individuals in the four  groups described above. These associations are the American Bar  Association, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,  the Financial Services Institute, ACA, AAII, IAA, and NVCA. We selected  these groups from a broader list of organizations we previously identified  as knowledgeable about accredited investors or that were recommended  by others. These organizations then recruited members to participate in  the interviews. We also asked participants for referrals to other individuals  who might be interested in participating.", "Our sample of 27 market participants consisted of 11 attorneys, 5  investment advisers, 5 angel investors, and 6 retail investors who qualify  as accredited investors but do not actively invest in unregistered  securities. We asked them demographic questions to learn more about  their backgrounds and help put their responses in context.", "We interviewed 11 attorneys, of whom 1 had more than 4 years of  experience with Regulation D transactions, 1 had more than 11 years  of experience, and 9 had more than 20 years. They represented  accredited investors, issuers, and placement agents and practiced in  different cities throughout the United States, although 5 were located  in New York City or Washington, D.C.", "We interviewed 5 broker-dealers or investment advisers: 3 said they  recommended Regulation D investments to clients at least once a  week; 1 said once a month; and 1 said several times a year.

They resided in different regions of  the United States.", "We conducted the structured interviews from February through March  2013. One team member asked the questions while a second recorded  the responses in a web-based questionnaire. We took steps to minimize  errors, such as difficulties interpreting a particular question, by pretesting  the interview questions with one member from each of the groups in  January 2013. We conducted pretests to make sure that the questions  were clear and unbiased and that they did not place an undue burden on  respondents. An independent survey specialist within GAO also reviewed  a draft of the questions prior to their administration. We made appropriate  revisions to the content and format of the questionnaire after the pretests  and independent review. The results from the structured interviews are  not generalizable to the population of market participants and only  represent the opinions of these 27 individuals. However, as described  above we took steps to obtain opinions from a diverse group of market  participants.", "Because the population of accredited investors is unknown, we performed  an additional analysis to suggest how changing the thresholds for net  worth and income would affect the pool of eligible investors. We used  data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) issues  every 3 years, to examine how changing the thresholds would affect the  pool of eligible households represented by survey respondents. For the  purposes of this analysis, a household refers to the primary economic unit  within a household (to which the SCF refers as a family). We used net  worth and income as defined in a Federal Reserve publication about the  SCF. For net worth, we excluded home equity. We did not attempt to  determine the appropriate threshold based on a household\u2019s marital  status. For the estimates in table 3, we followed SCF guidance and  estimated the standard errors (which appear in parentheses). We found  the data to be sufficiently reliable to evaluate household income and net  worth levels.", "To examine market participants\u2019 views on alternative financial and other  qualification criteria, we identified accredited investor criteria that market  participants and others proposed, and identified relevant criteria used by  the Ontario (Canada) Securities Commission and the United Kingdom  Financial Services Authority to qualify similar types of investors. From the  list of proposed and foreign regulator criteria, we identified a list of criteria  that was consistent with the intended purpose of the accredited investor  standard and that could be used to qualify individual investors as  accredited. We grouped these criteria into two categories: investors\u2019  access to financial resources and their understanding of financial risk.  (1) Investor\u2019s financial resources", "Liquid investments requirement. Investors would have to have  a minimum dollar amount of investment in liquid assets (that is,  assets that can be easily sold, are marketable, and the value of  which can be verified by a financial institution).", "Fixed-percentage investment. Investors would be limited in their  investments in single, nonpublic securities offerings to a certain  percentage of their individual net worth or income.  (2) Investor\u2019s understanding of financial risk", "Licenses/certification. Investors would have to demonstrate  knowledge of financial risks related to private placement  investments to receive licenses from regulators or authorized third  parties.

Investors who  wished to invest in private placement offerings would have to use  the services of registered investment advisers to manage their  investment accounts.", "We asked the 27 market participants if the current standard (income and  net worth) should be adjusted and to identify the most important criteria  for balancing capital formation and investor protection from the two  respective categories. We asked the market participants three different  lines of questions: (1) the effect of increasing or decreasing the minimum  income or net worth thresholds; (2) the effect of replacing the current  standard with an alternative criterion for financial resources; (3) the effect  of adding a criterion for understanding financial risk to the current  standard. By replace, we meant that potential investors must qualify  under the alternative criterion. By add, we meant if potential investors did  not qualify under the current standard, they could qualify under an  alternative. For each criterion, we asked about the effects on feasibility,  likelihood of market acceptance, and impact on investor protection and  capital formation. We did not ask about the effects of adding alternative  financial resources criteria to the current standard or replacing the current  standard with criteria for understanding financial risk.

Appendix III  includes the questions that we asked market participants and our results.", "We compared response patterns between the four types of market  participants that we interviewed and found that generally, there were little  differences in those patterns.
