Since the passage of Public Law 480 in 1954, U.S. food assistance has been provided to children and pregnant and lactating women. In the 1960s, USAID began building health clinics and funding research on treatments for diarrheal disease and the prevention of malaria. One of the specific objectives of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the primary legislation governing U.S. foreign aid, was to reduce infant mortality.", "In the 1970s, USAID began to focus on providing appropriate health interventions for common health problems in communities with the greatest needs. Activities related to child health included field studies on oral rehydration and vitamin A therapy and malaria research. \u201cIn carrying out the purposes of this subsection, the President shall promote, encourage, and undertake activities designed to deal directly with the special health needs of children and mothers. Such activities should utilize simple, available technologies which can significantly reduce childhood mortality, such as improved and expanded immunization programs, oral rehydration to combat diarrhoeal diseases, and education programs aimed at improving nutrition and sanitation and at promoting child spacing.\u201d", "Because the statutory language is broad and emphasizes but does not limit USAID to the specified interventions, USAID has considerable latitude in developing child survival activities appropriate to the community being served.", "In February 1985, in response to the authorizing legislation, some of USAID\u2019s ongoing child health efforts were consolidated into a child survival program. USAID provided mission-level child survival assistance to 31 countries in 1985, but it placed special emphasis on 22 countries that had especially high mortality rates. For each of these 22 countries, USAID developed a detailed child survival strategy, in cooperation with the host government, to deal with the country\u2019s specific needs and circumstances. USAID\u2019s policy was to sustain bilateral child survival funding in these countries for at least 3 to 5 years and provide technical support and training on a priority basis.", "Over the years, the congressional appropriations committees have continued to emphasize the importance of the basic interventions mentioned in the authorizing statute, particularly immunizations and oral rehydration therapy. In some years, the committees have also directed USAID to support particular activities, including the promotion of breastfeeding, research and development of vaccines, and prevention of vitamin A and other micronutrient deficiencies through food fortification, tablets, and injections.", "USAID\u2019s child survival program has evolved in the 1990s to where it no longer is a separate program, but is encompassed within USAID\u2019s sustainable development strategy as a component of its population, nutrition, and health sector.

During this 11-year period, USAID provided mission-level assistance on a continuing basis for some countries, such as Egypt, whereas other countries received funding in only 1 year. A total of 83 developing countries received some mission-level child survival funding during this period. The amounts ranged from $9,000 for Oman to $137 million for Egypt.

No one single group or organization typically performs the full range of activities that the agency sponsors. For example, in all the countries we visited, PVOs were involved at the community level with direct delivery of some of the basic health interventions.

USAID plans a new information management system that may improve the precision of the data for its child survival activities.", "From fiscal year 1985, when the child survival program officially began, through fiscal year 1995, appropriations statutes have mandated spending of at least $1.8 billion for child survival activities. From fiscal years 1985 to 1991, funds appropriated by Congress for child survival went into a separate functional account under USAID\u2019s development assistance account. Additionally, for several years prior to fiscal year 1992, the appropriations laws not only earmarked money for child survival, but the appropriations committees\u2019 reports also expressed the intention that other accounts within the development assistance account should provide substantially more money for child survival activities. Beginning in fiscal year 1992, the functional account was eliminated and subsequent laws appropriating moneys to USAID contained an earmark for child survival activities that could be drawn from any USAID assistance account. Since 1991, Congress has substantially increased the level of funds designated for child survival through earmarks (from $100 million in direct appropriations in fiscal year 1991 to $250 million in fiscal year 1992).", "USAID issued guidance in 1992 and 1996 about the types of activities that were allowed to be attributed to child survival. Additionally, the agency\u2019s budget office issues annual instructions for reporting on project activities. These instructions name types of activities that may be attributed to child survival and give broad discretion to USAID officials to determine the percentage of funding that can be reported as child survival. However, the instructions do not provide specific indicators for determining attribution, such as the percent of children in the population served for water projects. Moreover, some mission officials responsible for recording project activities told us that the guidance for making attributions was not clear to them.", "In our discussions with USAID officials, we found that the process of attributing funds to child survival activities was imprecise and that mistakes occurred. As a result, the percentage of funds designated as child survival varied widely for similar activities. For example, USAID used child survival funds for the construction of water systems in all four countries we visited. USAID guidance suggested 30 percent of the total budget of water and sewerage projects as an appropriate level to attribute to child survival, but child survival funds comprised from 3 to 100 percent of the funding for some of these projects.", "According to an official at the USAID mission in Egypt, the mission has a policy of attributing 3 percent of sewerage projects and 6 percent of water projects to child survival. In contrast, the Health Sector II project in Honduras attributed 70 percent of the $16.9 million water and sanitation component to child survival. According to a mission official, the justification for this level of attribution was that children under age 5 comprised approximately 70 percent of the deaths due to water-borne diseases in rural areas. Another activity funded by this project was the construction of area warehouses. About $72,000, which was 26 percent of the cost, was attributed to child survival. The justification USAID provided for this attribution was that these warehouses, which were used to store medical supplies, have contributed to the decline in the infant mortality rate in Honduras.", "The funding amounts reported as child survival are based on estimated percentages of total project obligations for types of child survival activities carried out under individual projects. These estimates are made by project or budget officers and are supposed to be based on a knowledge of project plans and activities. However, mission officials told us that they generally did not change the activity assignments or percentages, even though changes in available funding or project plans may occur during the year. For example, $800,000 in child survival funding was attributed to a basic education project in Ethiopia in 1994. A mission official told us that the child survival activity did not actually take place, but the reports provided to us by USAID included child survival funding for this project.", "USAID reports on funds attributed to child survival and other activities are not based on expenditures. USAID stated that its activity reporting system was never intended to track expenditures for programs and that Congress was aware that reported funding represented estimates of obligations. However, according to USAID officials, a new information system is underway that will link budgets, obligations, and expenditures and enable the agency to track funds more accurately.", "USAID officials said that the new system would be able to link some child survival assistance with actual expenditures in cases in which a distinct child survival activity has been defined. However, in other cases, reported funding will continue to be based on the project manager\u2019s estimate of the percentage of funding attributable to child survival. USAID began implementing the new system in July 1996 for all new commitments made at headquarters, and it plans to extend the system to the overseas missions by October 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID\u2019s Contribution to Child Survival", "paragraphs": ["USAID has made significant contributions, in collaboration with other donors, in reducing under-5 mortality rates.

Five countries achieved the World Summit goal of 70 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births. The number of deaths from the three major causes of under-5 mortality declined during this time, but the largest decrease was for vaccine-preventable diseases.", "USAID can claim some far-reaching accomplishments in immunizations. Between 1985 and 1994, 26 of the 59 countries that received some mission-level assistance specifically for immunization activities achieved USAID\u2019s goal of 80-percent immunization rates. Through collaboration with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), UNICEF, Rotary International, other international organizations, and the individual countries, USAID helped to bring about the eradication of poliomyelitis in the Americas. USAID\u2019s Children\u2019s Vaccine Initiative project supports a revolving fund, called the Vaccine Independence Initiative, that is managed by PAHO and UNICEF. This fund, which received $3.8 million of child survival funding between 1992 and 1995, is used to help developing countries purchase vaccines.", "One of USAID\u2019s most important accomplishments in diarrheal disease control occurred before 1985 with the discovery that oral rehydration salts could be used to treat the dehydration that occurs with diarrheal diseases and causes death. USAID has also had positive results in efforts to increase usage of oral rehydration therapy, although only four countries where USAID has provided mission-level child survival assistance have usage rates above 80 percent.", "USAID\u2019s recent diarrheal disease control efforts have been aimed at promoting sustainability by transferring technology to developing countries so that they can manufacture the salts. USAID has also contributed to research on the importance of vitamin A supplementation and efforts to incorporate vitamin A into local food supplies around the world.", "USAID\u2019s Center for Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE) concluded in a 1993 report that USAID\u2019s child survival activities had achieved many successes and made a significant contribution in expanding child survival services and reducing infant mortality in many countries. The CDIE report cited the importance of USAID\u2019s role in vaccinations and stated that the agency had supported other major donors, such as UNICEF, through coordination and the provision of needed resources. Another evaluation conducted independently by RESULTS Educational Fund and the Bread for the World Institute concluded in a January 1995 report that USAID\u2019s child survival activities had made an important contribution to reducing deaths among children under age 5 in countries receiving USAID assistance.", "In the four countries we visited, USAID\u2019s contributions through child survival activities were evident. For example, in Mozambique, USAID supports PVOs that provide child survival services and other types of humanitarian and development assistance.

Under the current USAID grant, APROFAM received about $2.5 million in child survival funding, representing 15 percent of its total USAID funds. We also visited a pharmaceutical plant in Guatemala where USAID provided equipment and technical assistance to manufacture packets of oral rehydration salts used in the treatment of diarrheal disease dehydration (see fig. 5). The packets are to be distributed through Ministry of Health facilities. This plant was a component of USAID\u2019s $20 million child survival project started in 1985 to assist the Ministry of Health.", "In Egypt, we visited urban and rural health clinics that administered vaccinations and oral rehydration therapy and had laboratories that were equipped to perform medical tests.

However, the amounts used for immunizations and diarrheal disease control were less in 1994 and 1995 than they had been in 1993. During the same period, USAID spent about $341.5 million on such areas as health systems development, health care financing, water quality, and environmental health (a new area).", "In Mozambique, USAID attributed child survival funds for the construction of a water supply system in Chimoio by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency to serve as many as 25,000 residents (see fig. 6).

The report also stated that the results of other child survival interventions appear to be greater than the results obtained from investing in water and sanitation and that oral rehydration therapy and interventions related to acute respiratory infections should be given higher priority.", "In Mozambique, reconstruction of a railroad bridge crossing the Zambezi River between Sena and Mutarara was considered child survival (see  fig. 7). The goal of this project was to rehabilitate roads so that land movement of food and other relief assistance, the return of displaced persons and refugees, and drought recovery activities could occur. The railroad bridge was modified to accommodate vehicles and pedestrian traffic. Of the project\u2019s $10.8 million budget, $1.9 million was attributed to child survival as nutrition in 1993 and 1994.", "Although the railroad bridge in Mozambique was considered a nutrition intervention, other infrastructure projects that have used child survival funding were classified as water quality/health, health systems development, and health care financing. Between 1993 and 1995, USAID attributed about $38.6 million in child survival funds to water quality/health, $113.5 million to health systems development, and $24.6 million to health care financing. Examples of activities related to health systems development include the construction of warehouses for government medical supplies in Honduras. An example of a health care financing activity in Bolivia is PROSALUD, which USAID established to be a self-financing health care provider.", "USAID attributed $30 million of the international disaster assistance funds to child survival in fiscal year 1995.

Although USAID considers health and population services to be important, the agency does not provide them directly; instead, it tries to improve the capacity, infrastructure, systems, and policies that support these services in a sustainable way.", "In its 1994 Strategies for Sustainable Development, USAID stated that the agency\u2019s population and health programs would concentrate on countries that contribute the most to global population and health problems and have population and health conditions that impede sustainable development. Agency guidance states that any of the following key factors indicate the need to consider developing strategic objectives that address family planning, child survival, maternal health, and reduction of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS: annual total gross domestic product growth less than 2 percent higher than annual population growth over the past 10 years, unmet need for contraception at or above 25 percent of married women of childbearing age, total fertility rate above 3.5 children per woman, mortality rate for children under age 5 at or above 150 per 1,000 live births, stunting in at least 25 percent of children under age 5, maternal mortality rate at or above 200 deaths per 100,000 live births, and prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases at or above 10 percent among women aged 15 to 30.", "Because USAID has identified global population growth as an issue of strategic priority agencywide, guidance states that strategies directed at family planning, child survival, maternal health, and reduction of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS\u2014all of which must be considered together\u2014will receive particular attention in those countries where the unmet need for contraception is the greatest. USAID stated that other concerns would also include under-5 mortality, maternal mortality, prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, and stunting.", "USAID\u2019s long-term goal is to contribute to a cooperative global effort to stabilize world population growth and protect human health. Its anticipated near-term results over a 10-year period are (1) significant improvement in women\u2019s health, (2) a reduction in child mortality by one-third, (3) a reduction of maternal mortality rates by one-half, and  (4) a decrease in the rate of new HIV infections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Guidance", "paragraphs": ["USAID issued guidance in 1992 and 1996 about the types of activities that are allowable uses of child survival funds.
