The amounts of  the penalties imposed can vary substantially, depending on the limits  specified in the applicable statutes or regulations and the degree to which  the agencies impose the maximum fines permitted. In 1996, Congress  passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act  (SBREFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 note), which was intended to, among other things,  \u201ccreate a more cooperative regulatory environment among agencies and  small businesses that is less punitive and more solution-oriented.\u201d Section  223 of SBREFA, entitled \u201cRights of Small Entities in Enforcement Actions,\u201d  requires agencies to provide small entities (a small business, a small  government, or a small organization) with some form of relief from civil  monetary penalties. Specifically, subsection 223(a) of SBREFA required  federal agencies regulating the activities of small entities to establish a  policy or program by March 29, 1997, for the reduction and, under  appropriate circumstances, the waiver of civil penalties by small entities.  Subsection 223(c) of the act required agencies to submit a one-time report  to four congressional committees by March 29, 1998, on the scope of their  programs or policies, the number of enforcement actions against small  entities that qualified or failed to qualify for the SBREFA program or policy,  and the total amount of penalty reductions and waivers.", "You asked us to examine the implementation of section 223 of SBREFA and  issues related to civil penalty enforcement in selected agencies.", "Specifically, you asked us to (1) describe the similarities and differences in  the selected agencies\u2019 policies or programs under subsection 223(a) of the  act; (2) determine how many civil penalty enforcement actions each  selected agency had initiated against small entities in each fiscal year since  SBREFA\u2019s enactment, and how many of those actions resulted in some kind  of penalty relief (either a waiver or penalty reduction); and (3) determine  whether any of the civil penalty enforcement actions that did not result in  penalty relief involved paperwork requirements and, if so, why a waiver or  penalty reduction was not provided in those cases. We focused our review  on five federal agencies that have civil monetary penalty authority,  appeared to have developed a large number of rules affecting small entities,  and were of interest to the Subcommittee: the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) within the Department of  Justice (DOJ), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) within the  Department of Labor (DOL)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Small businesses are a significant part of the nation\u2019s economy, accounting  (under SBA\u2019s definition) for 99 percent of all businesses, about 50 percent  of the gross domestic product, and about 53 percent of private industry\u2019s  workforce. Small governments make up 97 percent of all of the local  governments in the United States. However, small businesses and  governments can be disproportionately affected by federal agencies\u2019  regulatory requirements, and agencies may inadequately consider the  impact of those requirements on small entities when the requirements are  implemented.", "In response to concerns about the effect that federal regulations may have  on small entities, Congress passed the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) in  1980 (5 U.S.C. 601-612). The RFA requires federal agencies to analyze the  anticipated effects of rules they plan to propose on small entities unless  they certify that the rules will not have a \u201csignificant economic impact on a  substantial number of small entities.\u201d We have reported several times on  the implementation of the RFA, noting areas in need of improvement.", "On March 29, 1996, Congress passed SBREFA to, among other things,  strengthen the RFA\u2019s protections for small entities and \u201ccreate a more  cooperative regulatory environment among agencies and small businesses  that is less punitive and more solution-oriented.\u201d Subsection 223(a) of  SBREFA directed each federal agency regulating the activities of small  entities to establish a policy or program by March 29, 1997, \u201cto provide for  the reduction, and under appropriate circumstances for the waiver, of civil  penalties for violations of a statutory or regulatory requirement by a small  entity.\u201d Subsection 223(b) identifies certain \u201cconditions and exclusions\u201d  that agencies\u2019 policies or program could include (e.g., requiring the small  entity to correct the violation within a reasonable period of time and  excluding violations that pose serious health, safety, or environmental  threats). Although the agencies\u2019 policies and programs were required to  contain conditions and exclusions (subject to the requirements or  limitations in other statutes), agencies were not required to include the  conditions and exclusions listed in the subsection and were not limited to  those listed. Subsection 223(c) required agencies to submit a one-time  report to four specific congressional committees by March 29, 1998, on (1)  the scope of their programs or policies, (2) the number of enforcement  actions against small entities that qualified or failed to qualify for the  programs or policies, and (3) the total amount of penalty reductions and  waivers.", "Comments by the drafters of SBREFA at the time the act was passed  underscore the discretion that agencies have in the development and  implementation of their section 223 programs and the degree to which  agencies can use existing programs to satisfy the act\u2019s requirements.

It also said  that the plans should identify how notification of the agencies\u2019 policies will  be given to frontline workers and small businesses.", "We have recognized in previous reports that enforcement is an important  element of regulatory management and civil penalties are important to  agencies\u2019 enforcement efforts. For example, in a 1996 report on the Clean  Water Act we said \u201cpenalties play a key role in environmental enforcement  by deterring violators and by ensuring that regulated entities are treated  fairly and consistently so that no one gains a competitive advantage by  violating environmental regulations.\u201d In another report, we said civil  monetary penalties \u201care potentially a strong deterrent\u201d to noncompliance  with nursing home regulations, and we also said those penalties \u201chave  potential to provide the necessary incentives to ensure continued  compliance.\u201d", "However, some Members of Congress have become concerned about the  impact that civil penalties can have on small businesses and other small  entities, particularly for infractions that may be relatively minor in nature.  During the 105th Congress, the House of Representatives approved  legislation that would have required federal regulatory agencies, in certain  circumstances, to suspend civil fines on small businesses for first-time  paperwork violations so that the small businesses could correct the  violations. Similar legislation was introduced in the Senate but was not  enacted. In commenting on this proposed legislation, EPA and other  agencies indicated that information collection requirements are the  foundation of many health and safety statutes, and that violations of those  requirements should not automatically be treated as a minor infractions  meriting a waiver of civil penalties.

Ten departments and agencies  had at least 50 entries in at least 1 of these editions of the Unified Agenda\u2014 EPA; FCC; and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and  Human Services, the Interior, Justice, Labor, Transportation, and the  Treasury.

Within DOJ and DOL, we  identified the agencies that accounted for most of the departments\u2019 totals\u2014 INS within DOJ and MSHA and OSHA within DOL. We then confirmed that  each of the five agencies selected had civil penalty authority.", "To address the first objective of describing the similarities and differences  in the selected agencies\u2019 policies, we obtained a copy of the report that  each of the agencies submitted in 1998 pursuant to subsection 223(c) of  SBREFA from the Senate Committee on Small Business. We also obtained  copies of each agency\u2019s policies and reports from the agencies or through  the Internet. We reviewed the agencies\u2019 policies and policy descriptions in  their reports, noting areas of similarity and difference (e.g., whether the  agencies\u2019 policies provided civil penalty relief for small entities and the  scope of the policies\u2019 coverage). We then clarified, where appropriate, our  characterizations of the agencies\u2019 policies with agency officials.", "We also attempted to use the agencies\u2019 subsection 223(c) reports to address  the second objective\u2014determining how many civil penalty enforcement  actions the agencies had initiated and how many resulted in penalty relief.  However, two of the reports did not contain any enforcement data, and in  two other cases the data were not presented in the manner specified in the  statute or consistent with our objective. Therefore, we asked officials in  each selected agency to identify how many civil penalty enforcement  actions the agency had initiated against small entities each fiscal year since  SBREFA\u2019s enactment (i.e., fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000), and how  many of those actions in each year resulted in some penalty relief and no  penalty relief.", "To address our third objective regarding paperwork requirements, we  asked the agencies to identify how many of the enforcement actions  against small entities that resulted in no penalty relief involved a  paperwork requirement. We also asked the agencies to explain why those  paperwork-related actions did not result in civil penalty relief.

INS officials told us during this review that the agency\u2019s civil penalty  authority regarding small entities primarily related to the following two  areas of regulatory activity: (1) employment verification under section  274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986; and (2) oversight of air  and sea carriers who bring aliens into the United States under section  273 of the act, as amended.", "In the employer verification area, INS pointed to its \u201cGuidelines for  Determination of Employer Sanctions Civil Money Penalties,\u201d which  were issued in August 1991, as satisfying subsection 223(a) of  SBREFA.

A less  specific version of the INS civil monetary penalty policy was  published in the Federal Register in 1987 and was codified in the  Code of Federal Regulations.

INS  said this statutory provision was aimed at allowing employers of any  size who have made a good faith attempt to comply with a particular  employment verification requirement to correct technical or  procedural failures before they are deemed to be violations of the  act.

Also,  certain agencies\u2019 authorizing statutes require that certain minimum fines be  imposed or that certain factors be taken into consideration when granting  penalty relief. For example, section 17(a) of the Occupational Safety and  Health Act of 1970, as amended, states that any employer who willfully or  repeatedly violates certain statutory provisions or associated regulations  \u201cmay be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $70,000 for each  violation, but not less than $5,000 for each willful violation.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policies Vary in Degree to Which All Small Entity Enforcement Actions and Relief Are Covered", "paragraphs": ["The agencies\u2019 section 223 policies vary in the extent to which they cover all  civil penalty-related enforcement actions involving small entities and all  instances in which small entities can receive civil penalty relief.

However, an  OSHA official said that the agency has interpreted SBREFA as not applying  to state health and safety programs approved by OSHA. Therefore, the  OSHA enforcement data that we discuss in a later section of this report do  not include penalty relief that small entities have received under those state  programs.", "EPA said states are encouraged, but not required, to adopt the agency\u2019s  section 223 policies in agency-approved state environmental programs.  However, those policies cover only a portion of the various types of  enforcement actions in the agency involving small entities. For example,  EPA officials said that only two states\u2014Nebraska and Oregon\u2014had  adopted the agency\u2019s small community policy at the time of our review.  Also, EPA\u2019s small business policy and the agency\u2019s audit policy both require  small businesses to voluntarily disclose violations in order to receive civil  penalty relief. However, small businesses can receive civil penalty relief  without voluntary disclosure as a result of the regular administration of  nine environmental statutes EPA administers that permit the use of civil  penalties. Therefore, EPA or state environmental officials could discover  a violation of one of these statutory requirements by a small entity, propose  a civil penalty, and provide the entity with either a waiver or a reduction of  the penalty\u2014all without reference to section 223 of SBREFA. As a result,  EPA officials said that the data that we discuss later in this report does not  include all instances in which small entities receive civil penalty relief.", "Similarly, INS officials indicated that their two section 223 policies cover  only a portion of the types of agency enforcement actions, and said that the  number of small entities receiving penalty relief under the agency\u2019s carrier  policy represents only a portion of the total number of small entities  receiving penalty relief under various other sections of INA. For example,  the officials said that carriers could also receive penalty relief under at  least five other sections of the act, including section 234 (no advance notice  of aircraft arrival or aircraft landing at an unauthorized place), section 255  (employment on passenger vessels of crewmen with certain afflictions),  and section 256 (improper discharge of alien crewmen)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policies Vary in Extent to Which Small Entities Receive Extra Penalty Relief", "paragraphs": ["The selected agencies\u2019 section 223 policies vary in the extent to which they  provide small entities with more penalty relief than similarly situated larger  entities. Some of the policies (the FCC, EPA audit, and INS carrier policies)  provide small entities with no greater penalty relief than they provide to  any other regulated entity. Under these broad agency policies, small  entities can receive penalty relief on the basis of other factors (e.g., their  ability to pay the penalty), but size is not an explicitly relevant factor in  determining either the amount of the initial penalty assessed or any  reductions from that initial assessment. Other section 223 policies (EPA\u2019s  small business and small community policies) apply only to small entities.  In still other policies (MSHA, OSHA, and INS employment verification),  small entities can get penalty relief over and above that provided to larger  entities because they meet certain size-related criteria. In some of these  policies, the smaller the business, the greater the penalty reduction they  can receive. For example, OSHA\u2019s policy indicates that employers with 101  to 250 employees can get a 20-percent reduction in civil penalties,  employers with 26 to 100 employees can get a 40-percent reduction, and  employers with 25 or fewer employees can get a 60-percent reduction.  OSHA does not consider employers with more than 250 employees \u201csmall  businesses,\u201d and they therefore are ineligible for size-related penalty relief.", "In four of the five agencies included in our review (EPA, OSHA, MSHA, and  INS), the agencies\u2019 use of targeted relief for small entities is at least  sometimes directly traceable to underlying statutes. For example, the  Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, requires OSHA to  assess civil penalties taking into account, among other things, \u201cthe size of  the business of the employer being charged.\u201d Similarly, the Federal Mine  Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977 requires MSHA to consider,  among other things, \u201cthe appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the  business of the operator charged.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policies Vary in How Key Terms Are Defined", "paragraphs": ["The agencies\u2019 section 223 policies also vary in how certain key terms such  as small entity and penalty reduction are defined or used."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Small Entity", "paragraphs": ["SBREFA indicated that the term small entity should be defined the same  way it is defined in the RFA\u2014a small business, a small government, or a  small organization.

For example, the act  says that the term \u201csmall business\u201d has the same meaning as the term  \u201csmall business concern\u201d under section 3 of the Small Business Act, unless  an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small  Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment,  establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to  the activities of the agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal  Register.\u201d", "As previously noted, several of the agencies\u2019 section 223 policies (FCC, INS  carriers, and EPA audit) provide small entities with no greater penalty  relief than that provided to larger entities, all other factors being equal. Not  surprisingly, therefore, the term small entity is undefined in these policies.  Other agencies\u2019 policies that give small entities extra relief either define the  term small entity or the agency was able to describe how the term is used in  the administration of the policy. However, the policies\u2019 definitions of a  small entity vary among the agencies, and sometimes vary within the same  department or agency. For example:  EPA\u2019s small business policy defines a small business as a person,  corporation, partnership, or other entity that employs 100 or fewer  individuals across all facilities and operations owned by the business. OSHA\u2019s policy says that small entities eligible for civil penalty relief are  those with 250 or fewer employees at all work sites at any one time  during the previous 12 months.", "MSHA\u2019s policy does not specifically define the term small entity.", "Although MSHA traditionally defines a small mine as having fewer than  20 employees, the agency also sometimes uses SBA\u2019s definition of a  small entity for the mining industry\u2014500 employees or fewer.  However, in its regular penalty assessments, MSHA defines the size of a  regulated entity by either the number of hours worked or by tonnage of  production.", "EPA\u2019s definition of a small government eligible for penalty relief also varies.  For example, EPA said that any small government or small organization  employing 100 or fewer individuals is eligible for penalty relief under the  small business policy. However, EPA\u2019s small community policy is targeted  toward certain communities on the basis of the number of residents (fewer  than 2,500), not the number of employees in their local governments.  Although the INS employment verification policy requires consideration of  the size of the regulated entity in determining penalty assessments, the  policy does not define the term small entity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Penalty Reduction", "paragraphs": ["Most of the agencies\u2019 section 223 policies do not contain an explicit  definition of a penalty reduction. However, our discussions with officials in  the agencies indicated that the term is being used differently across the  agencies. For example, the INS carrier enforcement office considers a  penalty reduction to be the difference between the penalty imposed on the  regulated entity and the statutory maximum penalty. For example, if the  statutory maximum penalty for a particular violation was $3,300 and the  penalty ultimately imposed on the entity was $1,000, the INS carrier  enforcement office considers the $2,300 difference to be the amount of the  penalty reduction. However, EPA officials said that the agency does not  consider the statutory maximum in determining the amount of penalty  relief provided under its section 223 policies. Instead, they said that a  penalty reduction is the difference between the amount initially proposed  and the amount ultimately assessed. Using the above example with a $3,300  statutory maximum penalty, if EPA initially determined that the penalty  should be $1,300 but later reduced the penalty to $1,000, the amount of  penalty relief provided would be $300.", "The agencies\u2019 policies also differ in how penalty reductions are triggered.  For example, under OSHA\u2019s policy, penalty reductions are automatically  provided on the basis of preestablished formulas, and further reductions  can occur if the initial penalty determination is appealed. Under the INS  carrier policy, penalty relief can occur upon application by the carrier, or  automatically under a prearranged memorandum of understanding  between the carrier and INS.

In subsection 223(a), the act says  that under the appropriate circumstances, \u201can agency may consider ability  to pay in determining penalty assessments on small entities.\u201d Subsection  223(b) lists six conditions and exclusions that agencies may include in their  penalty relief policies or programs:  requiring the small entity to correct the violation within a reasonable   limiting the applicability to violations discovered through participation  by the small entity in a compliance assistance or audit program operated  or supported by the agency or a state;  excluding small entities that have been subject to multiple enforcement  actions by the agency;  excluding violations involving willful or criminal conduct;  excluding violations that pose serious health, safety, or environmental   requiring a good faith effort to comply with the law.", "As table 1 illustrates, the agencies\u2019 section 223 policies and related  administrative procedures varied in the extent to which they included these  suggested conditions and exclusions. All of the policies excluded small  entities from receiving penalty relief if they had been subject to multiple  enforcement actions. Other common exclusions were violations that  involved serious health, safety, or environmental threats and violations  involving willful or criminal misconduct. Only one of the policies limited  their applicability to violations discovered through participation by the  small entity in a compliance assistance or audit program\u2014EPA\u2019s audit  policy. EPA\u2019s small business policy contained this condition until April  2000. The agency decided to eliminate this requirement in order to make it  easier for small businesses to take advantage of the policy. Since then, the  policy has allowed small businesses to receive penalty relief if violations  are discovered by any voluntary means (e.g., via participation in training  classes; use of on-line compliance assistance centers; or use of checklists,  even if not sponsored by an environmental regulatory agency).", "Subsection 223(b) of SBREFA makes it clear that the conditions and  exclusions that agencies can include in their small entity penalty relief  programs and policies are not limited to those suggested in the act. Each of  the agencies\u2019 policies do, in fact, include other factors.

INS noted in its report that the agency had investigated approximately  6,000 businesses during fiscal year 1997 for violations of section 274A of  the INA, resulting in a notice of intent to fine in 888 of those cases.

EPA reported that through the  end of fiscal year 1997, 95 small entities had received relief under its  section 223 program, 10 small entities had not qualified for the program,  and 44 cases were still under consideration. EPA also reported that nearly  $900,000 in penalties had been reduced or waived through the program.  However, EPA\u2019s data focused on the number of small entities that had and  had not received relief under the program, not the number of enforcement  actions initiated against small entities that qualified and failed to qualify for  the program. Also, as EPA noted in its report, the data may understate the  number of small entities receiving penalty relief and the dollar amount of  that relief. The report presented data for penalty relief provided to small  entities under what EPA considered its section 223 policies (as the statute  required).

However, the report also  indicated that the unit of analysis was small entities, not enforcement  actions. OSHA officials told us during this review that the data actually  reflect the number of inspections in which penalties were reduced. This  difference in the unit of analysis can be important because a single  inspection can involve a number of enforcement actions.

The average amount of penalty per  enforcement action ranged from about $233 (1997) to about $274 (1999).

As previously noted, OSHA automatically applies its penalty  relief criteria to proposed penalties. Small entities can receive the largest  penalty reductions, and the smaller the entity the larger the reduction.  During each of the last 3 fiscal years (1998 through 2000), OSHA provided  small entities with more than $120 million in penalty relief, and in each year  more than 80 percent of the reductions provided to small entities were  based solely on the size of the entities.", "The data that EPA provided to us reflected enforcement under the three  elements of its section 223 programs, not all enforcement actions in the  agency.

Not surprisingly, the agencies used  that discretion and developed policies that vary substantially.

Some of the policies apply only to small entities or provide them with extra  civil penalty relief, and other policies provide small entities with no greater  relief than large entities. The agencies also varied in how key terms were  defined and in their policies\u2019 conditions and exclusions. This variability  notwithstanding, all of the agencies\u2019 policies and programs that we  reviewed were within the discretion afforded to them by SBREFA.  Agencies were allowed to limit the scope of their programs to only a  portion of their enforcement actions against small entities, and they could  decide not to give small entities any additional civil penalty relief. Agencies  were also allowed to establish whatever conditions or exclusions they  wanted for participation in their programs, subject to the requirements and  limitations in other statutes.", "Agencies\u2019 differing missions and operating environments may legitimately  require differences in the agencies\u2019 civil penalty relief policies. However,  some elements of agencies\u2019 policies can be strengthened and made more  consistent without impinging on agencies\u2019 flexibility. For example, if  Congress wants agencies\u2019 section 223 policies to be more inclusive, it could  require that those policies cover all instances in which small entities can  receive civil monetary penalties. Also, if Congress wants small entities to  receive more civil penalty relief than is provided to larger entities (unless,  of course, larger entities receive a complete penalty waiver), it could  require that agencies\u2019 policies or programs provide extra reductions for  small entities. These kinds of changes would improve small entities\u2019  opportunities to receive relief from federal civil monetary penalties.  However, Congress could still permit the agencies\u2019 policies to delineate  relevant conditions and exclusions under which the penalty relief would be  authorized without allowing the conditions and exclusions to be so  restrictive that they unduly limit the scope of the policies themselves. For  example, agencies could continue to exclude small entities that have been  subject to multiple enforcement actions, exclude violations involving  willful or criminal conduct, and require that entities correct the violations  within a reasonable period.", "Even if agencies made these changes to their section 223 policies, Congress  would still be unable to oversee the implementation of those policies  without data. Agencies are not currently required to collect data on the  implementation of their civil penalty policies under section 223; the statute  imposed a one-time reporting requirement that expired in 1998, and some  of the agencies failed to satisfy this requirement. To facilitate congressional  oversight, Congress could require agencies to maintain certain types of  implementation data, such as (1) the number of enforcement actions in  which civil penalties were proposed, (2) the number of those actions  involving small entities, (3) the number of those actions in which small  entities received some type of penalty relief, and (4) the dollar amount of  the relief provided. By maintaining such data, agencies would be able to  make the data available when Congress exercises its oversight duties in  this area. The data would also help the agencies themselves understand  how their section 223 policies are operating. When providing such data to  Congress, agencies should clearly define key terms such as \u201csmall entity\u201d  and \u201cpenalty reduction\u201d so that Congress can understand whether  variations in agencies\u2019 data are caused by differences in the  implementation of agencies\u2019 section 223 programs or other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["If Congress wishes to strengthen civil penalty relief for small entities, it  should consider amending section 223 of SBREFA to require that agencies\u2019  policies or programs (including relevant conditions and exclusions) cover  all of the agencies\u2019 civil penalty enforcement actions involving small  entities and provide small entities with more penalty relief than other  similarly situated entities. Also, to facilitate congressional oversight in this  area, Congress should consider amending the act to require agencies to  maintain data by fiscal year or some other time period on such factors as  the number of enforcement actions involving all small entities, the number  of enforcement actions that resulted in penalty reductions, and the amount  of penalty relief provided.

Department of Justice officials said  they had no comments on the draft report. On January 16 and 18, 2001, FCC  and DOL officials told us they had no comments on the matters for  congressional consideration but provided several suggestions to clarify  particular sections of the report, which we included as appropriate. On  January 24, 2001, we met with the Director of EPA\u2019s Office of Regulatory  Enforcement and the Director of the agency\u2019s Office of Compliance to  discuss the draft report. During the meeting, the Directors provided several  suggestions to clarify certain sections of the report. For example, they  requested that the report clearly state that SBREFA does not currently  require agencies to maintain the information that we requested in relation  to our second and third objectives. They also said the report should  indicate that EPA views information collection requirements as the  foundation of many health and safety statutes, and that violations of those  requirements should not automatically be treated as minor infractions  meriting a waiver of civil penalties. We made these and other changes to  the draft report, and provided the Directors with a revised draft reflecting  the changes made.", "On January 26, 2001, the Directors of EPA\u2019s Offices of Regulatory  Enforcement and Compliance provided written comments on the revised  draft report, which are reproduced in appendix I. The Directors said they  found our evaluation helpful and were taking steps to implement some of  the report\u2019s \u201crecommendations.\u201d For example, the Directors said they were  planning to begin collecting data on the number of small businesses taking  advantage of EPA\u2019s audit policy. However, they also provided several  \u201coverarching comments\u201d regarding the report. First, they said that  \u201cistinguishing between requirements that have an information collection  request and those that do not is an inaccurate litmus test for differentiating  \u2018major\u2019 and \u2018minor\u2019 violations.\u201d Second, they said it is not clear that  penalties issued against small businesses in EPA enforcement actions are a  \u201csignificant concern,\u201d noting that EPA reduces penalties below the  statutory maximums, settles most cases below the initial penalty offers,  and is required by the agency\u2019s statutes and penalty policies to consider  ability to pay, \u201cwhich enables EPA to take small business concerns into  account in its enforcement actions.\u201d The Directors also said EPA believes  that penalty incentives should reward those who make voluntary efforts to  comply with regulatory requirements, and that agencies implementing  SBREFA programs should continue to consider the penalty factors that  Congress has established (e.g., recovery of any economic benefit of  noncompliance).", "We did not indicate in our draft report that violations involving an  information collection were, in any sense, \u201cminor\u201d violations. In fact, as  previously indicated, we added a sentence to the revised draft that the  Directors reviewed reflecting EPA\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 concerns about this  issue in relation to legislation that Congress had considered. Regarding the  Directors\u2019 second point, it is not clear how EPA can determine whether  penalties issued against small entities are a significant concern without the  enforcement data that the Directors said the agency does not possess or  that they described as \u201cinadequate.\u201d Also, an entity\u2019s \u201cability to pay\u201d may be  unrelated to whether that entity is considered \u201csmall\u201d for purposes of  SBREFA. Therefore, taking into account a business\u2019 ability to pay does not  ensure that small business concerns are taken into account. Regarding the  Directors\u2019 last points, we noted in the conclusion of our draft report that  even if agencies\u2019 policies were required to provide extra reductions for  small entities, agencies would still be free to impose other conditions and  exclusions on the receipt of penalty relief. Those factors could include,  among other things, consideration of an organization\u2019s voluntary efforts to  comply and congressionally established factors.", "The EPA Directors also provided several \u201ctechnical\u201d comments on the draft  report. In several of these comments, the Directors stated the agency\u2019s  position on various issues but did not recommend changes to the draft  report. For example, in one such comment, they emphasized that EPA  offers penalty relief to small entities both through its section 223 policies  and through its policies implementing environmental statutes, and  indicated that EPA views \u201cability to pay\u201d separate and distinct from \u201cability  to continue in business.\u201d In other comments, the Directors noted that EPA  data tracking for the agency\u2019s voluntary disclosure policies was  \u201cinadequate\u201d (although improvements were being made), and that other  data that we requested on the agency\u2019s small communities policy did not  exist.", "However, in other technical comments the Directors suggested changes to  the draft report. For example, they said the report should indicate that an  enforcement program needs to meet many competing goals, and said  addressing the recommendations in the draft report may create tensions  with our previous recommendations regarding equitable treatment for comparable violations. Although we agree conceptually that an agency\u2019s  enforcement program may face competing goals, we do not believe that  providing penalty relief for small entities and maintaining data on the  amount of relief provided are inconsistent with a strong civil penalty  program. Furthermore, we do not believe that the matters for  congressional consideration in this report conflict with our previous  recommendations. In the report that the Directors cited, we listed a  number of factors that an agency could appropriately consider when  determining the penalties to be imposed (e.g., the severity of the violation  and the degree of economic benefit obtained). With the enactment of  section 223 of SBREFA (less than 2 weeks after the publication of our  report), the size of the entity involved in the violation became yet another  factor that agencies could legitimately consider when determining  equitable penalty amounts.", "In another comment, the Directors said the number of small entities  described as having received relief in EPA\u2019s 1998 report also represented  the number of enforcement actions taken during the reporting period.  Therefore, they said the information that subsection 223(c) of SBREFA  required be included in the agency\u2019s report was, in fact, included. However,  readers of EPA\u2019s 1998 report were not provided this information at the time  that the report was issued. Therefore, readers had no way of knowing  whether the information that EPA provided (on the number of small  entities receiving penalty relief) was consistent with the statutory  requirement (number of enforcement actions resulting in penalty relief). In  the revised draft report that the Directors reviewed, we had already noted  that, in commenting on this report, EPA said the number of small entities  was equivalent to the number of enforcement actions taken. Therefore, no  changes were made to the final report.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after the  date of this report.
