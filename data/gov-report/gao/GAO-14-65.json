To do this, GAO analyzed plans, status reports, and other documentation from agencies and interviewed agency and OMB officials.

However, four agencies did not always provide sufficient support for all of their estimates, and they varied in their use of processes\u0097such as an enterprise architecture and a method for assessing the value of investments\u0097recommended by OMB to identify consolidation opportunities.

Avoiding such investments will  be particularly important to ensure the most efficient use of resources as  agencies continue to be faced with budget restrictions.", "Over the past few years, we have issued a series of reports that have  identified federal programs or functional areas where potentially  unnecessary duplication, overlap, or fragmentation exists, the actions  needed to address such conditions, and the potential financial and other  benefits of doing so.

According to OMB, PortfolioStat has the potential to  save the government $2.5 billion over the next 3 years. Given the  potential for achieving such savings and improving IT investment  management, you asked us to review the implementation of PortfolioStat.  Our specific objectives were to (1) determine the status of efforts to  implement key required PortfolioStat actions, (2) evaluate selected  agencies\u2019 plans for making portfolio improvements and achieving  associated cost savings, and (3) evaluate OMB\u2019s plans to improve the  PortfolioStat process.", "To address our first objective, we obtained documentation from the 26  agencies that were required to comply with OMB\u2019s memo for  implementing the PortfolioStat initiative and compared it to the memo\u2019s  requirements and supporting guidance. To address our second objective,  we selected 5 agencies based on criteria including total IT expenditures  for fiscal year 2012, investment management maturity level, and IT and  Chief Information Officer organizational structures. These agencies are  the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, the Interior, the Treasury, and  Veterans Affairs. We analyzed these agencies\u2019 documentation and  interviewed relevant officials to identify their plans for reducing potentially  duplicative, low-value, and wasteful commodity IT investments and  determine the extent to which they were based on the use of an  enterprise architecture (EA) and an IT valuation model, as  recommended by OMB, and the extent to which support for estimated  cost savings was documented. To address our third objective, we  reviewed OMB\u2019s guidance for the 2013 PortfolioStat and interviewed  OMB\u2019s PortfolioStat Lead regarding plans for improving the PortfolioStat  process. In addition, we analyzed the information obtained from our  sources and the results of our analyses for our first two objectives to  determine whether OMB\u2019s plans for improving PortfolioStat addressed the  issues we identified.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2012 to November  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Further, we found that OMB guidance to agencies on how  to report their IT investments did not ensure complete reporting or  facilitate the identification of duplicative investments. Specifically,  agencies differed on what investments they included as an IT investment,  and OMB\u2019s guidance requires each investment to be mapped to a single  functional category. As a result, agencies\u2019 annual IT investments were  likely greater that the $79 billion reported in fiscal year 2011 and OMB\u2019s  ability to identify duplicative investments was limited. Further, we found  that several agencies did not routinely assess operational systems to  determine if they were duplicative. We recommended, among other  things, that OMB clarify its guidance to help agencies better identify and  categorize their IT investments and require agencies to report the steps  they take to ensure that their IT investments are not duplicative. OMB  agreed with these recommendations.", "More recently, we reported on efforts at the Departments of Defense,  Energy, and Homeland Security to identify duplicative IT investments.  More specifically, we noted that although Defense, Energy, and  Homeland Security use various investment review processes to identify  duplicative investments, 37 of our sample of 810 investments were  potentially duplicative at Defense and Energy. These investments  accounted for about $1.2 billion in spending for fiscal years 2007 through  2012. We also noted that investments were, in certain cases,  misclassified by function, further complicating agencies\u2019 ability to identify  and eliminate duplicative investments. We recommended that Defense  and Energy utilize transparency mechanisms, such as the IT Dashboard  to report on the results of their efforts to identify and eliminate potentially  duplicative investments. The agencies generally agreed with this  recommendation.", "We have also reported on the value of portfolio management in helping to  identify duplication and overlap and opportunities to leverage shared  services. For example, we have reported extensively on various agencies\u2019  IT investment management capabilities by using GAO\u2019s IT Investment  Management Framework, in which stage 3 identifies best practices for  portfolio management, including (1) creating a portfolio which involves,  among other things, grouping investments and proposals into predefined  logical categories so they can be compared to one another within and  across the portfolio categories, and the best overall portfolio can then be  selected for funding, and (2) evaluating the portfolio by monitoring and  controlling it to ensure it provides the maximum benefits at a desired cost  and an acceptable level of risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Established PortfolioStat to Help Agencies Reduce Duplication and Achieve Cost Savings", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the proliferation of duplicative and low-priority IT investments  within the federal government and the need to drive efficiency, OMB  launched the PortfolioStat initiative in March 2012, which requires 26  agencies to conduct an annual agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among  other things, reduce commodity IT spending and demonstrate how their  IT investments align with the agency\u2019s mission and business functions.  Toward this end, OMB defined 13 types of commodity IT investments in  three broad categories:   (1) Enterprise IT systems, which include e-mail; identity and access  management; IT security; web hosting, infrastructure, and content; and  collaboration tools.

Although OMB has issued guidance and required agencies to report on  actions taken to implement it, this has not been sufficient to ensure that  agency COOs address the issue of CIO authority at their respective  agencies. As a result, agencies are hindered in addressing certain  responsibilities set out in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which  established the position of CIO to advise and assist agency heads in  managing IT investments. Until the Director of OMB and the Federal CIO  require agencies to fully disclose limitations their CIOs may have in  exercising the authorities and responsibilities provided by law and OMB\u2019s  guidance, OMB may lack crucial information needed to understand and  address the factors that could prevent agencies\u2019 from successfully  implementing the PortfolioStat initiative.", "Investments reflected in agencies\u2019 enterprise architecture: Twenty  one of the 26 agencies reported that 100 percent of their IT investments  are reflected in their agency\u2019s EA, while the remaining 5 agencies  reported less than 100 percent: Commerce (90 percent), Justice (97  percent), State (40 percent), National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (17 percent), and U.S. Agency for International  Development (75 percent). According to OMB guidance, agencies must  support an architecture with a complete inventory of agency information  resources, including stakeholders and customers, equipment, systems,  services, and funds devoted to information resources management and  IT, at an appropriate level of detail.

In addition, the  TechStat model is consistent with government and industry best practices  for overseeing IT investments, including our own guidance on IT  investment management processes. Consistent with these survey  responses, in June 2013 we reported that the number of TechStat  sessions held to date was relatively small compared to the current  number of medium- and high-risk IT investments at federal agencies.

First, reported limitations in CIOs exercising  authority over the IT portfolios at six of the agencies suggests that more  needs to be done to empower CIOs to improve management and  oversight of agency IT resources. Second, not including all IT investments  in their EA or developing complete commodity IT baselines limits  agencies\u2019 ability to identify further opportunities for reducing wasteful,  duplicative, or low-value investments. Third, not addressing key elements  in action plans for implementing the PortfolioStat initiative increases the  likelihood that agencies will not achieve all the intended benefits. Finally,  following through on commitments to migrate or consolidate investments  is critical to ensuring accountability for results.

Particular attention should be paid to the Departments of  Health and Human Services, and State; the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration; the Office of Personnel Management; and the U.S.  Agency for International Development, which reported specific limitations  with the CIO\u2019s authority.", "In addition, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Management  and Budget direct the Federal Chief Information Officer to  require that agencies (1) state what actions have been taken to  ensure the completeness of their commodity IT baseline information  and (2) identify any limitation with this information as part of integrated  data collection quarterly reporting; require agencies to report on the progress of their two consolidation  efforts that were to be completed by December 2012 as part of the  integrated data collection quarterly reporting; disclose the limitations of any data reported (or disclose the  parameters and assumptions of these data) on the agencies\u2019  consolidation efforts and associated savings and cost avoidance; require that agencies report on efforts to address action plan items as  part of future PortfolioStat reporting; and Improve transparency of and accountability for PortfolioStat by  publicly disclosing planned and actual data consolidation efforts and  related cost savings by agency.", "We are also making 58 recommendations to 24 of the 26 departments  and agencies in our review to improve their implementation of  PortfolioStat requirements. Appendix IV contains these  recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OMB and the 26 executive agencies  in our review for comment and received responses from all 27. Of the 27,  12 agreed with our recommendations directed to them, 5 disagreed or  partially disagreed with our recommendations directed to them, 4  provided additional clarifying information, and 6 (the Departments of  Education, Labor, Transportation, and Treasury; the Small Business  Administration; and the U.S. Agency for International Development)  stated that they had no comments. Several agencies also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The  agencies\u2019 comments and our responses are summarized below.", "In e-mail comments from the Federal Chief Information Officer, OMB  generally agreed with three of our recommendations and disagreed  with three. Specifically, OMB agreed with the recommendation to  require agencies to disclose limitations their CIOs might have in  exercising the authorities and responsibilities provided by law and  OMB guidance but stated that it had already addressed this issue as  part of its fiscal year 2013 PortfolioStat process. Specifically,  according to OMB, its fiscal year 2013 PortfolioStat guidance  required agencies to describe how their policies, procedures, and  authorities implement CIO authorities, consistent with OMB  Memorandum 11-29, as part of either the information resources  management plan or enterprise roadmap they were instructed to  submit. OMB stated that it reviewed and analyzed agencies\u2019  responses and discussed limitations to CIOs\u2019 authorities directly with  agencies during the PortfolioStat sessions in cases where it  determined that such limitations existed. However, OMB did not  provide documentation supporting its reviews or discussions with  agencies. In addition, as we note in our report, requiring agencies to  fully disclose limitations their CIOs may have in exercising the  authorities and responsibilities provided by law and OMB guidance  should provide OMB information crucial to understanding and  addressing the factors that could prevent agencies from successfully  implementing the PortfolioStat initiative. For these reasons, we are  maintaining our recommendation.", "OMB stated that it agreed with our recommendation to require that  agencies (1) state what actions have been taken to ensure the  completeness of their commodity IT baseline information and (2)  identify any limitations with this information as part of the integrated  data collection quarterly reporting. It acknowledged the value in  ensuring the completeness and in understanding the limitations of  agency-produced artifacts and stated it would continue to dedicate  resources to validating agency savings associated with federal IT  reform efforts prior to presenting these savings to Congress. OMB  also stated that it would modify its analytical process to cite these  limitations when producing PortfolioStat reports in the future.", "OMB generally agreed with the recommendation to require agencies  to report on the progress of the two consolidation efforts they were to  complete by December 2012 and stated that, to the extent feasible, it  would dedicate resources to analyzing this information.", "OMB disagreed with our recommendation to disclose the limitations of  any data reported on the agencies\u2019 consolidation efforts and  associated cost savings and avoidance, stating that it had disclosed  limitations on data reported and citing three instances of these efforts.  While we acknowledge that OMB reported limitations of data  regarding consolidation efforts in these cases, the information  reported did not provide stakeholders and the public with a complete  understanding of the information presented. For example, OMB did  not disclose that information from the departments of Defense and  Justice was not included in the consolidation estimates reported,  which, considering the scope of Defense\u2019s efforts in this area (at least  $3.2 billion), is a major gap. As noted in our report, OMB\u2019s disclosure  of limitations of or qualifications to the data it reports would provide  the public and other stakeholders with crucial information needed to  understand the status of PortfolioStat and agency progress in meeting  the goals of the initiative. Therefore, we stand by our  recommendation.", "OMB also disagreed with our recommendation to require agencies to  report on efforts to address action plan elements as part of future  OMB reporting, stating that it had found that 24 of 26 agencies had  completed their plans. OMB further stated that it continuously follows  up on the consolidation efforts identified in the plans and, where  savings have been identified, reports this progress to Congress on a  quarterly basis. However, our review of the 26 agency action plans  found 26 instances where a required element (e.g., consolidation of  commodity IT spending under the CIO) was not addressed and 26  instances where a required element was only partially addressed--an  assessment with which agencies agreed. As noted in our report,  addressing all the required elements would better position agencies to  fully realize the intended benefits of the PortfolioStat initiative, and  they should therefore be held accountable for reporting on them as  required in OMB memo M-12-10. Accordingly, we stand by our  recommendation.", "Finally, OMB disagreed with our recommendation to improve  transparency and accountability for PortfolioStat by disclosing  consolidation efforts and related cost savings by agency. Specifically,  OMB stated that this recommendation does not adequately account  for the work it currently performs to ensure accountability for and  transparency of the process through its quarterly reporting of identified  savings to Congress. It further stated that some details are  deliberative or procurement sensitive and it would therefore not be  appropriate to disclose them. However, while OMB currently reports  realized savings by agency on a quarterly basis, these savings are not  measured against planned savings. Doing this would greatly enhance  Congress\u2019s insight into agencies\u2019 progress and hold them accountable  for reducing duplication and achieving planned cost savings and  would not require reporting deliberative or procurement-sensitive  information. Therefore, we stand by our recommendation.", "In written comments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture concurred  with the content of our report. The department\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix V.", "In written comments, the Department of Commerce concurred with  our recommendations but disagreed with our statement that the CIO  only has explicit authority over major IT investments. Commerce cited  a June 21, 2012, departmental memo on IT portfolio management that  it believes provides the CIO with explicit authority to review any IT  investment, whether major or non-major. Our statement regarding the  limitations on the CIO\u2019s authority was based on information reported  by the department to OMB in May 2012 and confirmed with officials  from the Commerce Office of the CIO during the course of our review.  However, we agree that the June 2012 memo provides the CIO with  explicit authority to review all IT investments. Accordingly, we have  removed the original statement noting limitations from the report and  also removed Commerce from the list of departments OMB should  require to disclose CIO limitations. The Department of Commerce\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix VI.", "In its written response, the Department of Defense provided  comments for both the department and the Army Corps of Engineers.  It concurred with one of the three recommendations made to Defense,  partially concurred with another and disagreed with the third.  Specifically, the department concurred with our recommendation to  obtain support from the relevant component agencies for the  estimated savings for fiscal years 2013 to 2015 for the data center  consolidation, enterprise software purchasing, and General Fund  Enterprise Business System initiatives. It partially concurred with our  recommendation to develop a complete commodity baseline, stating  that the department has efforts under way to further refine the  baseline. Since these efforts have not yet been completed, we are  maintaining our recommendation. The department did not concur with  our recommendation to fully describe the consolidation of commodity  IT spending under the CIO in future OMB reporting. The department  stated that it did not intend to follow OMB\u2019s guidance to consolidate  commodity IT spending under the CIO because this approach would  not work within the department\u2019s federated management process.  However, our recommendation was not to implement OMB\u2019s  guidance, but rather to address the element in the plan as required by  either describing the steps it will take to implement it or explaining why  it will not or cannot implement it. DOD did neither of these and instead  was silent on the subject. We therefore stand by our recommendation.  The department concurred with both of the recommendations we  made to the Army Corps of Engineers. The department\u2019s comments  are reprinted in appendix VII.", "In written comments, the Department of Energy concurred with our  recommendation to fully describe PortfolioStat action plan elements in  future OMB reporting and stated that the department was committed  to increasing the CIO\u2019s oversight and authority for federal commodity  IT investments. The department also noted that our statement that the  \u201cdepartment has no direct authority over IT investments in two semi- autonomous agencies (the National Nuclear Security Administration  and the Energy Information Administration)\u201d should be clarified to say  that it is the department CIO who does not have this authority. We  found support for this clarification in documentation we had already  received and therefore made it as requested. The department\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix VIII.", "In written comments, the Environmental Protection Agency generally  agreed with two of the three recommendations we made and  generally disagreed with the third. Specifically, the Environmental  Protection Agency generally agreed with our recommendations to (1)  fully describe three PortfolioStat action plan elements and (2) report  on the agency\u2019s progress in consolidating the managed print services  and strategic sourcing of end user computing to shared services as  part of the OMB integrated data collection quarterly reporting until  completed. The agency disagreed with our recommendation to  develop a complete commodity IT baseline, stating that it had  provided a complete baseline to OMB on August 31, 2012, and had  also reported to us during our review that the information was current  and complete at the time of submission. During our review, we found  that the Environmental Protection Agency did not have a process in  place to ensure the completeness of the information in the baseline.  Without appropriate controls and processes in place to confirm this,  the Environmental Protection Agency cannot be assured that its data  are complete. We therefore stand by our recommendation. The  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix IX.", "In written comments, the General Services Administration agreed with  our findings and recommendations and stated it would take action as  appropriate. The agency\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix X.", "In written comments, the Department of Homeland Security disagreed  with our recommendation to fully describe its efforts related to  consolidating commodity IT spending under the CIO in future OMB  reporting, stating that the department had already addressed this  recommendation. Specifically, the department stated that it had  included updated information on this topic in its fiscal year 2013  Information Resources Management Plan that was submitted to OMB  in May 2013. We reviewed the Information Resources Management  Plan and agree that it addresses our recommendation. We therefore  removed the recommendation from the report. The department\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix XI.", "In written comments, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development concurred with our recommendations and stated it  would provide more definitive information with timelines once the final  report had been issued. The department\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix XII.", "In e-mail comments, the Department of the Interior\u2019s GAO Audit  Liaison stated that the department generally concurred with our  findings and recommendations. However, the department  recommended revising the criteria we used to assess whether  agencies met the requirement to develop a commodity IT baseline  (depicted in table 1) to reflect whether or not an agency had  developed a baseline instead of whether that baseline was complete.  The department stated that a validation was not being performed on  how all agencies responded to the question and agencies that  answered truthfully were being penalized for responding honestly. We  recognize that agencies were not required to report on the  completeness of the commodity IT baseline information they  submitted to OMB; for this reason, we have recommended that OMB  require agencies to state what actions have been taken to ensure the  completeness of their commodity IT baseline information and identify  any limitations with this information as part of the integrated data  collection quarterly reporting.", "In e-mail comments, an official from the Department of Justice\u2019s Audit  Liaison Group stated that all references to the department were  factually correct.", "In written comments, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration concurred with our recommendations and noted the  agency will take actions to address them.

Regarding our recommendation to complete  the consolidation of e-mail services to shared services, the agency  stated that this effort was completed in August 2013. After reviewing  additional documentation provided, we agree that the agency has met  the requirement. We modified the report as appropriate, and removed  the recommendation. The National Science Foundation\u2019s comments  are reprinted in appendix XV.", "In e-mail comments, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s GAO  Audit Liaison stated that the agency was generally in agreement with  our report.", "In written comments, the Office of Personnel Management concurred  with our recommendations and noted that the agency will provide  updated information on efforts to address them to OMB on November  30, 2013. The agency\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XVI.", "In written comments, the Social Security Administration agreed with  one recommendation and disagreed with the other. The agency  disagreed with our recommendation to develop a complete commodity  IT baseline, stating that it believed its commodity baseline data to be  complete and accurate. However, our review found that the Social  Security Administration did not have a process in place to ensure the  completeness of the information in the baseline. Without appropriate  controls and processes in place to confirm the completeness of data,  the Social Security Administration cannot be assured that its data are  complete. The agency also acknowledged that it needed to document  a process for demonstrating the completeness of its baseline data.  Consequently, we stand by our recommendation. The Social Security  Administration\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XVII.", "In written comments, the Department of State stated that it concurred  with our report and would develop specific responses to each of the  three recommendations we made once the report is published.  However, related to our recommendation to complete the  consolidation of the Foreign Affairs Network and content publishing  and delivery services, the department stated that it has already  consolidated more than two commodity IT areas per OMB  Memorandum M-11-29. While we acknowledge that it has made  efforts in this area, during our review the department changed what it  considered the two commodity areas to be consolidated by December  2012 several times before stating that the two efforts were the Foreign  Affairs Network and content publishing and delivery services. Based  on this determination, we assessed the status of these two efforts and  confirmed that neither had been completed as of August 2013. In  addition, the department did not provide any documentation to support  that it had consolidated more than two commodity IT areas. We  therefore stand by our recommendation. The Department of State\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix XVIII.", "In written comments, the Department of Veterans Affairs concurred  with our four recommendations, stating the department is taking steps  to manage its investment portfolio more effectively and has developed  an action plan to address each recommendation.

These requirements included (1) designating a  lead for the initiative; (2) completing a high-level IT portfolio survey; (3)  establishing a commodity IT baseline; (4) holding a PortfolioStat session;  (5) submitting a final plan to consolidate commodity IT; (6) migrating at  least two duplicative commodity IT services by December 31, 2012; (7)  and documenting lessons learned. For the final plan to consolidate  commodity IT, we reviewed agency plans to determine whether each  element required in the plan was fully addressed. A \u201cpartially\u201d rating was  given if the plan addressed a portion but not all of the information required  in the element. In addition, we obtained a briefing book which OMB  provided to the agencies that, among other things, summarized the  agencies\u2019 commodity IT baseline data. We assessed the reliability of  OMB\u2019s reporting of these data through interviews with OMB officials  regarding their processes for compiling the briefing books and used the  briefing books to describe the federal investment in commodity IT at the  time of the 2012 PortfolioStat. We also assessed the reliability of  agencies\u2019 commodity IT baseline data by reviewing the processes  agencies described they had in place to ensure that all investments were  captured in the baseline. We identified issues with the reliability of the  agencies\u2019 commodity IT baseline data and have highlighted these issues  throughout this report, as appropriate.", "For objective two, we selected five agencies with (1) high fiscal year IT  expenditure levels (based on information reported on the OMB\u2019s IT  dashboard); (2) a mix of varying IT and CIO organizational structures  (centralized vs. decentralized); and (3) a range of investment  management maturity levels based on knowledge gathered from prior  work and reported results of PortfolioStat sessions. In addition, to the  extent possible, we avoided selecting projects that were the subject of  another engagement underway. The agencies selected are the  Departments of Agriculture, Defense, the Interior, the Treasury, and  Veterans Affairs. To evaluate the selected agencies\u2019 plans for making  portfolio improvements and achieving associated cost savings, we  obtained and analyzed agencies\u2019 action plans to consolidate commodity  IT, and other relevant documentation, and interviewed relevant agency  officials to compile a list of planned portfolio improvements and determine  the processes agencies used to identify these portfolio improvements. We  determined the extent to which these processes included using (1) the  agency enterprise architecture and (2) a valuation model, which OMB  recommended in its guidance to assist in analyzing portfolio information  and developing action plans. In addition, we assessed the reliability of the  cost savings and avoidance estimates by obtaining and analyzing the  support for the estimates for the two efforts that were to be migrated by  December 2012 and the two efforts with the highest anticipated savings  between fiscal years 2013 and 2015.
