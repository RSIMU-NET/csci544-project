GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent to which SBA addressed the Act's requirements, and (2) how SBA's response to major disasters in 2008 aligned with key components of its June 2007 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). GAO reviewed the Act, as well as SBA information on requirements addressed and steps taken, including the DRP, various reports to Congress, and policy memoranda.

SBA officials told GAO the agency has not yet completely addressed some provisions that require new regulations because to do so, the agency must make extensive changes to current programs or implement new programs. For two requirements that will involve private lenders, SBA plans to implement pilots before finalizing regulations. SBA has not yet addressed the Act's requirements for region-specific marketing and outreach and ensured that Disaster Loan Program information is readily available to regional entities, such as Small Business Development Centers (SBDC). By doing so, SBA could leverage the efforts and capacity of local resources and emergency management groups, and ensure that it and they will be better prepared for future disasters. Also, as of June 2009, SBA had not met deadlines to issue an annual report to Congress or an updated DRP. Failure to do so can lead to a lack of transparency on the agency's progress in reforming the program and limit its ability to adequately prepare for and respond to disasters. Furthermore, SBA did not have an implementation plan for addressing the remaining requirements. SBA's initial response after the 2008 Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike aligned with certain components of its initial DRP, such as using technology and outreach efforts to ensure timely assistance. The individuals GAO interviewed and results from SBA's 2008 Disaster Loan Program Customer Satisfaction Survey provided some positive feedback about SBA's performance following recent disasters. However, interviewees and survey results indicated areas for improvement; in particular, both indicated that application paperwork was burdensome and that the application process needed improvement. SBA officials told GAO that they have been taking steps to improve the application process, but did not provide documentation of such efforts. As a result, it did not appear to have any formal process for identifying problems in the application process and making needed improvements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["While the Small Business Administration (SBA) is known primarily for its  financial support of small businesses, the agency also plays a critical role  in assisting the victims of natural and other declared disasters. Since the  agency\u2019s inception in 1953, SBA has approved more than $46 billion in  disaster loans for homeowners, businesses, and nonprofit organizations.  SBA provides financial assistance through its Disaster Loan Program to  help homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofits recover  from disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and terrorist attacks. After  the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes (Katrina, Rita, and Wilma), SBA faced an  unprecedented demand for disaster loans, while also being confronted  with a significant backlog of applications; therefore, hundreds of  thousands of loans were not disbursed in a timely way. Many criticized  SBA for what was perceived to be a slow and confusing response to the  disasters. As a result, Congress and SBA agreed that the program needed  significant improvements. Since then, SBA has taken several steps to  reform its Disaster Loan Program, which include developing a Disaster  Recovery Plan (DRP), creating an online loan application, and increasing  the capacity of its Disaster Credit Management System (DCMS). In June  2008, Congress enacted the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan  Improvements Act to expand steps taken by SBA and require new  measures to ensure that SBA is prepared for future catastrophic disasters.", "In response to your request, this report examines reforms made to SBA\u2019s  Disaster Loan Program and the impact those reforms had following recent  disasters. Specifically, this report discusses (1) the extent to which SBA  addressed the requirements of the Small Business Disaster Response and  Loan Improvements Act of 2008 (Act), and (2) how SBA\u2019s response,  following the major disasters of 2008, aligned with key components of its  June 2007 DRP.", "To determine the extent to which SBA addressed the requirements of the  Act, we identified and analyzed the requirements and related statutory  deadlines; obtained information about SBA\u2019s completed, current, and  planned reform efforts; reviewed documents and progress reports to  determine if requirements had been addressed and deadlines were met;  interviewed officials and obtained information on what, if any, challenges  exist that may affect SBA\u2019s ability to implement certain requirements; and  interviewed officials to obtain information about next steps and resources  that the agency identified as needed to address any remaining  requirements. To assess how SBA\u2019s response following the major disasters  of 2008 aligned with key components of its DRP, we conducted site visits  in Iowa and Texas, and obtained information on how SBA\u2019s performance  in the aftermath of the 2008 Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike was viewed.  We interviewed SBA and Small Business Development Center (SBDC)  officials, state and local officials, and representatives of local Chambers of  Commerce, economic development organizations, and affected small  business owners about what worked well and suggested improvements to  SBA\u2019s disaster loan processes. We also reviewed results from a survey of  SBA loan applicants on their satisfaction with SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan  Program in 2008. Finally, we compared data for the 2008 disasters with  agency performance goals. Appendix I contains a detailed description of  our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2008 through July  2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

SBA does not provide disaster grants; rather, this financial assistance  generally is available in the form of direct, low-interest loans and is the  only SBA program not limited to small businesses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of Disaster Loans and Application and Disbursement Process", "paragraphs": ["A Presidential disaster declaration puts into motion long-term federal  recovery programs, such as the Disaster Loan Program, but SBA is not a  \u201cfirst responder\u201d after a disaster. Rather, local government emergency  services assume the role of first responders, with help from state and  volunteer agencies. For catastrophic disasters, and if a governor requests  it, federal resources can be mobilized through the U.S. Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for  search and rescue, electrical power, food, water, shelter, and other basic  human needs. SBA typically responds to a disaster within 3 days by  sending ODA field staff to the affected area to begin providing public  information about SBA\u2019s services.", "Once a disaster is declared, SBA, by law, is authorized to make two types  of disaster loans: (1) physical disaster loans, and (2) economic injury  disaster loans. Physical disaster loans are for the permanent rebuilding  and replacement of uninsured or underinsured disaster-damaged property.", "That is, SBA provides loans to cover repair costs that FEMA or other  insurance has not already fully compensated or covered. The loans are  intended for repair or replacement of the disaster victim\u2019s damaged  property to its pre-disaster condition. Interest rates are periodically  adjusted and SBA calculates rates after each disaster. By law, the interest  rates depend on whether each applicant has credit available elsewhere. If  SBA determines the applicant is unable to borrow from non-government  sources or does not have sufficient funds, then the applicant is considered  to not have credit available elsewhere. SBA offers two levels of interest  rates, a low rate for applicants who have no credit available elsewhere and  a higher rate for applicants with credit available elsewhere. Economic  injury disaster loans provide small businesses, including agricultural  cooperatives and private nonprofit organizations, with necessary working  capital until normal operations can resume after a disaster. Loan funds are  intended to cover operating expenses small businesses could have paid  had the disaster not occurred. The interest rates on an economic injury  disaster loan cannot exceed 4 percent (see table 1).", "Immediately following a disaster, SBA public information officers are  responsible for providing information and outreach to victims about SBA\u2019s  Disaster Loan Program and SBA customer service representatives are  available to help home and business owners complete loan applications.  However, certain restrictions and guidelines apply to SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan  Program. For example, individuals must first register with FEMA and  obtain a registration number before SBA can issue an application. SBA has  separate applications for home and business loans and offers these  applications in both paper and electronic form. Furthermore, SBA only  will make a disaster loan if there is reasonable expectation that the loan  can be repaid\u2014loan applicants must have a credit history acceptable to  SBA and demonstrate their ability to repay all outstanding loans. They  must also apply within certain time frames. Typically, loan applications for  physical disaster loans must be received by SBA within 60 days from the  date of the disaster declaration, while applications for economic injury  disaster loans must be received within 9 months. In addition, SBA  generally requires collateral for all loans greater than $14,000, recently  increased from $10,000 pursuant to section 12065 of the Act.", "Once SBA receives a completed loan application, staff in its Loan  Processing and Disbursement Center review eligibility, check credit, and  calculate repayment ability. Applicants declined at this stage always  receive notification in writing from SBA. The letter provides reasons for  the declination and advises the applicant of its reconsideration rights.  Applications that are not declined are assigned to an SBA loss verifier,  who is responsible for contacting each applicant to make an appointment  to verify the physical losses and estimate a dollar value for damaged real  estate and personal property. Next, staff underwrite the application and  review in greater depth the applicant\u2019s credit history, repayment ability,  and eligibility. Unless the application is withdrawn, SBA processes each  loan application to an approved or declined status.", "SBA notifies approved applicants and makes arrangements to execute the  loan closing. Before SBA can make any disbursements, the borrower must  execute loan closing documents and return them to SBA within 60 days.  Upon receipt of the closing documents, SBA issues the first disbursement  of the unsecured portion of the loan\u2013\u2013up to $14,000 for physical disaster  loans. After SBA has verified that lien requirements on collateral property  have been met, it can disburse the additional secured portion of the  physical disaster loan based on need or construction progress. Because no  physical repairs are associated with economic injury disaster loans, SBA  generally makes full disbursement for these loans once collateral and  insurance requirements are met. SBA monitors all disbursements to ensure  that loan funds are used in accordance with the loan authorization and  agreement.", "ODA and the newly created Executive Office of Disaster Strategic  Planning and Operations (EODSPO), both headquartered in Washington,  D.C., are responsible for responding to disasters, coordinating with other  disaster recovery entities, and administering the agency\u2019s Disaster Loan  Program. ODA has four field offices, which are the Customer Service  Center located in Buffalo, New York; two disaster Field Operations  Centers located in Atlanta, Georgia and Sacramento, California; and a  centralized Loan Processing and Disbursement Center located in Fort  Worth, Texas. ODA also has a Personnel and Administrative Services  Center and a DCMS Operations Center in Herndon, Virginia.  Organizationally the associate administrator of ODA reports directly to the  EODSPO chief; and the EODSPO chief reports to the SBA Administrator.

Members of Congress  found that it was necessary for SBA to develop and implement a written,  comprehensive disaster plan. Congress acted to signify the importance of  an agency-wide plan that provided guidance and procedures governing  preparations for, and response to, declarations of disasters of various  dimensions, including catastrophic disasters, by including several related  requirements in the Act. Thus, one section of the Act requires that SBA  develop, implement, or maintain a comprehensive written disaster  response plan and update the plan annually and following any major  disaster when SBA declares eligibility for additional disaster assistance.  Our prior work also revealed the need for SBA to conduct comprehensive  disaster planning. For example, as we stated in our February 2007 report,  SBA did not engage in or complete comprehensive disaster plans before  the Gulf Coast hurricanes, and this limited logistical disaster planning  likely contributed to the initial challenges the agency faced in responding.  We recommended that SBA develop time frames for completing key  elements of a disaster management plan and a long-term strategy for  acquiring office space, and assess whether the use of disaster simulations  or catastrophe models would enhance the disaster planning process. In  August 2008, SBA provided information to us on how the agency had  implemented our recommendation to use disaster simulations to enhance  its disaster planning. Other GAO reports, reports by other investigative  agencies, and disaster management experts long have stated that  comprehensive planning can help organizations prepare for potential  disasters and mitigate their effects.", "In the wake of the Gulf Coast hurricanes, SBA officials said that they  recognized the importance of disaster planning\u2014to improve planning, they  created the agency\u2019s first DRP and also conducted their first simulation.  In creating the DRP, SBA acknowledged the need for a systematic  approach to carry out the agency\u2019s disaster assistance mission and ensure  coordination, awareness, and support throughout the agency. The plan,  which was issued on June 1, 2007, was designed to provide procedures to  better handle future disasters of all sizes.

It includes requirements to improve  ODA\u2019s infrastructure, appoint an official to oversee the disaster planning  and responsibilities of the agency, and establish reporting requirements  for various reports to Congress. The Act also includes provisions to create  new SBA disaster loan programs, such as the Immediate Disaster  Assistance Program that would provide small dollar loans immediately  following a disaster and the Expedited Disaster Assistance Loan Program  that would provide expedited disaster assistance to businesses.", "The Act contains 9 provisions that establish deadlines for specific SBA  actions that range from 30 days to 1 year after the Act\u2019s enactment (see  table 2). For example, the Act requires SBA to conduct a study of whether  the standard operating procedures (SOP) for loans offered are consistent  with the regulations for administering the Disaster Loan Program and  report to Congress on the study findings within 180 days after the Act\u2019s  enactment. Additionally, the Act establishes multiple reporting  requirements for SBA.

For example, to improve the agency\u2019s disaster loan planning  and response, the agency conducted a study on the consistency between  the Disaster Loan Program\u2019s SOPs and regulations and reported its  findings to Congress.

More specifically, 1 provision provides SBA the discretion to offer  persons receiving disaster loans an option to defer repayment on their  loans and another provision provides SBA discretionary authority to  refinance Gulf Coast disaster loans. Two additional provisions only can be  triggered if the Administrator determines a disaster is a catastrophic event  and authorizes additional assistance. The statute states that the  determination is only to be made for the most extraordinary and  devastating events. Accordingly, SBA officials told us that the agency  needs to take no action unless a disaster is declared a catastrophic event  and the Administrator authorizes additional funding. Agency officials told  us SBA is able to carry out the requirements of these two sections and  stated that after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, the  agency carried out one of the requirements by issuing regulations and  permitting loans to small businesses located outside of the disaster area.", "Additionally, we found that at least 1 provision\u2013\u2013the Small Business  Bonding Threshold\u2013\u2013requires no action at this time because it would  require the agency to obtain additional appropriations.

Moreover, the existing plan does not include information on, nor is  there separate information addressing, as the Act requires in section  12063, regional marketing information. Additionally, at least 4 provisions  require SBA to either create new or make changes to existing programs.  Three of these 4 provisions require SBA to issue regulations within 1 year  of the Act\u2019s enactment, but the agency only has established regulations in  draft form and has not issued any final regulations.

Furthermore, EODSPO staff are responsible  for developing and submitting the annual report to Congress, but SBA  officials told us the office was not fully staffed in November 2008 when the  first annual report on disaster assistance was due to Congress.  Specifically, the Act requires that SBA report annually on the total number  of SBA disaster staff, major changes to the Disaster Loan Program (such  as changes to technology or staff responsibilities), a description of the  number and dollar amount of disaster loans made during the year, and  SBA\u2019s plans for preparing and responding to possible future disasters.", "Additionally, we believe that SBA has partially addressed the provision in  section 12063 mandating region-specific marketing and outreach.  However, agency officials told us that their comprehensive DRP and  Leadership Guide for Managing a Response to a Disaster include  marketing and outreach components and satisfy the Act\u2019s requirement,  and therefore, they do not believe a separate plan is necessary. While SBA  believes that this requirement has been met, the DRP and Leadership  Guide do not provide region-specific marketing information or have steps  in place to ensure that the information is available to SBDCs\u2013\u2013as required  by the Act. Specifically, the Act states the marketing and outreach plan  must (1) encourage a proactive approach to disaster relief efforts; (2)  make clear the services provided by SBA; (3) describe SBA\u2019s different  disaster loan programs, how they are made available, and the eligibility  requirements for each; (4) provide regional marketing information,  focusing on disasters occurring in each region, and likely scenarios for  disasters occurring in each region; and (5) ensure the marketing and  outreach plan is available at SBDCs and on SBA\u2019s Web site. For example,  lessons learned from the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes can provide a basis  for developing marketing information for regions that may be prone to  large scale disasters affecting large geographic areas. Based on our review,  the DRP and Leadership Guide do not include regional marketing  information, such as lessons learned from prior disasters, and it is unclear  how SBA ensures availability of the information to SBDCs and the public  through the agency\u2019s Web site. Also, as we will describe later, officials  with whom we spoke during our site visits to Iowa and Texas noted the  importance of regional marketing and outreach information and suggested  this type of information would be helpful prior to a disaster. By not  developing region-specific information in its updated plan and clear  mechanisms to share the information with SBDCs, SBA is not in  compliance with requirements of the Act, and has not fully leveraged the  efforts of regional entities, such as SBDCs and emergency management  groups, to ensure that it and they will be better prepared for future  disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Had Limited Success in Meeting Deadlines of the Act, Including Issuing An Annual Report and Updating the DRP", "paragraphs": ["SBA has had limited success in meeting the deadlines in 9 provisions of  the Act.

First, beginning in late May 2008,  tornadoes, severe storms, and flooding affected six Midwestern states  (Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wisconsin). Notices of  Presidential declarations of major disasters were issued in each state.  Flooding continued into July 2008 in some areas, with Cedar Rapids, Iowa,  being hardest hit, in terms of suffering the most physical damage and  business losses. The floods left 13 dead and damage region-wide was  estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. In addition to FEMA, state and  local emergency management agencies, the American Red Cross, and the  National Guard assisted the victims of flooding with disaster relief and  evacuation. Second, in early September 2008, a major disaster struck the  Gulf Coast states when Hurricane Ike made its way through Texas and  Louisiana. Hurricane Ike made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane near  Galveston, Texas, on September 7, 2008, and was declared a major disaster  by the President on September 13, 2008. Ike was the third most  destructive hurricane to make landfall in the United States and the third  major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season; it caused  widespread damage to some Gulf Coast areas already trying to recover  from Hurricane Gustav, which hit Louisiana on September 1, 2008.  Hurricane Ike was blamed for at least 100 deaths and damages are  estimated at approximately $24 billion.", "Based on our review, SBA\u2019s response following the 2008 Midwest floods  and Hurricane Ike aligned with certain components of its DRP, and the  agency\u2019s efforts were in accordance with the plan. Though we noted  earlier that the 2007 plan has not been updated and, therefore, has some  obsolete information, for purposes of this study, we found that the plan  addresses the major components\u2014including infrastructure, human  capital, information technology, and communications and outreach\u2014and  puts into writing a disaster assistance framework and related processes  for how the agency plans to prepare for and respond to victims of  potential disasters, and subsequently, offer assistance through its Disaster  Loan Program. For example, according to SBA, following both disasters  the agency used its organizational infrastructure and key staff in each of  its core functions to provide disaster assistance. ODA also utilized  available operational and technological support, and communications and  outreach, to help ensure that the agency would be able to provide timely  financial assistance to the disaster victims. While the 2008 disasters were  not as severe as those in 2005, the agency\u2019s performance in the aftermath  of the 2008 flooding dramatically improved over its performance in the  aftermath of the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Specifically, following the  2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, processing times for a home loan reached a  maximum of about 90 days, but in 2008 the processing time was about 5  days. Similarly, SBA took 70 days to process a business loan in 2005, but in  2008 the average processing time was about 9 days. In addition, on June  24, 2008, SBA opened a BRC in Cedar Rapids, which was co-located with  FEMA\u2019s DRC. The BRC enabled businesses owners and homeowners to  work directly with SBA staff to learn about available recovery resources  and programs, receive counseling, and receive face-to-face answers to  their questions. At the peak of its efforts, SBA reported having 194 staff  working from about 67 centers in Iowa to provide recovery assistance to  flood victims in more than 81 counties. As of June 2009, SBA had approved  more than $411 million in disaster assistance to individuals and business  owners whose homes or property were damaged by the Midwest floods.", "In addition, in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, SBA had about 116 disaster  staff in Texas and 200 in Louisiana. In Texas, particularly, SBA customer  service representatives provided assistance to Hurricane Ike victims  through 13 DRCs, two Disaster Loan Outreach Centers, and two BRCs. The  customer service representatives were available to meet individually with  disaster victims to issue loan applications, answer questions about SBA\u2019s  disaster loan program, explain the application process, and help  individuals complete their applications. Additionally, as of June 2009, SBA  had approved approximately $677 million in SBA disaster loans to Texas  and Louisiana homeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofits who  sustained damages from Hurricane Ike. Specifically, SBA provided about  $478 million in loans to more than 9,260 homeowners and renters, and  about $199 million in loans to nearly 1,640 businesses and nonprofit  organizations.", "Similar to its response following the Midwest floods, SBA took less time to  process disaster loan applications during its post-Hurricane Ike response  because of upgrades made to DCMS, an expanded disaster response  workforce, and an online electronic loan application\u2013\u2013eliminating the  need to mail an application or visit a center. As a result, the time needed to  process a home loan following Hurricane Ike averaged about 5 days and a  business loan averaged about 12 days."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA\u2019s Response to Recent Major Disasters Considered Satisfactory, but Both Our Interviewees and SBA\u2019s Survey Results Identified Areas for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Individuals affected by both disasters told us they considered the agency\u2019s  overall performance satisfactory in responding to the disasters. However,  the individuals believed some improvements could be made to SBA\u2019s  disaster loan application process. Similarly, our review of SBA\u2019s 2008  Disaster Loan Program Customer Satisfaction Survey also showed that  respondents provided some positive feedback about SBA\u2019s performance,  but they too believed that improvements were needed. During our site  visits to areas in Iowa and Texas, we obtained insights on the devastation  caused by the Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike from various state and  local government officials and small business owners, as well as their  perceptions of SBA\u2019s initial efforts. SBA District Office officials and  SBDCs affected by the disasters, as well as representatives of  nongovernmental organizations also gave their views on the disaster  recovery efforts. According to SBA and SBDC officials, state and local  government officials, nongovernmental representatives, and business  owners we interviewed in Iowa and Texas, in the days immediately  following the disasters, ODA staff reported to the affected areas,  established several BRCs, assigned knowledgeable customer service  representatives, and began providing the needed disaster assistance. The  individuals said that SBA representatives distributed loan applications and  assisted in the initial application process by answering questions,  providing guidance about the Disaster Loan Program, its eligibility rules  and requirements, offering one-on-one assistance with filling out the  disaster loan application, and accepting completed applications.", "Additionally, interviewees said SBA staff provided outreach and public  information to affected individuals and businesses about the Disaster Loan  Program. For example, to ensure that individuals and businesses knew  about available assistance, SBA staff worked with the local media in  providing television, radio and newspaper interviews, communicating  information about loan availability, and disseminating information through  various community briefings and town hall meetings. The interviewees  said SBA staff also made several visits to state and local groups, such as  the Chamber of Commerce to tell them about SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan  Program. Many of the people we interviewed said that while most  applicants used the paper application, the electronic loan application\u2013\u2013 introduced in August 2008 just prior to Hurricane Ike\u2013\u2013worked well and  they were not aware of any DCMS problems. Furthermore, many of them  were satisfied overall with SBA\u2019s initial disaster assistance efforts, and the  feedback we received on SBA\u2019s response to the disasters indicated to us  that the agency\u2019s assistance was consistent with the processes and  procedures outlined in the DRP.", "As mentioned, respondents to SBA\u2019s 2008 Disaster Assistance Program  Customer Satisfaction Survey also were somewhat satisfied with ODA\u2019s  Disaster Loan Program. Specifically, our review of the 2008 survey  results showed that ODA\u2019s aggregated customer satisfaction index score  was 55 on a scale of 100. Respondents, however, had mixed reaction program and the agency\u2019s performance in key areas such as application  processing, SBA\u2019s Customer Service Center and the disaster recovery  centers, inspection and decision processes, and loan closing. Specifically,  survey results showed applicants who were declined for an SBA disaster  loan had lower satisfaction ratings compared to applicants that were  approved for disaster loans. For example, the declined applicants\u2019 overall  customer satisfaction index was 34 as compared to approved applicants\u2019  customer satisfaction index, which ranged from 63 to 81, with  homeowners and renters generally more satisfied than business owners.  The survey results also showed that the inspection process and disaster   to the  recovery center areas were rated positively by all respondents. The  respondents noted that the DRCs were easy to locate, had convenient  hours of operation and accessible SBA staff; and rated SBA staff as being  professional, knowledgeable and helpful. Additionally, respondents rated  the SBA inspection process as an area where SBA staff excelled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interviewees and Survey Results Point to the Need for Improvements in the Application Process, but SBA Does Not Have A Clear Process with Which to Respond to Ongoing Concerns", "paragraphs": ["While SBA\u2019s response to the disasters was considered satisfactory overall,  both the individuals we interviewed and survey results point to areas for  improvement and suggested ways to increase satisfaction with SBA\u2019s  disaster assistance process. For example, some business owner applicants  we interviewed expressed concern over collateral requirements and  interest rates. They also complained about disparity between verbal versus  final written loan terms and amounts, having multiple loan officers or case  managers, and SBA not using district and branch office staff for follow up  after centers were closed in their areas. Additionally, some business owner  applicants said that the disaster loan application was too complex or  lacked adequate instructions\u2014a problem which interviewees believed  sometimes caused some applicants to withdraw their application or decide  not to apply for SBA disaster loans.", "Both the interviewees and the survey results indicated the amount of  paperwork required for the application process was burdensome, and  interviewees also expressed concerns about the timeliness of loan  disbursements. Specifically, some interviewees said that improvements  were necessary to speed up loan disbursements because some business  owners had to wait as long as 7 months after submitting the disaster loan  application to receive an initial loan disbursement, by which time a small  business could be so economically weakened that its future operations  would be in question. In terms of the survey, business loan and economic  injury disaster loan recipients were dissatisfied particularly with the  timeliness of fund disbursals after loan approval, and rated the application  process for business loans as among the areas most needing improvement.  In addition, the application and decision process were consistently among  the lower-rated performing areas.", "In addressing some of the areas in need of improvement, many business  owner applicants we interviewed suggested changes to SBA\u2019s disaster loan  application process, such as providing partial disbursements earlier in the  process and using bridge loans to help ensure disaster victims receive  timely assistance. We also consistently heard from SBDCs and state and  local emergency management agencies, the need for joint pre-planning and  disaster preparedness efforts with SBA, and more up-front information  about SBA\u2019s disaster response plan and their expected roles and  responsibilities as part of that response effort. In addition, during our  interviews, some business owner applicants complained that they had to  provide copies of 3 years of federal income tax returns, although they had  signed an IRS form 8821\u2014Tax Information Authorization\u2013\u2013which allows  SBA to get tax return information directly from IRS. Interviewees found  this process burdensome and somewhat inefficient and, as a result,  suggested that SBA change its application requirements to remove the  requirement that applicants must provide copies of tax returns. SBA  officials explained the current process for obtaining tax information from  IRS and stated that SBA does not require copies of tax returns from all  business applicants. Rather, they said that SBA requests copies on a case- by-case basis when it is unable to determine repayment ability based on  the tax transcript obtained by using IRS form 8821. However, our review  of SBA\u2019s filing requirements for business loans showed that SBA\u2019s written  procedures differed from those the officials explained. Specifically, SBA\u2019s  written requirements for business loans state that while SBA requires  business applicants to sign form 8821, applicants also must submit copies  of their tax returns. In addition to the potential paperwork burden for  applicants, the conflicting written procedures and SBA\u2019s current process  could cause confusion and inefficient processing during disaster  responses.", "Similarly, one suggestion from the ACSI report of survey results was that  SBA improve or maintain its process in high-performing areas of the loan  application process and work to improve its performance in the low- performing areas to demonstrate commitment to further improving the  process for future disaster loan applicants. For instance, areas with the  lowest impact on an applicant\u2019s overall satisfaction, such as the inspection  process and DRCs, were rated higher than other areas by all respondent  groups and those areas rated as having the highest impact on satisfaction  for most respondents\u2014the application and decision areas\u2014scored lowest  in satisfaction.", "Consequently, in reporting the results and suggestions for agency action,  SBA was encouraged to: (1) maintain its efforts in areas that were high  performing and had low impact on overall customer satisfaction, and (2)  increase its efforts to improve areas that were low performing and had a  higher impact on satisfaction.", "During our review and analysis of the 2008 customer satisfaction survey,  we found that the survey\u2019s results were not a formal part of the agency\u2019s  process for reforming its disaster loan program, or its efforts to  continually improve the application process. SBA officials were unable to  cite specific actions taken to incorporate the survey\u2019s results into efforts  to improve its disaster program, and it appears that its primary use for the  annual survey is linking it to the agency\u2019s budget and performance  accountability reports to provide an outcome measure for the Disaster  Loan Program. Additionally, apart from SBA\u2019s 2008 launch of its online  disaster loan application, we found that the agency\u2019s other disaster reform  efforts, to date, have not focused on the complexity of the disaster loan  application (particularly for business applicants), the extensive amount of  paperwork and documents required, or the timeliness of disbursements.  While SBA officials said they continually look for ways to improve the  disaster loan application, the agency does not appear to have a formal  process for addressing problem areas within its program and making  needed improvements. Consequently, it may be missing opportunities to  demonstrate its commitment to further improve the application process  for future applicants.", "Finally, some of the improvements suggested by the individuals we  interviewed are related to some requirements in the Act. For example, as  we noted earlier, the Act requires that SBA provide specific regional  marketing and outreach information and scenarios in its DRP, and include  SBDCs in preparing for future disasters. Additionally, the Act requires that  SBA coordinate with IRS, as necessary, in sharing tax records of disaster  loan applicants to ensure expedited processing of all disaster loans. As  mentioned earlier in this report, as of June, SBA has yet to address these  two requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SBA\u2019s response to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes exposed many  deficiencies in the agency\u2019s Disaster Loan Program and demonstrated the  need for reform. Since then, SBA has taken steps to improve its program.  For instance, SBA issued a DRP, adopted an electronic loan application,  upgraded the system capacity of its DCMS, improved employee training  and expanded its disaster reserve staff. With passage of the Act, Congress  also acted to transform and improve SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program and  ensure the agency is better prepared to handle future large-scale disasters.  SBA adapted its initial DRP in June 2007, which laid out a framework and  processes the agency has in place that would enable it to respond  effectively to disasters, and the Act requires that SBA have such a plan and  regularly update it. However, SBA has not addressed specifically how it  would market its Disaster Loan Program in different areas of the country,  nor adapted likely scenarios for certain regions prone to disasters.  Although SBA believes that it has addressed the requirement for marketing  and outreach in its DRP, the 2007 plan does not provide any regional  perspective, nor has the agency updated this plan since 2007. We  consistently heard from regional entities, such as SBDCs and emergency  management groups, about the need for more upfront information on  SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program and their expected roles and responsibilities  in disaster response efforts. By taking such actions, SBA could leverage  the efforts and capacity of SBDCs, as well as state and local emergency  management agencies, and ensure that it and they will be better prepared  for future events, especially in disaster-prone areas.", "SBA has taken a number of steps to address the many requirements of the  Act; however, some provisions have presented challenges for SBA in  implementing specific requirements and meeting some associated  deadlines. For example, SBA has not completely met certain requirements  and the agency does not have an implementation plan in place to ensure  the remaining requirements are addressed. Some of the changes required  by the Act, especially those requiring SBA to create new programs, will  take time to implement. It will be important for the agency to do so in a  comprehensive manner; but because the implementation process already  is behind schedule, it also will be important for SBA to ensure it has a plan  for implementing the remaining requirements and report on its progress to  Congress. Failure to produce annual reports on schedule can lead to a lack  of transparency on the agency\u2019s progress in reforming the program. Delays  in updates to the DRP also limit its ability to adequately prepare for and  respond to disasters. By continuing its efforts to address and implement all  requirements in the Act and expeditiously communicate its actions, SBA  could improve its operations for the 2009 hurricane season, build on the  lessons learned in the aftermath of the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, and  further signal its commitment to its mission of providing affordable and  timely financial assistance to help businesses and homeowners recover  from disasters.", "SBA\u2019s initial response following the 2008 Midwest floods and Hurricane  Ike aligned with certain components of its DRP, and the affected  individuals we interviewed, as well as respondents to SBA\u2019s 2008 Disaster  Loan Program Customer Satisfaction Survey were somewhat satisfied with  the agency\u2019s performance after the major disasters of 2008. However, the  individuals we interviewed and survey results both indicated areas for  improvement with SBA\u2019s disaster loan program. For instance, our  interviewees and the survey results indicated the amount of paperwork in  the application process was burdensome and cited the application  process, including tax information requirements, as an area for  improvement. As discussed in this report, while SBA has made progress,  the agency has missed opportunities to further improve its Disaster Loan  Program, and, in particular, improve the application process for future  applicants. For example, it was unclear to what extent it had a formal  process in place for addressing identified problem areas and making  needed improvements to its program.

Specifically, building on the  lessons learned from previous disasters, SBA should include likely  scenarios for certain regions prone to disasters and regional marketing  information for SBDCs, other local resources, and local emergency  management groups. In addition, SBA should make this information and  other Disaster Loan Program information readily available to these  regional entities prior to the likely occurrence of a disaster;    complete the first annual report to Congress on disaster assistance, and  adhere to the required time frames for subsequent annual reports;    expeditiously issue an updated DRP that reflects recent changes resulting  from the Act\u2019s requirements, as well as SBA\u2019s own disaster reform efforts;    develop an implementation plan and report to Congress on the agency\u2019s  progress in addressing all requirements within the Act\u2013\u2013including creating  and implementing new programs, such as the Immediate and Expedited  Disaster Assistance Programs\u2013\u2013and include milestone dates for  completing implementation and any major program, resource, or other  challenges the agency faces as its continues efforts to address  requirements and meet deadlines in the Act; and    develop and implement a process to address identified problems in the  disaster loan application process for future applicants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided SBA a draft of this report for review and comment.

We reviewed SBA\u2019s DRP and other plans issued by the agency  (i.e., SBA\u2019s ODA Field Operations, Processing and Disbursement Center,  and Customer Service Center Disaster Response Plans) to identify some of  the key components of the plans such as determining the agency\u2019s strategy  for establishing field operations, disseminating information, coordinating  with Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) and other regional  entities, and effectively processing applications, as well as the agency\u2019s  DRP that discusses its approach for being prepared for and responding to  a disaster declaration, strategy for internal and external communication,  and a description of ODA\u2019s responsibilities. In both Iowa and Texas, we  interviewed various stakeholders including SBA and SBDC officials, state  and local government officials, representatives of local Chambers of  Commerce and economic development organizations, and small business  owners to discuss what worked well, in terms of SBA carrying out key  components of their DRP, and what, if any, improvements were suggested  for SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program and processes. While our limited number  of site visits was too small for generalizing the information obtained to  assess ODA\u2019s overall ability to respond to any disaster, the observations  and perspectives expressed by the various stakeholders was sufficient to  suggest that SBA has begun institutionalizing key reforms in its disaster  program\u2019s policy and practices. Furthermore, we obtained information  about loan applicants\u2019 and recipients\u2019 satisfaction with the agency\u2019s  Disaster Loan Program and related services immediately following the  Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike.", "We also reviewed the 2008 Disaster Assistance Program Customer  Satisfaction Survey that addressed five customer segments which measure  customer satisfaction with SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program. It included four  types of loan recipients\u2014homeowners, renters, and business owners who  received physical damage and economic injury disaster loans, as well as  declined applicants. The survey questionnaire, which was developed  through a collaborative effort between the Claes Fornell International  (CFI) Group and SBA, measured overall satisfaction with SBA\u2019s program  in areas such as application processes, customer service center, recovery  center, and inspection processes. About 4,800 loan recipients and declined  applicants were included in the survey population resulting in about 570  completed responses used for analysis\u2014a response rate of about 20  percent. Further, the number of completed interviews was based on a  quota for calling among the five customer segments, with weights applied  to responses for the number of completed surveys and the number of loan  recipients and declined applicants studied. Our overall data reliability  assessment of the Customer Satisfaction survey was generally based on  discussions with SBA officials and our knowledge of the Disaster Loan  Program, publicly available information on ACSI, and our prior reports  which included analyses of past years\u2019 survey results.
