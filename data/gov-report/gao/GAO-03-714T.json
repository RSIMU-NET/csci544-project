As of January 1, 2003, the  state excise tax rates for a pack of 20 cigarettes ranged from 2.5 cents in  Virginia to $1.51 in Massachusetts (see fig.1). The liability for these taxes  generally arises once the cigarettes enter the jurisdiction of the state.", "Many states have increased their cigarette excise taxes in recent years  with the intention of increasing tax revenue and discouraging people from  smoking. As a result, many smokers are seeking less costly alternatives for  purchasing cigarettes, including buying cigarettes while traveling to a  neighboring state with a lower cigarette excise tax. The Internet is an  alternative that offers consumers the option and convenience of buying  cigarettes from vendors in low-tax states without having to physically  travel there.", "Consumers who use the Internet to buy cigarettes from vendors in other  states are liable for their own state\u2019s cigarette excise tax and, in some  cases, sales and/or use taxes. States can learn of such purchases and the  taxes due when vendors comply with the Jenkins Act. Under the act,  cigarette vendors who sell and ship cigarettes into another state to anyone  other than a licensed distributor must report (1) the name and address of  the person(s) to whom cigarette shipments were made, (2) the brands of  cigarettes shipped, and (3) the quantities of cigarettes shipped. Reports  must be filed with a state\u2019s tobacco tax administrator no later than the  10th day of each calendar month covering each and every cigarette  shipment made to the state during the previous calendar month. The  sellers must also file a statement with the state\u2019s tobacco tax administrator  listing the seller\u2019s name, trade name (if any), and address of all business  locations. Failure to comply with the Jenkins Act\u2019s reporting requirements  is a misdemeanor offense, and violators are to be fined not more than  $1,000, or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both. Although the  Jenkins Act, enacted in 1949, clearly predates and did not anticipate  cigarette sales on the Internet, vendors\u2019 compliance with the act could  result in states collecting taxes due on such sales. According to DOJ, the  Jenkins Act itself does not forbid Internet sales nor does it impose any  taxes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Federal Involvement with the Jenkins Act and Internet Cigarette Sales", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has had limited involvement with the Jenkins Act  concerning Internet cigarette sales. We identified three federal  investigations involving such potential violations, and none of these had  resulted in prosecution (one investigation was still ongoing at the time of  our work).

According to DOJ, the FBI could not provide  information on actions to investigate Jenkins Act violations, either by itself  or in connection with other charges, because the FBI does not have a  section or office with responsibility for investigating Jenkins Act violations  and does not track such investigations. Also, DOJ said it does not maintain  statistical information on resources used to investigate and prosecute  Jenkins Act offenses.", "In describing factors affecting the level and extent of FBI and DOJ  enforcement actions with respect to the Jenkins Act and Internet cigarette  sales, DOJ noted that the act creates misdemeanor penalties for failures to  report information to state authorities, and appropriate referrals for  suspected violations must be considered with reference to existing  enforcement priorities.

ATF special agents investigate trafficking of contraband tobacco  products in violation of federal law and sections of the Internal Revenue  Code. For example, ATF enforces the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking  Act (CCTA), which makes it unlawful for any person to ship, transport,  receive, possess, sell, distribute, or purchase more than 60,000 cigarettes  that bear no evidence of state cigarette tax payment in the state in which  the cigarettes are found, if such state requires a stamp or other indicia to  be placed on cigarette packages to demonstrate payment of taxes (18  U.S.C. 2342). ATF is also responsible for the collection of federal excise  taxes on tobacco products and the qualification of applicants for permits  to manufacture tobacco products, operate export warehouses, or import  tobacco products. ATF inspections verify an applicant\u2019s qualification  information, check the security of the premise, and ensure tax compliance.", "To enforce the CCTA, ATF investigates cigarette smuggling across state  borders to evade state cigarette taxes, a felony offense. Internet cigarette  vendors that violate the CCTA, either directly or by aiding and abetting  others, can also be charged with violating the Jenkins Act if they failed to  comply with the act\u2019s reporting requirements. ATF can refer Jenkins Act  matters uncovered while investigating CCTA violations to DOJ or the  appropriate U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for charges to be filed. ATF officials  identified three investigations since 1997 of Internet vendors for cigarette  smuggling in violation of the CCTA and violating the Jenkins Act.", "In 1997, a special agent in ATF\u2019s Anchorage, Alaska, field office noticed  an advertisement by a Native American tribe in Washington that sold  cigarettes on the Internet. ATF determined from the Alaska  Department of Revenue that the vendor was not reporting cigarette  sales as required by the Jenkins Act, and its investigation with another  ATF office showed that the vendor was shipping cigarettes into Alaska.  After ATF discussed potential cigarette smuggling and Jenkins Act  violations with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Alaska, it  was determined there was no violation of the CCTA. The U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Office did not want to pursue only a Jenkins Act violation, a  misdemeanor offense, and asked ATF to determine whether there was  evidence that other felony offenses had been committed. Subsequently,  ATF formed a temporary task force with Postal Service inspectors and  state of Alaska revenue agents, which demonstrated to the satisfaction  of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office that the Internet cigarette vendor had  committed mail fraud. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office agreed to prosecute  the case and sought a grand jury indictment for mail fraud, but not for  violating the Jenkins Act. The grand jury denied the indictment. In a  letter dated September 1998, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office requested that  the vendor either cease selling cigarettes in Alaska and file the required  Jenkins Act reports for previous sales, or come into compliance with  the act by filing all past and future Jenkins Act reports. In another letter  dated December 1998, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office instructed the vendor  to immediately comply with all requirements of the Jenkins Act.  However, an official at the Alaska Department of Revenue told us that  the vendor never complied. No further action has been taken.", "Another investigation, carried out in 1999, involved a Native American  tribe selling cigarettes on the Internet directly to consumers and other  tribes. The tribe was not paying state tobacco excise taxes or notifying  states of cigarette sales to other than wholesalers, as required by the  Jenkins Act. ATF referred the case to the state of Arizona, where it was  resolved with no criminal charges filed by obtaining the tribe\u2019s  agreement to comply with Jenkins Act requirements.", "A third ATF investigation of an Internet vendor for cigarette smuggling  and Jenkins Act violations was ongoing at the time of our work.", "ATF officials said that because ATF does not have primary Jenkins Act  jurisdiction, it has not committed resources to investigating violations of  the act. However, the officials said strong consideration should be given to  transferring primary jurisdiction for investigating Jenkins Act violations  from the FBI to ATF. According to ATF, it is responsible for, and has  committed resources to, regulating the distribution of tobacco products  and investigating trafficking in contraband tobacco products. A change in  Jenkins Act jurisdiction would give ATF comprehensive authority at the  federal level to assist states in preventing the interstate distribution of  cigarettes resulting in lost state cigarette taxes since ATF already has  investigative authority over the CCTA, according to the officials. The  officials also told us ATF has special agents and inspectors that obtain  specialized training in enforcing tax and criminal laws related to tobacco  products, and, with primary jurisdiction, ATF would have the investigative  authority and would use resources to specifically conduct investigations to  enforce the Jenkins Act, which should result in greater enforcement of the  act than in the past."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States Have Taken Action to Promote Jenkins Act Compliance by Internet Cigarette Vendors, but Results Were Limited", "paragraphs": ["Officials in nine states that provided us information all expressed concern  about Internet cigarette vendors\u2019 noncompliance with the Jenkins Act and  the resulting loss of state tax revenues.

Overall, the states\u2019 efforts to promote  compliance with the act by Internet vendors produced few results.  Officials in the nine states said that they lack the legal authority to  successfully address this problem on their own.

These efforts  involved contacting Internet vendors and U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices. Two  states had not made any such efforts.", "Six of the seven states tried to promote Jenkins Act compliance by  identifying and notifying Internet cigarette vendors that they are required  to report the sale of cigarettes shipped into those states. Generally,  officials in the six states learned of Internet vendors by searching the  Internet, noticing or being told of vendors\u2019 advertisements, and by state  residents or others notifying them. Five states sent letters to the identified  vendors concerning their Jenkins Act reporting responsibilities, and one  state made telephone calls to the vendors.", "After contacting the Internet vendors, the states generally received reports  of cigarette sales from a small portion of the vendors notified. The states  then contacted the state residents identified in the reports, and they  collected taxes from most of the residents contacted. When residents did  not respond and pay the taxes due, the states carried out various follow-up  efforts, including sending additional notices and bills, assessing penalties  and interest, and deducting amounts due from income tax refunds.  Generally, the efforts by the six states to promote Jenkins Act compliance  were carried out periodically and required few resources. For example, a  Massachusetts official said the state notified Internet cigarette vendors on  five occasions starting in July 2000, with one employee working a total of  about 3 months on the various activities involved in the effort.", "Table 1 summarizes the six states\u2019 efforts to identify and notify Internet  cigarette vendors about the Jenkins Act reporting requirements and shows  the results that were achieved. There was little response by the Internet  vendors notified. Some of the officials told us that they encountered  Internet vendors that refused to comply and report cigarette sales after  being contacted. For example, several officials noted that Native  Americans often refused to report cigarette sales, with some Native  American vendors citing their sovereign nation status as exempting them  from the Jenkins Act, and others refusing to accept a state\u2019s certified  notification letters. Also, an attorney for one vendor informed the state of  Washington that the vendor would not report sales because the Internet  Tax Freedom Act relieved the vendor of Jenkins Act reporting  requirements.", "Apart from the states\u2019 efforts to identify and notify Internet cigarette  vendors, state officials noted that some Internet vendors voluntarily  complied with the Jenkins Act and reported cigarette sales on their own.  The states subsequently contacted the residents identified in the reports to  collect taxes. For example, a Rhode Island official told us there were three  or four Internet vendors that voluntarily reported cigarette sales to the  state. On the basis of these reports, Rhode Island notified about 400  residents they must pay state taxes on their cigarette purchases and billed  these residents over $76,000 (the Rhode Island official who provided this  information did not know the total amount collected). Similarly,  Massachusetts billed 21 residents for cigarette taxes and collected $2,150  based on reports of cigarette sales voluntarily sent to the state.", "Three of the seven states that made an effort to promote Jenkins Act  compliance by Internet cigarette vendors contacted U.S. Attorneys and  requested assistance. The U.S. Attorneys, however, did not provide the  assistance requested. The states\u2019 requests and responses by the U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 Offices are summarized below.", "In March 2000, Iowa and Wisconsin officials wrote letters to three U.S.  Attorneys in their states requesting assistance. The state officials asked  the U.S. Attorneys to send letters to Internet vendors the states had  identified, informing the vendors of the Jenkins Act and directing them  to comply by reporting cigarette sales to the states. The state officials  provided a draft letter and offered to handle all aspects of the mailings.  The officials noted they were asking the U.S. Attorneys to send the  letters over their signatures because the Jenkins Act is a federal law  and a statement from a U.S. Attorney would have more impact than  from a state official. However, the U.S. Attorneys did not provide the  assistance requested. According to Iowa and Wisconsin officials, two  U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices said they were not interested in helping, and  one did not respond to the state\u2019s request.", "After contacting the FBI regarding an Internet vendor that refused to  report cigarette sales, saying that the Internet Tax Freedom Act  relieved the vendor of Jenkins Act reporting requirements, the state of  Washington acted on the FBI\u2019s recommendation and wrote a letter in  April 2001 requesting that the U.S. Attorney initiate an investigation.  According to a Washington official, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office did not  pursue this matter and noted that a civil remedy (i.e., lawsuit) should  be sought by the state before seeking a criminal action. At the time of  our work, the state was planning to seek a civil remedy.", "In July 2001, the state of Wisconsin wrote a letter referring a potential  Jenkins Act violation to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution. According to  a Wisconsin official, this case had strong evidence of Jenkins Act  noncompliance\u2014there were controlled and supervised purchases  made on the Internet of a small number of cartons of cigarettes, and  the vendor had not reported the sales to Wisconsin. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s  Office declined to initiate an investigation, saying that it appeared this  issue would be best handled by the state \u201cadministratively.\u201d The  Wisconsin official told us, however, that Wisconsin does not have  administrative remedies for Jenkins Act violations, and, in any case, the  state cannot reach out across state lines to deal with a vendor in  another state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Concerned about Internet Vendors\u2019 Noncompliance and Believe Greater Federal Action Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["Officials in each of the nine states expressed concern about the impact  that Internet cigarette vendors\u2019 noncompliance with the Jenkins Act has  on state tax revenues.

In examining a statute, such as the Jenkins Act, that is silent  on its applicability to Native American Indian tribes, courts have  consistently applied a three-part analysis. Under this analysis, if the act  uses general terms that are broad enough to include tribes, the statute will  ordinarily apply unless (1) the law touches \u201cexclusive rights of self- governance in purely intramural matters;\u201d (2) the application of the law to  the tribe would abrogate rights guaranteed by Indian treaties; or (3) there  is proof by legislative history or some other means that Congress intended  the law not to apply to Indians on their reservations.

Transferring primary investigative jurisdiction from  the FBI to ATF would give ATF comprehensive authority at the federal  level to enforce the Jenkins Act and should result in more enforcement.
