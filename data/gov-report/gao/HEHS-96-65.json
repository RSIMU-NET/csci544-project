First, the general requirements state that devices must be designed and manufactured in a way that will not compromise patient health and safety and that devices must perform as the manufacturer intended. Second, the design and construction requirements cover topics such as chemical, physical, and biological properties; labeling; radiation safety; and accuracy of measuring functions.", "The EU system relies greatly on recognized performance standards, which can be international, European, or national. Demonstrating that a device meets such standards is voluntary, but this is an acceptable\u2014and often convenient\u2014way to demonstrate that a device complies with the essential requirements.", "In reviewing medical device applications FDA uses the two criteria mandated by law\u2014safety and effectiveness. For devices entering the market through the 510(k) route, the manufacturer must demonstrate comparative safety and effectiveness, that is, the new device is as safe and effective as the legally marketed predicate device. In evaluating the safety and effectiveness of a Class III device through the PMA route, FDA must determine that the application demonstrates a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective.", "To satisfy the effectiveness requirement, a device must provide beneficial therapeutic results in a significant portion of the target patient population. The U.S. criterion of effectiveness encompasses more than the European criterion of performing as the manufacturer intended; it requires the device to benefit certain patients. For example, to market an excimer laser in the United States, the manufacturer must demonstrate not only that the laser can cut tissue from the patient\u2019s cornea, but also that the laser procedure lessens or eliminates the patient\u2019s nearsightedness. In the EU, if the manufacturer specified that the purpose of the device was to eliminate a patient\u2019s nearsightedness, it would have to demonstrate the validity of that claim. However, if the claim was restricted to the device\u2019s ability to remove tissue in a particular way, judgment of the appropriate use of the device would be left to clinicians.", "In evaluating effectiveness, FDA generally reviews an individual device on its own merits. In certain situations, however, reviewers consider whether a new device is potentially less effective than available alternative therapies. FDA\u2019s position is that the agency evaluates comparative effectiveness only when a less effective device could present a danger to the public, that is, when a device is designed to treat a disease that (1) is either life-threatening or capable of causing irreversible morbidity, or (2) is a contagious illness that poses serious consequences to the health of others."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "United States and EU Review Systems Structured Differently", "paragraphs": ["The EU gives major regulatory responsibilities to public and private bodies; in contrast FDA has sole responsibility in the United States.

The competent authority ensures that the directives are incorporated into national law, approves clinical investigations of devices, and operates the country\u2019s reporting system for adverse incidents. Additionally, the medical device directives contain a safeguard clause. This clause gives the competent authority the power to withdraw an unsafe device from the market; the competent authority can be overruled by the European Commission after consultation among all of the parties concerned.

NBs are the organizations that perform conformity assessments on medical devices of medium or high risk that require the intervention of an independent organization prior to CE marking. The NBs determine whether a device conforms to the essential requirements in the relevant medical device directive. If the device is judged to be in conformance, the manufacturer may then place the CE mark on the product and market it throughout the European Union.

In the United States, the manufacturer makes a claim regarding which class a device belongs in when it submits an application for FDA review. FDA, however, has final authority over the classification decision.

In both systems, the purpose of classifying devices is to dictate the level of control the system exerts to ensure that devices comply with the respective requirements.", "The EU directives set out a complex array of assessment procedures that manufacturers must follow to demonstrate that a device conforms to the essential requirements. A device\u2019s class determines the type of conformity assessment review the device must undergo, but the manufacturer is usually permitted to choose an assessment route from at least two options\u2014often involving two general approaches. One approach is a review of the full quality assurance (QA) system that governs every phase of the manufacture of a device, from design through shipping. Officials of a German NB told us that one goal of a full QA review is to ensure that the manufacturer has written quality control procedures for every one of these phases and that these procedures are followed. NB reviewers conduct on-site inspections as part of this process.", "The other approach consists of two components. The first is a procedure called a type examination, in which the NB physically tests a prototype of the device to determine if it meets certain standards. The type examination component is paired with a limited QA review focused only on the production phase of manufacture. This review is intended to ensure the consistency of product quality. We refer to this overall approach as the type examination route. Appendix III contains a more detailed description of the different routes of conformity assessment and the assessment requirements for different device classes.", "The EU system includes both of these device approval routes as a compromise between member states that tended to rely on one approach or the other. For example, in the UK a voluntary oversight system had emphasized full QA system review, while the type examination approach had prevailed in Germany\u2019s regulatory system.", "Both the EU and U.S. systems minimize oversight for the devices considered least risky. For EU Class I devices that do not involve a measuring function or sterile products, manufacturers may simply furnish a declaration that the device conforms to the essential requirements and maintain technical documentation that would permit review of the device. There is no NB review, but the manufacturer must register such devices with the competent authority in the country of the manufacturer\u2019s place of business. In the United States, FDA exempts selected low-risk devices from premarket notification requirements. Manufacturers must still register their devices with FDA and must comply with GMP rules.", "Most new U.S. devices fall into Class I or Class II and are evaluated for substantial equivalence to devices already on the market. FDA determines whether a device has the same intended use and same technological characteristics as a predicate device by reviewing a 510(k) application submission. If a new device has the same intended use and technological characteristics, FDA deems it substantially equivalent to a predicate device and allows the device to be marketed. Also, if a device has new technological characteristics and FDA determines that they do not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness, FDA will find the device to be substantially equivalent. If the device has new technological characteristics and raises different questions of safety and effectiveness, the device will be found not substantially equivalent. The manufacturer can then seek approval for it through the premarket approval process.", "FDA requires a PMA review for most Class III devices. This is a more rigorous review because of the device\u2019s inherent high risk or lack of established safety and effectiveness information. A multidisciplinary staff at FDA evaluates the PMA application. Nonclinical studies that the team reviews may include microbiological, toxicological, immunological, biocompatibility, engineering (for example, stress, wear, fatigue), and other laboratory or animal tests as appropriate. The team also reviews the results of any clinical investigations involving human subjects. Generally, FDA evaluates a manufacturer\u2019s tests and does not perform its own tests on products. For a small portion of PMA reviews, FDA reviewers seek advice from an advisory panel of clinical scientists in specific medical specialties and representatives of industry and consumer groups.", "U.S. device manufacturers have expressed concern that FDA asks them to submit an excessive amount of data during the 510(k) review process. The director of FDA\u2019s Office of Device Evaluation told us that FDA requires only what is necessary to establish that a device is as safe and effective as its predicate. She also told us that FDA has chosen to interpret the 510(k) requirements so that more devices can go through that review process rather than the longer PMA process. As a result, the agency needs enough data to demonstrate that those 510(k) devices meet the standard of substantial equivalence and do not raise new concerns regarding safety and effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EU Quality Assurance Approach Does Not Examine Individual Devices", "paragraphs": ["When an NB certifies a manufacturer\u2019s full QA system, the manufacturer may be able to attach the CE mark to several related products. The philosophy behind this approach is that if a company has a good design and manufacturing system, the devices it produces will be safe and perform as the manufacturer claims. Therefore, the full QA assessment route does not require the NB to conduct individual reviews of related devices that are produced under the same QA system, although the NB can do so when the situation warrants it. The certification covers the related devices, allowing the manufacturer to market all of them without going through an additional conformity assessment. Representatives of a British industry group told us that the QA approach makes it possible to continually monitor a company without testing individual items that may not be representative of the overall quality of production.", "Officials who work in the EU system told us that they expect manufacturers to choose the full QA route to conformity assessment more frequently than the type examination route. This route can be particularly advantageous for larger companies. The officials believe the type examination route is more likely to appeal to smaller companies that do not produce many product lines or a company that wants to get a particular device to market before it has time to put a full QA system in place.", "The kinds of standards manufacturers must meet during European QA reviews are similar to the GMP requirements in the U.S. system.

Under the new system, manufacturers may be required to provide clinical evidence that a device meets the essential requirements for safety; this evidence may come from either published scientific literature on similar devices or data from a clinical trial on the device under consideration. Implementation of the EU medical device directives may result in clinical trials being required more frequently than they had been in the past.", "Officials from a German NB discussed with us circumstances under which they would be likely to need data from a clinical trial to evaluate a new device under the EU directives. If the device uses an accepted technology to treat a medical indication for which use of that technology is also accepted, a clinical trial would not be necessary. If both the technology and the application are novel, however, they said they would require a clinical trial.

They said that regardless of whether a clinical trial is necessary, clinical data, based on either previous clinical trials, scientific literature, or field experience, would have to be provided.", "Although it is unclear how frequently European reviewers will ask manufacturers to perform clinical trials, FDA officials believe that clinical trials are often needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of devices undergoing PMA review.

For example, NBs may have extensive interaction with manufacturers before the review process formally begins, and they sometimes perform preliminary reviews before beginning the official conformity assessment. This could make it difficult to identify the date on which the NB\u2019s review begins.

The U.S. medical device industry has advocated giving private third parties a role in the review of medical devices, and FDA is exploring this possibility in a pilot project. Ensuring that private reviewers have the necessary independence, requisite expertise, and sufficient resources would enhance the confidence of the Congress and the American public in the integrity of the device review process.

During the 510(k) review, FDA judges whether a device is substantially equivalent to one already on the market. The premarket approval (PMA) process is reserved for high-risk devices. PMAs and PMA supplements require a more stringent FDA review, which may include the analysis of clinical data to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. In addition, manufacturers must comply with certain postmarket requirements such as reporting of certain device-related adverse events.

Special controls include performance standards, postmarketing surveillance, patient registries, and other controls as deemed necessary.

A tier I review is essentially a labeling review to ensure that the label correctly identifies the intended use of the device. Most Class I devices fall within tier I because a less rigorous scientific evaluation of these low-risk devices does not adversely affect the public health. A tier II review is a scientific and labeling review. This tier encompasses the majority of 510(k)s and select PMA supplements. A tier III review is an intensive scientific and labeling review, using a team review approach for devices utilizing new technology or having new intended uses.

To evaluate technological characteristics, FDA reviews the physical and performance characteristics of the device, such as device design, materials used, and power source. For example, in reviewing a new pacemaker lead made of polyurethane, FDA would assess performance testing information to confirm that the new lead is substantially equivalent to the predicate (or previously approved) lead. This is necessary because differences in chemical formulations of polyurethane or differences in design and assembly can affect safety and effectiveness.", "In arriving at a determination, FDA reviewers may use voluntary standards and guidance about a particular device.
