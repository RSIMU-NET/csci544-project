However, DOD minimally documented the data sources, calculations, and estimating methodologies it used in developing the cost estimate. Additionally, DOD anticipates that the new facility will become the hub of a larger medical-services-related campus, for which neither cost estimates nor time frames have yet been developed. Without a cost estimate for the facility that includes detailed documentation, DOD cannot fully demonstrate that the proposed replacement medical center will provide adequate health care capacity at the current estimated cost.

DOD guidance in effect when the facility was designedprovided that when designing medical facilities, planners should develop  patient workload factors\u2014both current and projected\u2014and use these  factors to determine the sizing requirements for the facility. While DOD  officials acknowledged that inconsistencies, gaps in documentation, and  calculation errors existed in the requirements documentation, they did not  think the identified issues alone would necessitate a revision of the facility  requirements. However, because DOD has not yet determined the effects  of the newly proposed posture changes on projected patient workload\u2014 which in turn drives the requirement for the facility size\u2014it is not known if  the inconsistencies, gaps, and calculation errors coupled with the posture  change will require DOD to revise its facility requirements.

To  project most inpatient and outpatient workload for the replacement  medical center, DOD officials used fiscal year 2010 estimated patient  workload data as a baseline. However, they used different baseline data  in different parts of the analysis. For example, in determining the number  of labor and delivery rooms, DOD officials did not use workload data from  fiscal year 2010 as the baseline. According to DOD officials, the  obstetrician workload has historically been relatively stable. Therefore,  they used the labor and delivery room workload data from the Health  Care Requirements Analysis, which had been conducted in fiscal year  2008 to support the original plan for renovating and reconstructing LRMC  and determined that the data were accurate enough for their purposes.", "Once DOD officials determined what projected workload data to use in  their calculations for the new facility, they were to use the criteria in DOD  Space Planning Criteria for Health Facilities to calculate the facility\u2019s  requirements, for example, the appropriate number of inpatient beds and  outpatient exam rooms. DOD officials generally used the formulas  provided in this document, but they applied them inconsistently when  determining the appropriate size for individual departments within the  facility. For example, the space planning criteria direct DOD officials to  divide an inpatient department\u2019s projected workload\u2014in this case, the  average daily census\u2014by a particular occupancy rate to determine the  number of inpatient beds that would be required. The criteria specify  that certain inpatient beds should be designed in modules of 4, 6, or 8  beds. DOD generally followed these criteria in calculating the number of  nursing unit medical/surgical beds, a type of inpatient bed. The criteria  specify an occupancy rate of 85 percent for inpatient medical/surgical  beds. Following this formula, DOD officials divided the projected average  daily census (48.7 patients) by 0.85. This calculation resulted in a  requirement for 57.3 beds. To conform to the modular grouping criteria,  DOD officials rounded to 60 beds.", "However, in determining the number of inpatient behavioral health beds  DOD officials deviated from these criteria. The projected average daily  census for behavioral health was 24 patients. The space planning criteria  specify a 70 percent occupancy rate for psychiatric (i.e., behavioral  health) beds when the average daily census is fewer than 25 patients,  instead of the 85 percent occupancy rate specified for nursing unit  medical/surgical beds. Nevertheless, DOD officials used an 85 percent  occupancy rate to calculate the requirement for behavioral health beds.  This resulted in a requirement for 28.2 beds\u2014rounded to 30 beds to  conform to the modular grouping criteria. According to DOD officials, they  chose to use a different occupancy rate factor because they reasoned  that since space planning criteria had not been updated to reflect the shift  to single occupancy rooms, the 70 percent rate would likely result in a  requirement for a higher number of beds. Following the space planning  criteria\u2019s guidance would have produced a requirement for 34.3 beds,  which would have been rounded to 36 beds to account for the modular  grouping criteria. As a result, the need for behavioral health beds may  actually be higher than DOD officials determined. The documentation did  not clearly convey the reasons for the deviations or adjustments DOD  officials made when applying the criteria, and as a result, decision makers  may lack reasonable assurances that the number of beds required would  be sufficient to meet the needs of the expected beneficiary population in  Europe. Although these deviations or adjustments may not adversely  affect the size of the replacement medical center, their effect when  combined with the yet to be assessed posture changes remains  unknown.", "Inadequate documentation of how facility requirements were  estimated. DOD\u2019s documentation of its processes for determining the  replacement medical center\u2019s sizing requirements did not always clearly  indicate how DOD officials had generated these requirements and  omitted details that would have helped demonstrate how DOD officials  had determined the size of the replacement medical center. For example,  DOD\u2019s planning documentation reported contradictory methods for  projecting patient workload. According to the Updated (FY10) Health Care  Requirements Analysis, DOD used three different scenarios to project the  facility\u2019s workload, resulting in a low, a midrange, and a high projection;  all three scenarios used estimated patient workload data from fiscal year  2010 as the baseline:", "Scenario A excluded the workload attributable to the conflicts in Iraq  and Afghanistan, and assumed that the change in patient workload  would continue to follow the trend set over the previous 5 years.", "Scenario B adjusted for potential future decreases in beneficiary  population, and assumed that the change in patient workload would  continue to follow the trend set over the previous 5 years.", "Scenario C assumed that the change in patient workload would  continue to follow the trend set over the previous 5 years and made  no exclusions or adjustments.", "The Updated (FY10) Health Care Requirements Analysis first reported  using Scenario B\u2014the scenario that resulted in midrange projections\u2014to  project inpatient and outpatient workload for the replacement facility.  However, later sections of the document report the use of different  methods to project patient workload. DOD officials confirmed that they  had used a combination of methods to project inpatient and outpatient  workload, and that they had used Scenario B only to validate these  projections after they had calculated them. These officials acknowledged  that the Updated (FY10) Health Care Requirements Analysis could have  better documented how these projections were developed. The lack of  clear documentation makes it difficult to understand the processes used  without extensive explanation by DOD officials.", "In addition, the Updated (FY10) Health Care Requirements Analysis  omitted details on how DOD officials developed certain data. For  example, the document does not show how DOD officials projected  inpatient workload for behavioral health beds, only noting that the  projected average daily census was 24 patients. Although the Updated  (FY10) Health Care Requirements Analysis did not document how the  average daily census was calculated, DOD officials told us that the  historical data on inpatient behavioral health workload were not sufficient  for projecting workload because LRMC\u2019s behavioral health inpatient  capacity was such that any beneficiaries other than active duty  servicemembers were referred to the German economy for treatment.  Therefore, the officials said they used another method (Scenario C) to  project workload, so that the facility would have the inpatient behavioral  health capacity to treat additional patients. The planning documentation  also does not show how DOD officials projected the number of providers  required for outpatient ambulatory departments. The Updated (FY10)  Health Care Requirements Analysis contains a table with the number of  outpatient ambulatory providers but does not show how or whether  projected outpatient workload data for the replacement medical center  were used to determine the number of outpatient providers that would be  required. These gaps in documentation make it unclear whether the size  of the replacement medical center will be adequate to meet the needs of  the beneficiary population, and when combined with potential posture  changes and previously discussed deviations or adjustments, the extent  to which they may affect the size of the facility is unknown.", "Calculation errors in the planning documentation. We also found  several calculation errors within the Updated (FY10) Health Care  Requirements Analysis report. One table in the report that shows  historical (5-year average), baseline, and projected workload for inpatient  and outpatient care had errors in the 5-year average column for inpatient   and bed days of care. When we spoke with DOD officials,  dispositionswe pointed out these errors. DOD officials acknowledged the errors and  noted that the correct numbers could be found in a separate table in the  report\u2019s appendix\u2014although the appendix table was not listed as a  reference to support the historical workload numbers. Additionally, a table  in the report\u2019s appendix, which illustrated the different projected inpatient  and outpatient workload data, calculated using the three different  scenarios, had many calculation errors in the projected outpatient  workload columns. Specifically, in calculating projected workload using  Scenarios A and B, DOD incorrectly used the 5-year average\u2014instead of  the fiscal year 2010 data\u2014as a baseline, and when using Scenario C,  DOD adjusted for potential decreases in the beneficiary population,  although this scenario did not call for such an adjustment. As a result,  outpatient workload data using Scenario B, for example, was calculated  to be 288,534 encounters instead of 328,944 (a 14 percent difference).  The projected data derived by incorrectly applying Scenario B were then  used in another table in the report\u2019s appendix to verify that the projected  outpatient provider staffing would be sufficient to treat the projected  number of outpatients. DOD officials acknowledged the error and  provided us with correct data. According to DOD officials, even though  there was a 14 percent difference in the projected outpatient workload  data, the outpatient provider staffing levels would still be sufficient.  Although these calculation errors may not adversely affect the size of the  replacement medical center, it remains unknown to what extent this error  will affect facility requirements when combined with the yet to be  assessed posture changes, previously discussed deviations or  adjustments, and gaps in documentation.", "Standards for internal controls include, among other things, control  activities.

In addition, the  cost estimate does not include costs associated with the disposition or  retirement of proposed medical center facilities at the end of their life  cycles, such as demolition or renovation costs. In addition, DOD officials  said costs associated with the disposition of the current LRMC or 86th  MDG are not included in the cost estimate. Army officials told us that the  facilities that make up the current LRMC will remain under the auspices of  the Army. These officials noted that following completion of the  replacement medical center, ownership of the current LRMC facilities will  transfer to Army Installation and Management Command. Under this  arrangement, these facilities will no longer be classified as part of the  Military Health System. Therefore, Army officials told us that any costs  associated with their disposition should not be included in the overall  estimate for the replacement medical center. The 86th MDG clinic  consists of 13 separate buildings. The remaining components that make  up the current 86th MDG clinic will be transferred to Ramstein Air Base.

Without a full  accounting of life cycle costs, management will have difficulty  successfully planning program resource requirements and making wise  decisions about where to allocate resources. Cost estimates are typically  based on limited information and therefore need to be bound by the  constraints that make estimating possible. These constraints are usually  defined by ground rules and assumptions. However, because such  assumptions are best guesses, the risks associated with a change to any  of these assumptions must be identified and assessed. Many  assumptions profoundly influence cost; the subsequent rejection of even  a single assumption could invalidate many aspects of the cost estimate.  Unless ground rules and assumptions are clearly documented, a cost  estimate will not provide a basis for developing resolutions concerning  areas of potential risk. Furthermore, it will not be possible to reconstruct  the estimate when the original estimators are no longer available.", "A well-documented cost estimate is essential if an effective independent  review is to ensure that it is valid. However, the documentation DOD  provided in support of its cost estimate did not clearly demonstrate how  facility requirements had been factored into cost elements.", "DOD\u2019s cost estimate lacked documentation that described, in detail, the  calculations performed and the estimating methodology used to derive  the cost for each element of the replacement medical center.

We also met with medical and construction  planners with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health  Affairs), the TRICARE Management Activity, U.S. Army Medical  Command, the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), the Air Force  Medical Support Agency, and the 86th Medical Group (MDG) to discuss  how they determined the size of the replacement medical center.", "To review the process used to develop the cost estimate for the facility to  determine to what extent DOD followed established best practices for  developing its cost estimate, we obtained and reviewed available cost  estimates for the proposed replacement medical center as well as  supporting documentation that was used to determine overall costs. We  evaluated this information using GAO\u2019s standardized methodology of cost  estimating best practices. For our reporting needs, we collapsed these  best practices into four general characteristics for sound cost estimating:  accurate, credible, comprehensive, and well documented. We determined  the overall assessment by rating whether DOD followed best practices  that make up each of the four characteristics. We assigned a number to  our ratings: not met = 1, minimally met = 2, partially met =3, substantially  met = 4, and met = 5. We took the average of the individual assessment  ratings to determine the overall rating for each of the four characteristics.  Criteria assessed as not applicable were not given a score and not  included in the overall assessment calculation. We met with officials from  the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the  TRICARE Management Activity, Army Medical Command, the Air Force  Medical Support Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to  our evaluation to explain our approach for reviewing DOD\u2019s cost  estimating process and to discuss project costs. We also met with these  officials to discuss the results of our evaluation. To determine the overall  costs of the replacement medical center, we obtained and reviewed  planning documents. We also met with officials from LRMC and 86th  MDG to discuss what the future plans are for the current facilities  following construction of the replacement medical center.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2011 through May 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
