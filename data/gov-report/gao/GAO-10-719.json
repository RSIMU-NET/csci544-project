The government ownership interest in these companies resulted from financial assistance that was aimed at stabilizing the financial markets, housing finance, or specific market segments. This report (1) describes the government's ownership interest and evaluates the extent of government involvement in these companies, (2) discusses the government's management and monitoring of its investments and exit strategies, and (3) identifies lessons learned from the federal actions. This work was done in part with the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) and involved reviewing relevant documentation related to these companies and the federal assistance provided.

In each case, the government required changes to the companies' corporate governance structures and executive compensation. For example, of the 92 directors currently serving on boards of these companies, 73 were elected since November 2008. Many of these new directors were nominated by their respective boards, while others were designated by the government and other significant shareholders as a result of their common share ownership. The level of involvement in the companies varied depending on whether the government served as an investor, creditor, or conservator. For example, as an investor in Bank of America, Citigroup, and GMAC, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) had minimal or no involvement in their activities. As both an investor in and a creditor of AIG, Chrysler, and GM--as a condition of receiving assistance--the government has required some combination of the restructuring of their companies, the submission of periodic financial reports, and greater interaction with company personnel. FHFA--using its broad authority as a conservator--has instituted a number of requirements and practices that involve them in the Enterprises."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government historically has intervened in financial markets  during times of economic crisis from the Great Depression to the Savings  and Loan crisis of the 1980s. During the most recent financial crisis, the  federal government has shown a willingness to intervene in private  markets after determining that national interests were at stake. From the  fall of 2008 to June 2010, eight large financial institutions and companies  have received more than $447 billion in exceptional amounts of financial  assistance, which resulted in the government having an ownership interest  in these companies. Specifically, the government is currently a significant  shareholder in five companies and acts as conservator of two housing  government-sponsored enterprises\u2014Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  (Enterprises). In addition, the government has provided financial  assistance to these companies to support the credit, insurance, and the  secondary mortgage markets through the purchase of debt and mortgage- backed securities, asset guarantees, and the extension of lines of credit.  These situations have raised questions about the appropriate role of the  federal government as a shareholder, its management of its assets, the  implications of government ownership for private markets, and the  government\u2019s plans for divesting its investments in the companies and  finding a sustainable solution to the current problems of the Enterprises.", "This report, done in part with the Special Inspector General for the  Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), looks at the extent of the  government\u2019s involvement in companies that have received exceptional  assistance from the federal government, including American International  Group Inc.

This legal framework provided the financial resources for assistance,  the federal government\u2019s authorities, and the restrictions companies were  required to comply with in exchange for the financial assistance. In  assisting the public to understand its involvement in the companies, in  May 2009 the administration published a set of core principles that are to  guide the government\u2019s management of ownership interests in private  firms. Most of the institutions that the government had or has an  ownership interest in are regulated by one of several financial regulators,  which have a role in overseeing the financial condition and operations of  its regulated entities.", "The federal government\u2019s efforts in late 2008 to stabilize the financial  markets are not its first intervention in private markets during economic  downturns. The government has previously undertaken large-scale  financial assistance efforts, including to private companies. For example,  in the 1970s and early 1980s Congress created separate financial assistance  programs totaling more than $12 billion to stabilize Conrail, Lockheed- Martin, and Chrysler, with most of the funds being distributed in the form  of loans or loan guarantees. Most recently, in response to the most severe  financial crisis since the Great Depression, Congress provided Treasury  additional authority to stabilize the financial system. In particular:  In July 2008, Congress passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of  2008 (HERA), which established FHFA\u2014the agency responsible for the  monitoring of safety and soundness and the housing missions of the  Enterprises and the other housing government-sponsored enterprises,  namely, the Federal Home Loan Banks\u2014and among other things, provided  for expanded authority to place the Enterprises in conservatorship or  receivership and provides Treasury with certain authorities to provide  financial support to the Enterprises. In accordance with HERA, on  September 6, 2008, FHFA placed the Enterprises into conservatorship  because of concern that their deteriorating financial condition ($5.4  trillion in outstanding obligations) would destabilize the financial system.  The goals of the conservatorships are to preserve and conserve the assets  and property of the Enterprises and enhance their ability to fulfill their  missions. FHFA has the authority to manage the Enterprises and maintains  the powers of the board of directors, officers, and shareholders. Treasury  agreed to provide substantial financial support so that Enterprises could  continue as going concerns to support mortgage financing, subsequently,  the Federal Reserve Board committed to a variety of activities, including  purchasing substantial amounts of their debt and securities to support  housing finance, housing markets, and the financial markets more  generally.", "In October 2008, Congress passed EESA, which authorized the creation of  TARP to, among other things, buy up to $700 billion in troubled assets,  such as mortgage-backed securities and any other financial instrument  that the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Chairman of  the Federal Reserve Board, determined that it needed to purchase to help  stabilize the financial system. EESA created OFS within Treasury to  administer TARP, which comprises a number of programs that were  designed to address various aspects of the unfolding financial crisis. Early  in the program, Treasury determined that providing capital infusions  would be the fastest and most effective way to address the crisis. In return  for these capital infusions, Treasury received equity in the hundreds of  companies that have participated in the program. In return for receiving  these capital infusions, TARP-recipients were subject to certain  requirements and restrictions, such as dividend requirements and limits on  executive compensation.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)  amended and expanded EESA\u2019s executive compensation provisions and  directed Treasury to require appropriate standards for executive  compensation and corporate governance of TARP recipients. On June 10,  2009, Treasury adopted an interim final rule to implement the law for  executive compensation and corporate governance, including limits on  compensation, providing guidance on the executive compensation and  corporate governance provisions of EESA, and setting forth certain  additional standards pursuant to authority under EESA. The requirements  for executive compensation generally include: (1) limits on compensation  that exclude incentives for senior executive officers to take unnecessary  and excessive risks that threaten the value of TARP recipients; (2)  provision for the recovery of any bonus, retention award, or incentive  compensation paid to certain executives based on materially inaccurate  statements of earnings, revenues, gains, or other criteria; (3) prohibition  on \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments accrued to certain executives; (4)  prohibition on payment or accrual of bonuses, retention awards, or  incentive compensation to certain executives; and (5) prohibition on  employee compensation plans that would encourage manipulation of  earnings reported by TARP recipients to enhance employees\u2019  compensation. The regulation required the establishment of Office of the  Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation (Special Master) to  review the compensation payments and structures of TARP recipients of  \u201cexceptional financial assistance,\u201d which includes all of the companies in  our study with the exception of the government-sponsored Enterprises.

Created in October 2008, it aimed to stabilize the financial  system by providing capital to viable banks through the purchase of  preferred shares and subordinated debentures. These transactions  generally provide that the banks pay fixed dividends on the preferred  shares, that the debentures accrue interest, and that the banks issue a  warrant to purchase common stock, preferred shares, or additional senior  debt instruments.", "The Targeted Investment Program (TIP), established in December 2008,  was designed to prevent a loss of confidence in financial institutions that  could (1) result in significant market disruptions, (2) threaten the financial  strength of similarly situated financial institutions, (3) impair broader  financial markets, and (4) undermine the overall economy. Treasury  determined the forms, terms, and conditions of any investments made  under this program and considered the institutions for approval on a case- by-case basis. Treasury required participating institutions to provide  warrants or alternative considerations, as necessary, to minimize the long- term costs and maximize the benefits to the taxpayers, in accordance with  EESA. Only two institutions participated in TIP, Bank of America and  Citigroup, and both repurchased their preferred shares and trust preferred  shares, respectively, from Treasury in December 2009.  Treasury has  terminated the program.", "The Asset Guarantee Program (AGP), was created in November 2008 to  provide a federal government guarantee for assets held by financial  institutions that had been deemed critical to the functioning of the U.S.  financial system. The goal of AGP was to encourage investors to keep  funds in the institutions. According to Treasury, placing guarantee  assurances against distressed or illiquid assets was viewed as another way  to help stabilize the financial system. In implementing AGP, Treasury  collected a premium on the risk assumed by the government that was paid  in preferred shares that were exchanged later for trust preferred shares.  Citigroup terminated its participation on December 23, 2009. Treasury has  since terminated AGP. While the asset guarantee was in place, no losses  were claimed by Citigroup and no federal funds were paid out.", "The AIG Investment Program\u2014originally called the Systemically  Significant Failing Institutions Program (SSFI)\u2014was created in November  2008 to help avoid disruptions to financial markets from an institutional  failure that Treasury determined would have broad ramifications for other  institutions and market activities. AIG has been the only participant in this  program and was provided the assistance because of its systemic  importance to the financial system. The assistance provided under this  program is reflected in the securities purchase agreements, which required  Treasury to purchase preferred shares from AIG and entitles Treasury to  dividends declared by AIG on these preferred shares and provide warrants  to purchase common stock.", "The Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP) was created in  December 2008 to prevent a significant disruption to the U.S. automotive  industry. Treasury determined that such a disruption would pose a  systemic risk to financial market stability and have a negative effect on the  U.S. economy. The program was authorized to provide funding to support  automakers during restructuring, to ensure that auto suppliers to Chrysler  and GM received compensation for their services and products, and to  support automotive finance companies. AIFP provided sizeable loans to  Chrysler and GM (including a loan to GM that was convertible into shares  of GMAC that were purchased with the proceeds).  Treasury loaned up to  $1.5 billion to Chrysler Financial, which was fully repaid on July 14, 2009.  Ultimately the government obtained an equity stake through the  restructurings and loan conversion.", "The Capital Assistance Program (CAP), established in February 2009, was  designed to help ensure that qualified financial institutions have sufficient  capital to withstand severe economic challenges. These institutions were  required to meet eligibility requirements substantially similar to those used  for CPP. A key component of CAP was the Supervisory Capital  Assessment Program (SCAP), under which federal bank regulators, led by  the Federal Reserve, conducted capital assessments, or \u201cstress tests,\u201d of  large financial institutions. Participation in SCAP was mandatory for the  19 largest U.S. bank holding companies (those with risk-weighted assets of  $100 billion or more as of December 31, 2008). The tests were designed  to determine whether these companies had enough capital to absorb  losses and continue lending even if economic and market conditions were  worse than expected between December 2008 and December 2010.  Institutions deemed not to have sufficient capital were given 6 months to  raise private capital. In conjunction with the test, Treasury announced that  it would provide capital through CAP to banks that needed additional  capital but were unable to raise it through private sources. GMAC was the  only institution determined to need additional capital assistance from  Treasury. GMAC received the additional capital assistance through AIFP  on December 30, 2009.

For Citigroup and GMAC, the common stock strengthened their capital  structure, because the markets view common equity more favorably than  preferred shares. Initially, Treasury invested $25 billion in Citigroup under  CPP and an additional $20 billion under TIP.  Treasury also entered into a  loss sharing arrangement with Citigroup on approximately $301 billion of  assets under AGP under which Treasury assumed $5 billion of exposure  following Citigroup\u2019s first losses of $39.5 billion.

In the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve  approved assistance to AIG by authorizing FRBNY to create a facility to  lend AIG up to $85 billion to address its liquidity needs. As part of this  agreement, AIG agreed to issue convertible preferred stock to a trust to be  created on behalf of the U.S. Treasury (the AIG Credit Facility Trust). This  was achieved through the establishment of an independent trust to  manage the U.S. Treasury\u2019s beneficial interest in Series C preferred shares  that, as of April 2010, were convertible into approximately 79.9 percent of  the common stock of AIG that would be outstanding after the conversion  of the Series C preferred shares in full.  While the Series C preferred  shares initially represented 79.9 percent of the voting rights, after  Treasury\u2019s November 2009 TARP investment, the amount of Series C  preferred shares voting rights to be acquired was reduced to 77.9 percent  to account for the warrant to purchase 2 percent of the common shares  that Treasury received in connection with that TARP investment.  A June  2009 20 to 1 reverse stock split adjusted the exercise price and number of  shares associated with the Treasury warrant, allowing warrants held by  Treasury to become convertible into 0.1 percent common equity.  Part of  the outstanding debt was restructured, when as noted above, Treasury  agreed to purchase $40 billion of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  (Series D) and received a warrant under TARP.

Finally, because Treasury\u2019s  ownership in the Enterprises is not part of TARP, staff outside of OFS is  responsible for monitoring these investments. Given the varied forms of  ownership interest and the complexity of many of the investments,  Treasury will likely have to develop a unique exit strategy for each  company. The divestment process, however, is heavily dependent on  company management successfully implementing strategies discussed  with their regulators and Treasury. Further, external factors, such as  investors demand for purchasing securities of these companies receiving  exceptional assistance and broader market conditions, must be considered  when implementing exit strategies. Because most of the shares are  expected to either be sold in a public offering or be redeemed or repaid  using funds raised in the public markets, the financial markets must be  receptive to government efforts.

This report also included three recommendations related to  Treasury\u2019s approach to managing its assets and divesting itself of its equity  stake in Chrysler and GM. First, we recommended that Treasury ensure  that it has the expertise needed to adequately monitor and divest the  government\u2019s investment in Chrysler and GM, and obtain needed expertise  where gaps are identified. Following this recommendation, Treasury hired  two additional staff to work on the Auto Team, which is composed of  analysts dedicated solely to monitoring Treasury\u2019s investments in the  companies. Treasury also hired Lazard LLC in May 2010 to act as an  advisor on the disposition of Treasury\u2019s investment in GM. Second, we  recommended that Treasury should report to Congress on its plans to  assess and monitor the companies\u2019 performance to help ensure that they  are on track to repay their loans and to return to profitability. In response  to this recommendation, Treasury stated that it already provides updates  to TARP oversight bodies including the Congressional Oversight Panel and  SIGTARP, concerning the status of its investments and its role in  monitoring the financial condition of Chrysler and GM and that it will  provide additional reports as circumstances warrant. Third, we  recommended that Treasury develop criteria for evaluating the optimal  method and timing for divesting the government\u2019s ownership stake in  Chrysler and GM. In response to this recommendation, Treasury stated  that members of the Auto Team are experienced in selling stakes in private  and public companies and are committed to maximizing taxpayer returns  on Treasury\u2019s investment. Treasury also stated that private majority  shareholders typically do not reveal their long-term exit strategies in order  to prevent other market participants from taking advantage of such  information. However, we note that because Treasury\u2019s stakes in the  companies represent billions of taxpayer dollars, Treasury should balance  the need for transparency about its approach with the need to protect  certain proprietary information, the release of which could put the  companies at a competitive disadvantage or negatively affect Treasury\u2019s  ability to recover the taxpayers\u2019 investment. Moreover, Treasury could  provide criteria for an exit strategy without revealing the precise strategy.", "Although GMAC is a bank holding company, it received assistance under  AIFP. While investment in GMAC was previously managed by Treasury\u2019s  Auto Team, the investment in GMAC is currently managed by other  Treasury officials. This team uses many of the same indicators that are  used for bank holding companies. For instance, to monitor GMAC\u2019s  condition, the Treasury\u2019s team views liquidity and capital levels at the  company and observes management\u2019s strategic decision making. Due to it  not being publicly traded and the challenges it faces in its transition to a  more traditional bank holding company model, Treasury is more actively  involved in managing and valuing its investment in the company.", "As of January 27, 2010, Treasury had not decided how it would divest its  GMAC preferred shares or recommended a time frame for the divestment.  The Federal Reserve and FDIC will be involved in the approval process  that would allow GMAC to exit TARP by repurchasing its preferred shares.  Treasury could recover its investment in GMAC preferred shares through  the same process used to exit its preferred equity investments in Citigroup  and Bank of America, but other options exist. For example, Treasury  could sell its preferred shares to a third party, convert its preferred shares  into common equity and sell those shares, or hold the preferred shares to  maturity.  Throughout 2009, the company continued to experience  significant losses as it attempted to follow through on its strategies as a  relatively new, independent company. As we have seen, Treasury  purchased $3.8 billion in preferred shares ($2.54 billion of trust preferred  shares and $1.25 billion of mandatory convertible preferred shares) from  GMAC on December 30, 2009, because the company could not raise capital  in the private markets to meet its SCAP requirements.", "According to Treasury officials, for its common stock in GMAC, Treasury  is continuing to explore many options to exit its investment, including an  initial public offering or other alternatives.

The Federal Reserve and FRBNY have different roles than they do  in overseeing the bank holding companies, because their relationship with  AIG is not a supervisory one but a relationship between creditor and  borrower. The Federal Reserve and FRBNY have acted to ensure that AIG  maintains adequate capital levels after it suffered a severe loss of capital in  2008 that compromised its ability to sell certain businesses and maintain  its primary insurance subsidiaries as viable businesses. A strengthened  balance sheet, access to new capital, profitability, and lower risk levels are  important in tracking AIG\u2019s progress in returning to financial health. In  order to monitor this progress, the Federal Reserve, FRBNY, and Treasury  use various indicators, including liquidity, capital levels, profit and loss,  and credit ratings. Although each of these entities monitors AIG  independently, they share information on such indicators as cash position,  liquidity, regulatory reports, and other reports as necessary. AIG is also  responsible for regularly providing periodic internal reports as specified in  the FRBNY credit agreement and the Treasury securities purchase  agreements.

Over time, more of the government\u2019s credit  exposure has been converted to equity that potentially poses greater risk  to the federal government. For example, Treasury purchased $40 billion of  preferred shares and the proceeds were used to pay down the balance of  the FRBNY Revolving Credit Facility. More recently, in December 2009,  FRBNY accepted preferred equity interest in two AIG-created special  purpose vehicles that own American International Assurance Company,  Ltd and American Life Insurance Company\u2014AIG\u2019s leading foreign life  insurance companies. In exchange, FRBNY reduced the amount AIG  owed on the Revolving Credit Facility by $25 billion. Repayment of AIG\u2019s  remaining $27 billion debt will depend, in part, on the markets\u2019 willingness  to finance the company with new funds following its return to financial  health.", "According to officials at Treasury and the Federal Reserve, AIG must  repay the FRBNY credit facility before the AIG Trust can, as a practical  matter, divest its equity shares. As a result, the AIG trustees said that they  would begin developing an exit strategy once AIG had repaid its debt to  FRBNY, which is due no later than September 13, 2013. According to the  AIG trustees and Treasury officials, while Treasury and the AIG Trust are  responsible for developing independent exit strategies, they plan to  coordinate their efforts. The Treasury team that manages the AIG  investment has been running scenarios of possible exit strategies but has  not decided which strategy to employ. A number of options are being  considered by the AIG trust for divesting the Series C Preferred Stock, one  of which is to convert the Series C Preferred Stock to common stock and  divest such common stock through a public offering or a private sale.  Treasury has multiple options available for divesting its preferred shares,  including having AIG redeem Treasury\u2019s shares, converting the shares to  common stock that would subsequently be sold in a public offering, or  selling the shares to an institutional buyer or buyers in a private sale.  According to Treasury officials, Treasury is devoting significant resources  to planning the eventual exit strategy from its AIG investments.", "When AIG will be able to pay the government completely back for its  assistance is currently unknown because the federal government\u2019s  exposure to AIG is increasingly tied to the future health of AIG, its  restructuring efforts, and its ongoing performance as more debt is  exchanged for equity. Therefore, as we noted in our April 2010 report on  AIG, the government\u2019s ability to fully recoup the federal assistance will be  determined by the long-term health of AIG, the company\u2019s success in  selling businesses as it restructures, and other market factors such as the  performance of the insurance sectors and the credit derivatives markets  that are beyond the control of AIG or the government. In March 2010, the  Congressional Budget Office estimated that the financial assistance to AIG  may cost Treasury as much as $36 billion compared to the $30 billion  estimated in September 2009 by Treasury.

Building on lessons learned from the  financial crises of the 1970s and 1980s, we identified guiding principles at  that time that help to serve as a framework for evaluating large-scale  federal assistance efforts and provided guidelines for assisting failing  companies, including the government\u2019s actions during the most recent  crisis. These principles include (1) identifying and defining the problem,  (2) determining national interests and setting clear goals and objectives  that reflect them, and (3) protecting the government\u2019s interests. The  government generally adhered to these principles during this recent crisis.  But because of its sheer size and scope, the crisis presented unique  challenges and underscored a number of lessons to consider when the  government provides broad-based assistance. First, widespread financial  problems, such as those that occurred in this crisis, require  comprehensive, global actions that must be closely coordinated. For  example, Treasury\u2019s decision to provide capital investments in financial  institutions was driven in part by similar actions in other countries.  Second, the government\u2019s strategy for managing its investments must  include plans to mitigate perceived or potential conflicts that arise from  the government\u2019s newly acquired role as shareholder or creditor and its  existing role as regulator, supervisor, or policymaker. Acquiring an  ownership interest in private companies can help protect taxpayers by  enabling the government to earn returns when it sells its shares and the  institutions repurchase their shares or redeem their warrants. But this  scenario can also create the potential for conflict if, for example, public  policy goals are at odds with the financial interests of the firm receiving  assistance. Further, the federal government\u2019s intervention in private  markets requires that those efforts be transparent and effectively  communicated so that citizens understand policy goals, public  expenditures, and expected results. The government\u2019s actions in the  recent crisis have highlighted the challenges associated with achieving  both. The government also needs to establish an adequate oversight  structure to help ensure accountability. Finally, the government must take  steps to mitigate the moral hazard that can arise when it provides support  to certain entities that it deems too big or too systemically significant to  fail. Such assistance may encourage risk-taking behavior in other market  participants by encouraging the belief that the federal government will  always be there to bail them out."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Government Generally Adhered to Key Principles When Providing Federal Assistance during the Recent Financial Crisis", "paragraphs": ["Building on lessons learned from the financial crises of the 1970s and  1980s, we identified guiding principles to help serve as a framework for  evaluating large-scale federal assistance efforts and provided guidelines  for assisting failing companies.", "Identifying and defining the problem, including separating issues that  require immediate response from longer-term structure issues.", "Determining national interests and setting clear goals and objectives that  reflect them.", "Protecting the government\u2019s, and thus the taxpayer\u2019s, interests by working  to ensure not only that financial markets continue to function effectively,  but also that any investments made provide the highest possible return.  This includes requiring concessions from all parties, placing controls over  management, obtaining collateral when feasible, and being compensated  for risk.", "During the recent financial crisis, the government faced a number of  challenges in adhering to these three principles\u2014which we identified  during earlier government interventions in the private markets\u2014when it  provided financial assistance to troubled companies. First, the scope and  rapid evolution of this crisis complicated the process of identifying and  defining the problems that needed to be addressed. Unlike past crises that  involved a single institution or industry, the recent crisis involved  problems across global financial markets, multiple industries, and large,  complex companies and financial institutions. For example, problems in  mortgage markets quickly spread to other financial markets and ultimately  to the broader economy. As the problems spread and new ones emerged,  the program goals Treasury initially identified often seemed vague, overly  broad, and conflicted. Further, because the crisis affected many  institutions and industries, Treasury\u2019s initial responses to each affected  institution often appeared ad hoc and uneven, leading to questions about  its strategic focus and the transparency of its efforts.", "During a financial crisis, identifying and defining problems involves  separating out those issues that require an immediate response from  structural challenges that will take longer to resolve. The most recent  crisis evolved as the crisis unfolded and required that the government\u2019s  approach change in tandem. Treasury created several new programs under  TARP to address immediate issues, working to stabilize bank capital in  order to spur lending and restart capital markets and seeking ways to help  homeowners facing foreclosure. While banks have increased their capital  levels and these companies have begun repaying the government  assistance, constructing relevant solutions to address the foreclosure  crisis has proved to be a long-term challenge.  The recently enacted  financial services reform legislation requires that systemically important  financial companies be subject to enhanced standards, including risk- based capital requirements, liquidity requirements, and leverage limits that  are stricter than the standards applicable to companies that do not pose  similar risk to financial stability. Also, the law creates a procedure for the  orderly liquidation of financial companies if the Secretary of the Treasury  makes certain determinations including a determination that the failure of  the company and its resolution under otherwise applicable law would  have serious adverse effect on financial stability.", "Second, determining national interests and setting clear goals and  objectives that reflect them requires choosing whether a legislative  solution or other government intervention best serves the national  interest. During the recent crisis the federal government determined that  stabilizing financial markets, housing markets, and individual market  segments required intervening to support institutions it deemed to be  systemically significant. It also limited its intervention, stating that it  would act only as a reluctant shareholder and not interfere in the day-to- day management decisions of any company, would exercise only limited  voting rights, and would ensure that the assistance provided would not  continue indefinitely. Further, Treasury emphasized the importance of  having strong boards of directors to guide these companies, as discussed  earlier. While the U.S. government developed goals or principles for  holding large equity interest in private companies, its goals for managing  its investment have at times appeared to conflict with each other.  Specifically, Treasury announced that it intended to protect the taxpayer  investment, maximize overall investment returns and that it also intended  to dispose of the investments as soon it was practicable to do so.  However, protecting the taxpayer investment may be at odds with  divesting as soon as possible. For example, holding on to certain  investments may bring taxpayers a higher return than rapid divestment.  Recognizing the tension among these goals, Treasury has tried to balance  these competing interests but ultimately, it will have to decide which  among them is most important by evaluating the trade-offs.", "Finally, protecting the government\u2019s and taxpayers\u2019 interest is an essential  objective when creating large-scale financial assistance programs that put  government funds and taxpayer dollars at risk of loss. Generally consistent  with this principle, the government took four primary actions that were  designed to minimize this risk.", "First, a priority was gaining concessions from others with a stake in the  outcome\u2014for example, from management, labor, and creditors\u2014in order  to ensure cooperation in securing a successful outcome. As we have  pointed out previously, as a condition of receiving federal financial  assistance, TARP recipients (AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, GMAC,  Chrysler, and GM) had to agree to limits on executive compensation and  dividend payments, among other things. Moreover, GM and Chrysler had  to use their \u201cbest efforts\u201d to reduce their employees\u2019 compensation to  levels similar to those at other major automakers that build vehicles in the  United States, which resulted in concessions from the United Auto  Workers on wages and work rules.", "Second, exerting control over management became necessary in some  cases\u2014including approving financial and operating plans and new major  contracts\u2014so that any restructuring plans would have realistic objectives  and hold management accountable for achieving results and protecting  taxpayer interests. For example, under AIFP, Chrysler and GM were  required to develop restructuring plans that outlined their path to financial  viability. The government initially rejected both companies\u2019 plans as not  being aggressive enough but approved revised plans that included  restructuring the companies through bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve has  also reviewed AIG\u2019s divestiture plan and routinely monitors its progress  and financial condition. Finally, as conservator FHFA maintains  substantial control over the business activities of the Enterprises.", "Third, the government sought to ensure that it was in a first-lien position  with AIG, GM, and Chrysler, which received direct government loans, in  order to recoup the maximum amounts of taxpayer funds. Treasury was  not able to fully achieve this goal in the Chrysler initial loans because the  company had already pledged most of its collateral, leaving little to secure  the federal government\u2019s loans. Treasury was however able to obtain a  priority lien position with respect to its loan to Chrysler post-restructuring.  FRBNY was able to obtain collateral against its loans to AIG.", "Fourth, the government sought compensation for risk through fees and  equity participation, routinely requiring dividends on the preferred shares  it purchased, charging fees and interest on the loans, and acquiring  preferred shares and warrants that provided equity. For example, the  government required Bank of America and Citigroup to provide warrants  to purchase either common stock or additional senior debt instruments,  such as preferred shares, under their financial agreements. As a condition  for providing a $85 billion revolving loan commitment, for example,  FRBNY initially required that AIG pay an initial gross commitment fee of 2  percent (approximately $1.7 billion) and interest on the outstanding  balance, plus a fee on the unused commitment, and in exchange, issue  preferred shares (convertible to approximately 79.8 percent of issued and  outstanding shares of common stock) into a trust for the benefit of the  U.S. Treasury. Treasury\u2019s contractual agreements with the Enterprises  detail the terms of the preferred shares, and require them to pay  commitment fees, but Treasury has not implemented these fees due to the  Enterprises\u2019 financial condition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Recent Crisis Presented Challenges and Underscored Additional Principles When Providing Assistance", "paragraphs": ["The size and scope of the recent crisis were unprecedented and created  challenges that highlighted principles beyond those based upon the  lessons learned from the 1970s and 1980s. These include ensuring that  actions are strategic and coordinated both nationally and internationally,  addressing conflicts that arise from the government\u2019s often competing  roles and the likelihood of external influences, ensuring transparency of  and communicating effectively with the Congress and the public, ensuring  that a system of accountability exists for actions taken, and taking  measures to reduce moral hazard."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenges Faced by the Federal Government Stemmed From the Global Nature of the Crisis Highlighting the Need for Coordination of Global Actions during Times of Crisis", "paragraphs": ["Financial crises that are international in scope require comprehensive,  global actions and government interventions that must be closely  coordinated by the parties providing assistance\u2014including agencies of the  U.S. government as well as foreign governments\u2014to help ensure that  limited resources are used effectively. In prior work, we reported that  overseeing large financial conglomerates has proven challenging,  particularly in regulating their consolidated risk management practices  and identifying and mitigating the systemic risks they pose. Although the  activities of these large firms often cross traditional sector boundaries,  financial regulators under the current U.S. regulatory system have not  always had full authority or sufficient tools and capabilities to adequately  oversee the risks that these financial institutions posed to themselves and  other institutions. We have laid out several elements that should be  included in a strengthened regulatory framework, including using  international coordination to address the interconnectedness of  institutions, operating cross borders, and helping ensure regulatory  consistency to reduce negative, competitive effects. Initial actions during  the crisis were taken and coordinated by the Federal Reserve, Treasury,  and FDIC, and some were made in conjunction with similar actions by  foreign governments. For example, the United States and several foreign  governments took a variety of actions including providing liquidity and  capital infusions and temporarily banning the short selling of financial  institution stock.", "On September 6, 2008, initial government actions that were taken to  support the Enterprises were due to their deteriorating financial condition,  with worldwide debt and other financial obligations totaling $5.4 trillion,  and their default on those obligations would have significantly disrupted  the U.S. financial system and the global system.", "Shortly afterwards, as several other large financial firms came under heavy  pressure from creditors, counterparties, and customers, the Federal  Reserve used its authority under Section 13(3) to create several facilities  to support the financial system and institutions that the government would  not have been able to assist without triggering this authority, prior to the  creation of TARP.", "The global nature of these companies added to the challenges for the  federal government and international community as it resolved these  issues. Concerted federal government attempts to find a buyer for the  company or to develop an industry solution for Lehman Brothers failed to  address its financing needs. According to Federal Reserve officials, the  company\u2019s available collateral was insufficient to obtain a Federal Reserve  secured loan of sufficient size to meet its funding needs. In the case of  AIG, after contacting the FRBNY on September 12, 2008, the U.S.  government took action because of its relationships with other global  financial institutions and coordinated with regulators in a number of  countries. According to AIG\u2019s 2008 10-K, AIG had operations in more than  130 countries and conducted a substantial portion of its general insurance  business and a majority of its life insurance business outside the United  States. Because of its global reach, the company was subject to a broad  range of regulatory and supervisory jurisdictions, making assisting the  company with its divestment plans extremely difficult. In light of AIG\u2019s  liquidity problems, AIG and its regulated subsidiaries were subject to  intense review, with multiple foreign regulators taking supervisory actions  against AIG. On September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve and Treasury  determined that the company\u2019s financial and business assets were  adequate to secure an $85 billion line of credit, enough to avert its  imminent failure.", "In October 2008, in an unprecedented display of coordination, six central  banks\u2014the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England,  Swiss National Bank, Bank of Canada, and the central bank of Sweden\u2014 acted together to cut short-term interest rates. In a coordinated response,  the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors  announced comprehensive plans to stabilize their banking systems\u2014 making a critical promise not to let systemically important institutions fail  by offering debt guarantees and capital infusions, and increasing deposit  insurance coverage.", "Within 2 weeks of enacting TARP, consistent with similar actions by  several foreign governments and central banks, Treasury\u2014through the  newly established Office of Financial Stability\u2014announced that it would  make available $250 billion to purchase senior preferred shares in a broad  array of qualifying institutions to provide additional capital that would  help enable the U.S. institutions to continue lending. Treasury provided  $125 billion in capital purchases for nine of the largest public financial  institutions, including Bank of America and Citigroup, considered by the  federal banking regulators and Treasury to be systemically significant to  the operation of the financial system. Together these nine financial  institutions held about 55 percent of the U.S. banking assets and had  significant global operations\u2014including retail and wholesale banking,  investment banking, and custodial and processing services\u2014requiring  coordinated action with a number of foreign governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Federal Government Assistance to the Private Sector Highlights the Need to Address Conflicts and Manage External Influences That Can Arise from the Federal Government\u2019s At Times Competing Roles and Policy Actions", "paragraphs": ["The government\u2019s ownership of common shares in private companies can  create various conflicts and competing goals that must be managed. First,  having an ownership interest in a private company gives the government  voting rights that can influence the firm\u2019s business activities. However,  Treasury has limited its voting rights to only matters that directly pertain  to its responsibility under EESA to manage its investments in a manner  that protects the taxpayer. For example, Treasury used its voting rights  elect directors to Citigroup\u2019s board, approve the issuance of common  shares, and a reverse stock split. Likewise, Treasury has designated  directors to serve on Chrysler, GM, and GMAC\u2019s boards of directors.", "Second, when the government is both investor and regulator for the same  company, federal agencies may find themselves in conflicting roles. For  instance, as noted in our April 2010 report on Chrysler and GM pensions,  until Treasury either sells or liquidates the equity it acquired in each  company, the government\u2019s role as shareholder creates potential tensions  with its roles as pension regulator and insurer. This can be illustrated by  the conflicting pressures that would likely arise in two critical and  interrelated scenarios: (1) how to decide when to sell the government\u2019s  shares of stock and (2) how to respond to a decline in pension funding. If  either or both companies return to profitability then the government\u2019s  multiple roles are less likely to result in any perceived conflicts. However,  if either company had to be liquidated, the government would face these  perceived conflicts, because Treasury would have to make decisions  relating to the value of its investments and the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation would need to make decisions related to the companies\u2019  pensions.", "Additionally, on December 11, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service, a  bureau within Treasury, issued a notice stating that under certain  circumstances selling stock that Treasury received under any TARP  program would not trigger an ownership change. As a result, when  Treasury sells such shares there is no change in ownership for tax  purposes, and the companies would not be required to make changes that  limit net operating losses after a change in ownership. Some in Congress  have argued that this action created an additional subsidy to the financial  institutions that received federal assistance and by reducing potential  revenue from taxes, it conflicts with Treasury\u2019s duty to take actions that  are in the best interest of the taxpayers.", "The assistance to the Enterprises illustrates the potential challenges that  can arise when the government uses its assistance to further its public  policy goals\u2014in this case, managing support for the home mortgage  markets and efforts to preserve and conserve assets. Specifically, Treasury  is pursuing public policy goals to address mortgage foreclosures through  the Enterprises, but these actions could also potentially negatively affect  the Enterprises\u2019 financial condition. For example, the Enterprises are  participating in the administration\u2019s foreclosure prevention programs by  modifying the terms of mortgages insured or owned by the Enterprises to  prevent avoidable foreclosures by lowering the borrower\u2019s monthly  mortgage payments. Treasury and FHFA have argued that such programs,  by improving borrowers\u2019 financial condition, will also benefit the  Enterprises, which have large holdings of delinquent mortgages. However,  the Enterprises have stated in their financial disclosures that these  programs may result in significant costs over time, such as incentive  payments made to servicers and borrowers over the life of the  modification and losses associated with borrower redefaults on modified  mortgages. Whether loan modifications would benefit both borrowers and  the Enterprises or further jeopardize the Enterprises\u2019 financial condition is  unknown and may depend in part on how the program is implemented and  overseen by FHFA and Treasury over time. Overseeing the programs  aimed at reducing costs to taxpayers remains a challenge.", "Being both a creditor and a shareholder in private companies creates  another conflict for the government. As a major creditor, the government  is more likely to be involved in an entity\u2019s operations than it is if it is acting  only as a shareholder, and operational decisions that it imposes could  affect returns on taxpayer investments. For example, the government is  currently both a creditor and shareholder in Chrysler and was both a  creditor and shareholder in GM until GM repaid its $6.7 billion loan on  April 20, 2010. Treasury made initial loans to the companies to help them  avert bankruptcy, then provided financing that was converted to equity to  help them through the bankruptcy and restructuring process. As a  creditor, the government obtained rights to impose requirements on the  companies\u2019 business, including requiring them to produce a certain  portion of their total production in the United States. These requirements  established by Treasury as creditor, could negatively affect the companies\u2019  stock price, which in turn could negatively affect the return on investment  earned by Treasury, as a shareholder.", "To manage its different investments, the government has used different  strategies\u2014direct management and a trust arrangement\u2014which have  different implications for the government and the private companies that  may affect how easily it can address conflicts of interest. Directly  managing the investments offers two significant advantages. First, it  affords the government the greatest amount of control over the  investment. Second, having direct control over investments better enables  the government to manage them as a portfolio, as Treasury has done under  CPP. However, such a structure also has disadvantages. For example, as  we have seen, having the government both regulate a company and hold  an ownership interest in it can create a real or perceived conflict of  interest. A direct investment also requires that the government have staff  with the requisite skills to manage it. For instance, as long as Treasury  maintains direct control of its equity investment in Citigroup, Chrysler,  and GM, among others, it must have staff or hire contractors with the  necessary expertise in these specific types of companies. In previous  work, we raised concerns about Treasury\u2019s ability to retain the needed  expertise to assess the financial condition of the auto companies and  develop strategies to divest the government\u2019s interests given the  substantial decline in its staff resources and lack of dedicated staff  providing oversight of its investments in the automakers.", "In contrast, the government has used a trust arrangement to manage its  investment in AIG. Such an arrangement puts the government\u2019s interest in  the hands of an independent third party and helps to avoid potential  conflicts that could stem from the government having both regulatory  responsibilities for and ownership interests in a company. A trust also  helps mitigate perceptions that actions taken with respect to TARP  recipients are politically motivated or based on any \u201cinside information\u201d  received from the regulators. While Treasury has interpreted TARP as  prohibiting placing TARP assets in a trust structure, FRBNY created a trust  to manage the government\u2019s ownership interest in AIG before TARP was  established.", "Finally, the varied and sometimes conflicting roles of the government as  an owner, creditor, regulator, and policymaker also potentially subject  private companies to greater government scrutiny and pressure than they  might have otherwise experienced. In particular, the government\u2019s  investments in these companies increases the level of government and  public oversight and scrutiny these companies receive, as policymakers,  elected officials, and regulators work to ensure that taxpayer interests are  protected. The companies may also be subject to pressure from  government officials to reconsider or alter business decisions that affect  the companies\u2019 bottom lines. For example, Chrysler and GM faced  pressure to reinstate many of the auto dealerships that had been slated for  closure.", "Government involvement could come from many different sources and in  many different forms, including legislative actions and direct  communications. To gauge the nature and scope of external influences, we  interviewed officials from the six companies that received exceptional  financial assistance and reviewed legislation that would place  requirements or restrictions on these companies. We also reviewed  letters sent to Chrysler and GM officials from legislative and executive  branch officials and selected state government officials. We found that the  issues receiving the most congressional scrutiny were executive  compensation, transparency and accountability, mortgage modifications,  and closures of automobile dealerships.", "Executive compensation. We identified 24 bills that members of Congress  introduced in calendar years 2008 and 2009 involving restrictions on  executive compensation or additional taxation of executive compensation  at companies receiving TARP assistance. Also, AIG officials stated that the  majority of congressional contacts they received related to executive  compensation and bonuses.", "Transparency and accountability. We identified 16 bills introduced in  calendar years 2008 and 2009 that would require the companies to take  steps that would result in increased transparency or accountability, such  as reporting on how TARP funds were used. For example, the TARP  Transparency Reporting Act would require TARP recipients to report to  Treasury on their use of TARP funds.", "Mortgage modifications. Officials from the companies whose business  includes mortgage financing told us that one of the most common subjects  of congressional correspondence was requests for modifications to  specific constituents\u2019 mortgages.", "Automobile dealerships. About 60 percent of the bills we identified that  specifically targeted the auto industry sought to curtail or prevent the  closure of automobile dealerships. One of these bills, which established an  arbitration process for dealerships that want to appeal a closure decision,  became public law. Furthermore, according to letters from members of  Congress that Chrysler and GM provided to us, dealership closure was the  most common subject. The letters usually either asked for an explanation  of how the closure decisions had been made or for reconsideration of the  closure of a particular dealership. (See appendix III for more information  on the nature and scope of communication with the auto industry.)", "Company officials we interviewed told us that the level of government  involvement\u2014from requests for appearances at congressional hearings to  letters from elected officials\u2014had increased since their companies had  requested and received financial assistance from the government.  Company officials told us that this involvement was to be expected and  did not cause them to make decisions that were in conflict with their  respective companies\u2019 best interests. However, these officials also stated  that addressing the government\u2019s involvement, such as responding to  letters or requests for information, required increased company resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Federal Intervention into Private Markets Illustrates the Need for Transparency and an Effective Communication Strategy", "paragraphs": ["Federal government intervention in private markets not only requires that  these efforts be transparent but also requires that the action include a  strategy to help ensure open and effective communication with  stakeholders, including Congress and taxpayers. The government\u2019s actions  in the recent crisis have highlighted the challenges associated with  achieving both of these objectives. Throughout the crisis, Congress and  the public often stated that the government actions appeared vague, overly  broad, and conflicted. For example, Treasury\u2019s initial response to the crisis  focused on providing assistance to individual institutions and appeared ad  hoc and uneven, leading to questions about its strategic focus and the  transparency of its efforts. Specifically, questions about the government\u2019s  decision to assist Bear Stearns and AIG, but not Lehman Brothers,  continued months after the decisions were made. Moreover, while TARP  was created to provide a comprehensive approach to addressing the  unfolding crisis, Treasury\u2019s decision to change the focus of the program  weeks after the passage of EESA from purchasing mortgage-backed  securities and whole loans to injecting capital into financial institutions  caught many in Congress, the markets, and the public by surprise and  adversely affected these parties understanding of the program\u2019s goals and  priorities which may have undermined the initial effectiveness of the  program.", "In general, transparency means more than simply reporting available  information to interested parties, it involves such things as providing  clearly articulated guidelines, decision points, and feedback mechanisms  to help ensure an adequate understanding of the matters at hand. For the  recent actions, transparency would include providing information on how  the companies were to be monitored and the results of those activities.  However, when considering any federal intervention, part of this decision- making process includes identifying what information can and should be  made public and balancing concerns about the public\u2019s \u201cneed to know\u201d  against disclosing proprietary information in a competitive market. For  example, while disclosing detailed information about Treasury\u2019s plans to  sell shares of company stock may not be appropriate, the government  should communicate its purpose in intervening in the private market and  approach for evaluating the success of any federal action. Specifically,  making information available to the public on the purpose of federal  intervention and the decision to intervene could help ensure that the  public understands the implications of not intervening and the expected  results from the government\u2019s actions.", "While EESA required Treasury to report information about TARP  activities, Treasury\u2019s failure to adequately communicate the rationale for  its actions and decisions early on caused confusion about the motivations  behind these actions and decisions and long plagued the program.  Treasury\u2019s lack of an effective communication strategy was, in part, the  result of the unfolding nature of the crisis but even so, the nature of the  unfolding crisis was not effectively communicated. For example, the  multifaceted nature of the crisis resulted in numerous TARP programs to  address specific problems in the markets; however, Treasury did not  establish or adequately explain some of the programs until after assistance  had already been announced. Specifically, Treasury announced assistance  to Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG before TIP and SSFI\u2014now called  the AIG Assistance Program\u2014were established and announced in January  2009 and November 2008, respectively. Since the inception of TARP, we  have recommended that Treasury take a number of actions aimed at  developing a coherent communication strategy for TARP. In our previous  reports, we have recommended that Treasury develop a communication  strategy that included building an understanding and support for the  various components of the TARP program. While the actions we  suggested were intended to address challenges associated with TARP\u2014 such as hiring a communications officer, integrating communications into  TARP operations, scheduling regular and ongoing contact with  congressional committees and members, holding town hall meetings with  the public across the country, establishing a counsel of advisors, and  leveraging available technology\u2014most of these suggestions would be  applicable when considering a communication strategy for any federal  intervention.

We first  highlighted the importance of accountability in implementing TARP in  December 2008, which has been reiterated by Congressional Oversight  Panel and SIGTARP. Specifically, we noted the importance of establishing  oversight structures, including monitoring and other internal controls that  can help prevent and detect fraud. Federal action in the midst of a crisis  will undoubtedly require that actions be taken at the same time that  programs are being established. In December 2008, we reported that a  robust oversight system with internal controls specifically designed to deal  with the unique and complex aspects of TARP would be key to helping  OFS management achieve the desired results. For example, OFS faced  the challenge that it needed to develop a comprehensive system of internal  controls at the same time that it was reacting quickly to changing financial  market events and establishing the program. One area that took time to  develop was establishing a plan to help ensure that participating  institutions adhered to program requirements or to monitor companies\u2019  compliance with certain requirements, such as executive compensation  and dividend restrictions.

According to regulators and market  observers, such assistance may weaken the incentives for large uninsured  depositors, creditors, and investors to discipline large complex firms that  are deemed too big to fail. In March 2009, Federal Reserve Chairman  Bernanke told the Council on Foreign Relations that market perceptions  that a particular institution is considered too big to fail has many  undesirable effects. He explained that such perceptions reduce market  discipline, encourage excessive risk-taking by the firm, and provide  artificial incentives for firms to grow. He also noted these beliefs do not  create a level playing field, because smaller firms may not be regarded as  having implicit government support. Similarly, others have noted how  such perceptions may encourage risk-taking. For example, some large  financial institutions may be given access to the credit markets at  favorable terms without consideration of their risk profile.", "Before a financial crisis, the financial regulatory framework could serve an  important role in restricting the extent to which institutions engage in  excessive risk-taking activities resulting from weakened market discipline.  For instance, regulators can take pre-emptive steps to mitigate moral  hazard by taking the necessary regulatory actions to help ensure that  companies have adequate systems in place to monitor and manage risk  taking. Any regulatory actions that the government takes to help ensure  strong risk management systems at companies of all sizes would help to  lessen the need for government intervention.", "In general, mitigating moral hazard requires ensuring that any government  assistance includes terms that make it a last resort and undesirable except  in the most dire circumstances and specifying when the government  assistance will end. During the recent crisis, the government has included  provisions that attached such costs to the provision of assistance,  including limiting executive compensation, requiring dividends, and  acquiring an ownership interest. Further, while uncertainty about the  duration of the crisis makes it difficult to specify timetables for phasing  out assistance and investments, it is important to provide a credible \u201cexit  strategy\u201d to prevent further disruption in the financial markets when  withdrawing government guarantees. While Treasury has articulated its  exit strategy for some of the companies we reviewed, the government\u2019s  plans for divesting itself of investments in AIG and the Enterprises are less  clear.

In addition, we interviewed senior  management\u2014primarily the Chief Executive Officers and the Chief  Financial Officers\u2014for most of the companies in our study, including the  Enterprises, and interviewed the AIG trustees to understand their role in  the governance of AIG.", "To address the third objective on evaluating the government\u2019s monitoring  of the companies\u2019 financial viability and exit strategies, we interviewed  officials from FDIC, Federal Reserve, FHFA, FRBNY, FRB-Chicago, FRB- Richmond, OCC, and OFS. We also interviewed the asset managers who  are responsible for monitoring and valuing the equity shares held by  Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program, the Targeted Investment  Program and the Asset Guarantee Program. We reviewed Treasury  documents, such as asset manager reports, TARP transaction reports, and  press releases; Treasury testimonies; and press releases from the  companies.  We also reviewed the contractual agreements between the  government and the companies including credit agreements, securities  purchase agreements, asset purchase agreements, and master agreements  in order to understand the companies\u2019 responsibilities in reporting  financial information and the government\u2019s responsibility for monitoring  and divesting its interests. Finally, we reviewed a Congressional Oversight  Panel report relating to Treasury\u2019s approach on exiting TARP and  unwinding its impact on the financial markets.", "To address the fourth objective relating to the implications of the  government\u2019s ongoing involvement in the companies, we reviewed prior  GAO work on principles for providing large-scale government assistance  and assessed the degree to which the government\u2019s activities under TARP  adhered to these principles. To identify actions the government is taking  with the potential to influence the companies\u2019 business decisions, we  reviewed legislation that would affect TARP recipients and determined  what, if any action the legislation would require the companies to take. To  identify the nature and scope of contacts TARP recipients received from  executive branch agencies, members of Congress, and state government  officials, we interviewed government relations staff at AIG, Bank of  America, Chrysler, Citigroup, GM, and GMAC. These interviews also  provided us with information on the extent of government involvement  and influence in the companies\u2019 business operations. For Chrysler and  GM, we obtained 277 letters that the companies received from members of  Congress, which was the number of letters the companies received during  calendar year 2009 and kept on file. We reviewed each of the letters to  determine their topic and whether they sought to influence the companies\u2019  business decisions. We also obtained more than 2,300 e-mails that certain  senior executives of Chrysler and GM received from congressional and  state government officials during calendar year 2009, including 1,221 from  Chrysler and 1,098 from GM. Due to the large number of these e-mails, we  reviewed a random probability sample of 251 from the 2,319 e-mails the  companies provided us with to create estimates about the population of all  the e-mails. Because we followed a probability procedure based on  random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples  that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided  different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our  particular sample\u2019s results as having a margin of error at the 95 percent  confidence level of plus or minus 8 percentage points or less. This is the  interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of  the samples we could have drawn. With this probability sample, each  member of the study population had a nonzero probability of being  included, and that probability could be computed for any member. Finally,  we obtained 264 e-mails that certain senior executives at the companies  received from White House and Treasury officials in calendar year 2009.  After removing e-mails that were out of scope and duplicates, we were left  with 109 e-mails, including 89 sent to Chrysler and 20 sent to GM. We  reviewed these e-mails to determine their purpose and topic and whether  they sought to influence the companies\u2019 business decisions.", "We provided a draft of this report to FHFA, the Federal Reserve, OFS,  OCC, and FDIC for their review and comment.  In addition, we provided  excerpts of the draft of this report to the companies receiving exceptional  assistance\u2014AIG, AIG Trust, Bank of America, Chrysler, Citigroup, and  GMAC\u2014to help ensure the accuracy of our report.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 to August 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provided a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Government Assistance and Outstanding Balances of the Companies", "paragraphs": ["Since the fall of 2008, a number of large financial institutions and  companies have received more than $447 billion in financial assistance  leaving the government with a significant ownership interest in a number  of companies. The government provided assistance or funds to American  International Group (AIG); Bank of America Corporation (Bank of  America); Chrysler; Citigroup, Inc (Citigroup); Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac (Enterprises); General Motors (GM); and GMAC, Inc (GMAC). As of  March 31, 2010, the government owned substantial amounts of preferred  or common shares in seven companies\u2014AIG, Chrysler, Citigroup, GM,  GMAC, and the Enterprises. The total amounts of assistance disbursed to  each company are shown in figure 2. The federal government assisted  these companies by infusing capital through the purchase of preferred  shares, direct loans, guarantees, stock exchanges, or lines of credit that  led to the government owning preferred and common shares.", "Figure 3 shows the variation in the amount of government ownership  interest in the companies and the outstanding balance that is owed to the  government. The financial institutions and the companies have begun to  pay down some of the assistance. GM has repaid the entirety of the debt  owed to Treasury under its post-bankruptcy credit agreement, and  Chrysler has repaid a portion of its loan from Treasury. As previously  noted, whether the government will be recovering all its investment or  assistance to Chrysler and GM is unknown. For companies where the  government has an ownership stake, the amount of recovery depends on a  number of external factors, including the financial health of the companies  and the market value of their stock as well as the companies\u2019 ability to  repay loans or repurchase preferred shares. Similarly, Treasury still holds  common shares in Citigroup. The Enterprises have not repaid any portion  of the assistance Treasury has provided and as of June 2010 continued to  borrow from Treasury.", "To provide some additional protection for the taxpayer, Treasury required  the companies to commit to certain financial terms and actions. For  example, in exchange for the capital infusions in the form of preferred  shares, Treasury required AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, the  Enterprises, GM, and GMAC to pay dividends. The dividend rate varied  across the seven companies ranging from less than 5 percent to 10 percent  for AIG and the Enterprises. As shown in table 6, as of March 31, 2010,  Treasury had collected a total of more than $16.2 billion in dividends from  Bank of America, Citigroup, the Enterprises, GM, and GMAC. AIG was  required to pay dividends at an annual rate of 10 percent on series D  cumulative preferred shares prior to when they were exchanged for seri E noncumulative preferred shares, but it had not paid any dividends to  Treasury as of March 31, 2010. Series D unpaid dividends were capitaliz thereby increasing the liquida tion preference of the Series E shares for  which they were exchanged.", "The government or, in the case of AIG, FRBNY requires that AIG and  Chrysler pay interest on the loans provided. Moreover, Treasury currently  holds warrants obtained in connection with the preferred shares that it  holds for AIG, Citigroup, and the Enterprises. Because GMAC is a privately held company, Treasury exercised its warrants immediately. On March 3,  2010, Treasury received more than $1.5 billion from its auction of Bank of  America\u2019s warrants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Legislation and Government Communication with GM and Chrysler", "paragraphs": ["To further examine the extent of government involvement in companies  receiving Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) assistance, we reviewed  legislative proposals and government communications with General  Motors Company (GM) and Chrysler Group LLC (Chrysler).

The bills generally aimed to  curtail or prevent the closure of auto dealerships, as well as plants and  suppliers. One of the bills that became public law requires Chrysler and  GM to provide to the dealers specific criteria for the closures and gives  dealers the right to pursue binding arbitration concerning their closures.  The Automobile Dealer Economic Rights Restoration Act of 2009, as  introduced in the House and Senate, would require the automakers to  restore a dealership based on the dealer\u2019s request.

In total, 188 individual members of Congress sent letters to  the companies over this time period.", "In terms of the content of the letters, many dealt with specific constituent  concerns, with the closing of auto dealerships being the most common  topic.
