When deciding on a nursing home, consumers and their families  can make choices based on such factors as location, fees, specialties,  services and activities for residents, and what they know about the quality  of care provided in a facility. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), is responsible for establishing quality standards that  nursing homes must meet in the delivery of care to their residents and for  overseeing nursing homes\u2019 compliance with those standards. In our prior  work, we have shown that the quality of care provided in nursing homes  can vary, often significantly, and have raised concerns about the quality  of care in some nursing homes.

State surveyors also conduct  complaint investigations in response to allegations of quality  problems. State surveyors may spend several days in the nursing  home to assess whether the nursing home is in compliance with  federal quality standards. If nursing homes are found to be out of  compliance with any requirements, state surveyors issue deficiency  citations that reflect the scope (number of residents affected) and  severity (level of harm to residents) of the deficiency.

The adjustment for  resident acuity is done using data from a resident assessment tool  called the Minimum Data Set (MDS), which nursing homes complete  and periodically report to CMS. MDS collects information on residents\u2019  health, physical functioning, mental status, and general well-being. Each nursing home\u2019s staffing rating is assigned based on how its total  nursing and registered nurse staffing levels compare to the  distribution of staffing levels for freestanding facilities in the nation  and staffing level thresholds identified by CMS.

For example, after the Acting Administrator of  CMS directed CMS officials to develop a rating system for nursing homes  in late April 2008, CMS obtained comments about the planned rating  system from long-term care stakeholders through an Open Door Forum  in June 2008. CMS also reviewed and summarized comments it received  via an email account set up specifically for comments regarding the  planned rating system through late July.

Technical  expert panel members told us that they discussed how much weight  should be assigned to each component when combining the  component ratings to calculate the overall rating. One technical expert  panel member told us that, in the end, the members generally agreed  to assign more weight to the health inspection and staffing  components and less weight to the quality measure component, which  reflects differences in the perceived validity and reliability of the data  used to calculate these components. Consistent with the technical  expert panel\u2019s proposal, CMS decided to assign overall ratings to  each nursing home by starting with the health inspection rating, then  adding or subtracting stars if the nursing home\u2019s staffing or quality  measure rating was particularly high or low, with a minimum and  maximum rating of one and five stars, respectively.", "Whether to exclude hospital-based nursing homes or set up  separate ratings for hospital-based and freestanding nursing  homes. Another key methodological decision that CMS made was  whether to exclude nursing homes that are hospital-based from the  Five-Star System or to set up separate ratings for hospital-based and  freestanding nursing homes. CMS\u2019s Five-Star System contractor  stated that hospital-based facilities may typically provide a different  type of care than freestanding facilities. That is, hospital-based  facilities may provide care to more acute residents who require more  extensive services than freestanding facilities. However, one senior  CMS official told us that some hospital-based and freestanding  facilities may provide care to similar types of residents.

A third key  methodological decision that CMS made was whether the staffing  rating that nursing homes receive should be based on reported  staffing levels that are adjusted to account for resident acuity. For  example, in a published article, two of the technical expert panel  members and others argued that the appropriate level of nurse  staffing may differ substantially in two nursing homes with identical  numbers of staff, because of the differences in the amount of time  needed to care for residents due to variation in resident acuity.  However, panel members told us that they debated whether and the  extent to which nursing staffing levels should be adjusted to reflect  resident acuity due to concerns about the validity of existing  adjustment approaches. Because CMS agreed that nursing home  staffing levels should reflect the care needs of the facility\u2019s residents,  CMS decided to adjust staffing levels for differences in the expected  amount of time required to care for residents and worked with the  technical expert panel to select an adjustment method."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Typically Considers Modifying the Five-Star System in Response to Stakeholders, after Routine Monitoring, and When New Data Sources Become Available", "paragraphs": ["CMS generally considers modifying the Five-Star System in response to  (1) methodological issues raised by stakeholders, (2) its routine  monitoring of the system, and (3) the availability of new data sources.

Officials further said  that each issue raised does not always result in modifications to the Five- Star System, although some minor modifications have been made. For  example, in September 2009, in response to input it received from long- term care stakeholders, CMS updated the methodology for calculating a  nursing home\u2019s health inspection rating. With the methodological change,  the health inspection rating for a nursing home is no longer updated  unless new survey data for that nursing home becomes available. Initially,  because each nursing home\u2019s health inspection rating is relative to the  ratings of all nursing homes in the same state, the results of new surveys  and rating changes for some nursing homes could have affected the  ratings for other nursing homes in the state. Stakeholders had noted to  CMS that the rating of an individual nursing home therefore could be  changed even if that nursing home had not had a new survey. CMS made  the methodological change to address this concern, while noting that this  had happened to only a small percentage of nursing homes.", "Some issues raised by stakeholders have not resulted in a modification of  the Five-Star System.

CMS reviewed this concern with its Five-Star System  contractor and found that fixed thresholds would likely present  disadvantages to nursing homes because changes in survey policy could  lead to changes in survey scores and result in significant changes for  nursing homes\u2019 health inspection ratings. CMS officials stated that using  a relative distribution allows nursing homes\u2019 ratings to remain more stable  and, additionally, allows consumers to compare nursing homes within a  state.", "CMS also considers making modifications to the Five-Star System based  on its periodic analysis of the system\u2019s rating trends; however, to date, no  modifications have been made based on these analyses.

For example, CMS examined whether it should  modify the health inspection component because some state survey  agencies have begun using the Quality Indicator Survey to collect survey  information. In 2010, as part of its analysis for one of its monthly reports,  CMS examined whether the health inspection rating of facilities that were  inspected using the Quality Indicator Survey differed from those that were  inspected with the traditional, paper-based survey. No significant  difference was found between the two approaches to conducting the  survey and, as a result, CMS did not modify the Five-Star System.", "Through this analysis, CMS has found that nursing homes\u2019 star ratings have improved in  the first 2 years since the Five-Star System has been implemented, but it is unclear if the  results are due to more accurate reporting of the data or an actual improvement in quality. ratings of the Five-Star System based on new data available from MDS  3.0, an updated version of the resident assessment tool. CMS is  examining how using data from MDS 3.0 to adjust staffing data to account  for resident acuity will affect the staffing ratings of nursing homes. In  addition, CMS is considering whether the availability of these new data  should result in a modification to the manner in which the thresholds for  the staffing component ratings are determined. CMS intends to complete  any modifications to the staffing component rating based on the new data  by April 2012. CMS is also currently refining and testing the nursing home  quality measures using MDS 3.0 data and is considering options for  modifying how the quality measure component rating for the Five-Star  System will be calculated using these new data. CMS anticipates that the  quality measure component of the Five-Star System will be modified at  the end of calendar year 2012.

A CMS  official told us that the agency has determined what type of data it wants  to collect through nursing home payroll systems, such as data that will  allow the calculation of nursing staff turnover in a nursing home, and is  working with a private firm to develop the system to collect this  information. Electronic payroll data have several strengths, including that  they will allow CMS to collect data on several aspects of staffing that are  not currently available, including the percentage of staff that are full time  and the number of staff that provide direct patient care.

We have found, in our prior work, that  developing and using specific milestones and timelines to guide and  gauge progress toward achieving an agency\u2019s desired results is a leading  practice for effective strategic planning and management. Particularly  because much of the implementation is to be conducted by the Five-Star  System contractor, the use of milestones and timelines to guide and  gauge implementation is especially useful for helping to ensure that CMS  has clear expectations for its contractor and a means for determining  whether appropriate progress has been made in implementing these  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Not Established How Its Planned Efforts Will Help Achieve Goals", "paragraphs": ["CMS has not established, through planning activities or resulting planning  documents, how its planned efforts to improve the Five-Star System will  help CMS achieve the goals of the system\u2014to inform consumers and  improve provider quality.

This lack of planning and priority setting  may explain why CMS has taken limited steps to determine whether or to  what extent the Five-Star System is achieving the primary goal of  providing consumers with understandable and useful information on  nursing home care. For example, consumer testing of the Five-Star  System could provide information on the extent to which this goal is being  achieved. According to AHRQ, consumer testing is a key practice for  ensuring that health care quality information is publicly reported in a  manner that is useful and understandable to consumers.

For example, while public reporting  itself can be an incentive for providers to improve quality, there may be  other efforts that could help CMS to further accomplish this goal. Nursing  home quality measures serve a number of purposes, including providing  data to nursing homes to help with their own quality improvement efforts.  In addition, making quality measure information available to consumers  allows them to distinguish among nursing homes\u2019 quality and provides an  incentive for providers to improve their quality. Therefore, adding more  individual quality measures to that rating component in the Five-Star  System could potentially create even greater incentives as well as provide  nursing homes with more data on how to improve the quality of their care.  However, CMS has not explicitly prioritized this planned effort or others  based on achievement of this secondary goal. This planning and  prioritization is especially important for quality measures because quality  measures can be costly and time intensive to develop, especially if new  data need to be collected in order to create the measures.", "CMS officials said that the agency has no planning activities or resulting  planning documents related to the Five-Star System because there are  too many intervening circumstances that make planning difficult. These  include uncertainty about resources available for the Five-Star System  due to competing resource needs within the agency, mandatory activities  required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that take up  staff time and effort, and other agency initiatives.

This was a significant step  toward increasing the transparency of information important to  consumers, but for CMS to sustain the Five-Star System over time, the  agency will need to continue making a concerted effort. CMS has made  some efforts to update the Five-Star System as it reviews the system\u2019s  underlying components to identify potential ways to improve the system  over time. However, there can be significant challenges to ensuring that  the Five-Star System remains useful and valid over time, especially when  the components of that system continue to evolve. While CMS has  identified efforts it intends to make to improve the Five-Star System, the  agency has not strategically planned how to carry out these efforts, such  as outlining the milestones and timelines that will help ensure that  progress is being made. In addition, CMS has not clearly identified how  each of its planned efforts will help achieve the goals of the Five-Star  System. As a result, CMS may not know how it will prioritize and best  leverage its available resources to implement these efforts and achieve  the goals of the Five-Star System.

Points are assigned based on  the number, scope, and severity of a nursing home\u2019s health deficiencies  found during surveys, with deficiencies with greater scope and severity  equating to more points. Therefore, a lower survey point total results in a  better rating (see table 2). If multiple revisits are required to ensure that  major deficiencies are corrected, additional points are added to the health  inspection score (see table 3). Based on the totals received, the top   10 percent of nursing homes in a given state receive five stars, the  bottom 20 percent receive one star, and the middle 70 percent of nursing  homes receive two, three or four stars, with equal proportions   (23.33 percent) in each category.", "Each nursing home\u2019s staffing rating is calculated based on the facility\u2019s  self-reported registered nurse (RN) and total nursing (sum of RN,  licensed practical nurse, and certified nursing assistant) staffing levels for  a 2-week period around the time a routine survey is conducted. Staffing  levels are converted to hours per resident day and are adjusted to reflect  varying levels of resident acuity. Each nursing home\u2019s staffing rating is  assigned based on how its total nursing and RN staffing levels compare  to the distribution of staffing levels for freestanding facilities in the nation  and staffing level thresholds identified by CMS. (See table 4.)", "Each nursing home\u2019s quality measure rating is calculated based on the  nursing home\u2019s performance over the three most recent quarters on   10 of 19 quality measures, including 7 long-stay and 3 short-stay  measures. Two of the long-stay measures capture aspects of activities of  daily living, which reflect nursing home residents\u2019 ability to provide self- care. Performance on the two activities of daily living-related measures is  weighted 1.6667 times as high as the other measures. This, according to  CMS, reflects the greater importance of these measures to many nursing  home residents and ensures that the two activities of daily living  measures count for 40 percent of the overall weight of the long-stay  measures. For the individual quality measures used to calculate this  rating, nursing homes that have lower percentages are considered to  have higher quality of care and, thus, receive more points.
