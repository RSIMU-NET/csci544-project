Stakeholders have questioned the increase in hospital participation in the 340B program, and the implications for Medicare and its beneficiaries, especially regarding cancer care; and whether certain of the program's hospital eligibility criteria target hospitals appropriately.", "GAO was asked to review hospitals' participation in the 340B and Medicare programs. This report (1) compares 340B hospitals with non-340B hospitals in terms of financial and other characteristics and (2) compares spending for Medicare Part B drugs at 340B hospitals, for all drugs and for oncology drugs, with spending at non-340B hospitals. To examine hospital participation using the most recent data available, GAO analyzed 2008 and 2012 data from HRSA and CMS to compare characteristics and Medicare Part B drug spending for 340B hospitals and non-340B hospitals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Certain providers, including hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients, have access to discounted prices on outpatient drugs through the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). In 2012, these hospitals\u2014referred to as 340B disproportionate share hospitals (DSH) because they are eligible for the program based on their serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients and other specified criteria\u2014were generally larger and more likely to be teaching hospitals compared with non-340B hospitals. They also tended to provide more uncompensated and charity care than non-340B hospitals; however, there were notable numbers of 340B hospitals that provided low amounts of these types of care. For example, 12 percent of 340B DSH hospitals were among the hospitals that reported providing the lowest amounts of charity care across all hospitals in GAO's analysis. Overall financial margins for 340B DSH hospitals tended to be lower compared with non-340B hospitals, which could be attributable, in part, to the tendency for 340B DSH hospitals to provide more uncompensated and charity care.", "GAO found that in both 2008 and 2012, per beneficiary Medicare Part B drug spending, including oncology drug spending, was substantially higher at 340B DSH hospitals than at non-340B hospitals. This indicates that, on average, beneficiaries at 340B DSH hospitals were either prescribed more drugs or more expensive drugs than beneficiaries at the other hospitals in GAO's analysis. For example, in 2012, average per beneficiary spending at 340B DSH hospitals was $144, compared to approximately $60 at non-340B hospitals. The differences did not appear to be explained by the hospital characteristics GAO examined or patients' health status. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the Medicare program, uses a statutorily defined formula to pay hospitals for drugs at set rates regardless of hospitals' costs for acquiring the drugs. Therefore, there is a financial incentive at hospitals participating in the 340B program to prescribe more drugs or more expensive drugs to Medicare beneficiaries. Unnecessary spending has negative implications, not just for the Medicare program, but for Medicare beneficiaries as well, who would be financially liable for larger copayments as a result of receiving more drugs or more expensive drugs. In addition, this raises potential concerns about the appropriateness of the health care provided to these beneficiaries. HRSA and CMS have limited ability to counter this incentive because the 340B statute does not restrict covered entities from using drugs purchased at the 340B discounted price for Medicare Part B beneficiaries and the Medicare statute does not limit CMS reimbursement for such drugs.", "In commenting on a draft of this report HHS noted some concerns with GAO's conclusions and suggested that further analysis may be needed to examine patient outcomes and differences in health status. GAO believes its methods appropriately support its conclusions as further discussed in the report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider eliminating the incentive to prescribe more drugs or more expensive drugs than necessary to treat Medicare Part B beneficiaries at 340B hospitals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 340B Drug Pricing Program requires drug manufacturers to sell most  outpatient drugs at deeply discounted prices to certain providers and  other entities\u2014commonly referred to as covered entities\u2014in order to  have their drugs covered by Medicaid. Entity eligibility for the program is  defined in statute and includes certain hospitals that serve a  disproportionate number of low-income patients. Participating hospitals,  referred to as 340B hospitals, benefit from lower outpatient drug prices  and may also benefit from the revenue generated when they are  reimbursed by Medicare and other payers at rates that exceed the  discounted prices the hospitals pay for outpatient drugs. The 340B  statute does not specify how covered entities should use the savings or  any resulting revenue associated with the discounts.", "Currently, approximately 40 percent of all U.S. hospitals participate in the  program, and the majority of 340B discounted drugs are sold to  hospitals. Some members of Congress and certain stakeholders, such as drug manufacturers, have raised questions about the increasing  number of hospitals that participate in the 340B Program. They question  whether certain of the program\u2019s hospital eligibility criteria appropriately  target hospitals for participation. They contend that participating hospitals  do not necessarily use the program and program revenues to help  vulnerable patients, such as low-income uninsured patients, and that the  program gives hospitals incentives to maximize the revenue that they  earn through it. In contrast, they contend that nonhospital entities that are  eligible for the 340B Program on the basis of their participation in  qualifying federal programs must operate within the rules of those  programs, so there is some assurance that those entities will use the  program, including any revenue generated through it, to help the  vulnerable patients they serve. Other stakeholders, such as organizations  representing 340B hospitals, emphasize that participating hospitals are  safety net providers that serve more low-income, uninsured, and  underinsured patients than other hospitals. Such stakeholders contend  that the program is intended to allow hospitals to use the revenue they  generate through the 340B Program to help them cover their operating  costs and make up any financial losses, as well as to implement  programs to benefit vulnerable patients.", "Another issue raised by stakeholders, including groups representing  independent oncology practices and oncology providers, is that hospitals\u2019  participation in the 340B Program might contribute to a recent trend in  hospital acquisition of oncology practices. Because independent  outpatient oncology practices are not eligible for the 340B Program, they  cannot obtain oncology drugs at the 340B discounted rate. Some  stakeholders argue that 340B hospitals are acquiring independent  oncology practices, in part, to expand their outpatient base for 340B  oncology drugs and thus generate higher revenue for these drugs. They  assert that this trend has negative implications for payers and patients,  including the Medicare program and its beneficiaries, because payments  for services provided in hospital outpatient departments are generally  higher than they are for services provided in free-standing community  outpatient facilities. However, these stakeholders note that a variety of  other factors could contribute to these acquisitions.", "You asked us to examine hospitals\u2019 participation in the 340B Program  and the potential implications for Medicare and its beneficiaries.

We also examined whether hospitals  with higher DSH adjustment percentages provided larger amounts of  charity care and uncompensated care. We used the cost report data to  examine hospitals\u2019 financial characteristics by calculating four types of  hospital financial margins: (1) total facility margin, (2) total Medicare  margin, (3) inpatient Medicare margin, and (4) outpatient Medicare  margin. In addition, we determined whether hospitals received the  following Medicare payment adjustments and the size of each  adjustment: (1) DSH adjustment, (2) indirect medical education (IME)  adjustment, (3) direct graduate medical education (GME) payment,   (4) outlier case adjustment, and (5) Medicare-dependent hospital (MDH)  classification.

Higher average per  beneficiary spending at 340B DSH hospitals compared to non-340B  hospitals persisted regardless of teaching status or patient health  status. For example, in 2008 and 2012, the health status of outpatient  oncology beneficiaries that received a Part B drug was similar at 340B  and non-340B hospitals. In 2012, the average risk score of these  outpatient oncology beneficiaries at 340B DSH hospitals was 2.29, while  it was 2.11 at non-340B DSH hospitals and 2.14 at other non-340B  hospitals. Risk scores are based on overall health care spending and  are not limited to oncology drug spending specifically. Nevertheless, the  difference between the risk scores of beneficiaries treated at 340B and  non-340B hospitals relative to these hospitals\u2019 Part B oncology drug  spending suggests that the substantially higher Part B spending at 340B  DSH hospitals may not be explained by differences in patient health  status. Because Medicare reimbursement rates for Part B oncology drugs  at all of the hospitals in our analysis were based on the same fee  schedule, this indicates that, on average, Medicare beneficiaries at 340B  DSH hospitals were prescribed more oncology drugs, or prescribed more  expensive oncology drugs, than beneficiaries at the other hospitals in our  analysis.", "The average number of oncology patients served increased among all  three of our hospital groups between 2008 and 2012, but 340B DSH  hospitals saw the greatest increase in such patients served (83 to 120, or  45 percent). The increase across all three hospital groups in the number  of oncology patients served may reflect recent trends in oncology  treatment, such as where patients are treated, and could be due to  multiple factors, including factors outside of the 340B program. For  example, stakeholders that we spoke with noted that there is a larger  trend toward integration in the health care industry. However, 340B DSH  hospitals were much more likely to treat oncology patients compared with  non-340B hospitals. In addition, there was a 5 percentage point increase  from 2008 to 2012 in the percentage of 340B DSH hospitals that treated  oncology patients, while the increases for non-340B DSH and other non- 340B hospitals were 1 and 2 percentage points, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Per Beneficiary Part B Drug Spending at 340B and Non-340B Hospitals May Reflect Responses to Incentives in the 340B and Medicare Programs", "paragraphs": ["Medicare uses a statutorily defined formula to pay hospitals at set rates  for drugs, regardless of their costs for acquiring them, which CMS cannot  alter based on hospitals\u2019 acquisition costs, and the 340B statute does not  restrict covered entities from using drugs purchased at the 340B  discounted price for Medicare Part B beneficiaries. Consequently, there is  a financial incentive at these hospitals to prescribe more drugs and more  expensive drugs to Medicare beneficiaries in order to maximize the  revenue generated by the difference between the cost of the drug and  Medicare\u2019s reimbursement. The substantially higher per beneficiary  Medicare spending for Part B drugs at 340B DSH hospitals, which did not  appear to be explained by hospital characteristics or patient health status,  may reflect responses to this incentive. Unnecessary spending has  negative implications, not just for the Medicare program, but for Medicare  beneficiaries as well, who would be financially liable for larger  copayments as a result of receiving more drugs or more expensive drugs,  and higher Part B premiums that reflect the increases in Medicare  spending for those drugs. Moreover, there are potential concerns about  the appropriateness of the health care provided to Medicare beneficiaries  if it is overly influenced by financial incentives to prescribe outpatient  drugs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Certain providers, including hospitals that serve a disproportionate  number of low-income patients, have access to discounted prices on  outpatient drugs through the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Currently,  approximately 40 percent of all U.S. hospitals participate in the program,  including approximately 1,000 DSH hospitals. Because DSH hospitals  account for nearly 80 percent of all 340B drug purchases, it is important  to understand the characteristics of the population that is served by these  hospitals in order to evaluate the impact of the 340B program on hospitals  and their patients. We found that 340B DSH hospitals generally provided  more charity care and uncompensated care compared with non-340B  hospitals. However, there were notable exceptions to this pattern.  Specially, 12 percent of the 340B DSH hospitals reported providing  relatively small amounts of charity care and 14 percent reported providing  relatively small amounts of uncompensated care.", "The financial incentive to maximize Medicare revenues through the  prescribing of more or more expensive drugs at 340B hospitals also  raises concerns. Our work suggests that 340B DSH hospitals may be  responding to this incentive to maximize Medicare revenues. On average,  per beneficiary Medicare spending on Part B drugs in 2008 and 2012 was  substantially higher at 340B DSH hospitals compared with non-340B  hospitals\u2014yet we did not find that these differences could be readily  explained by hospital characteristics or patients\u2019 health status. While  hospitals may be financially benefitting\u2014which is not inconsistent with the  legislative design of the 340B Program\u2014this poses potentially serious  consequences to the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. Not only  does excess spending on Part B drugs increase the burden on both  taxpayers and beneficiaries who finance the program through their  premiums, it also has direct financial effects on beneficiaries who are  responsible for 20 percent of the Medicare payment for their Part B drugs.  Furthermore, this incentive to prescribe these drugs raises potential  concerns about the appropriateness of the health care provided to  Medicare Part B beneficiaries. Absent a change in financial incentives,  potentially inappropriate spending on drugs may continue. While limiting  hospitals\u2019 Medicare Part B reimbursement for 340B discounted drugs or  eliminating the 340B discount for drugs provided by hospitals to Medicare  Part B beneficiaries could diminish the incentive to prescribe more drugs  or more expensive drugs than necessary at 340B hospitals, CMS and  HRSA are unable to take such actions because they do not have the  statutory authority to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure the financial sustainability of the Medicare program,  protect beneficiaries from unwarranted financial burden, and address  potential concerns about the appropriateness of the health care provided  to Part B beneficiaries, Congress should consider eliminating the  incentive to prescribe more drugs or more expensive drugs than  necessary to treat Medicare Part B beneficiaries at 340B hospitals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Third Party Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review to HHS and received written  comments that are printed in appendix I. Because of the focus on 340B  hospitals in this report, we also provided 340B Health (formerly Safety  Net Hospitals for Pharmaceutical Access) an opportunity to review a draft  of this report and we have summarized the comments we received below.  HHS and 340B Health also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated, as appropriate. Following is our summary of and response  to comments from HHS and 340B Health."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HHS Comments", "paragraphs": ["In its comments, HHS stated that our examination of Medicare Part B  outpatient drug spending is a useful initial analysis of differences in  spending between 340B DSH hospitals and non-340B hospitals. HHS  also noted concerns related to some of our conclusions; however, we  believe our methods and findings were robust and appropriately support  our conclusions, as discussed below.", "First, HHS noted that although we examined differences in per beneficiary  spending by hospital type, we did not examine differences in patient  outcomes or quality. HHS acknowledged that higher spending for Part B  drugs at 340B hospitals could represent unnecessary or excess spending  for these drugs. However, HHS stated that it is also possible that a higher  volume of physician-administered drugs could lead to better clinical  outcomes. While we did not attempt to evaluate health outcomes as part  of our analysis, we have no evidence to suggest that non-340B hospitals  had an incentive to provide a lower volume of Part B drugs than required  to achieve positive clinical outcomes. In particular, we believe that  because Medicare reimbursed all hospitals in our analysis\u2014including  non-340B hospitals\u2014based on the drug's average sales price plus a fixed  percentage above the drug's average sales price, non-340B hospitals  would have no incentive to underprescribe Part B drugs.", "Second, HHS questioned our interpretation of the differences between  the average risk scores among the three hospital groups (1.50 for 340B  DSH hospitals vs. 1.45 and 1.36 for non-340B DSH and other non-340B  hospitals, respectively). HHS believes that the differences in risk scores  could represent a meaningful difference in the health status of  beneficiaries. We acknowledge that the differences in risk scores could  represent a difference in the health status of the beneficiaries served by  each hospital group. However, we believe that the relative difference  between the risk scores and the per beneficiary Part B drug spending at  340B DSH and non-340B hospitals indicates that the substantially higher  spending at 340B DSH hospitals may not be explained by differences in  patient health status. For example, based on the risk scores, overall  health care spending for beneficiaries who received Part B drugs at 340B  DSH hospitals in 2012 would have been expected to be, on average,   3.4 percent higher than overall health spending that year for beneficiaries  who received Part B drugs at non-340B DSH hospitals. In contrast,  spending for Part B drugs at 340B DSH hospitals was substantially  higher\u2014140 percent higher\u2014than spending at non-340B DSH hospitals.  While the spending expectation from the risk scores applies to overall  health care spending, not just Part B drug spending, the relative  percentage differences suggest that the higher spending at 340B DSH  hospitals may not be explained by differences in patient health status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "340B Health Comments", "paragraphs": ["340B Health noted several concerns related to the methodologies we  used for our analysis. However, we believe that our methods were sound,  as described below.  340B Health expressed concerns about the methodology we used to  examine the amount of charity care and uncompensated care provided by  hospitals. In particular, 340B Health stated that the data from worksheet  S-10 in the Medicare hospital cost reports that we used for this analysis  are too unreliable to serve as the basis for policy conclusions because the  data are not used by CMS to determine Medicare payments. However,  before we conducted our analysis, we confirmed with CMS that the  agency did not have any concerns about our use of the data in the S-10  worksheet for our analysis. In addition, we performed our own data  reliability assessment and concluded that the cost report data were  sufficiently reliable for our study. The Medicare cost report is collected  annually from all institutional providers that render services to Medicare  beneficiaries. Among other things, these reports contain self-reported  information on facility characteristics, utilization data, and financial  statement data. We used these data to describe various characteristics of  hospitals, including hospitals\u2019 self-reported levels of charity care and  uncompensated care.  340B Health also questioned whether our methods controlled for certain  reasons it might be appropriate for Medicare Part B spending to be  significantly higher at 340B hospitals. For example, they noted that 340B  hospitals are larger, more likely to be teaching hospitals, and more likely  to treat cancer patients or otherwise higher-risk patients. Our analyses  controlled for each of these characteristics. To control for the size of each  hospital, we calculated Part B drug spending at the per beneficiary level.  To control for the effect of teaching hospital status, we examined Part B  drug spending by teaching hospital level (major teaching, other teaching,  and nonteaching) and we found substantially higher Part B drug spending  at 340B DSH hospitals regardless of teaching status. To control for the  possibility that 340B DSH hospitals were more likely to treat cancer  patients, we conducted a separate analysis of Part B spending for  oncology drugs at 340B DSH and non-340B hospitals and found similar  results in spending.", "Although controlling for teaching status and conducting separate analyses  of oncology drug spending may have in part controlled for the treatment  of higher risk patients, we also conducted analyses to determine whether  patient health status at 340B DSH hospitals may explain the substantially  higher Part B drug spending at these hospitals. 340B Health expressed  concerns about the methodology we used in this analysis, noting that the  patient risk scores we used were not intended to predict Part B drug  spending\u2014which was a limitation we noted in our report. However, the  risk scores we used are an indication of the expected overall health care  spending for the beneficiaries served by the hospitals in our analysis, and  we found small differences in expected overall health care spending  across the hospital groups. As we noted above, we believe that the  relative difference between the risk scores and the per beneficiary Part B  drug spending at 340B DSH and non-340B hospitals indicates that the  substantially higher spending at 340B DSH hospitals may not be  explained by differences in patient health status. Additionally, in  expressing concerns about the risk score measures, 340B Health referred  to a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report that questioned the  usefulness of these measures for assessing expected spending for   However, the same report also stated that, on  individual beneficiaries.average, the risk scores are accurate predictors of patient health status,  and for our report, we calculated an average risk score for each hospital  group.  340B Health also questioned whether our exclusion of a group of  hospitals\u2014smaller, mostly nonteaching DSH hospitals that were in the  340B Program in 2012, but not in 2008\u2014from our spending analysis  might have skewed our findings. Our discussion in the report focused on  our analysis of hospitals that participated in the 340B program in both  2008 and 2012 to ensure a like-to-like comparison. However, although we  did not include a discussion of it in the report, we did separately examine  Part B drug spending at DSH hospitals that participated in the 340B  Program in 2012 but not in 2008. For example, we found that, in 2008,  Part B drug spending at these hospitals was similar to spending at other  non-340B DSH hospitals. However, in 2012, after the hospitals joined the  340B Program, Part B drug spending at these hospitals was 53 percent  higher than spending at non-340B DSH hospitals (and among the  nonteaching hospitals, spending at 340B DSH hospitals was 73 percent  higher than non-340B DSH hospitals). Furthermore, although spending  was higher at these 340B DSH hospitals in 2012, the average risk score  of patients treated at these hospitals (1.41) was slightly lower than the  average risk score of patients treated at non-340B DSH hospitals (1.45).  These findings indicate that, like those we included in our report, these  newer participants in the 340B program may have been responding to the  financial incentives in the program.", "Finally, 340B Health expressed concern that we did not attempt to review  patient outcomes or otherwise evaluate the quality of care provided to  beneficiaries at 340B DSH hospitals compared with non-340B hospitals  and cited research that found that increased use of outpatient drugs can  reduce spending on health services. However, the research 340B  Health cited was not focused on Part B drugs\u2014which are generally drugs  administered by a physician in a clinical setting\u2014but rather on the effects  of insurance coverage for prescription drugs on medical costs, so is not  directly relevant to our analysis. In addition, as we noted above, while we  did not attempt to evaluate health outcomes as part of our analysis, we  have no evidence to suggest that non-340B hospitals had an incentive to  provide a lower volume of Part B drugs than required to achieve positive  clinical outcomes due to the structure of Medicare\u2019s payment for Part B  drugs.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
