To meet this requirement, INS established the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC), whose pilot operations began in July 1994. When individuals arrested for aggravated felonies identify themselves as being foreign-born, the local law enforcement agency (LEA) sends a request to LESC to determine whether these individuals are aliens and, thus, possibly subject to deportation.

This phase is estimated to cost $1.4 million. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997, LESC will accept queries from California, New York, Florida, Texas, and Illinois in addition to Arizona. In its fiscal year 1996 budget, INS has requested 39 staff positions to operate LESC and estimates that LESC operating expenses will total $3.4 million and $3.6 million for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, respectively.", "An interim independent assessment of the LESC pilot operating results through February 1995 concluded that the LESC concept was viable and recommended that the pilot continue so that a full assessment can be made at the conclusion of the pilot test.

The INS Phoenix District Office provides investigative support for all LEAs in Arizona. In Phoenix, when individuals are arrested for aggravated felonies and identify themselves as foreign-born, the LEA official initiates a query to LESC. However, queries from Maricopa County (the largest LEA in Arizona) are not limited to aggravated felonies; they are initiated for all foreign-born individuals arrested for any offense. These queries are initiated automatically when information that an individual is foreign-born is entered into the booking terminal. INS officials told us that the decision to include all arrests was made because the LESC staff needed a much greater number of inquiries than it was receiving from the Phoenix police department so that they could more effectively test the mechanics of the LESC electronic computer system.", "The two LEAs initiate queries to LESC through the existing National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) network, which LEAs routinely use for interagency exchange of criminal justice and related information.

The search will either reveal that no information that matches the name and date of birth of the individual who has been arrested is available or will list the name or names of any persons in the databases who are possible matches. The LESC staff member compiles the information and teletypes a response to the LEA which states, \u201cThis is not an INS detainer.\u201d The response ends with the following message: \u201cFor further information, contact (agent\u2019s name), Phoenix INS , (agent\u2019s telephone number).\u201d The response from LESC travels back to the LEA over the same path that the initial query used.", "The LESC staff member concurrently sends a copy of the response to the INS Phoenix District Office. There, an investigator assigned to the pilot is responsible for analyzing the response. In the early months of the pilot, before Maricopa County was added, the INS investigator first obtained the paper files of the individuals proposed as possible matches.

The Phoenix investigator told us he could usually determine whether the individuals were aliens from interviews, since INS investigators are trained to identify aliens through interrogations.", "If the arrested person is identified as an alien subject to deportation, INS will issue a detainer, which requires the LEA to notify INS before releasing the individual from custody. Therefore, if the LEA plans to release individuals on bond or their own recognizance at any point in the criminal proceedings, INS will be notified in time to take these individuals into custody and begin the deportation process on the basis of any previous convictions or deportations.

LESC searches INS files using the name and date of birth of arrested individuals to attempt to match them with aliens in its databases. These searches are inconclusive because names and dates of birth in the files are not unique to an individual and can be easily falsified.", "Unlike LEAs, who establish criminal history files based on fingerprints, INS establishes paper and electronic files for aliens\u2014for both enforcement and service purposes\u2014based on the name, date of birth, and other personal information that an individual provides. However, some individuals may have the same or similar names and dates of birth as other persons. In addition, aliens who commit crimes often provide aliases and other false information in their encounters with INS. As a result, INS may unknowingly create multiple files for the same individual and, during a search by name, may not locate all information on the individual. In our statistical sample of 383 criminal aliens in DACS, we found that 317, or about 83 percent, had used one or more aliases and 184, or 48 percent, had supplied more than one birth date to INS. The following tables provide more detailed information on the use of multiple aliases and birth dates by the criminal aliens in our sample.", "From the inception of the LESC pilot in July 1994 through May 31, 1995, LESC received 6,738 queries. For 56 percent of the queries, no record was found in the electronic files. INS officials told us that the two major reasons why no records were found were that (1) the alien gave a different name or date of birth than that recorded in INS\u2019 databases or (2) the alien entered the country illegally and thus was not recorded in any of INS\u2019 databases. The automatic search process provided a possible match for about 10 percent of the queries. However, the LESC staff was able to provide possible matches for an additional 34 percent of the queries by searching each database separately using variations of the name. Then the INS investigator either reviewed the paper file or interviewed the individual to conclusively determine that the individual was an alien.", "The time required for LESC\u2019s electronic search and the subsequent investigation limits INS\u2019 ability to detain aliens arrested for aggravated felonies.

During this period, however, LEAs released 920 aliens that INS would have detained because INS did not identify them as aliens before bond was posted or they were released on their own recognizance.

In the second initiative, the California Department of Justice (CAL/DOJ) is flagging the state criminal histories of previously deported criminal aliens based on fingerprint cards supplied by INS. This allows LEAs to detain these individuals until INS takes them into custody.

CAL/DOJ reads INS\u2019 fingerprint cards into California\u2019s automated fingerprint processing system to compare these fingerprints to those in California\u2019s automated fingerprint database. For those for which there is a match, CAL/DOJ places an alert flag in the individual\u2019s state criminal history file.

INS has agreed to send a local INS agent to the LEA within 48 hours of being contacted to take custody of the individual. If the underlying offense does not dictate that the subject be prosecuted in California, INS takes the alien into custody for federal prosecution or deportation proceedings. This saves California the costs of custody and prosecution.

While these officials agreed with most of our findings and recommendations, they took issue with several points. First, the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement stated that we had misinterpreted the legislative mandate for INS contained in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 by stating that INS was required to immediately identify aliens arrested for aggravated felonies. He stated that under the congressional mandate, INS is only required to provide\u2014on a 24-hour basis\u2014federal, state, and local criminal justice entities with all available information it has on suspected aggravated felons at the time of their reported arrest with follow-up action to confirm identity and alien status in the course of the criminal justice process.", "We believe INS has misstated the content of our draft. We agree that the congressional mandate does not require INS to immediately determine whether arrested persons are aliens. Our draft stated only that INS is limited in its ability to take appropriate enforcement action against aliens who are arrested for aggravated felonies because of the lengthy time required by LESC to conduct the electronic search and by an INS investigator to conclusively identify the arrested individual as an alien. To more precisely reflect the language in the law, we have clarified the section of the report concerning INS\u2019 legislative mandate.", "Second, the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement expressed concern that the report repeatedly suggested that the LESC approach was flawed because of its use of name-based methodology and that the report failed to note that almost all law enforcement systems, including the FBI\u2019s NCIC, presently operate in this manner. Our report does point out that INS\u2019 existing name-based databases limit LESC\u2019s ability to make timely determinations of whether arrested persons are aliens. INS itself has acknowledged these same limitations and is, for this reason, developing IDENT, a fingerprint-based identification system to provide quick, accurate identification of individuals who will be processed for either enforcement or benefit purposes. While NCIC does provide for name searches, it differs from INS databases by relying on fingerprint-based information to establish case files. This reduces the risk\u2014that INS still faces\u2014of creating multiple files on an individual.", "INS officials disagreed with our recommendation regarding the evaluation of the LESC pilot.
