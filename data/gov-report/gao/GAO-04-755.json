The property databases for the six medical centers contained incomplete information. As a result, GAO could not select a statistical sample of test items so that results could be projected to each location's entire property universe. Key policies and procedures established by VA to control personal property provided facilities with substantial latitude in conducting physical inventories and maintaining their property management systems, which resulted in reduced property accountability. For example, VA's Materiel Management Procedures handbook allowed the person responsible for custody of VA property to attest to the existence of that property rather than requiring independent verification. Also, personnel at some locations interpreted a policy that established a $5,000 threshold for property that must be inventoried as a license to ignore VA requirements to account for lower cost items that are susceptible to theft or loss, such as personal computers and peripheral equipment. These weak practices, combined with lax implementation, resulted in low levels of accountability and heightened risk of loss. VHA personnel located fewer than half of the 100 items GAO selected at each of five medical centers and 62 of 100 items at the sixth medical center. The process for obtaining credit for recalled, expired, or deteriorated drugs was, in essence, an honor system. Each of the six pharmacies GAO visited used a contractor to return drugs to the manufacturer for credit, but only one of the pharmacies inventoried non-narcotic drugs before they were turned over to the contractor. None of the pharmacies had enough information about which drugs qualified for credit to be able to reconcile the credits they received with the drugs they had turned over to the contractor. There was no agency-level oversight of returned drug information to help identify improvements that might increase the credits that VA receives. At four of the six facilities, non-narcotic drugs held for return were stored in unsecured open bins accessible to anyone in the pharmacy. The combined lack of record keeping and physical controls over non-narcotic drugs held for return exposed them to potential loss, theft, or unauthorized use. Scheduled and actual hours worked by part-time physicians at the six locations GAO visited were not always documented in accordance with a January 2003 VHA directive. Five of the six locations had not prepared written work schedules for all part-time physicians as required. GAO found that latitude provided in the directive resulted in wide variation in procedures used by the six medical centers to verify physician compliance with work schedules. While some timekeepers used informal notes to record daily attendance, one facility required physicians to sign in. However, on the day of GAO's review, only two of 15 scheduled physicians had signed in. Attendance monitoring procedures at the six locations varied in frequency and included monitoring all part-time physicians once per quarter at one location and 5 percent of part-time physicians each month at another."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2003, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provided health  care to veterans through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)  medical programs at a cost of $27 billion.

The system was originally designed to  schedule preventive maintenance.  In 1996, the system was expanded to  incorporate the agency\u2019s previously separate property management  function, becoming the agency\u2019s official record of inventory for capitalized  and noncapitalized equipment.  VHA\u2019s Acquisition and Materiel  Management (A&MM) service maintains the property management portion  of the system while Engineering Services operates the property  maintenance portion.  The property management system includes a  detailed listing of the agency\u2019s personal property, providing information  that among other things, is (1) a control for the accuracy of property cost  information presented in the agency\u2019s financial report, (2) the basis for  physical inventories of agency personal property, and (3) the primary  control record for accountability over the agency\u2019s personal property.  The  system is used to prepare bar code labels that are affixed to nonexpendable  property acquired by VHA to identify items as VHA property and to provide  for efficient physical inventories using portable bar code readers.  The  property management software has been updated occasionally to  incorporate, for example, the addition of a disposal date capability and  changes in the agency\u2019s cost thresholds for property accountability and  capitalization.  A VHA official told us that once a property item is entered in  the system\u2019s database, a system application control retains the record, even  after disposal of the item.", "Pharmaceutical manufacturers allow VA a credit for certain drugs that are  returned.  Each manufacturer establishes its own criteria for issuing credit,  which can change at any time and differ among a single manufacturer\u2019s  products.  The differing criteria can include such attributes as units of  packaging and length of time between the return date and the expiration  date.  Some drugs are not returnable and must be destroyed if not used  before the expiration date.  To obtain available credits with minimal agency  resources, VA has arranged contracts with pharmaceutical returns vendors  that individual VHA medical facilities may utilize.  One hundred forty of  VHA\u2019s 160 medical centers use the services of Devos, Ltd., doing business  as Guaranteed Returns, to assist them in returning drugs for credit or  disposing of nonreturnable drugs in accordance with environmental  standards and preparing required paperwork to monitor the movement of  narcotic drugs.  Guaranteed Returns receives a percentage of credits issued  for returnable drugs and a fee based on weight for destruction of  nonreturnable drugs.", "VHA also uses the services of part-time physicians where necessary to  alleviate recruitment difficulties or when practicality would not indicate  full-time employees.  While VA policy states a part-time appointment  requires a tour of duty scheduled in advance that normally does not  significantly change from one pay period to another, it also provides that a  part-time physician whose other responsibilities make adherence to the  same schedule every pay period impractical may have an adjustable work  schedule. Part-time physicians with adjustable tours of duty have a  biweekly work requirement consisting of non-core hours that may be  adjusted at the request of the employee and core hours that are the days  and times when the employee must be present unless granted an  appropriate form of leave or excused absence.  VA policy requires core  hours to be at least 25 percent of total scheduled hours.  In April 2003, the  OIG reported that part-time physicians were not working the hours  established in their VA appointments.  A February 2004 follow-up report by  the OIG stated that while most part-time physicians were on duty as  required, 8 percent of the part-time physicians tested were not on duty or  on approved leave or authorized absence as scheduled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To gain an understanding of VHA\u2019s policies and procedures and the related  internal controls for the three areas of operation we assessed, to identify  key control activities, and to assess the design effectiveness of those  controls, we obtained and reviewed VA and VHA directives, handbooks,  and other policy guidance and reports issued by VA\u2019s OIG.

Table 1 summarizes the results of  our property observation tests at all locations we visited.  Each category of  items not observed is discussed below.", "Database errors or omissions represented 156 items that were not observed  ostensibly because of insufficient database information.  These errors  included assets for which the property database did not (1) indicate a  disposal date, though property officials told us the item had been disposed  of, or (2) did not indicate a location for the property item.  One property  official said the predecessor property control system had not included a  field for a disposal date, and when the program was modified to add that  capability, then-existing records were not updated.  Other database errors  included records that did not accurately identify the asset as building  service equipment, which represent items that are essentially part of  facility buildings rather than personal property, or entries with one  equipment identification number that represented several component  items constituting one system.", "At the Washington medical center, we could not locate three property  items, each valued at over $1 million, because of other data entry errors.   The explanation for two of the three items was that the assets were on  order but had not yet been received.  Center officials attributed these  errors to property personnel entering these assets into the property control  system prior to receipt.  For the third item, center officials informed us that  one bar code number had been issued for a system of several pill  dispensing machines, the components of which were at various locations  throughout the medical center and had a combined value over $1 million,  rather than bar coding each component and entering it in the property  record to provide a means of controlling each item.", "Inadequate labeling of property items prevented us from verifying the  identity of 17 items with a total acquisition cost of $29,463,952 selected  from the property records at four medical centers.  According to VA  officials, nonexpendable property costing $5,000 or more must be bar  coded and recorded in the property system.  However, none of these 17  items had bar code labels attached, and either serial number labeling was  also not attached to the asset or the serial number was not entered in the  property records.  For example, at the Tampa medical center, five property  items totaling $9,996,491, including a telephone operating system, two X- ray systems, and two components of an X-ray system, were inadequately  labeled.  Although items that we observed matched the general description  and location indicated by the property records for these items, we were  unable to specifically verify their identity because bar codes had not been  placed on the items and serial number information could not be compared  between the property records and the physical items.  When both bar code  and serial number information cannot be compared between the property  records and the property item, the physical inventory process is impaired  and property accountability is compromised.  Under these circumstances,  even the most effective physical inventory procedure cannot provide the  requisite assurance that assets are controlled adequately.", "Forty-two mobile or portable items, such as a wheelchair, adjustable bed,  and Intensive Care Unit module, also could not be located. Officials stated  that these items are moved from one location to another within the medical  centers to meet patients\u2019 needs.  At the Houston medical center, from our  selection of 100 items, property officials were unable to locate 13 portable  assets, totaling $19,997, before the end of our visit.  Some of these items  included patient beds, patient feeding pumps, and a portable defibrillator.", "Regarding the remaining 184 items, property officials at the six medical  centers could neither locate them at the time of our visits nor provide  documentation supporting the disposal, loan, or loss of the items, or  otherwise explain why they were not found.", "A 1997 addition to VA\u2019s Handbook 7127, \u201cMateriel Management  Procedures,\u201d established a $5,000 threshold for property that must be  inventoried.  The handbook stated that it is a local decision to maintain  inventory on \"other\" nonexpendable equipment not capitalized or  accounted for and also required accountability for sensitive property  regardless of cost.  Referring to the inventory provisions, A&MM staff at  four of the six locations we visited told us they were only accountable for  property items costing $5,000 or more and items in the four categories of  sensitive assets specifically identified by VA policy: handguns, ammunition,  canines, and automobiles.  By ignoring VA\u2019s general requirement to account  for sensitive property regardless of cost, property managers at those  locations did not keep the property control database current for most items  costing less than $5,000 and lost control of the items not tracked.  Medical  center property officials at two centers said we should not expect to locate  items with a cost lower than $5,000 because they do not inventory these  assets.  This practice means that some items, such as computers, monitors,  and other sensitive equipment, which by their nature are subject to theft,  loss, or conversion to personal use, are not inventoried or tracked.  Of the  184 items that were neither found nor had plausible explanations for not  being found, over half (95) were sensitive assets.  Table 2 shows the nature  of these 95 sensitive items categorized as personal computers, laptop  computers, scanners, printers, monitors, facsimile or copier machines, and  videocassette recorders.", "The Information Resources Management department (IRM) at the six  medical centers we visited had developed alternative procedures to  maintain accountability for computer equipment that cost less than $5,000.   However, we found many instances in which these procedures were not  used effectively.  For example, a separate listing prepared by the Los  Angeles center\u2019s IRM was not used to update the property location  information in the property control record, which showed the initial IRM  storage room instead of the final location to which computer equipment  was assigned.  Further, the IRM record was not kept up to date, a factor in  IRM personnel being unable to locate 22 of the 30 IRM items we selected  for observation.", "Our standards for internal control require that key duties be divided or  segregated among different people to reduce the risk of error or fraud.   However, one of the methods for taking physical inventory of property  established in VA\u2019s handbook provides that each party responsible for  property items will (1) receive a listing of accountable property items  charged to him or her according to the property management system;   (2) conduct a physical count; and (3) sign and date the listing, certifying the  existence of and continuing need for the property for which he or she was  responsible.  Allowing the party responsible for the custody of property  assets to attest to the existence of those same assets is contrary to the  segregation of duties standard and compromises the control provided by  taking an independent physical inventory.  To illustrate the minimal value  of such procedures, property officials at two medical centers told us that  some service line managers just sign the inventory list without verifying the  existence of the equipment.  These practices would result in creating or  perpetuating property control record errors if listed items had been lost,  stolen, loaned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of.  VA\u2019s handbook also  requires the involvement of A&MM officials in quarterly spot checks to  verify inventory accuracy, but A&MM officials at only two of the locations  we visited indicated they perform regular spot checks.", "A&MM staff at the Atlanta medical center told us they conducted periodic  inventories of personal property rather than delegating that control  function to parties responsible for the property.  They also told us that the  Atlanta facility considers computer equipment to be sensitive and,  therefore, accountable.  At this location, we observed 62 of 100 test items  compared to from 13 to 39 of the 100 items at each of the other five  locations we visited, all of which performed physical inventories primarily  by using equipment lists certified by property custodians.", "Subsequent to our visit, property officials from the San Francisco medical  center told us that they had located all equipment items with an acquisition  cost of $5,000 or more that we had selected for testing, and officials from  the Washington medical center told us they had located 10 additional items  that we selected for observation, one of which was over $5,000.  However,  because we were no longer on site and could not verify the existence of  these items, the additional found items are not incorporated in the  statistics we present.", "Agency officials provided us with a copy of proposed revisions to VA\u2019s  property policy guidance that address some of the weaknesses we  identified.  While the draft policy adds 27 specific categories of equipment  that would require accountability regardless of cost, including computer  equipment, it reduces the frequency of spot checks from quarterly to  semiannually and addresses the physical inventory segregation of duties  issue only minimally by requiring that 5 percent of inventory be verified by  disinterested parties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Controls over Process for Returning Drugs for Credit Was Weak", "paragraphs": ["Internal control over drugs held for return credit, which according to VHA  officials is left to the discretion of medical center management, provided  no assurance that the six pharmacies we visited were receiving the proper  amount of credits for returned drugs. All six of the pharmacies used  contractors to return the drugs, and agency officials said that using  contractors had increased the amount of credits VA received for returned  drugs.  However, all six locations lacked information about which drugs  qualified for credit, and only one pharmacy inventoried non-narcotic drugs  before they were turned over to the contractor. Accordingly, none of the  pharmacies had the basic information needed to verify that credits received  were correct and complete.  We also found that no analytical review of  credits for returned drugs, focused on maximizing the amount of credits  received, was performed at the location, network, or agency level.

VHA officials told us that  controls over returned drugs and related credits were left up to pharmacy  managers at individual medical centers.  However, we found that each of  the six medical centers we visited essentially used an honor system for  returning drugs to manufacturers for credit, relying on contractors that  collected and processed recalled, expired, or deteriorated drugs. The  contractors packaged the drugs at the medical centers and shipped them  either to the contractors\u2019 processing facilities or, if required by the  manufacturers, to the manufacturers\u2019 processing facilities.  For drugs  shipped to the contractors\u2019 facilities, the contractors (1) determined which  drugs were returnable; (2) returned drugs qualified for credit to the  manufacturers and destroyed the nonreturnable drugs; and (3) provided  the pharmacy an itemized list of drugs collected, and their disposition, and  an itemized estimate of credits to be received.  The drug manufacturers  determined the final amount of credits issued.  While reviewing  documentation for drugs that were returned by the six medical centers in  September 2002, we found none of the pharmacies had determined if they  received appropriate credit for the drugs they turned over to the  contractor.  Further, none of the pharmacies could determine if the credits  received were complete or correct because all lacked detailed information  about which drugs the manufacturers accepted for credit.   In addition,  none of the medical centers except Tampa maintained lists of non-narcotic  drugs turned over to the return drug contractor.", "Medical center pharmacy staff told us there are over 1,000 drug  manufacturers, each with its own policies for returning drugs for credit.   For example, one drug manufacturer might require that a drug be returned  30 days prior to its expiration to qualify for credit, another drug  manufacturer might allow a credit for a drug 30 days past its expiration,  and another might not allow credits at all.  Furthermore, a VA  pharmaceutical return contractor informed us that the manufacturers  frequently change their policies.  Consequently, medical center pharmacy  managers lacked information that would enable them to determine  whether the credits they received for returned drugs were correct.  As a  result, the pharmacies relied on the contractors\u2019 determination of the type  and quantity of drugs that were returnable and relied solely on the drug  manufacturers\u2019 determination of the final amount of credits issued for  returned drugs.", "In addition to establishing a return policy for drugs, each drug  manufacturer set its own requirements for the process of returning the  drugs and issuing credits.  Some drug manufacturers allowed the  pharmacy\u2019s contractor to process returned drugs and issued a credit  through the pharmacy\u2019s prime vendor.  Other manufacturers would only  accept returned drugs directly from VHA.  Our review of the estimated  credits for non-narcotic drugs returned in September 2002 showed most  were processed through each pharmacy\u2019s prime vendor.  Table 3 shows the  contractors\u2019 estimated value of credits to be received by the six medical  center pharmacies we visited for non-narcotic drugs returned during  September 2002.", "The return contractor informed us that if pharmacies requested, it could  provide a report on the actual credits issued through the prime vendor for  specific returned drugs.  None of the pharmacies we visited indicated they  were aware of this capability.  Using these reports might facilitate the  pharmacies\u2019 reconciliation of credits received with drugs returned.

For example, medical center pharmacy  managers we interviewed did not review the lists of drugs processed for  credit provided by the pharmaceutical return contractor to determine if  unusual trends occurred that might indicate an opportunity to increase  credits received.  Periodic analysis of drugs turned in throughout the year  could reveal whether specific drugs were not accepted for credit on a  recurring basis.  For instance, drugs being consistently turned in too late to  receive credit would indicate a need to process the drugs differently.  If  pharmacy managers reviewed actual returned drugs and credit data and  took necessary corrective action to optimize returns, the net cost of  pharmaceutical operations might be reduced.  For example, at the Los  Angeles pharmacy we found that 23 percent, or more than $60,000, of the  $274,000 estimated value of drugs returned in September 2002 did not  receive a credit because the drug expiration dates exceeded the  manufacturers\u2019 requirements.", "Medical center pharmacy officials stated that it was not cost effective to  perform any of these control activities for returned drugs.

The VA OIG reported that three employees of the  Houston medical center were convicted of conspiring to steal large  amounts of non-narcotic pharmaceutical drugs from the pharmacy.  These  employees had stolen over $1.3 million of drugs over 3 years.  At the  Washington, D.C., medical center, as discussed in our recent report on VHA  personnel screening procedures, we found that one employee of the  pharmacy had been convicted for possession of illegal drugs prior to VHA  employment.  While these incidents may not relate directly to drugs held  for return to manufacturers, they indicate the risks involved and  underscore the clear need for effective control over these drugs.  The  combination of weaknesses in record keeping and physical controls over  non-narcotic drugs held for return exposed them to potential loss, theft, or  unauthorized use."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Controls over Part-time Physician Time and Attendance Could Be Strengthened Further", "paragraphs": ["Our review of part-time physician time and attendance documentation for  the two pay periods ending in September 2003 showed that scheduled and  actual hours worked were not always documented according to policy at  the six medical centers we visited.

We also found that latitude  provided in VHA\u2019s Directive 2003-001, issued in January 2003, on time  and attendance of part-time physicians was a factor in the various ways the  six locations carried out part-time physician attendance monitoring  responsibilities.

Consistent with that management control  objective, VHA\u2019s January 2003 directive called for specifying work  schedules in writing in advance of the biweekly pay period, showing the  specific days and hours that part-time physicians were to work, including  core hours when employees working adjustable shifts must be present.   Our review showed that schedules were not always established in advance  of the pay period as required by VHA.  For the two pay periods ending in  September 2003, our review of records for 10 part-time physicians at each  of the six locations we visited revealed that only the Houston medical  center had documented preapproved schedules for all physicians whose  records we tested.  A contributing factor for this weakness was that an  official at one location told us part-time physicians with fixed schedules did  not require a documented preapproved schedule.  Almost one-third of the  part-time physician records that we reviewed did not include the required  documented schedule.  However, all those who had documented schedules  also had core hours established as required.  Table 4 summarizes the  results of our work regarding part-time physician policies and their  schedules at the centers we visited.", "Failure to document schedules can lead to confusion about when a  physician should be at work.  The VA OIG\u2019s February 2004 report on VA  medical center part-time physician time and attendance stated that 15 of 58  part-time physicians who were not present when scheduled during a 1-day  test said they had changed their hours without getting written approval.", "Our internal control standard regarding accurate recording of transactions  and events applies to the entire process or life cycle of a transaction or  event from initiation and authorization through its final classification in  summary records.  Our comparison of manually prepared time and  attendance records with computerized payroll system timecards indicated  no differences between total hours worked and total hours entered in the  payroll system for the cases we tested.  However, we found that when part- time physicians temporarily modified their approved work schedules, the  changes they noted on their forms 4-5631a, used to document, review, and  approve actual hours worked, were sometimes not entered in the  computerized payroll system.  At five of the six medical centers, we  compared information shown on the payroll system timecards to the forms  4-5631a that were signed by the part-time physicians, timekeepers, and the  physicians\u2019 supervisors.  At four of those five medical centers, we noted at  least one instance of a difference between the specific days and hours  worked shown on a part-time physician\u2019s form 4-5631a and that information  shown on the corresponding payroll system timecard.", "Timekeepers and other medical center officials told us that recording  temporary changes for actual time worked in VHA\u2019s computerized payroll  system is difficult because the system is inflexible.  As a result, if total  hours that a part-time physician actually worked during a pay period  equaled the total hours scheduled, timekeepers often entered the  physician\u2019s scheduled hours into the computerized payroll system rather  than the actual hours worked.  However, accurate payroll system  information about specific hours worked is important to satisfy VHA\u2019s need  to document whether part-time physicians fulfill their core hour  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Part-time Physician Attendance Varied by Location and Service", "paragraphs": ["Our standards for internal control state that an entity\u2019s documentation of  transactions and other significant events must be complete and accurate.   At the six medical centers we visited, we found variation in the design and  effectiveness of medical center procedures concerning the way supervisors  and timekeepers checked and documented daily employee attendance and  how facility management periodically monitored employee compliance  with time and attendance requirements.", "VHA\u2019s January 2003 directive on part-time physician time and attendance  referred to VA\u2019s underlying policy manual that established requirements for  supervisors or timekeepers to have personal knowledge that part-time  physicians worked the hours or days shown on their time and attendance  forms.  Timekeeping procedures that included keeping a record of each  physician\u2019s daily attendance throughout a pay period provided greater  reliability than those that relied on the physicians\u2019, their timekeepers\u2019, or  their supervisors\u2019 memories.  With working arrangements of part-time  physicians, their supervisors, and timekeepers that vary among the service  centers within a medical center, we found that the timekeepers at the  medical centers we visited accounted for daily attendance of physicians  using a wide variety of procedures.  While the Houston medical center  established a sign-in procedure for all part-time physicians, the other five  medical centers relied primarily on the timekeepers\u2019 observation of  physicians\u2019 daily attendance.  At those facilities, the procedures often  differed among service centers and included activities such as timekeepers  making informal notes on their personal calendars or preparing calendar- like worksheets to check off the names of each part-time physician when  he or she was observed at the center during a scheduled workday.  While  each process offered a level of control over time and attendance, they all  had limitations and none provided assurance that part-time physicians  were on duty during their core hours.", "For example, on the surface, a sign-in procedure would seem to offer more  definitive assurance; however, effectiveness depends on how well the  procedure is implemented.  On the day we reviewed part-time physician  sign-in sheets at the Houston medical center, we noted that only 2 of 15  physicians scheduled to work had signed in.  Timekeepers told us they  observed 5 other physicians in the facility and 1 had advance approval to  attend a lecture. However, the timekeepers also told us 2 other part-time  physicians scheduled to work had called in and stated that they were  \u201caccounted for,\u201d and the remaining 5 had not reported in or otherwise  confirmed their attendance.  Houston\u2019s failure to enforce its sign-in  procedures for its part-time physicians is an example of compromised  control effectiveness that impaired medical center management\u2019s ability to  know if part-time physicians worked when scheduled.", "While VHA\u2019s January 2003 directive identified medical center management\u2019s  responsibility for monitoring compliance with part-time physician time and  attendance policy, the methodology for implementing that responsibility  was left to the discretion of facility management.  Some of the  methodologies adopted were less effective than others.  For example, while  the Atlanta medical center service areas checked attendance for 5 percent  of part-time physicians one day each month, at the San Francisco center  service areas checked attendance of all part-time physicians at least one  day per quarter, and its Office of Human Resource Management made  random spot checks.  In addition to physical observation, other methods  used for making these periodic surveys of attendance at the six locations  included monitoring doctors logging into the facility\u2019s computer network,  monitoring doctors\u2019 notes entered into VHA\u2019s patient records system, and  paging doctors to determine if physicians used medical center telephones  to respond.", "The wide variety of part-time physician time and attendance procedures  that have been developed by the medical centers we visited reduces VHA  management\u2019s level of assurance that controls are effective and agency  objectives are being achieved.  We believe an opportunity exists for the  agency to study the various medical center and service area procedures so  that VHA can provide more specific direction about the most effective ways  to improve control over part-time physician time and attendance  agencywide."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The weaknesses in internal control that we identified at the six VA medical  centers we visited leave the agency vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse.   Improving the design and implementation of policies regarding personal  property will help improve accountability for agency assets, especially  sensitive property.  VHA managers performed no analytical oversight of  credits for returned drugs, and the six medical centers had no effective  control over the amount of credits for drugs returned to manufacturers.   Some analysis of drug return transactions would provide management with  a basis to determine what control activities would provide an appropriate  cost/benefit ratio.  Current policies and procedures for monitoring part- time physician time and attendance, if implemented more effectively, may  provide reasonable assurance that management\u2019s objectives will be met.  In  addition, the wide range of physician attendance monitoring procedures  developed by the various medical centers and service areas provides an  opportunity to improve controls agencywide if their relative effectiveness  is studied.
