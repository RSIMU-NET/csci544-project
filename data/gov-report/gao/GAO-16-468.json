Such spending has increased over the past 7 fiscal years, which has resulted in a $7.3 billion decline from fiscal years 2010 to 2017 in development, modernization, and enhancement activities.", "Specifically, 5,233 of the government's approximately 7,000 IT investments are spending all of their funds on O&M activities. Moreover, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to identify IT O&M expenditures known as non-provisioned services that do not use solutions often viewed as more efficient, such as cloud computing and shared services. Agencies reported planned spending of nearly $55 billion on such non-provisioned IT in fiscal year 2015. OMB has developed a metric for agencies to measure their spending on services such as cloud computing and shared services, but has not identified an associated goal. Thus, agencies may be limited in their ability to evaluate progress.", "Many O&M investments in GAO's review were identified as moderate to high risk by agency CIOs, and agencies did not consistently perform required analysis of these at-risk investments. Further, several of the at-risk investments did not have plans to be retired or modernized. Until agencies fully review their at-risk investments, the government's oversight of such investments will be limited and its spending could be wasteful.", "Federal legacy IT investments are becoming increasingly obsolete: many use outdated software languages and hardware parts that are unsupported. Agencies reported using several systems that have components that are, in some cases, at least 50 years old. For example, Department of Defense uses 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation's nuclear forces. In addition, Department of the Treasury uses assembly language code\u2014a computer language initially used in the 1950s and typically tied to the hardware for which it was developed. OMB recently began an initiative to modernize, retire, and replace the federal government's legacy IT systems. As part of this, OMB drafted guidance requiring agencies to identify, prioritize, and plan to modernize legacy systems. However, until this policy is finalized and fully executed, the government runs the risk of maintaining systems that have outlived their effectiveness. The following table provides examples of legacy systems across the federal government that agencies report are 30 years or older and use obsolete software or hardware, and identifies those that do not have specific plans with time frames to modernize or replace these investments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 16 recommendations, one of which is for OMB to develop a goal for its spending measure and finalize draft guidance to identify and prioritize legacy IT needing to be modernized or replaced.

We analyzed that data to determine whether spending had  changed over those years and compared OMB\u2019s associated performance  measure to federal best practices.", "We evaluated the extent to which the 12 selected federal agencies are  performing oversight on their existing legacy investments by reviewing  agency IT Dashboard data to identify investments in O&M that had been  identified as being moderate to high risk. We also reviewed agency  documentation such as TechStat documentation and operational  analyses, as available.", "To assess the age and obsolescence of federal IT, we reviewed agency  documentation, such as operational analyses and enterprise architecture  documents, and interviewed agency officials on issues related to legacy  investments. We also requested that the 12 agencies provide a list of  their three oldest systems. In some cases, agencies reported that they do  not track the ages of individual systems. In those cases, we requested  that the agency provide their three oldest IT investments. We also  compared OMB and agencies\u2019 current practices with federal guidance,  such as OMB\u2019s Circular No. A-11: Preparation, Submission, and  Execution of the Budget and its associated supplement on capital assets,  to determine whether OMB and agencies are adequately managing the  age and obsolescence of federal IT. In addition, we profiled selected  systems and investments. To select those, we selected a system or  investment that was identified as one of the agency\u2019s oldest or had been  identified as being at-risk. In particular, we selected one system or  investment per agency using factors such as investment type (major or  non-major), system or investment age, and risk level. We reviewed  agency documentation and interviewed agency officials on the profiled  systems or investments.", "To assess the reliability of the OMB budget data and IT Dashboard data,  we reviewed related documentation, such as OMB guidance on budget  preparation, capital planning, and IT Dashboard submissions.

For  example, to assist agencies in managing their investments, Congress  enacted the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. This act requires OMB to  establish processes to analyze, track, and evaluate the risks and results  of major capital investments in information systems made by federal  agencies and report to Congress on the net program performance  benefits achieved as a result of these investments. Most recently, in  December 2014, Congress enacted IT acquisition reform legislation  (commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition  Reform Act or FITARA) that, among other things, requires OMB to  develop standardized performance metrics, including cost savings, and to  submit quarterly reports to Congress on cost savings.", "In carrying out its responsibilities, OMB uses several data collection  mechanisms to oversee federal IT spending during the annual budget  formulation process. Specifically, OMB requires federal departments and  agencies to provide information related to their Major IT Business Cases  (previously known as exhibit 300) and IT Portfolio Summary (previously  known as exhibit 53).", "Major IT Business Case. The purpose of this requirement is to  provide a business case for each major IT investment and to allow  OMB to monitor IT investments once they are funded. Agencies are  required to provide information on each major investment\u2019s cost,  schedule, and performance.", "IT Portfolio Summary. The purpose of the IT portfolio summary is to  identify all IT investments\u2014both major and non-major \u2014and their  associated costs within a federal organization. This information is  designed, in part, to help OMB better understand what agencies are  spending on IT investments.", "OMB directs agencies to break down IT investment costs into two  categories: (1) O&M and (2) development, modernization, and  enhancement (DME). O&M (also known as steady state) costs refer to  the expenses required to operate and maintain an IT asset in a  production environment. DME costs refers to those projects and activities  that lead to new IT assets/systems, or change or modify existing IT  assets to substantively improve capability or performance.", "Beginning in 2014, OMB directed agencies to further break down their  O&M and DME costs to identify provisioned IT service costs. A  provisioned IT service is one that is (1) owned, operated, and provided by  an outside vendor or external government organization and (2) consumed  by the agency on an as-needed basis. Examples of provisioned IT service  could include cloud services or shared services from another federal  agency or a private service provider. About 8.5 percent of federal  agencies\u2019 planned spending for fiscal year 2016 has gone toward  provisioned IT services, leaving the vast majority of spending going  toward IT that is non-provisioned. Figure 1 shows the breakdown in  planned spending for fiscal year 2016.", "Further, OMB has developed guidance that calls for agencies to develop  an operational analysis policy for examining the ongoing performance of  existing legacy IT investments to measure, among other things, whether  the investment is continuing to meet business and customer needs. This  guidance calls for the policy to provide for an annual operational analysis  of each investment that addresses cost, schedule, customer satisfaction,  strategic and business results, financial goals, and innovation.", "Nevertheless, federal IT investments have too frequently failed or  incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to  mission-related outcomes. The federal government has spent billions of  dollars on failed and poorly performing IT investments which often  suffered from ineffective management, such as project planning,  requirements definition, and program oversight and governance.", "Accordingly, in February 2015, we introduced a new government-wide  high-risk area, Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and  Operations. This area highlights several critical IT initiatives underway,  including reviews of troubled projects, an emphasis on incremental  development, a key transparency website, data center consolidation, and  the O&M of legacy systems.", "To make progress in this area, we identified actions that OMB and the  agencies need to take. These include implementing the recently-enacted  statutory requirements promoting IT acquisition reform, as well as  implementing our previous recommendations. In the last 6 years, we  made approximately 800 recommendations to OMB and multiple  agencies to improve effective and efficient investment in IT. As of October  2015, about 32 percent of these recommendations had been  implemented."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB\u2019s Recent Major Initiatives for Overseeing IT Investments", "paragraphs": ["OMB has implemented a series of initiatives to improve the oversight of  underperforming investments and more effectively manage IT. These  efforts include the following:  IT Dashboard. In June 2009, to further improve the transparency into  and oversight of agencies\u2019 IT investments, OMB publicly deployed the  IT Dashboard. As part of this effort, OMB issued guidance directing  federal agencies to report, via the Dashboard, the performance of  their IT investments. Currently, the Dashboard publicly displays  information on the cost, schedule, and performance of over 700 major  federal IT investments at 26 federal agencies. Further, the public  display of these data is intended to allow OMB, other oversight  bodies, and the general public to hold the government agencies  accountable for results and progress. Among other things, agencies  are to submit ratings from their Chief Information Officers (CIO),  which, according to OMB\u2019s instructions, should reflect the level of risk  facing an investment relative to that investment\u2019s ability to accomplish  its goals. To do so, each agency CIO is to assess his or her IT  investments against a set of six pre-established evaluation factors  identified by OMB and then assign a rating of 1 (high risk and red) to 5  (low risk and green) based on the CIO\u2019s best judgement of the level of  risk facing the investment. Over the past several years, we have  made over 20 recommendations to help improve the accuracy and  reliability of the information on the IT Dashboard and to increase its  availability. Most agencies agreed with our recommendations or had  no comment.", "TechStat reviews. In January 2010, the Federal CIO began leading  TechStat sessions\u2014face-to-face meetings to terminate or turn around  IT investments that are failing or are not producing results. These  meetings involve OMB and agency leadership and are intended to  increase accountability and improve performance. OMB also  empowered agency CIOs to begin to hold their own TechStat  sessions within their respective agencies by June 2012. In June 2013,  we reported that OMB and selected agencies held multiple TechStats,  but additional OMB oversight was needed to ensure that these  meetings were having the appropriate impact on underperforming  projects and that resulting cost savings were valid. Among other  things, we recommended that OMB require agencies to address high- risk investments. OMB generally agreed with this recommendation.  However, as of October 28, 2015, OMB had only conducted one  TechStat review in the prior 2 years and OMB had not listed any  savings from TechStats in its quarterly reporting to Congress since  June 2012.", "Cloud computing strategy. In order to accelerate the adoption of  cloud computing solutions across the government, OMB\u2019s 25-Point IT  Reform Plan included a \u201cCloud First\u201d policy that required each agency  CIO to, among other things, implement cloud-based solutions  whenever a secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud option exists.  Building on this requirement, in February 2011, OMB issued the  Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, which provided definitions of  cloud computing services; benefits of cloud services, such as  accelerating data center consolidations; case studies to support  agencies\u2019 migration to cloud computing; and roles and responsibilities  for federal agencies. In April 2016, we reported, among other  things, that we had identified 10 key practices that if included in cloud  service agreements can help agencies ensure services are performed  effectively, efficiently, and securely. OMB\u2019s guidance, released in  February 2012, included most of the key practices, and we  recommended that OMB include all 10 key practices in future  guidance.", "PortfolioStat reviews. To better manage existing IT systems, OMB  launched the PortfolioStat initiative in March 2012, which requires  agencies to conduct an annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to,  among other things, reduce commodity IT spending and  demonstrate how their IT investments align with the agency\u2019s mission  and business functions. In 2013 and 2015 we reported that agencies  had the potential to save at least $3.8 billion through this initiative.  However, we noted that weaknesses existed in agencies\u2019  implementation of the initiative; therefore, we made more than 60  recommendations to OMB and agencies. OMB partially agreed with  our recommendations, and responses from 21 of the agencies varied,  with some agreeing and others not.", "IT Shared Services Strategy. In May 2012, OMB released its  Federal IT Shared Services Strategy. The strategy requires  agencies to use shared services\u2014IT functions that are provided for  consumption by multiple organizations within or between federal  agencies\u2014for IT service delivery in order to increase return on  investment, eliminate waste and duplication, and improve the  effectiveness of IT solutions. Examples of commodity IT areas to  consider migrating to a shared environment, as described in the  strategy, include software licenses, e-mail systems, and human  resource systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Has Reported on the Need to Improve Oversight of Legacy IT", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on legacy IT and the need for the federal  government to improve its oversight of such investments. For example, in  October 2012, we reported on agencies\u2019 operational analyses policies  and practices. As previously mentioned, operational analysis is a key  performance evaluation and oversight mechanism required by OMB to  ensure O&M investments continue to meet agency needs. In particular,  we reported that although OMB guidance called for agencies to develop  an operational analysis policy and perform such analyses annually, the  extent to which the selected five federal agencies we reviewed carried out  these tasks varied significantly. Specifically, the Departments of  Homeland Security (DHS) and Health and Human Services (HHS)  developed policies and conducted analyses, but excluded key  investments and assessment factors. The Departments of Defense  (Defense), the Treasury (Treasury), and Veterans Affairs (VA) had not  developed a policy or conducted operational analyses. As such, we  recommended that the agencies develop operational analysis policies,  annually perform operational analyses on all investments, and ensure the  assessments include all key factors. Further, we recommended that OMB  revise its guidance to include directing agencies to post the results of  such analyses on the IT Dashboard. OMB and the five selected agencies  agreed with our recommendations and have efforts planned and  underway to address them. In particular, OMB issued guidance in August  2012 directing agencies to report operational analysis results along with  their fiscal year 2014 budget submission documentation (e.g., exhibit 300)  to OMB. Thus far, operational analyses have not yet been posted on the  IT Dashboard.", "We further reported in November 2013 that agencies were not conducting  proper analyses. Specifically, we reported on IT O&M investments and  the use of operational analyses at selected agencies and determined that  of the top 10 investments with the largest spending in O&M, only the DHS  investment underwent an operational analysis. DHS\u2019s analysis addressed  most, but not all, of the factors that OMB called for (e.g., comparing  current cost and schedule against original estimates). DHS officials  attributed this to the department still being in the process of implementing  its new operational analysis policy. The remaining agencies did not  assess their investments, which accounted for $7.4 billion in reported  O&M spending. Agency officials cited several reasons for not doing so,  including relying on budget submission and related management reviews  that measure performance; however, OMB has noted that these are not a  substitute for an operational analysis. Consequently, we recommended  that seven agencies perform operational analyses on their IT O&M  investments and that DHS ensure that its analysis was complete and  addressed all OMB factors.

Appendix II provides detailed information on agency spending on  operations and maintenance from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2015.", "According to agency officials, reasons for the increase in O&M spending  include the recent shift of major systems from DME to O&M (as the  investment completed development activities and began O&M activities);  and rising costs to maintain legacy IT infrastructure, such as those that  use older programming languages. They also noted that improved  reporting (i.e., ensuring that O&M expenditures were properly reported as  O&M instead of as DME) has made it appear that O&M spending has  increased.", "For example, a DHS official in the Office of the CIO stated that one  reason for the increased spending on O&M as a percentage of its total is  because initially DHS had high DME spending to setup the agency, but  now that the major parts of the agency are established, the funding has  shifted to O&M. DHS officials stated that they anticipate future increases  in DME funding as prioritized IT modernization efforts are approved and  funded. Further, an official in Department of State\u2019s (State) Bureau of  Information Resource Management stated that the increase is largely due  to increased costs of maintaining the infrastructure, including meeting  security requirements. Moreover, VA officials stated that updates to its  technology are the primary reason for the increase in spending. In  addition, an official in HHS\u2019s Office of the CIO stated that the increased  spending on O&M was largely due to grants to states and local entities for  new programs, such as the Affordable Care Act.", "Conversely, several agencies have decreased spending on O&M. For  example, as we have previously reported, the Department of Energy  (Energy) reduced spending by approximately $300 million, which it  attributed to the reclassification of high performance computers from the  IT portfolio to facilities. According to Energy officials, these investments  were re-categorized because they include both supercomputers and  laboratory facilities. Similarly, the Department of Commerce  (Commerce) reduced spending by approximately $110 million and  attributed it to the reclassification of satellite ground systems from its IT  portfolio. In making this decision, Commerce determined that it needed to  refocus oversight efforts to a more appropriate level and consequently  minimized the role of the CIO and others in the oversight of satellites. We  disagreed with these reclassifications, and reported that they run contrary  to the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which specifies requirements for the  management of IT. Further, we reported that by gathering incomplete  information on IT investments, OMB increases the risk of not fulfilling its  oversight responsibilities, of agencies making inefficient and ineffective  investment decisions, and of Congress and the public being misinformed  as to the performance of federal IT investments. We recommended that  Energy and Commerce appropriately categorize their IT investments, but  both agencies disagreed.", "A policy analyst within OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government and Information  Technology expressed concern when agencies, or their bureaus, spend a  low percentage of their IT funds on DME. The analyst further stated that  this could indicate that the agency\u2019s maintenance costs are reducing its  flexibility and the agency or bureau is unable to innovate. For example, 5  of the 26 agencies that report to the IT Dashboard reported spending less  than 10 percent on DME activities in fiscal year 2015 (see table 3).", "Further, 34 percent of bureaus (i.e., 51 of the 151) spent less than 10  percent on DME. For more details on the bureaus spending less than 10  percent on DME activities, see appendix III.", "According to agency officials, reasons for these bureaus\u2019 low spending on  DME include the size and mission of the bureau (e.g., smaller bureaus do  not perform much DME work), as well as several bureaus having recently  completed major DME work that is now in the O&M phase. Further,  according to Commerce officials, one of their bureaus had no actual IT  systems in its budget, as its IT has been absorbed by headquarters, and  thus any DME spending is part of the Office of IT Services\u2019 budget.", "OMB staff in the Office of E-Government and Information Technology  have recognized the upward trend of O&M spending and identified  several contributing factors, including (1) the support of O&M activities  requires maintaining legacy hardware, which costs more over time, and  (2) costs are increased in maintaining applications and systems that use  older programming languages, since programmers knowledgeable in  these older languages are becoming increasingly rare and thus more  expensive. Further, OMB officials stated that in several situations where  agencies are not sure whether to report costs as O&M or DME, agencies  default to reporting as O&M. According to OMB, agencies tend to  categorize investments as O&M because they attract less oversight,  require reduced documentation, and have a lower risk of losing funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Less than a Quarter of Federal IT Spending Is Categorized as Provisioned", "paragraphs": ["OMB encourages agencies to adopt provisioned IT services, such as  cloud computing and shared services, to make IT more efficient and agile,  and enable innovation.
