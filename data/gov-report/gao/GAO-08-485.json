Congress required GAO to report on employment of such officials by contractors who received more than $500 million in DOD's 2005 contract awards. In response, this report (1) provides information on how many former DOD employees worked for contractors in 2006 and estimates how many worked on contracts that were related to their former agencies or to their direct responsibilities and (2) identifies the practices used to monitor restrictions and information challenges in monitoring post-DOD employment. To do this work, GAO matched data from DOD for all employees who left DOD over a 6 year period with data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and from 52 contractors; conducted surveys; and interviewed DOD and contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, 52 contractors employed 2,435 former DOD senior and acquisition officials who had previously served as generals, admirals, senior executives, program managers, contracting officers, or in other acquisition positions which made them subject to restrictions on their post-DOD employment. Most of the 2,435 former DOD officials were employed by seven contractors. On the basis of a stratified random sample of contractor-supplied information, GAO estimates that at least 422 former DOD officials could have worked on defense contracts related to their former agencies and that at least nine could have worked on the same contracts for which they had oversight responsibilities or decision-making authorities while at DOD. The information GAO obtained from contractors was not designed to identify violations of the restrictions. While contractors could have employed quite a few former DOD officials on assignments related to their prior DOD positions, there could be appropriate justification for each of these situations. Most of the contractors who responded to our survey reported using a range of practices to ensure awareness and compliance with post-government employment restrictions, although GAO's request proved challenging for contractors to provide accurate information identifying their former DOD officials. According to the surveyed contractors, they can identify former DOD officials with post-government employment restrictions and track their assignments during their cooling-off periods. However, GAO's analysis found a significant under-reporting of the contractors' employment of former DOD officials. Specifically, contractor-supplied data showed they employed 1,263 former DOD officials in 2006, while IRS data showed the contractors employed 2,435. New post-government employment requirements enacted in January 2008 are likely to make written ethics opinions for former DOD officials more readily available to contractors. DOD also must now keep ethics opinions in a central database. This information was not designed to provide a mechanism for DOD to effectively monitor former DOD officials' post-government employment compliance after they begin working for contractors on specific contracts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, civilian and military personnel leave the Department of Defense  (DOD) and go to work for contractors that do business with DOD\u2014 sometimes the same contractors they were working with before leaving  DOD.

The laws seek in part to protect against  conflicts of interest\u2014such as former DOD officials using their DOD  contacts to the benefit of the contractor to the detriment of the  government. The laws also seek to promote public trust in the integrity of  the government\u2019s decision-making process, which facilitates the award of  contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Violation of  these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties for former DOD  officials and, in some circumstances, the defense contractors that employ  them.", "Beginning as early as 1969, efforts to maintain public trust and monitor  compliance with post-government employment restrictions have included  laws requiring certain former DOD officials to self-report their  employment with defense contractors for up to 2 years after leaving DOD  and requiring contractors to report annually on the employment of these  former officials to various DOD ethics offices. Several of our reports on  these past strategies to make post-DOD employment with defense  contractors more transparent to DOD, the most recent in 1990, found  problems with the implementation and enforcement of those reporting  requirements, and questioned the extent to which former DOD officials or  defense contractors complied with them and the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s  monitoring. Congress repealed these reporting requirements in 1995 when  enacting new provisions to impose a 1 year compensation ban for former  procurement officials with certain contractors and provide ethics advice  and counseling concerning applicable employment restrictions for  subsequent work for contractors.", "More recently, our work and the work of others have raised concerns that  the monitoring of former DOD officials\u2019 compliance with post-government  employment restrictions may be inadequate. Congress included a  provision in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2007 requiring us to report on recent employment of former  DOD officials by major defense contractors. In response, this report        (1) provides information on how many former DOD military and civilian  personnel worked for major defense contractors in 2006 and an estimate  of how many of these were former DOD senior or acquisition officials who  worked on defense contracts for these employers that were the  responsibility of their former agency or their direct responsibility at DOD  and (2) identifies the practices used to monitor compliance with post- government employment restrictions and the information challenges that  contractors and DOD face in monitoring the movement of former DOD  employees to defense contractors.", "To conduct this work and based on our analysis of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2005  contract award data, we focused on 52 contractors we identified for  review of post-government employment of former DOD officials. To  determine how many former DOD officials worked for these 52  contractors, as agreed with your offices, we matched personnel data from  DOD for all military and civilian employees who left DOD service in a         6 year period since January 2001 (including about 35,000 former DOD  senior and acquisition officials) with (1) taxpayer data from the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) and (2) personnel data from the contractors on  individuals they directly compensated in 2006 as employees, independent  contractors, consultants, or members of their boards of directors. To  estimate how many former DOD officials subject to post-government  employment restrictions these contractors may have assigned to work on  DOD contracts related to their former DOD positions, we drew a stratified  random sample of former DOD officials for whom contractor-provided  information indicated direct employment in 2006 and used a questionnaire  to obtain job histories (both DOD and contractor) from their contractor  employers.", "To identify practices major defense contractors report using to comply  with post-government employment restrictions, we surveyed all 52  contractors on personnel assignment record-keeping, practices for  identifying, screening, and tracking former DOD officials, and training for  employees on post-government employment restrictions. We analyzed  responses from 47 contractors who responded to the survey, but we did  not corroborate or test contractors\u2019 self-reported practices for  effectiveness. To identify monitoring challenges, we analyzed the extent to  which contractors were able to submit sufficient information to us on how  many former DOD officials worked for them in 2006 and provide us with  copies of DOD\u2019s written ethics opinions and related job histories for a  random sample of former DOD officials. It should be noted that there is no  statutory or regulatory requirement that a contractor collect, have, or  maintain this information. We also met with DOD ethics and procurement  policy officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense to discuss DOD\u2019s  practices and information challenges for monitoring former DOD officials  employed by defense contractors. We conducted this performance audit  from November 2006 through May 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.

There are  acknowledged benefits to employing former government officials for both  DOD and defense contractors; for example, former DOD officials bring  with them the knowledge and skills in acquisition practices they have  developed at DOD which also benefit DOD when communicating with  these contractor personnel. However, a major concern with post- government employment has been that senior military and civilian officials  and acquisition officials working for defense contractors immediately after  leaving DOD could lead to conflicts of interest and affect public  confidence in the government by creating the following perceptions,  among others:    DOD personnel who anticipate future employment with a defense  contractor might be perceived as using their position to gain favor with  the contractor at the expense of the government, and  former DOD personnel who work for a defense contractor might be  perceived as using their contacts with former colleagues at DOD to the  benefit of the defense contractor and to the detriment of the public."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Implementation of Post- Government Employment Laws", "paragraphs": ["The principal restrictions concerning post-government employment for  DOD and other federal employees after leaving government service are  found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 (post-employment conflict of interest) and            41 U.S.C \u00a7 423 (restrictions on former officials\u2019 acceptance of  compensation from a contractor).

The law restricts former DOD acquisition  officials from accepting compensation from a defense contractor  during a 1 year cooling-off period. Specifically, this provision prohibits  employment with a contractor if the acquisition official performed  certain duties at DOD involving the contractor and a contract valued in  excess of $10 million.

In our view, and DOD ethics  and procurement officials agree, the information currently  available to  DOD from providing written ethics opinions to former DOD senior and  acquisition officials who request them regarding prospective employment   restrictions has  limited utility for monitoring compliance with post- government employment restrictions once former DOD officials go to  work for defense contractors for several reasons:    while officials have been encouraged to seek an ethics advisory  opinion, they were not required to obtain them, nor were contractors  required to ask for them;    DOD\u2019s record-keeping for its written ethics opinions is decentralized at  the many defense ethics offices that issued them; and    DOD lacks a mechanism for providing the information to contracting  officers or program managers for a particular contract.", "Nonetheless, for DOD\u2019s purposes, ethics advisory opinions may now be  more readily available and centrally located because of the 2008 defense  authorization act provision that requires former officials to obtain written  ethics opinions on applicable post-government employment restrictions  from their DOD ethics officials before accepting compensation from  defense contractors for a period of 2 years after leaving DOD service.  DOD also has a new record-keeping requirement to retain each request  and each written opinion provided in a central database or repository for  at least 5 years.", "While this requirement may help to increase transparency over which  former officials are working with contractors and what may raise a  potential conflict of interest, its utility may be limited because information  is not being tied to specific contracts.  Senior ethics officials in DOD\u2019s  Standards of Conduct Office and the director of Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy and Strategic Sourcing (DPAP), for example, told us  that DOD currently does not have a mechanism to link information on  former officials\u2019 post-DOD work for their new employers for specific  defense contracts that are pending or awarded before their former  agencies, offices, or commands.  They believed that such a mechanism  would be valuable to program managers and contracting officers who  need to ensure that contracted work being done in their programs is free  of conflicts.  They also believed that such a mechanism would be relatively  cost-effective to implement.  After learning of the results of our data  collection efforts, in fact, these officials were concerned that current  mechanisms do not provide DOD a clear picture of how many former  officials are working with contractors and what risks of conflicts are  present."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The public needs to be assured that decisions related to the hundreds of  billions of dollars spent each year on defense contracts comply with the  applicable post-government employment restrictions and are free of  conflicts of interest.  But this task is highly challenging when it comes to  monitoring whether former DOD officials are in compliance with these  rules or have a conflict of interest by working for a defense contractor.     Our review illustrated aspects of this challenge, including difficulties  associated in collecting data on thousands of employees working for just  52 contractors.  It is likely our surveys would have been more difficult to  accomplish if they had been applied to the entire spectrum of defense  contractors, which includes hundreds of small companies that may not  have automated or complete information on their employees.", "Further, requirements that have been imposed in the past to collect  information on former DOD officials working for contractors have not  been effective for a variety of reasons.  These include difficulties  associated with asking private citizens to report back to the government  on their employment for extended periods of time and disparities in the  way information was collected and reported.  Moreover, when information  was collected, its value was limited, according to DOD officials, because it  could not be tied to specific programs or contracts, where it could inform  those responsible for ensuring integrity at the front line of acquisitions.   Despite these challenges, there may be ways that more accurate and useful  information could be collected, for example, by asking potential  contractors to certify that their employees are in compliance with post- government employment restrictions when contracts are being awarded.   The results of our review\u2014particularly results relating to the estimated  numbers of former DOD senior and acquisition officials who could be  working in areas that tie back to their work at DOD\u2014show that examining  such options is worthwhile."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide greater transparency during the acquisition process given the  fact that former DOD officials can and do work on defense contracts  related to their prior agencies or their direct responsibilities, the risk of  conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest, and the  need to maintain public trust in the integrity of defense contracting, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) to consider the relevant  recent statutory changes and determine if changes in procurement policy  are needed to impose additional reporting requirements or other  requirements  to guard against violations of the government\u2019s post- employment rules.  For example, DOD could consider requiring defense  contractors who are awarded a contract, within a set number of days after  contract award, to (1) disclose to the contracting officer the names of  employees who are certain former DOD officials (e.g., civilian senior  executives, high-level military officers, or acquisition officials) who  worked on the response to the solicitation and (2) certify that these  employees are in compliance with the applicable post-government  employment restrictions. In addition, after assessing the benefits and costs  associated with the certification process, DOD could consider whether  and to what extent it should apply a similar mechanism throughout the  term of the contract.

This  report does not address any government employment restrictions which  might be applicable when former private sector employees are employed  by DOD or other federal government agencies.

To identify  those contractors, we analyzed data on the values of contracts awarded to  all companies from DOD\u2019s Statistical Information Analysis Division. As a  result, we identified the 52 contractors meeting the major defense  contractor criteria to include in our review. As shown in table 10, which  ranks the 52 major defense contractors by the value of their fiscal year  2005 DOD contract awards, these companies accounted for more than half  of DOD\u2019s total contract awards in 2005\u2014$142.8 billion of the total        $269.2 billion.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2006 through        May 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Through initial discussions with five of the major defense  contractors and the IRS, we determined that data on former DOD officials\u2019  employment were reasonably available for 2006.  To determine how many  military and civilian personnel left DOD service, as agreed with committee  staff, we limited our analysis to data from the Defense Manpower Data  Center\u2019s databases for all military and civilian employees who left DOD  service for any reason other than being deceased in a 6-year period  between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2006 (N=1,857,004). We  determined that data from the data center were sufficiently reliable to  accurately support our analysis in support of this objective.", "DOD\u2019s data included personally-identifiable characteristics for each  former employee such as name, social security number (SSN), end date of  employment, branch of service, military rank, civilian grade, and if the  employee\u2019s job specialty was coded as any of the several defense  acquisition workforce positions. To analyze defense contractors\u2019 post- government employment for a subgroup of former DOD senior and  acquisition officials, we used DOD\u2019s personnel data to include in the  subgroup the following range of former DOD officials: senior officials such  as military officers ranked O-7 and above (e.g., generals, admirals) and  members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) regardless of whether  they also were coded as serving in a defense acquisition workforce  position. Acquisition officials include military (from O-3 to O-6) and  civilian (from grades GS-12 through 15) officials for which DOD coded  their status as members of its acquisition workforce, including program  managers, deputy program managers, and contracting officers (N=35,192  individuals).", "To determine how many of the 1,857,004 former military and civilian  personnel (including the 35,192 former DOD senior and acquisition  officials) worked for the 52 major defense contractors in 2006, we  matched DOD\u2019s personnel data with (1) income tax data from IRS and     (2) personnel data from the contractors on former DOD senior or  acquisition officials they directly compensated in 2006 as employees or  independent contractors.", "The data obtained from IRS included Form W-2 and Form 1099- Miscellaneous information. We used data from the returns identifying the  contractor who submitted the income tax data and the SSN and name for  all individual taxpayers for whom the 52 major defense contractors  reported taxable income for the 4-year period between 2003 and 2006.  Because contractor-supplied data identified DOD officials they hired  between 2004 and 2006, we compared SSNs from 2003 income tax data to  the 2006 income tax data and eliminated SSNs for individuals that matched  because this showed the contractors hired those individuals prior to 2004.", "We also obtained data from 51 of the 52 contractors on individuals who we  or they matched to our criteria for former DOD senior and acquisition  officials they compensated in 2006 and hired between 2004 and 2006.  Contractors were permitted to provide the SSNs for either (1) all  individuals compensated in 2006 and hired in the 3-year period between  2004 and 2006 or (2) the individuals they identified as matching our  criteria for being a former DOD senior or acquisition official and hired  between 2004 and 2006. In either case, we analyzed the contractors\u2019 SSN  data to match against the SSNs in DOD\u2019s personnel data.", "From the matches we determined that 1,263 individuals matched our  criteria as former DOD senior and acquisition officials. For each of the 51  contractors who provided us this SSN data, we assessed the accuracy and  completeness of their information by analyzing how many former DOD  senior and acquisition officials their information showed were employed  in 2006 (N=1,263) compared with our analysis of IRS data for the same  purpose (N=2,435). We based our analysis of demographic data for this  objective on the IRS and DOD data.", "To develop an estimate of how many of the former DOD senior or  acquisition officials subject to post-government employment restrictions  the major defense contractors assigned to work on defense contracts  related to their former DOD agencies or their direct responsibilities, as  shown in table 11, we used the contractor-identified population of 1,263  individuals. To ensure that we had adequate representation of these  officials from contractors with fewer former DOD officials, we stratified  the population into two strata based on the number of former DOD  officials reported by each contractor as employees\u2014contractors reporting  50 or more former DOD officials were assigned to one stratum and  contractors reporting less than 50 former DOD officials were assigned to  another stratum.

Recognizing that the contractors responding to our survey were self- reporting on a sensitive issue, the information sought from contractors  was not designed or expected to identify specific violations of post- government employment restrictions. Instead, the survey also asked  contractors for information on circumstances surrounding the post-DOD  work in relationship to prior DOD positions and responsibilities.
