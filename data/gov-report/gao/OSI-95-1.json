The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 clarified or expanded RTC\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s responsibilities for resolving failed thrifts and banks. As of April 25, 1994, RTC was responsible for resolving 743 thrifts. From fiscal year 1990 to May 19, 1994, FDIC was responsible for resolving 465 failed banks. Under the RTC Completion Act, RTC is to cease operating by December 31, 1995. After that date, FDIC will become responsible for (1) resolving the thrifts that fail after June 30, 1995, and (2) completing the disposition of thrift assets remaining in RTC\u2019s inventory.", "When RTC assumes control of an institution, its Office of Investigations and its Legal Division\u2019s Professional Liability Section work together. They determine which institution officers and directors, if any, are responsible for, or culpable in, the losses that resulted in the institution\u2019s failure. Once these administrative determinations are made, RTC generally then files a professional liability suit or submits a criminal referral naming the culpable individuals. FDIC operates in much the same manner.", "Between its inception and June 30, 1994, RTC filed 245 professional liability suits against directors and officers, of which 181 are pending, and made 1,134 criminal referrals to the Department of Justice.

First, the databases are incomplete: Names of culpable individuals against whom legal action was not cost-effective are not always included in Corporation databases, and criminal referral listings to the Department of Justice are incomplete. Second, configuration of the Corporation databases constrains their usefulness in locating names of culpable individuals. Third, one RTC database incorrectly lists individuals as culpable when they are not.

After we compared all FDIC criminal referrals filed with Justice for one failed bank with an FDIC listing of all criminal referrals filed in the past 5 years, we found over half missing from the FDIC listing. FDIC had filed criminal referrals against eight individuals from the failed bank between November 1990 and February 1991, yet only three of the names were on its criminal referral listing. As a result, if the Corporations had performed employment screening, they would have been unaware of the culpability of the five not on the listing. FDIC acknowledged that the criminal referral listing, which came from a database not designed for employment screening, is not appropriate for this purpose due to the number of errors it contains.", "A similar situation exists with the RTC databases. RTC acknowledged that because each RTC region is responsible for entering its own data, some may not have entered all of the professional liability suit and criminal referral data necessary to make this database an integral part of an accurate screening system. This inconsistent reporting occurs because each region has discretion about how much information is placed in the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Format/Organization of Databases Make Employment Screening Difficult", "paragraphs": ["The Corporations\u2019 databases lack systematic means to identify culpable individuals, and the organization of FDIC\u2019s database of professional liability suits constrains its usefulness.

To perform our verification when social security numbers were not available, we requested individuals\u2019 home addresses and dates of birth from the Corporations. These were sometimes available only on documents maintained by outside legal counsel.", "Further, the organization of FDIC\u2019s professional liability suit database, containing over 1,500 individuals\u2019 names, is such that it constrains the usefulness of the database for employment screening. It does not have the capability to retrieve defendants by name. Instead, this database, which FDIC officials acknowledged would be difficult to use for employment screening, identifies failed institutions resolved by FDIC, each followed by a list of defendants\u2019 names.

However, early notification would allow managers to evaluate and determine, in a timely manner, whether to restrict the employees\u2019 duties and responsibilities or to evaluate their employment status. Such action would help limit the Corporations\u2019 vulnerability to fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.", "For example, RTC hired an individual in January 1990 as a credit specialist to manage a conservatorship institution with $1.9 billion in assets. RTC filed a professional liability suit against him in December 1992. Being unaware of the suit, a senior manager at the regional RTC office offered the employee a new position (and a paid move) 4 days after RTC had filed the professional liability suit. In fact, the manager did not learn of the suit for 11 days after making the offer (15 days after RTC had filed suit). After learning of the suit on December 28, 1992, the manager acted to limit RTC\u2019s vulnerability: He restricted the individual from all RTC offices and placed him on a fully paid administrative-leave status for approximately 1 month until his employment was to expire because the local RTC office was closing. Previously, the credit specialist\u2019s duties included (1) providing guidance, direction, and control to the institution through the documentation and inventory of assets; (2) directing the sale of owned real estate and loans; and (3) assuming, in the absence of the managing agent in charge of the RTC conservatorship institution, the responsibilities and delegated authorities of the managing agent.", "In another instance, RTC filed a professional liability suit against the Vice President for Loan Workout (a conservatorship employee) at an RTC conservatorship institution having over $200 million in assets. Following the filing of the suit in December 1992, RTC sent a letter to the individual\u2019s residence requesting that he resign. RTC did not inform the managing agent in charge of the RTC conservatorship institution where the vice president worked of either the suit or the letter. According to the managing agent, he was unaware that RTC had determined the vice president to be responsible for the failure of an institution until the employee showed him a copy of the RTC letter. The managing agent thus had no opportunity to consider revising the vice president\u2019s duties and limiting RTC\u2019s vulnerability. A Virginia newspaper published an article about RTC\u2019s employment of the vice president. The article, entitled \u201cThrifts: From One Failure to Another,\u201d stated that when RTC filed suit against the individual, it did not have to look far for the defendant as he was working a block away at another failed thrift being managed by RTC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RTC/FDIC Policy Unclear as to What Action to Take Regarding Those Found Culpable", "paragraphs": ["In January 1994, RTC issued a policy covering civil service employees determined to be culpable in the losses of failed institutions.

Thus, the policy provides neither the direction nor the clear guidance that managers need when deciding (1) to hire an individual previously found culpable for the failure of an institution or (2) what personnel action, if any, should be taken against current employees whom the Corporations have found culpable.", "Similarly, FDIC policy does not provide clear guidance for managers to make necessary employment decisions regarding culpability determinations.
