Absent additional legislative action,  fees are expected to fall by approximately 5 percent each year beginning  in 2006 and continuing through 2012.

The establishment of a fee schedule was an attempt to break the link  between physicians\u2019 charges and Medicare payments. The fee schedule  was not designed to reduce spending levels overall but to redistribute  payments for services based on the relative resources used by physicians  to provide different types of care. Under the fee schedule, Medicare pays  for more than 7,000 physician services.  To arrive at Medicare\u2019s fee, the  service\u2019s relative value is multiplied by a dollar conversion factor.", "Currently, under SGR, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare, uses the dollar conversion  factor to calculate Medicare fees and updates the conversion factor each  calendar year to account for the change in the cost of providing physician  services (as measured by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI)), adjusted  for the extent to which actual spending aligns with spending targets.

Similar to  MVPS, SGR sets spending targets for physician services and updates fees  to bring spending in line with those targets. Under the SGR system, if  spending exceeds the target, future fee updates are reduced. If spending  falls short of the target, future fee updates are increased. By adjusting fees  when prior-year spending has deviated from the target, SGR attempts to  moderate the growth in total Medicare outlays for physician services.", "Specifically, the SGR formula establishes expenditure targets as follows:  from a base year\u20141996\u2014the targets are updated each year to account  for four factors: (1) changes in the number of Medicare beneficiaries in  traditional fee-for-service; (2) growth in the costs of providing physician  services, laboratory tests, and Medicare-covered outpatient prescription  drugs; (3) growth in the overall economy, as measured by changes in real  per capita gross domestic product (GDP); and (4) changes in expenditures  that result from changes in laws or regulations. Spending and targets are  estimated from data available in the fall, when CMS sets physician fees for  the next calendar year. Because SGR spending targets are cumulative, the  target set for a specific year is affected by the targets set in all prior years.  BBRA required CMS, in calculating each year\u2019s SGR spending target and  fee update, to revise the targets set for the two previous years using the  most recent available data.", "SGR differs from MVPS in two key ways. The first relates to volume and  intensity growth limits. MVPS relied, in part, on historical trends in volume  and intensity growth to set new targets each year, whereas SGR ties  allowable volume and intensity increases to the growth in real GDP per  capita. Under SGR, real spending per beneficiary\u2014that is, spending  adjusted for the underlying cost of providing physician services\u2014is  allowed to grow at the same rate that the national economy grows over  time on a per-capita basis\u2014currently projected to be about 2 percent  annually. If volume and intensity grow faster, the annual increase in  physician fees will be less than the estimated increase in the cost of  providing services. Conversely, if volume and intensity grow more slowly  than 2 percent annually, the SGR system permits physicians to benefit  from fee increases that exceed the increased cost of providing services. To  reduce the effect of business cycles on physician fees, economic growth is  measured as the 10-year moving average change in real per capita GDP.  This measure is projected to range from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent during  the 2005 through 2014 period.", "A second difference is that MVPS compared target and actual expenditures  in a single year, whereas SGR compares targets and actual expenditures  cumulatively from a base year. The cumulative nature of SGR\u2019s spending  targets increases the potential volatility of physician fee updates because  the system requires that excess spending in any year be recouped in future  years. Conceptually, this means that if spending has exceeded the SGR  targets, fee updates in future years must be lowered sufficiently to offset  the excess spending. Conversely, the system also requires that if spending  has fallen short of the targets, fees must be increased to boost future  spending.", "SGR limits how much fees can be adjusted when spending has missed the  target. SGR\u2019s performance adjustment may decrease fees by as much as 7  percentage points below the percentage change in MEI when spending has  exceeded the target and may increase fees by as much as 3 percentage  points above the percentage change in MEI when spending has fallen short  of the target. SGR adjustments to the fees are determined by how much  the cumulative amount of spending on physician services since 1996  differs from the cumulative spending target since that base year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Action Temporarily Avoided Fee Declines; Fees Projected to Decline Beginning in 2006", "paragraphs": ["Since the introduction of the fee schedule in 1992 through 2001, physicians  generally experienced real increases in their fees\u2014that is, fees increased  more than the increase in the cost of providing physician services, as  measured by MEI. Specifically, during that period, fees increased by 39.7  percent, whereas MEI increased by 25.9 percent. In 2002, however, SGR  reduced fees by 4.8 percent, despite an estimated 2.6 percent increase in  the costs of providing physician services. (See fig. 4.)", "SGR reduced fees in 2002 because estimated spending for physician  services\u2014cumulative since 1996\u2014exceeded the target by approximately  $8.9 billion, or 13 percent of projected 2002 spending. In part, the fee  reduction occurred because CMS revised upward its estimates of previous  years\u2019 actual spending. Specifically, CMS found that its previous estimates  had omitted a portion of actual spending for 1998, 1999, and 2000. In  addition, in 2002 CMS lowered the 2 previous years\u2019 spending targets  based on revised GDP data from the Department of Commerce. Based on  the new higher spending estimates and lower targets, CMS determined  that fees had been too high in 2000 and 2001. In setting the 2002 physician  fees, the SGR system reduced fees to recoup previous excess spending.  The update would have been about negative 9 percent if the SGR system  had not limited its decrease to 7 percentage points below MEI. Because  the previous overpayments were not fully recouped in 2002, and because  of volume and intensity increases, by 2003, physicians were facing several  more years of fee reductions to bring cumulative Medicare spending on  physician services in line with cumulative targets.", "However, CMS had determined that its authority to revise previous  spending targets was limited. In 2002 CMS noted that the 1998 and 1999  spending targets had been based on estimated growth rates for beneficiary  fee-for-service enrollment and real per capita GDP that actual experience  had shown to be too low. If the estimates could have been revised, the  targets for those and subsequent years would have been increased.  However, at the time that CMS acknowledged these errors, the agency  concluded that it was not allowed to revise these estimates. Without such  revisions, the cumulative spending targets remained lower than if errors  had not been made.", "In late 2002, the estimate of SGR called for a negative 4.4 percent fee  update in 2003. With the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations  Resolution of 2003, CMS determined that it was authorized to correct the  1998 and 1999 spending targets. Because SGR targets are cumulative  measures, these corrections resulted in an average 1.4 percent increase in  physician fees for services for 2003.", "In 2003, MMA averted additional fee reductions projected for 2004 and  2005 by specifying an update to physician fees of no less than 1.5 percent  for 2004 and 2005. The MMA increases replaced SGR fee reductions of 4.5  percent in 2004 and an estimated 3.6 percent in 2005. Because MMA did  not make corresponding revisions to SGR\u2019s spending targets, SGR will  reduce fees beginning in 2006, to offset the additional spending caused by  MMA\u2019s fee increases. In addition, recent growth in volume and intensity,  which has been larger than SGR targets allow, will further compound the  problem of excess spending that needs to be recouped.", "The 2004 Medicare Trustees Report announced that the projected  physician update would be about negative 5 percent for 7 consecutive  years beginning in 2006; the result is a cumulative reduction in physician  fees of more than 31 percent from 2005 to 2012, while physicians\u2019 costs of  providing services, as measured by MEI, are projected to rise by 19  percent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["To a large extent, the physician fee cuts projected by Medicare\u2019s Trustees  are required under SGR\u2019s system of cumulative spending targets to make  up for excess spending in earlier years. MMA added to the excess spending  by specifying minimum fee updates for 2004 and 2005 without resetting the  spending targets for those years. As a result, physician fee cuts were  postponed, not avoided.", "In considering the projected fee cuts, however, it is important to recall that  Congress originally established Medicare spending targets for physician  services in response to runaway spending in the 1980s. The recent increase  in volume and intensity growth suggests that Medicare faces a  fundamental physician spending growth problem even if the SGR slate of  missed spending targets were somehow wiped clean. Currently, projected  Medicare spending for physician services exceeds what policymakers have  specified\u2014through the parameters of the SGR system\u2014is the appropriate  amount to spend. Because of expected increases in the volume and  intensity of services provided by physicians, real spending per beneficiary  is projected to grow by more than 3 percent per year. SGR, designed to  promote fiscal discipline, allows such spending to grow by just over 2  percent per year. If the growth in real spending per beneficiary is not  lowered through other means, SGR will mechanically reduce fee updates  in an attempt to impose fiscal discipline and moderate total spending  increases. Although this mechanical response may be desirable from a  budgetary perspective, any consequences for physicians and their patients  are uncertain.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
