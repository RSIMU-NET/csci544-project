Actual harm or more serious deficiencies were cited for 20 percent or about 3,500 nursing homes during an 18-month period ending January 2002, compared to 29 percent for an earlier period. Fewer discrepancies between federal and state surveys of the same homes suggests that state surveyors are doing a better job of documenting serious deficiencies and that the decline in serious quality problems is potentially real. Despite these improvements, the continuing prevalence of and state surveyor understatement of actual harm deficiencies is disturbing. For example, 39 percent of 76 state surveys from homes with a history of quality-of-care problems--but whose current survey found no actual harm deficiencies--had documented problems that should have been classified as actual harm or higher, such as serious, avoidable pressure sores. Weaknesses persist in state survey, complaint, and enforcement activities. According to CMS and states, several factors contribute to the understatement of serious quality problems, including poor investigation and documentation of deficiencies, limited quality assurance systems, and a large number of inexperienced surveyors in some states. In addition, GAO found that about one-third of the most recent state surveys nationwide remained predictable in their timing, allowing homes to conceal problems if they chose to do so. Considerable state variation remains regarding the ease of filing a complaint, the appropriateness of the investigation priorities, and the timeliness of investigations. Some states attributed timeliness problems to inadequate staff and an increase in the number of complaints. Although the agency strengthened enforcement policy by requiring states to refer for immediate sanction homes that had repeatedly harmed residents, GAO found that states failed to refer a substantial number of such homes, significantly undermining the policy's intended deterrent effect. CMS oversight of state survey activities has improved but requires continued attention to help ensure compliance with federal requirements. While CMS strengthened oversight by initiating annual state performance reviews, officials acknowledged that the reviews' effectiveness could be improved. For the initial fiscal year 2001 review, officials said they lacked the capability to systematically distinguish between minor lapses and more serious problems that required intervention. CMS oversight is also hampered by continuing database limitations, the inability of some CMS regions to use available data to monitor state activities, and inadequate oversight in areas such as survey predictability and state referral of homes for enforcement. Three key CMS initiatives have been significantly delayed--strengthening the survey methodology, improving surveyor guidance for determining the scope and severity of deficiencies, and producing greater standardization in state complaint processes. These initiatives are critical to reducing the subjectivity evident in current state survey and complaint activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A number of congressional hearings since July 1998 have focused  considerable attention on the need to improve the quality of care for the  nation\u2019s 1.7 million nursing home residents, a highly vulnerable population  of elderly and disabled individuals.

Significant  weaknesses in federal and state nursing home oversight that we identified  in a series of reports and testimonies since 1998 included (1) periodic state  inspections, known as surveys, that understated the extent of serious care  problems due to procedural weaknesses, (2) considerable state delays in  investigating public complaints alleging harm to residents, (3) federal  enforcement policies that did not ensure deficiencies were addressed and  remained corrected, and (4) federal oversight of state survey activities that  was limited in scope and effectiveness.", "In July 1998, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)\u2014the  federal agency with responsibility for managing Medicare and Medicaid  and overseeing compliance with federal nursing home quality standards\u2014 launched a series of actions intended to address many of the weaknesses  we identified. Since 1998, the agency has worked to strengthen surveyors\u2019  ability to detect quality-of-care deficiencies; required states to investigate  complaints alleging resident harm within 10 days; mandated immediate  sanctions for nursing homes with a pattern of harming residents; and  begun measuring state compliance with federal survey requirements and  reviewing data on the results of state surveys to help pinpoint  shortcomings in state survey activities.", "To evaluate the extent of the progress made in improving the quality of  nursing home care since we last addressed this issue in September 2000,  you asked us to assess:  trends in measured nursing home quality;    state responses to previously identified weaknesses in their survey,  complaint, and enforcement activities; and  the status of key federal efforts to oversee state survey agency  performance and improve quality.", "To assess recent trends in measured nursing home quality, we analyzed  survey results for the period July 11, 2000, through January 31, 2002, and  compared them to survey results for two earlier 18-month periods: (1)  January 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, and (2) January 1, 1999, through  July 10, 2000. Our analysis relied on data from the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting  (OSCAR) system, which compiles the results of all state nursing home  surveys nationwide. To better understand the trends identified through  our OSCAR analysis, we analyzed the results of federal comparative  surveys, conducted at recently surveyed nursing homes to assess the  adequacy of the state surveys, for two time periods\u2014October 1998  through May 2000 and June 2000 through February 2002. We also reviewed  76 survey reports from homes with a history of actual harm deficiencies  but whose most recent survey found no such deficiencies in states where  the percentage of homes cited for actual harm had declined to below the  national average since mid-2000. Our review of deficiencies from these  survey reports focused on the types of quality-of-care deficiencies most  frequently cited nationwide.", "To assess state survey activities as well as federal oversight, we analyzed  the conduct and results of fiscal year 2001 state survey agency  performance reviews during which CMS regional offices determined state  compliance with seven federal standards; we focused on the five standards  related to statutory survey intervals, survey documentation, complaint  activities, enforcement requirements, and OSCAR data entry. We  conducted structured interviews with officials from CMS, CMS\u2019s 10  regional offices, and 16 state survey agencies to discuss trends in survey  deficiencies, the underlying causes of problems identified during the  performance reviews, and state and federal efforts to address these  problems. We also discussed these issues with officials from 10 additional  states during a governing board meeting of the Association of Health  Facility Survey Agencies. We selected the 16 states with the goal of  including states that (1) were from diverse geographic areas, (2) had  shown either increases or decreases in the percentage of homes cited for  actual harm, (3) had been contacted in our prior work, and (4) represented  a mixture of strong and weak performance based on the results of federal  performance reviews of state survey activities. We also obtained data from  most state survey agencies on staffing issues such as nursing home  surveyor experience and vacancies. To assess enforcement actions, we  analyzed data in CMS\u2019s enforcement database and compared homes  identified in OSCAR as requiring immediate sanctions with those actually  referred to CMS for sanctions by state survey agencies.

Based on statutory requirements, CMS defines standards that nursing  homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs  and contracts with states to assess whether homes meet these standards  through annual surveys and complaint investigations.

Based  on our earlier work indicating that facilities could mask certain  deficiencies, such as routinely having too few staff to care for residents, if  they could predict the survey timing, HCFA directed states in 1999 to (1)  avoid scheduling a home\u2019s survey for the same month of the year as the  home\u2019s previous standard survey and (2) begin at least 10 percent of  standard surveys outside the normal workday (either on weekends, early  in the morning, or late in the evening).", "State surveyors\u2019 assessment of the quality of care provided to a sample of  residents during the standard survey serves as the basis for evaluating  nursing homes\u2019 compliance with federal requirements. CMS establishes  specific investigative protocols for state surveyors to use in conducting  these comprehensive surveys. These procedural instructions are intended  to make the on-site surveys thorough and consistent across states. In  response to our earlier recommendations concerning the need to better  ensure that surveyors do not miss significant care problems, HCFA  planned a two-phase revision of the survey process. In phase one, HCFA  instructed states in 1999 to (1) begin using a series of new investigative  protocols covering pressure sores, weight loss, dehydration, and other key  quality areas, (2) increase the sample of residents reviewed with  conditions related to these areas, and (3) review \u201cquality indicator\u201d  information on the care provided to a home\u2019s residents, before actually  visiting the home, to help guide survey activities. Quality indicators are  essentially numeric warning signs of the prevalence of care problems such  as greater-than-expected instances of weight loss, dehydration, or  pressures sores. They are derived from nursing homes\u2019 assessments of  residents and rank a facility in 24 areas compared with other nursing  homes in the state. By using the quality indicators to select a preliminary  sample of residents before the on-site review, surveyors are better  prepared to identify potential care problems. Surveyors augment this  preliminary sample with additional resident cases once they arrive in the  home. To address remaining problems with sampling and the investigative  protocols, CMS is planning a second set of revisions to its survey  methodology. The focus of phase two is (1) improving the on-site  augmentation of the preliminary sample selected off-site using the quality  indicators and (2) strengthening the protocols used by surveyors to ensure  more rigor in their on-site investigations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complaint Investigations", "paragraphs": ["Complaint investigations provide an opportunity for state surveyors to  intervene promptly if quality-of-care problems arise between standard  surveys.

Until 1999, federal  guidelines were limited to requiring the investigation of complaints  alleging immediate jeopardy conditions within 2 workdays. In March 1999,  HCFA acted to strengthen state complaint procedures by instructing states  to investigate any complaint alleging harm to a nursing home resident  within 10 workdays. Additional guidance provided to states in late 1999  specified that, as with immediate jeopardy complaints, investigations  should generally be conducted on-site at the nursing home. This guidance  also identified techniques to help states identify complaints having a  higher level of actual harm.

In November 2002,  CMS augmented the deficiency data available on its Web site with 10  clinical indicators of quality, such as the percentage of residents with  pressure sores, in nursing homes nationwide.

The scope and severity of a deficiency determine the applicable  sanctions that can involve, among other things, requiring training for staff  providing care to residents, imposing monetary fines, denying the home  Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, and terminating the  home from participation in these programs. Before a sanction is imposed,  federal policy generally gives nursing homes a grace period of 30 to 60  days to correct the deficiency. We earlier reported, however, that the  threat of federal sanctions did not prevent nursing homes from cycling in  and out of compliance because they were able to avoid sanctions by  returning to compliance within the grace period, even when they had been  cited for actual harm on successive surveys. In 1998, HCFA began a two- stage phase-in of a new enforcement policy. In the first stage, effective  September 1998, HCFA required states to refer for immediate sanction  homes found to have a pattern of harming residents or exposing them to  actual or potential death or serious injury (H-level deficiencies and above  on CMS\u2019s scope and severity grid).

Federal monitoring surveys can be either  comparative or observational. A comparative survey involves a federal  survey team conducting a complete, independent survey of a home within  2 months of the completion of a state\u2019s survey in order to compare and  contrast the findings. In an observational survey, one or more federal  surveyors accompany a state survey team to a nursing home to observe  the team\u2019s performance. Roughly 85 percent of federal surveys are  observational.

Then a  chest x ray was taken, revealing that the resident had sustained two  fractured ribs and fluid had accumulated in the resident\u2019s left lung. A  facility investigation determined that the resident had been injured by a lift  used to transfer the resident to and from the bed. It was clear from the  surveyor\u2019s information that the facility failed to take appropriate action to  assess and provide the necessary care until the resident developed serious  symptoms of chest trauma.

We concluded that 5 of the 10 surveys did contain  adequate documentation to support actual harm because there was a clear  link between the deficient facility practice and the documented harm to a  resident.

According to the notes of facility nurses, a  personal alarm unit was in place as a safety device to prevent falls. The  surveyor found that the facility had (1) failed to provide adequate  interventions to prevent accidents and (2) continued to use the alarm unit  even though it did not prevent any of the falls.

Predictable surveys can allow quality-of-care  problems to go undetected because homes, if they choose to do so, may  conceal problems.

Oklahoma officials attributed this timeliness problem to staff shortages  and a surge in the number of complaints received in 2000, from about 5 per  day to about 35. The rising volume of complaints is a particular problem  for California, which receives about 10,000 complaints annually, and had a  20 percent increase in complaints from January 2001 through July 2002.

However, officials in one region told us  that they had instructed three of four states not to look back before the  January 2000 implementation date of the policy. Two other regional offices  told us that CMS policy did not require the state to look back before  January 2000 for earlier surveys. Officials at another regional office did not  recall the look-back policy at the time we talked to them in mid-2002, and  were not sure what advice they had given their states when the policy was  first implemented.", "Second, some state survey agencies told us that their managers  responsible for enforcement did not have an adequate methodology for  checking the survey history of homes to identify those meeting the criteria.

Officials in one state told us that its district offices had no  consistent procedure for checking the survey history of homes. An official  in another state told us that some cases were not referred because time  lags in reporting some surveys meant that an earlier survey\u2014such as a  complaint survey\u2014with an actual harm deficiency might not have been  entered in the state\u2019s tracking system until after a later survey that also  found harm-level deficiencies.", "Third, two states did not implement CMS\u2019s expanded policy on immediate  sanctions.

Because surveyors often  missed significant care problems due to weaknesses in the survey process,  HCFA took some initial steps to strengthen the survey methodology, with  the goal of introducing an improved survey process in 2000. In July 1999,  the agency introduced quality indicators to help surveyors do a better job  of selecting a resident sample, instructed states to increase the sample size  in areas of particular concern, and required the use of investigative  protocols in certain areas, such as pressures sores and nutrition, to help  make the survey process more systematic. However, HCFA recognized  that additional steps were required to ensure that surveyors thoroughly  and systematically identify and assess care problems.", "To address remaining problems with sampling and the investigative  protocols, CMS contracted for the development of a revised survey  methodology. The contractor has proposed a two-phase survey process.  In the first phase, surveyors would initially identify potential care  problems using quality indicators generated off-site prior to the start of the  survey and additional, standardized information collected on-site, from a  sample of as many as 70 residents. During the second phase, surveyors  would conduct an investigation to confirm and document the care  deficiencies initially identified. According to CMS officials, this process  differs from the current methodology because it would more  systematically target potential problems at a home and give surveyors new  tools to more adequately document care outcomes and conduct on-site  investigations. Use of the new methodology could result in survey findings  that more accurately identify the quality of care provided by a nursing  home to all of its residents. Initial testing to evaluate the proposed  methodology focused primarily on the first phase and was completed in  three states during 2002. As of April 2003, a CMS official told us that the  agency lacked adequate funding to conduct further testing that more fully  incorporates phase two. As a result, it is not clear when changes to survey  methodology will be implemented. We continue to believe that redesign of  the survey methodology, under way since 1998, is necessary for CMS to  fully respond to our past recommendation to improve the ability of  surveys to effectively identify the existence and extent of deficiencies.  While CMS\u2019s goal of not adding additional time to surveys is an important  consideration, it should not take priority over the goal of ensuring that  surveys are as effective as possible in identifying the quality of care  provided to residents.", "Recognizing inconsistencies in how the scope and severity of deficiencies  are cited across states, in October 2000, HCFA began developing more  structured guidance for surveyors, including survey investigative protocols  for assessing specific deficiencies.

The  areas originally targeted for this initiative included deficiencies related to  pressure sores, urinary catheters and incontinence, activities  programming, safe food handling, and nutrition. Delays have occurred  because CMS is committed to incorporating the work of multiple expert  panels and two rounds of public comments for each deficiency. The  project has been further delayed because the approach used to identify  resident harm shifted during the course of work. The process should  proceed more quickly, however, now that CMS has developed its  approach. CMS expected to release the first new guidance, addressing  pressure sores, in early 2003, but officials were unable to tell us how many  of the 190 federal nursing home requirements will ultimately receive new  guidance or a specific time line for when this initiative will be completed.  As discussed earlier, CMS\u2019s state performance reviews include an  assessment of state surveyors\u2019 documentation of the scope and severity of  a sample of deficiencies cited, which should provide CMS with an  opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the new guidance.", "Finally, despite initiation of a complaint improvement project in 1999,  CMS has not yet developed detailed guidance for states to help improve  their complaint systems. Effective complaint procedures are critical  because complaints offer an opportunity to assess nursing home care  between standard surveys, which can be as long as 15 months apart. In  1999, HCFA commissioned a contractor to assess and recommend  improvements to state complaint practices. CMS received the contractor\u2019s  final report in June 2002, and indicated agreement with the contractor that  reforming the complaint system is urgently needed to achieve a more  standardized, consistent, and effective process. The study identified  serious weaknesses in state complaint processes (see table 5) and made  numerous recommendations to CMS for strengthening them. Key  recommendations were that CMS increase direction and oversight of  states\u2019 complaint processes and establish mechanisms to monitor states\u2019  performance. CMS indicated that it has already taken steps to address  these recommendations by initiating annual performance reviews that  include evaluating the timeliness of state complaint investigations and the  accuracy of states\u2019 complaint triaging decisions, and by developing the  new ASPEN complaint tracking system, which should provide more  complete data about complaint activities than the current system. The  contractor also recommended that CMS (1) expand outreach for the  initiation of complaints, such as use of billboards or media advertising,   (2) enhance complaint intake processes by using professional intake staff,  (3) improve investigation and resolution processes by using available data  about the home being investigated and establishing uniform definitions  and criteria for substantiating complaints, (4) make the process more  responsive by conducting timely investigations and allowing the  complainant to track the progress of the investigation, and (5) establish a  higher priority for complaint investigations in the state survey agency.  CMS noted that some of these recommendations are beyond the agency\u2019s  purview and will require the support of all stakeholders to accomplish.  CMS told us that it plans to issue new guidance to the states in late fiscal  year 2003\u2014about 4 years after the complaint improvement project  initiative was launched."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in September 2000, continued federal and state attention is  required to ensure necessary improvements in the quality of care provided  to the nation\u2019s vulnerable nursing home residents. The reported decline in  the percentage of homes cited for serious deficiencies that harm residents  is consistent with the concerted congressional, federal, and state attention  focused on addressing quality-of-care problems. More active and data- driven oversight is increasing CMS\u2019s understanding of the nature and  extent of weaknesses in state survey activities. Despite these efforts,  however, the proportion of homes reported to have harmed residents is  still unacceptably high. It is therefore essential that CMS fully implement  key initiatives to improve the rigor and consistency of state survey,  complaint investigation, and enforcement processes.", "The seriousness of the challenge confronting CMS in ensuring consistency  in state survey activities is also becoming more apparent. Our work, as  well as that of CMS, demonstrates the persistence of several long-standing  problems and also provides insights on factors that may be contributing to  these shortcomings:    state surveyors continue to understate serious deficiencies that caused  actual harm or placed residents in immediate jeopardy;    deficiencies are often poorly investigated and documented, making it  difficult to determine the appropriate severity category;    states focus considerable effort on reviewing proposed actual harm  deficiencies, but many have no quality assurance processes in place to  determine if less serious deficiencies are understated or have investigation  and documentation problems;  the timing of too many surveys remains predictable, allowing problems to  go undetected if a home chooses to conceal deficiencies;    numerous weaknesses persist in many states\u2019 complaint processes,  including the lack of consumer toll-free hotlines in many states, confusion  over prioritization of complaints, inconsistent complaint investigation  procedures, and the failure of most states to investigate all complaints  alleging actual harm within 10 days, as required; and    states did not refer a substantial number of homes that had a pattern of  harming residents to CMS for immediate sanctions.", "Over the past several years, CMS has taken numerous steps to improve its  oversight of state survey agencies, but needs to continue its efforts to help  better ensure consistent compliance with federal requirements. Several  areas that require CMS\u2019s ongoing attention include (1) the newly  established standard performance reviews to ensure that critical elements  of the review, such as assessing states\u2019 ability to properly document  deficiencies, are successfully implemented, (2) the successful  modernization of CMS\u2019s data system by 2005 to support the survey process  and provide key information for monitoring state survey activities, (3) the  planned expansion of comparative surveys to improve federal oversight of  the state survey process, (4) the survey methodology redesign intended to  make the survey process more systematic, (5) the development of more  structured guidance for surveyors to address inconsistencies in how the  scope and severity of deficiencies are cited across states, and (6) the  provision of detailed guidance to states to ensure thorough and consistent  complaint investigations. Some of these efforts have been under way for  several years, and CMS has consistently extended their estimated  completion and implementation dates.

However, the agency did not specifically comment on any actions  it would take to finalize and implement its new survey methodology,  which is broader than the actions CMS described. Our draft report noted  that, earlier this year, CMS said it lacked adequate funding for the  additional field testing needed to implement the new survey methodology.  Through September 2003, CMS will have committed $4.7 million to this  effort. While CMS did not address the lack of adequate funding in its  comments on our draft report, a CMS official subsequently told us that  about $508,000 has now been slated for additional field testing. This  amount, however, has not yet been approved. Not funding additional field  testing could jeopardize the entire initiative, in which a substantial  investment has already been made.

However, the agency did not indicate whether it would require states to  initiate an ongoing process that would evaluate the appropriateness of the  scope and severity of documented deficiencies, as we recommended.  While federal oversight is critical, the annual performance reviews  conducted by federal surveyors examine only a small, random sample of  state survey reports and should not be considered a substitute for  appropriate and ongoing state quality assurance mechanisms. In its  comments, New York stated that, in April 2003, it had implemented a  process consistent with our recommendation and it had already realized  positive results. New York is using the results of these reviews to provide  surveyor feedback and expects that instances where deficiencies may be  understated will decrease.

Alabama  commented that there is a relationship among (1) the scheduling of  nursing home standard surveys, (2) the number and timing of complaint  surveys, (3) the tasks that must be accomplished during each survey, and  (4) the resources that are available to state agencies. According to  Alabama, the funding provided by CMS is insufficient to meet all of the  CMS workload demands, and many of the serious problems identified in  our draft report were attributable to insufficient funding for state agencies  to hire and retain the staff necessary to do the required surveys. For  example, Alabama indicated that the inability of some states to meet  survey time frames\u2014maintaining a 12-month average between standard  surveys and investigating complaints alleging actual harm within 10 days\u2014 is almost always the result of states not having enough surveyors to  accomplish the required workload.", "Comments from other states echoed Alabama\u2019s concerns about the  adequacy of funding provided by CMS. Arizona said that, in order to hire  and retain qualified surveyors, it increased surveyor salaries in 2001.  Because CMS did not increase the state\u2019s survey and certification budget  to accommodate these increases, the state left surveyor positions unfilled  and curtailed training to make up for the funding shortfall. Arizona also  observed that CMS\u2019s priorities sometimes conflict, further complicating  effective resource use. CMS\u2019s performance standards require states to  investigate all complaints alleging immediate jeopardy or actual harm in 2  and 10 days, respectively. For budgeting purposes, however, CMS ranks  complaint investigations as a lower priority than annual surveys and  instructs states to ensure that annual surveys will be completed before  beginning work on complaints. California and Connecticut officials said  that the growing volume of complaints in their states, combined with  limited resources, is a concern. California officials observed that the  growth in the number of complaints, coupled with the lack of significant  funding increase from CMS, has made it impossible to meet all federal and  state standards. They added that they received a 3-percent increase in  survey funding from fiscal years 2000 through 2003, but documented the  need for a 24-percent increase over this period. As noted in our draft  report, the higher priority California attaches to investigating complaints  affected survey timeliness\u2014about 12 percent of the state\u2019s homes were  not surveyed within the required 15 months. Connecticut indicated that 90  percent of the complaints it receives allege actual harm and require  investigation within 10 days, but that with fairly stagnant budget  allocations from CMS, its ability to initiate investigations of so many  complaints within 10 days was limited. CMS\u2019s fiscal year 2001 state  performance review found that Connecticut did not investigate about 30  percent of the sampled actual harm complaints in a timely manner.

CMS\u2019s written comments did not address our review of  these deficiencies; however, during an interview to follow up on state  comments, CMS officials told us that they agreed with our determinations  of actual harm as detailed in appendix III.", "Arizona and California agreed that some of the deficiencies we reviewed  for nursing homes in their states should have been cited at the level of  actual harm. However, their disagreement regarding others stemmed from  differing interpretations of CMS guidance, particularly the language on the  extent of the consequences to a resident resulting from a deficiency. For  example, Arizona stated that one of the two deficiencies we reviewed  could not be supported at the actual harm level because the injuries from  multiple falls\u2014including skin tears and lacerations of the extremities and  head requiring suturing\u2014did not compromise the residents\u2019 ability to  function at their highest optimal level (table 8, Arizona 3). In these cases, it  was documented that nursing home staff had failed to implement plans of  care intended to prevent such falls. In contrast, California agreed with us  that state surveyors should have cited actual harm for similar injuries  resulting from falls\u2014head lacerations and a minimal impaction fracture of  the hip\u2014due to the inappropriate use of bed side rails (table 8, California  9). CMS officials noted that the definition of actual harm uses the term  \u201cwell-being\u201d rather than function because harm can be psychological as  well as physical. Moreover, they indicated that whether the consequence  was small or large was irrelevant to determining harm. CMS central office  officials acknowledged that the language linking actual harm to practices  that have \u201climited consequences\u201d for a resident has created confusion for  state surveyors and that this reference will be eliminated in an upcoming  revision of the guidance.", "Regarding preventable stage II pressure sores, California stated that  guidance received from CMS\u2019s San Francisco regional office in November  2000 precluded citing actual harm unless the pressure sores had an impact  on residents\u2019 ability to function. According to a California official, this  and similar guidance on weight loss was the CMS regional office\u2019s reaction  to the growing volume of appeals by nursing homes of actual harm  citations as well as a reaction to administrative law hearing decisions.  Prior to this written guidance, which California received in late 2000, it  routinely cited preventable stage II pressure sores as actual harm. The  guidance noted that small stage II pressure sores seldom cause actual  harm because they have the potential to heal relatively quickly and are  usually of limited consequence to the resident\u2019s ability to function. We  discussed the San Francisco regional office guidance with another  regional office as well as with CMS central office officials, who agreed that  the San Francisco region\u2019s pressure sore guidance was inconsistent with  CMS\u2019s definition of harm, which judges the impact of a deficiency on a  resident\u2019s \u201cwell-being\u201d rather than functioning. Moreover, central office  officials indicated that the regional office\u2019s guidance should have been  submitted to CMS\u2019s Policy Clearinghouse for approval. This entity was  created in June 2000 to ensure that regional directives to states are  consistent with national policy. San Francisco regional office officials  indicated that the individual responsible for the guidance provided to  California had since left the agency.", "California also disagreed with our assessment that state surveyors should  have cited immediate jeopardy for a resident who repeatedly wandered  (eloped) outside the facility near a busy intersection. According to state  officials, California\u2019s policy on immediate jeopardy requires the surveyor  to witness the incident. A San Francisco regional office official told us that  surveyors did not have to witness an elopement to cite immediate  jeopardy. An official from a different regional office agreed and noted that  repeated elopements suggested the existence of a systemic problem that  warranted citation of immediate jeopardy.", "Although Iowa and Nebraska did not comment specifically on the  deficiencies in their surveys that we determined to be actual harm, they  did address the definition of harm and the role of surveyor judgment in  classifying deficiencies. Iowa officials indicated that a more precise  definition of harm is needed because of varying emphasis over the last  several years on the degree of harm\u2014harm that has a small consequence  for the resident or serious harm. Nebraska commented that we may have  based our conclusion that two deficiencies in its surveys should have been  cited at the actual harm level on insufficient information because citing  actual harm is a judgment call that varies among state and federal  surveyors based on experience and expertise. As noted in our draft report,  we found sufficient evidence in the surveys we reviewed to conclude that  some deficiencies should have been cited as actual harm because a  deficient practice was identified and linked to documented actual harm."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Predictability", "paragraphs": ["CMS, Arizona, and Iowa commented that nursing home surveys, as  currently structured, are inherently predictable because of the statutory  requirement to survey nursing homes on average every 12 months with a  maximum interval of 15 months between each home\u2019s survey. We agree  but believe that survey predictability could be further mitigated by  segmenting the surveys into more than one visit, a recommendation we  made in 1998 but that CMS has not implemented. Currently, surveys are  comprehensive reviews that can last several days and entail examining not  only a home\u2019s compliance with resident care standards but also with  administrative and housekeeping standards. Dividing the survey into  segments performed over several visits, particularly for those homes with  a history of serious deficiencies, would increase the presence of surveyors  in these homes and provide an opportunity for surveyors to initiate  broader reviews when warranted. With a segmented set of inspections,  homes would be less able to predict their next scheduled visit and adjust  the care they provide in anticipation of such visits.", "CMS also commented that our report captures only the number of days  since the prior survey and does not take into account other predictors, for  example the time of day or day of the week. Rather than segmenting  standard surveys as we earlier recommended, the agency instructed states  to reduce survey predictability by starting at least 10 percent of surveys  outside the normal workday\u2014either on weekends, in the early morning, or  in the evening. It also instructed states to avoid, if possible, scheduling a  home\u2019s survey for the same month as its previous standard survey. Though  varying the starting time of surveys may be beneficial, this initiative is too  limited in reducing survey predictability, as evidenced by our finding that  34 percent of current surveys were predictable. Arizona commented that it  was unaware of any CMS guidance to avoid scheduling a home\u2019s survey  for the same month of the year as the home\u2019s previous standard survey  and indicated the state will now incorporate the requirement into its  scheduling process.", "Comments from CMS and Arizona stated that the window of time for a  survey to be unpredictable was limited and, as a result, little could be done  to reduce predictability. CMS\u2019s technical comments noted that many states  have annual state licensing inspection requirements that would limit the  window available to conduct surveys to 9 to 12 months after the prior  survey, particularly since most inspections are done in conjunction with  the federal survey to maximize available resources. CMS, however, was  unable to provide a list of such states. None of the 10 states we  subsequently contacted had state licensure inspection requirements that  would explain their high levels of survey predictability. Arizona  commented that the state\u2019s licensing inspections are triggered by facilities  applying to renew their licenses 60-120 days before their annual license  expires. Due to budgetary constraints, Arizona conducts both this state  and the federal survey at the same time. While not a requirement, the state  strives to complete surveys during this 60-120 day period of time. Thus,  nursing homes in Arizona may have some level of control over when  federal surveys are conducted, particularly when the state begins  complying with CMS guidance to avoid scheduling a home\u2019s survey for the  same month as its previous survey. As we reported in September 2000,  Tennessee also had an annual licensing inspection requirement that  contributed to survey predictability, but the state modified its law to  permit homes to be surveyed at a maximum interval of 15 months. Since  then, the proportion of predictable surveys in Tennessee decreased from  about 56 percent to 29 percent. Arizona also stated that surveys had to be  conducted within a 45-day window after the 1-year anniversary of the prior  survey to be considered unpredictable. Arizona\u2019s comments erroneously  assume that a survey cannot take place before the 1-year anniversary of  the prior survey. There is no prohibition on resurveying a home prior to  the 1-year anniversary of its last survey, and many states do so. In fact,  from October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2001, Arizona conducted 23  percent of its surveys before the 1-year anniversary.", "CMS provided several technical comments that we incorporated as  appropriate.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.

To identify trends in the proportion of  nursing homes cited for actual harm or immediate jeopardy, we analyzed  data from CMS\u2019s OSCAR system. We compared standard survey results for  three approximately 18-month periods: (1) January 1, 1997, through June  30, 1998, (2) January 1, 1999, through July 10, 2000, and (3) July 11, 2000,  through January 31, 2002. Because surveys are to be conducted at least  once every 15 months (with a required 12-month state average), it is  possible that a facility was surveyed more than once in a time period. To  avoid double counting of facilities, we included only the most recent  survey of a facility from each of the time periods. The data from the two  earliest time periods were included in our September 2000 report. We  updated our earlier analysis of surveys conducted from January 1, 1999,  through July 10, 2000, because it excluded approximately 300 surveys that  had been conducted but not entered into OSCAR at the time we conducted  our analysis in July 2000.", "Sample of state survey reports. To assess the trends in actual harm and  immediate jeopardy deficiencies discussed above, we (1) identified 14  states in which the percentage of homes cited for actual harm had  declined to below the national average since mid-2000 or was consistently  below that average and (2) reviewed 76 survey reports from homes that  had G-level or higher quality-of-care deficiencies on prior surveys but  whose current survey had quality-of-care deficiencies at the D or E level,  suggesting that the homes had improved. All the surveys we reviewed  were conducted from July 2000 through April 2002. Our review focused on  four quality-of-care requirements that are the most frequently cited nursing  home deficiencies nationwide (see table 6). According to OSCAR data, 99  surveys in the 14 states conducted on or after July 2000 documented a D-  or E-level deficiency in at least one of these four quality-of-care  requirements. We reviewed all such deficiencies in surveys from 13 states  but randomly selected 22 surveys from California, which cited the majority  (45) of these deficiencies. In reviewing the surveys, we looked for a  description of the resident\u2019s diagnoses, any assessment of special  problems, and a description of the care plan and physician orders  connected with the deficiency identified. We also looked for a clear  statement of the home\u2019s deficient practice and the relationship between  the deficiency and the care outcome.", "Federal comparative surveys. In September 2000, we reported on the  results of 157 comparative surveys completed from October 1998 through  May 2000. To update our analysis, we asked each CMS region to provide  the results of more recent comparative surveys, including data on the  corresponding state survey. The regions identified and provided  information on the deficiencies identified in 277 comparative surveys that  were completed from June 2000 through February 2002.", "Survey predictability. In order to determine the predictability of nursing  home surveys, we analyzed data from CMS\u2019s OSCAR database. We  considered surveys to be predictable if (1) homes were surveyed within 15  days of the 1-year anniversary of their prior survey or (2) homes were  surveyed within 1 month of the maximum 15-month interval between  standard surveys. Consistent with CMS\u2019s interpretation, we used 15.9  months as the maximum allowable interval between surveys. Because  homes know the maximum allowable interval between surveys, those  whose prior surveys were conducted 14 or 15 months earlier are aware  that they are likely to be surveyed soon.", "Complaints. We analyzed the results of CMS\u2019s state performance review  for fiscal year 2001 to determine states\u2019 success in investigating both  immediate jeopardy complaints and actual harm complaints within time  frames required either by statute or by CMS instructions. To better  understand the results of state performance as determined by CMS\u2019s  review, we interviewed officials from CMS\u2019s 10 regional offices and 16  state survey agencies (see state performance standards below for a  description of how these states were chosen). We also reviewed the  report submitted to CMS by its contractor, which was intended to assess  and recommend ways to strengthen state complaint practices. Finally, to  assess the implementation of CMS\u2019s new automated system for tracking  information about complaints, we reviewed CMS guidance materials and  interviewed CMS officials and state survey agency officials from our 16  sample states.", "Enforcement. To determine if states had consistently applied the  expanded immediate sanction policy, we analyzed state surveys in OSCAR  that were conducted before April 9, 2002, and identified homes that met  the criteria for referral for immediate sanction. We included surveys  conducted prior to the implementation of the expanded immediate  sanction policy because actual harm deficiencies identified in such  surveys were to be considered by states in recommending a home for  immediate sanction beginning in January 2000. To be affected by CMS\u2019s  expanded policy, a home with actual harm on two surveys must have an  intervening period of compliance between the two surveys. Because  OSCAR is not structured to consistently record the date a home with  deficiencies returned to compliance, we had to estimate compliance dates  using revisit dates as a proxy. We compared the results of our analysis to  CMS\u2019s enforcement database to determine if CMS had opened  enforcement cases for the homes we identified. Our analysis compared the  survey date in OSCAR to the survey date in CMS\u2019s enforcement database.  We considered any survey date in the enforcement database within 30  days of the OSCAR survey date to be a match. CMS officials reviewed and  concurred with our methodology. We then asked CMS to analyze the  resulting 1,334 unmatched cases to determine if a referral should have  been made.", "State performance standards. To assess state survey activities as well as  federal oversight of state performance, we analyzed the conduct and  results of fiscal year 2001 state survey agency performance reviews during  which the CMS regional offices determined compliance with seven federal  standards; we focused on the five standards related to statutory survey  intervals, deficiency documentation, complaint activities, enforcement  requirements, and OSCAR data entry. Because some regional office  summary reports on the results of their reviews for each state did not  provide detailed information about the results, we also obtained and  reviewed regions\u2019 worksheets on which the summary reports were based.  In addition, we conducted structured interviews with officials from CMS,  CMS\u2019s 10 regional offices, and 16 state survey agencies to discuss nursing  home deficiency trends, the underlying causes of problems identified  during the performance reviews, and state and federal efforts to address  these problems. We also discussed these issues with officials from 10  additional states during a governing board meeting of the Association of  Health Facility Survey Agencies. We selected the 16 states with the goal of  including states that (1) were from diverse geographic areas, (2) had  shown either an increase or a decrease in the percentage of homes cited  for actual harm, (3) had been contacted in our prior work, and (4)  represented a mixture of results from federal performance reviews of state  survey activities.

To avoid double counting of facilities, we included  only the most recent survey from each of the time periods. Some of the  data in table 7 were included in our September 2000 report. However, we  updated our analysis of surveys conducted from January 1, 1999, through  July 10, 2000, because it excluded approximately 300 surveys that had  been conducted but not entered into OSCAR at the time we conducted our  analysis in July 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Abstracts of Nursing Home Survey Reports That Understated Quality-of- Care Problems", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of a sample of 76 nursing home survey reports demonstrated  a substantial understatement of quality-of-care problems. Our sample was  selected from 14 states in which the percentage of homes cited for actual  harm had declined to below the national average since mid-2000 or was  consistently below that average. We identified survey reports in these  states from homes that had G-level or higher quality-of-care deficiencies  (see table 1) on prior surveys but whose current survey had quality-of-care  deficiencies at the D or E level, suggesting that the homes had improved.  All the surveys we reviewed were conducted from July 2000 through April  2002. Our review focused on four quality-of-care requirements that are the  most frequently cited nursing home deficiencies nationwide (see table 6).", "In our judgment, 30 of the 76 surveys (39 percent) from 9 of the 14 states  had one or more deficiencies that documented actual harm to residents\u2014 G-level deficiencies\u2014and 1 survey contained a deficiency that could have  been cited at the immediate jeopardy level.

We  considered surveys to be predictable if (1) homes were surveyed within 15  days of the 1-year anniversary of their prior survey or (2) homes were  surveyed within 1 month of the maximum 15-month interval between  standard surveys. Consistent with CMS\u2019s interpretation, we used 15.9  months as the maximum allowable interval between surveys.

Table 12  summarizes the amounts of federal civil money penalties (CMP)  implemented against nursing homes referred for immediate sanction.  Although these monetary sanctions were implemented, CMS\u2019s  enforcement database does not track collections.
