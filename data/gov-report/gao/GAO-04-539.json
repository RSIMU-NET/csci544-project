Given DOE's long history of using contractors and the rising cost of postretirement benefits, the Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, asked GAO to (1) analyze DOE's estimated financial obligation for postretirement health and pension benefits for contractor employees at the end of fiscal year 2003, (2) determine how DOE evaluates its contractor postretirement health and pension benefit programs and assesses the comparative levels of benefits offered by contractors, and (3) assess how DOE's oversight of these benefits could be enhanced."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of September 30, 2003, DOE reported an estimated $13.4 billion in unfunded contractor postretirement health and pension benefits. This figure is an actuarial estimate of all benefits attributed to employee service before September 30, 2003, minus the fair market value of assets dedicated to the payment of retiree benefits. The unfunded balance has grown over the past 4 fiscal years as a result of the continuing accumulation of benefits, declining interest rates, and negative returns on pension assets. A significant portion of the unfunded balance relates to benefit programs at contractor sites that have already closed or will close once the work is complete. DOE Order 350.1 generally provides that contractors periodically complete selfassessment studies comparing their benefits to professionally recognized measures. DOE uses these studies to make decisions about the level of contractor benefits. While the most recently completed comparison studies suggest that DOE has been successful in offering total contractor benefits that are comparable to those of selected competitors, the DOE Order 350.1 studies are not performed at a significant number of contractor locations, and alternative review procedures performed by DOE personnel are inconsistent from one contractor location to another; thus DOE's ability to evaluate the full range of programs is limited. In addition, GAO found that a number of contractor studies completed under DOE Order 350.1 did not conform to prescribed and recommended methodologies, calling into question the validity and comparability of the results. Moreover, DOE's current focus on total benefits rather than individual benefit components in evaluating benefits does not fully recognize the differences in costs between deferred benefit programs, such as pension and postretirement health benefits, and other benefit components. This distinction is important because changes to pension and postretirement health benefits can have a significant impact on DOE's long-term costs and budgetary needs. For example, a 1 percent increase in a contractor employee's current year vacation benefits has less impact on DOE's long-term costs and budgetary needs than a 1 percent increase in postretirement pension or health benefits, which have a continuous and compounding effect as they are paid out in each year of retirement. While reported total contractor benefits are comparable to selected competitors, as stated above, the postretirement health benefits of DOE contractor employees at these sites averaged more than 44 percent greater than the average of the contractors' competitors, while defined benefit pension benefits averaged 29 percent greater. The approval and monitoring of DOE contractor employee pension and postretirement health benefits is primarily the responsibility of DOE contracting officers, who administer contracts at individual contractor locations. Management does not systematically review information developed at individual contractor locations to identify best practices or areas where benefit comparisons do not adhere to agency requirements or guidance. Developing and disseminating this information agencywide would enhance DOE's oversight of contractor employee benefits and provide information needed to manage postclosure benefit costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy (DOE) carries out its national security,  environmental cleanup, and scientific and technological innovation  missions through the extensive use of third-party contractors, including  universities and private companies. These contractors, in many cases,  incur costs for pension and postretirement health benefits that are  reimbursed by DOE under the terms of their contracts.  Contractor pension  and postretirement health benefits represent significant costs for both  research and environmental cleanup efforts. The current methodology  used to fund these costs may result in the need for DOE to reimburse  contractor benefit payments well after current operating contracts are  terminated or cleanup sites are completed.", "We, along with DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General (IG), have issued several  reports during recent years on the challenges DOE faces in the area of  contract management and the extent of environmental cleanup costs.  Since 1990, we have included DOE\u2019s contract management, which is  broadly defined to include contract administration and project  management, as a high-risk area. Given DOE\u2019s long history of using  contractors in its research and cleanup missions and the rising cost of  providing employee postretirement health benefits, it is important that the  management of short-term and long-term contractor employee benefits  obligations ensures both the successful completion of cleanup and  research objectives and the cost-effective use of government resources.", "In this context, you requested that we review DOE\u2019s contractor employee  benefits to (1) analyze the department\u2019s estimated financial obligation for  pension and postretirement health benefits for contractor employees at the  end of fiscal year 2003, (2) determine how DOE evaluates its contractor  pension and postretirement health benefit programs and assesses the  comparative levels of benefits offered by its contractors, and (3) assess  how DOE\u2019s oversight of these benefit programs could be enhanced.", "We conducted our review from July 2003 through February 2004 at the  Department of Energy headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the Defense  Contract Audit Agency in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested written  comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Energy. We also  requested oral comments on applicable sections of a draft of this report  from the Secretary of Defense. We incorporated those comments into our  report as appropriate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOE relies on contractor organizations to manage, operate, maintain, and  provide support to its environmental cleanup and science and energy  research at government-owned facilities. Contractors at environmental  cleanup sites direct remediation efforts for radioactive and hazardous  waste contamination generated during former nuclear weapons research  and production activities. The eventual completion of cleanup activities at  individual contractor locations without the existence of other ongoing  operations, called site completion or site closure, generally leads to  transition into long-term stewardship activities such as monitoring and  surveillance requiring significantly fewer resources.  Contractors at  research sites complete a variety of ongoing research and development  activities at national laboratories and universities.", "Contractors at cleanup and research sites may sponsor and pay pension  and postretirement health benefits, collectively called postretirement  benefits, for employees providing service under DOE contracts in order to  attract, motivate, and retain qualified individuals to assist the agency in  carrying out its mission. Contractors administer postretirement benefits for  these employees either by establishing separate benefit plans solely for  these individuals or by arranging for their participation in existing  corporate plans, where contractor employees at DOE sites and those  contractor employees assigned to non-DOE work participate in the same  benefit plans.", "DOE reimburses contractor payments for employee compensation,  including postretirement benefits as authorized by applicable regulations  and each contractor\u2019s operating agreement. For example, the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) establishes uniform policies and procedures  for the acquisition of goods and services by executive agencies. The FAR  cost principles include factors to be considered by an agency when  determining whether a contractor-claimed cost is to be allowed and  reimbursed by an agency.  Generally, consideration of whether  compensation costs incurred under a government contract with a  commercial organization are allowable includes whether they are, among other things, reasonable, allocable, and compliant with other applicable  standards and the terms of the contract. For fiscal year 2003, DOE  reimbursed approximately $431 million in contractor postretirement  benefit contributions at 39 different DOE contractor sites.", "Contractor employees qualify for retiree benefits in pension and  postretirement health plans differently, resulting in different methodologies  for the payment of the two types of benefits. Pension benefits are  determined using a formula based on employee salary and years of service  as specified by contractor plan provisions. Employees accrue, or earn,  future pension benefits throughout their period of service and are generally  required to work for a certain period, called a vesting period, before they  have a right to receive any accrued retirement benefits. DOE contractors  that offer defined benefit pension plans are subject to the minimum funding  standards established by the Employee Retirement and Income Security  Act of 1974 (ERISA).The ERISA requirements set minimum standards  regarding how much contractors must set aside each year in order to  provide for future defined benefit pension payments when they are due.", "In contrast to contributions for pension benefits, there are no legal  requirements to fund postretirement health benefits in advance for  payments to retirees. Therefore, DOE contractors generally pay for  postretirement health plans on a pay-as-you-go basis. Retired contractor  employees are usually entitled to participate in contractor health plans  after they complete a period of service immediately prior to their  retirement. However, unlike pension benefits, the future amount of  postretirement health benefits earned by a contractor employee cannot be  expressly defined at the employee\u2019s retirement date. This is due, in part, to  the potential for future contractor changes in benefit provisions, such as  retiree contributions, copayments, and coverage limitations, or  cancellation of postretirement health coverage.", "Figure 1 summarizes the previously discussed relationships between DOE,  contractors, third-party administrators, and contractor employees in the  payment, sponsorship, and delivery of postretirement benefits.", "Consistent with the long-term nature of DOE research and cleanup  activities, it is DOE\u2019s policy to provide for the continuation of  postretirement benefit plans when there are changes in individual  contractors due to contract competitions. Typically, these scenarios would  not result in the need for the cancellation and re-creation of these benefit  plans. Although future contractor employee benefits earned may change as  a result of contract negotiations, DOE attempts to continue the existing  benefit plan with the new contractor as the sponsor, or offer comparable  benefits in a successor contractor benefit plan during changes in  contractors. Under this scenario, prior contractor retirees continue  receiving benefits from the new plan sponsor and current employees  continue to accrue benefits according to existing plan provisions.", "It is also DOE\u2019s policy to facilitate the continuation of postretirement  benefits following the completion of activities at environmental cleanup  sites. DOE officials stated that an agency review of contracts, benefit plan  documents, and labor agreements determined that contractor  postretirement plans set forth the terms of an exchange between the  contractor and contractor employees. In exchange for current services,  contractors provide benefits after retirement (i.e., monthly pension  payments and payments toward postretirement health insurance  premiums) as defined by the terms of the postretirement benefit plans.  DOE officials also stated that the continuation of pension and  postretirement health benefits is necessary to reward former contractor  employees for prior service at cleanup sites and to attract and retain future  contractors and contractor employees to work at remaining cleanup sites.", "The completion of all contractor activities at environmental cleanup sites  generally results in either the termination of the prime contract or a  significant reduction in the scope of the outstanding contract. These  contract changes at site closure differ from a change in contractor at an  ongoing site because retirees who earned postretirement benefits under  the terms of prior contracts are left without an active contractor to  administer future benefit payments. It is DOE\u2019s policy in these situations  that future postretirement benefits earned by contractor employees may be  satisfied by the outgoing contractor in one of two ways. Under the first  option, the contractor can request reimbursement from DOE for the  immediate settlement of outstanding benefit obligations, such as through  the purchase of insurance contracts. Under the second option, the  contractor may facilitate the continuation of the current benefit program  and seek DOE reimbursement as postretirement benefit payments are  made to retirees. The outgoing contractor can achieve the latter option  through continuing to sponsor current postretirement benefit plans or  through the transfer of plan administration to another party. This report  refers to those benefits due and paid after site closure as post-closure  benefits.", "In 1996, DOE issued Order 350.1 to establish responsibilities, requirements,  and further cost allowability criteria for the management and oversight of  contractor compensation programs. The order provides that contracting  officers are largely responsible for the review and approval of allowable  contractor compensation costs. It also details procedures for the  management and oversight of postretirement benefits, such as the approval  of new postretirement benefit plans, the approval of changes made to  existing plans, and required procedures during contract and postretirement  benefit plan terminations. The department\u2019s Contractor Human Resources  Management Division (CHRM) is responsible for providing contracting  officers with policies and procedures for managing contractor  postretirement benefits costs under the provisions of DOE Order 350.1.  DOE\u2019s Office of Procurement Assistance Management (OPAM) establishes  overall performance objectives for contractor compensation programs and  approves changes to pension and postretirement health benefit plans in  excess of contracting officer authorization limits. The National Nuclear  Security Administration (NNSA) assumes these responsibilities at current  naval reactor sites and assists in the review of contractor compensation  programs at other NNSA-designated locations.", "DOE Order 350.1 requires contractors to complete a recurring evaluation of  their employee benefit programs, including pension and postretirement  health plans, against the benefit programs of labor competitors in the  private sector or other professionally recognized measures.", "These provisions are completed to aid contracting officers in assessing  contractor benefit costs against the reasonableness standards of the FAR.  Specifically, DOE Order 350.1 states that contractors may use either the  results from (1) a benefit value study or (2) the annual U.S. Chamber of  Commerce Employee Benefit Study, collectively called comparison studies  in this report, to perform an appropriate evaluation of their benefit  programs.", "Benefit value studies are intended to measure the relative worth of a  contractor\u2019s benefit programs to its employees. This is done through the  calculation of a replacement value for the benefits offered in the  contractor\u2019s benefit program. Replacement values that may differ among  employees, such as the use and extent of current employee health benefits,  are calculated through the use of a hypothetical group of employees. This  methodology allows comparisons between the provisions of benefit  programs with different demographics, turnover and retirement rates, and  benefit election patterns. As such, replacement values are also calculated  for selected labor market competitors of the contractor and compared to  the contractor replacement values. DOE contractors engage benefits  consulting companies to assist with the benefit value studies and work with  contracting officers to approve the methodologies used.", "Replacement values are found for each benefit component evaluated in the  study and used to develop an overall benefit index program for that  contractor. The final product of the benefit value study, called the net  benefit value index, compares the relative value of the contractor\u2019s  employer-paid benefits to the employer-paid value of the average labor  competitor\u2019s benefits, represented by an index of 100. Therefore, a  contractor with a net benefit value index of 107.0 offers benefits to its  employees with a replacement value that is 7 percent above the average of  the contractor\u2019s labor competitors. As mentioned, the benefit value studies  also create separate indexes for major individual benefit components, such  as pension benefits and vacation time.", "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Employee Benefit Study, or Chamber of  Commerce cost study, provides a comparison of the annual employee  benefit contributions and payments made by the contractor with the  average contributions and payments of a survey population. The U.S.  Chamber of Commerce Employee Benefit Study is an annual polling of  domestic employers conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s  Statistics and Research Center and sponsored by American International  Group, Inc.

Table 1 summarizes the funded status for pension and  postretirement health benefits for the last 5 fiscal year-ends as reported by  DOE.", "In general, deterioration in the funded status of postretirement health  benefits can be attributed to the excess of future benefits earned by current  contractor employees, known as service costs, plus interest costs on  outstanding obligations over the payments made to retirees to satisfy  previously earned benefits. Postretirement health benefit service costs plus  interest costs have ranged from 2.3 times to 2.5 times the payments to  retirees made in each of the past 5 fiscal years. The significant increases in  recent retiree health benefit costs, decreases in discount rates, and  continuing accrual of postretirement benefits in existing contractor plans  all affect the service and interest costs of contractor postretirement health  plans, although we did not determine to what extent each of these  individual factors affected the total funded status.", "Annual changes in the funded status of pension plans, unlike changes in the  funded status of postretirement health plans, can be significantly affected  by returns on dedicated pension assets. Contributions to pension plans are  generally held in trust for the payment of benefits to participants and their  beneficiaries. Plan trustees, usually banks or trust companies, make  investment decisions for the plan with these assets. Contractor pension  assets have, on average, experienced negative returns from 7 percent to 8  percent in each of the past 5 fiscal years. Negative asset returns decrease  the fair market value of accumulated pension assets and therefore  significantly contribute to changes in the funded status of pension benefits.", "However, because of current DOE policies, neither the current unfunded  position nor the significant recent changes in funded status results in a  requirement for contractors, or DOE, to make any additional annual  postretirement benefit contributions. DOE Order 350.1 provides that in  general, annual contractor contributions for pension benefits shall not  exceed the minimum contribution required by ERISA. The order also  provides that postretirement health benefits are paid using a pay-as-you-go  method unless otherwise required by state or federal statute. See table 2 for  pension contributions and postretirement health payments reimbursed by  DOE over the last 5 fiscal years.", "However, certain contractors may face higher short-term pension  contributions because minimum contributions calculated under ERISA  rules factor in both current service costs and outstanding obligations.

The ability of DOE to honor these claims largely depends  on DOE\u2019s available financial resources compared to the total settlement  costs involved in the satisfaction of outstanding postretirement benefits.", "According to DOE officials, DOE has recently considered several options  to avoid postretirement benefit settlements because the reimbursement of  contractors for the purchase of annuity contracts and future health benefit  payments involves significant costs above the calculated settlement  amount. Because of the budgetary resources required to settle  postretirement benefits at completed cleanup sites, DOE officials  anticipate continuing the annual reimbursement of benefit payments by  extending contracts with cleanup site contractors in some cases, solely to  administer the benefits, thereby preserving the contractor relationship as  the plan sponsor. The continuation of these benefits creates specific  challenges for DOE, including the following:  DOE currently attempts to pass the administrative responsibilities for  the continuation of post-closure employee benefits to existing  contractors.

In addition, DOE\u2019s Value  Study Desk Manual describes recommended methodologies for the  completion of a benefit value study. Collectively, the procedures and  methodology outlined in DOE Order 350.1 and the Value Study Desk  Manual are intended to provide reasonable assurance that the comparison  studies result in valid, reliable, and comparable information regarding the  benefits offered by DOE contractors. To assess the studies completed by  DOE contractors, we selected 12 significant provisions from DOE Order  350.1 and the Value Study Desk Manual and reviewed the most recently  completed contractor studies for conformance with these provisions. Our  review encompassed all 21 contractor sites subject to the comparison  study provisions of DOE Order 350.1 (18 completed benefit value studies  and 3 completed Chamber of Commerce cost studies).", "Based on our review of the studies performed at contractor sites subject to  the valuation provisions of DOE Order 350.1 and the Value Study Desk  Manual, we found one or more instances of nonconformance with required  or recommended comparison study procedures at 18 of the 21 contractor  sites. In summary, we found instances of nonconformance with guidance in  the following areas:  Contractors did not follow applicable provisions for selecting and  documenting comparators used in the development of a benefit value  index (11 of 18 sites completing benefit value studies).", "Contractors did not use the recommended methodologies to calculate  the results of the comparison study (10 of 21 sites completing benefit  value or cost studies).", "Contracting officers did not obtain recommended certifications from  contractors and actuarial consultants to verify data used in the benefit  value studies (16 of 18 sites completing benefit value studies).", "Since the results of the benefit value comparison studies are sensitive to  the selection of a comparator group, DOE Order 350.1 and the Value Study  Desk Manual provide that the comparator group include at least 15  participants, only 20 percent of which can be other DOE contractor sites  that compete for professional level staff. Our review determined that 11 out  of 18 contractors did not properly select comparator firms or maintain  documentation on comparators in accordance with recommended  procedures in the Value Study Desk Manual. Although DOE policies also  require contracting officers to review and approve the contractor  comparator group prior to the completion of the benefit value study,  several contractors were not in compliance with this agency procedure  because they did not provide the specific documentation recommended by  the Value Study Desk Manual. This situation may result in inconsistent  criteria selection for comparators among contractor studies.", "DOE Order 350.1 requires contractor comparison studies to generate  appropriate comparison statistics. The Value Study Desk Manual  recommends that benefit value studies calculate the contractor\u2019s total  employer-paid net benefit value using a comparison to the average total  (e.g., the mean) net benefit value for the comparator group. DOE Order  350.1 requires Chamber of Commerce cost studies to calculate the  contractor\u2019s actual per capita benefits cost per employee compared to the  most recently published survey from the same benefit year. Our review  found that 10 out of the 21 contractor sites did not calculate the desired  performance measure as required or recommended by DOE guidance. In  several cases, we found that the contractor total benefit value index was  computed based on the median, not the mean, of competitor replacement  values. We also found that separate performance measures were presented  for employee groups with tiered benefits without any indication of the total  cost distribution between the groups. The failure to calculate consistent  comparison study results makes it difficult for agency officials to compare  results among sites and correctly determine whether corrective action  plans are required.", "The Value Study Desk Manual also recommends that the assigned  contracting officers obtain certifications from both the contractor and the  benefits consulting group performing the comparison studies to verify the  accuracy, consistency, and validity of comparisons completed. The  certifications are key controls over the quality of the studies. For example,  they would alert contracting officers if the contractor was to change  comparator firms or valuation methodologies and assumptions or was  unable to obtain up-to-date competitor benefit data. Our review determined  that 16 out of 18 contractors that completed a benefit value study did not  submit the contractor and actuarial certifications at the completion of the  study. The absence of these certifications can result in the improper  interpretation of the comparison study results by contracting officers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Increased Management Review Would Help DOE Oversee Its Contractor Employee Benefits Program", "paragraphs": ["DOE could enhance its oversight of contractor employee benefits and  address the challenges posed by the future administration of significant  post-closure benefits by providing for greater management review of  information developed at individual contractor sites and incorporating a  focus on the long-term nature of pension and postretirement health  benefits. The limited review of post-closure benefit payments completed by  contracting officers at closed sites may make the continued  decentralization of benefit program monitoring impractical. Also, the   70-year anticipated duration for some DOE reimbursements of contractor  employee pension and postretirement health costs earned to date needs  additional consideration in DOE\u2019s evaluations of contractor benefit costs.", "DOE contracting officers are primarily responsible for determining the  allowability of DOE contractor employee benefit costs and administering  the benefits. Accordingly, DOE\u2019s current monitoring and risk assessment  process is largely performed by contracting officers who are responsible  for reviewing benefit programs at one contractor site. Contracting officers  have the ability to seek technical advice and policy support from various  DOE resources, including CHRM, OPAM, and NNSA. DOE also maintains a  Memorandum of Understanding with DOD agency offices to provide audit  services. These management offices offer, as needed or requested, various  issue- or location-specific monitoring activities; however, they do not  routinely review the results of the monitoring and risk assessment  activities of the contracting officers. Thus, agencywide information  regarding nonconformance with guidelines for contractor employee benefit  program assessments is not routinely analyzed by management so that  corrective actions can be taken.  Similarly, best practices are not routinely  identified at individual contractor sites and propagated across the agency.", "Also, dissimilarities in benefit programs between contractor locations can  lead to adverse situations for the contractor benefits program as a whole.  DOE recently approved proposals submitted by contractor employee  groups at two DOE sites to enhance each group\u2019s pension benefits so they  would be comparable with the pension benefits at another DOE site. The  agency approved these benefit enhancements largely based on the  argument that doing so would retain skilled staff, even though the most  recent contractor benefit value studies indicated that these sites already  had pension and postretirement health benefit replacement values  exceeding average labor competitor programs.", "The fact that some sites have closed, and others are nearing completion,  also suggests the need for more management attention to program reviews.  We found that contracting officers at several closed, or near-completed,  environmental sites did not perform comparison studies under the  provisions of DOE Order 350.1 or complete other substantive monitoring  procedures.  The failure to do so was attributed to a lack of resources. We  believe that transitioning these monitoring and risk assessment procedures  to a management level that will still exist after site closure would better  position DOE to address future challenges. Systematic monitoring reviews  and risk assessments will be necessary for post-closure benefits since DOE  officials contend that (1) current contractor pension and postretirement  health plan provisions allow for changes in postretirement benefits  subsequent to the site closure and (2) post-closure benefit payments  remain subject to compliance with DOE\u2019s guidance for comparison studies  and applicable regulations, such as the cost reasonableness provisions of  the FAR.", "Although the agency resources required to monitor DOD\u2019s contractor  benefits program are significantly greater than those needed at DOE, the  organizational structure at DOD provides an example of an oversight group  used to assist in compliance reviews and risk assessment at all contractor  locations. DOD provides contracting officers significant operational  support from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense  Contract Management Agency (DCMA). The two agencies provide a  consistent source of routine review and analysis of detailed benefit and  cost information outside of individual contractor locations. This group is  thus able to gain broad knowledge of contractor issues and decisions to  apply a more consistent definition of reasonableness to the evaluation of  contractor benefit costs. DOD also has formal guidance within the agency\u2019s  supplement to the FAR, which lists occurrences in postretirement health  or pension programs that indicate heightened risk and should lead a  contracting officer to request a separate in-depth evaluation of the policies,  practices, and costs of a contractor benefit component that is performed  jointly by DCAA and DCMA staff.", "DOE\u2019s evaluation of total benefits in the benefit value study rather than a  review of the individual benefit components does not fully address the  differences in costs between deferred benefit programs, such as pension  and postretirement health benefits, and other benefit components. A  management focus on the long-term impacts of contractor benefit program  decisions may provide improved information for decision makers in DOE  and Congress.  This information is important because decisions on changes  to pension and postretirement health benefits can have a significant impact  on DOE\u2019s long-term budgetary needs. For example, a 1 percent increase in  a contractor employee\u2019s current year vacation benefits has less impact on  DOE\u2019s long-term costs and budgetary needs than a 1 percent increase in  postretirement pension or health benefits, which have a continuous and  compounding effect as they are paid out in each year of retirement.  Nevertheless, DOE contracting officers decide whether corrective action  plans are needed largely based on the review of the total benefit value  index, which does not take into account the differences between the total  cost of pension and postretirement health benefits and other benefit  components. These cost differences may be significant because pension  and postretirement health benefits can require DOE reimbursement long  after an employee retires.", "As shown in table 4, the benefit value indexes for contractors\u2019 pension and  postretirement health benefits are significantly different from the total  benefits indexes shown in table 3. Both the pension and postretirement  health benefit indexes have larger programwide averages, larger index  ranges, and more contractors with benefit indexes outside of DOE\u2019s target  range of 5 percent above the average of selected competitors.  For  example, postretirement health benefits average more than 44 percent  greater than the average of the DOE contractors\u2019 competitors, while  defined benefit pensions average 29 percent greater.", "In addition, DOE\u2019s review of current pension contributions and  postretirement health payments through the Chamber of Commerce cost  studies completed by three contractor sites is not consistent with the long- term nature of pension and postretirement health benefits. This  inconsistency is largely due to the fact that annual employer contributions  for pension and health benefits generally do not equal the estimated  amount of postretirement benefits earned by current employees that year,  also called the annual service cost of benefits. For example, DOE  reimbursed $430 million in costs to its contractors for pension and health  plan contributions in fiscal year 2003; however, the reported fiscal year  2003 service cost of those plans was $872 million.", "It is DOE\u2019s policy to evaluate contractor requests for changes to existing  pension and postretirement health plans by reviewing total benefit values  and annual contributions, rather than total costs. DOE Order 350.1 requires  contractors to submit proposed changes to contractor postretirement  benefit programs with information on the impact of the changes on existing  comparison studies and anticipated changes in cost. However, the order  does not differentiate the annual contractor contribution cost from the  total future cost of the changes. For example, the determination to accept  proposed changes by one contractor noted that the increase in pension  liabilities caused by the changes would not result in additional short-term  reimbursements by DOE due to the positive funded status of the plan.  Furthermore, our review of changes made to contractor postretirement  benefit plans during fiscal year 2002 revealed that 3 out of 11 contractors  that submitted changes to DOE for approval did not include either the  effect of the plan changes on comparison study results or an estimate of  savings or costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The satisfaction of postretirement contractor benefits earned under  current and prior contracts with the government will require significant  amounts of budgetary and administrative resources to pay and monitor the  payment of these benefits long after current research contracts and  cleanup sites are terminated. Because DOE has excluded certain  contractor locations from a requirement to complete periodic benefit  valuation studies, it cannot apply a consistent evaluation of costs for all  benefit programs. Within programs required to complete comparison  studies, instances of contractor nonconformance with policies and  guidance make the results difficult to interpret and use in making  management decisions regarding the level of program benefits. The  challenges associated with administering post-closure benefits and a lack  of focus on the long-term nature of postretirement pension and health  benefit obligations exacerbate these problems.
