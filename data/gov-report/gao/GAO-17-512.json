Also, DOD and congressional committees have identified actions that could mitigate risks associated with ending the dual-hat leadership arrangement, such as formalizing agreements between NSA/CSS and CYBERCOM to ensure continued collaboration, and developing a persistent cyber training environment to provide a realistic, on-demand training capability. As of April 2017, DOD had not determined whether it would end the dual-hat leadership arrangement.", "DOD's progress in implementing key cybersecurity guidance\u2014the DOD Cloud Computing Strategy , The DOD Cyber Strategy , and the DOD Cybersecurity Campaign \u2014has varied. DOD has implemented the cybersecurity elements of the DOD Cloud Computing Strategy and has made progress in implementing The DOD Cyber Strategy and DOD Cybersecurity Campaign . However, DOD's process for monitoring implementation of The DOD Cyber Strategy has resulted in the closure of tasks before they were fully implemented; for example, DOD closed a task that, among other things, would require completing cyber risk assessments on 136 weapon systems. Officials acknowledged they are on track to complete the assessments by December 31, 2019, but as of May 2017, the task was not complete. Unless DOD modifies its process for deciding whether a task identified in its Cyber Strategy is implemented, it may not be able to achieve outcomes articulated in the strategy. Also, DOD lacks a timeframe and process for monitoring implementation of the DOD Cybersecurity Campaign objective to transition to commander-driven operational risk assessments for cybersecurity readiness. Unless DOD improves the monitoring of its key cyber strategies, it is unknown when DOD will achieve cybersecurity compliance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD take the following two actions: (1) modify its criteria for closing tasks from The DOD Cyber Strategy ; and (2) establish a timeframe and monitoring for implementing an objective of the DOD Cybersecurity Campaign to transition to commander-driven operational risk assessments for cybersecurity readiness. DOD partially concurred with these recommendations and identified actions it plans to take. If implemented, GAO believes these actions would satisfy the intent of the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) faces tens of millions of attempted  malicious cyber intrusions per year as adversaries seek to take  advantage of the department\u2019s reliance upon computer networks.  Although only a small fraction of these attempts are successful, any  successful intrusion has the potential to provide adversaries with the  ability to collect valuable intelligence about capabilities and operations,  degrade networks, and manipulate information that commanders need to  make timely and critical decisions. In the past decade there have been  several high-profile breaches of DOD\u2019s information and networks. For  example, in 2008, DOD suffered a significant compromise of its networks  when a flash drive infected with malicious computer code was inserted  into a DOD-owned laptop in the Middle East. The malicious code spread  throughout DOD\u2019s unclassified and classified networks and enabled data  to be transferred to servers under foreign control.", "In the past decade, DOD has acknowledged the increasing scope and  capability of adversaries to negatively affect DOD information and  networks. As such, DOD has taken a number of steps to defend its use of  cyberspace from evolving cyber threats. For example, in 2009, DOD  established U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) to, among other things,  address the risk of cyber threats and vulnerabilities. In the process of  standing up CYBERCOM, in 2010 the President re-designated the  Director National Security Agency (NSA) as CYBERCOM\u2019s commander,  establishing a \u201cdual-hat\u201d leadership arrangement with the intent of  allowing CYBERCOM to leverage the existing capabilities and capacity of  NSA. NSA, among other things, serves as the government lead for  cryptology, exercises operational control of signals intelligence, and  provides cybersecurity products and services in support of DOD. The  Director of NSA also serves as the chief of DOD\u2019s Central Security  Service (CSS), which promotes coordination between NSA and the  military service cryptologic elements. Officials told us that NSA and CSS are separate organizations, but they now essentially operate as a single  entity (henceforth referred to as \u201cNSA/CSS\u201d in this report).", "From fiscal years 2011 through 2016, we issued a number of reports on  DOD\u2019s efforts to protect against cyberspace threats in which we  highlighted management weaknesses across the department and made  recommendations that could improve the department\u2019s cyberspace  management and operations. In 2015 and 2016, we issued reports in  which we emphasized the importance of the recommendations contained  in three cybersecurity reports as high-priorities for DOD to address.  These reports related to the security of DOD\u2019s defense industrial base,  resiliency planning in the event of a cyberattack, and roles and  responsibilities for supporting civil authorities in the event of a cyberattack  that affects the homeland. Later in this report we discuss these reviews  and DOD\u2019s progress in implementing our recommendations in more  depth.", "House Report 114-537 accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 and House Report 114-573  accompanying a bill for the Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal Year  2017 include provisions for us to assess DOD\u2019s management of progress  in protecting its cyber networks, systems, and information\u2014generally  equivalent to assessing DOD\u2019s cybersecurity efforts. Specifically, DOD  defines cybersecurity as the prevention of damage to, protection of, and  restoration of computers, electronic communications systems and  services, wire communications, and electronic communications, including  information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity,  authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. This report examines  (1) DOD officials\u2019 perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of  maintaining the dual-hat leadership arrangement of NSA/CSS and  CYBERCOM, and actions that could mitigate risks entailed in ending the  leadership arrangement; (2) the extent to which DOD has implemented  key strategic cybersecurity guidance; and (3) the status of DOD\u2019s efforts  to implement our cybersecurity recommendations.", "To determine DOD officials\u2019 perspectives on the advantages and  disadvantages of maintaining the dual-hat leadership arrangement of  NSA/CSS and CYBERCOM as well as actions that could mitigate risks entailed in ending the leadership arrangement, we reviewed documents  used by the Joint Staff and CYBERCOM to brief their leadership on the  advantages and disadvantages of the arrangement. We also interviewed  officials from NSA/CSS, CYBERCOM, and the office of DOD\u2019s Chief  Information Officer (CIO) about their perspectives on the advantages and  disadvantages of the dual-hat leadership arrangement. Further, we sent a  written questionnaire to 25 DOD components, including 9 combatant  commands, all 4 military services, 5 combat support agencies, and 7  DOD components responsible for implementing key strategic  cybersecurity guidance. The questionnaire contained 10 questions on  how the dual-hat leadership arrangement affects cyber missions,  functions, and operations, and it instructed recipients to develop  responses representing the perspectives of their components. We  received 14 complete responses to the dual-hat leadership portion of our  questionnaire from CYBERCOM, 6 combatant commands, 4 combat  support agencies, and 3 offices within the Office of the Secretary of  Defense. We received partial responses from 9 other DOD components,  which provided background information on the dual-hat, but not their  views on the advantages, disadvantages, and actions to mitigate risks.  We did not receive any responses from 2 of the components. DOD CIO  also compiled an official response from DOD to the dual-hat leadership  arrangement questions that reflected views from across the 25 DOD  components to whom we sent questionnaires.", "Our report reflects the DOD-wide response and the information we  received from the 14 components who responded to our questions.  Additionally, we gathered information from NSA/CSS, CYBERCOM, the  Joint Staff, components from within the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, and the 14 components who responded to our questionnaire on  aspects of the dual-hat leadership arrangement between NSA/CSS and  CYBERCOM that should be preserved or enhanced, and considerations  that should be made before the dual-hat leadership of the organizations is  ended. After compiling the documentary evidence, interview results, and  questionnaire responses, we grouped the resulting advantages and  disadvantages into categories and sent the results with descriptions and  examples to officials at NSA/CSS, CYBERCOM, and DOD CIO for review  to provide additional assurance that the team accurately and  appropriately described and categorized the responses. The components  provided us with technical comments that we incorporated into the report,  as appropriate.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has implemented key strategic  cybersecurity guidance, we first identified DOD\u2019s key strategic  cybersecurity guidance by asking senior officials from the offices of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy, the DOD Principal Cyber  Advisor, and the DOD CIO to identify the strategies, plans, and guidance  currently used by the department to support the implementation of its  cybersecurity capabilities. We also sent questionnaires to 25 DOD  components instructing them to develop responses representing the  perspectives of their components. The questionnaire contained 10  questions on key cyber guidance, and we received responses from 22 of  the components for these questions. Based on input provided by senior  DOD officials and the responses from the 22 DOD components who  responded to our questionnaire, we identified the following three key  strategic cybersecurity documents to review: the 2012 DOD Cloud  Computing Strategy, the 2015 DOD Cybersecurity Campaign, and The  DOD Cyber Strategy, published in 2015.", "Second, we reviewed the documents we identified through input from  senior DOD officials and responses to our questionnaire in order to gain  an understanding of the department\u2019s priorities and efforts to defend itself  from evolving cyberspace threats. Although the 2012 DOD Cloud  Computing Strategy and The DOD Cyber Strategy focus on a number of  cyberspace issues, we limited our review of these documents to the  portions related specifically to DOD\u2019s cybersecurity mission. For example,  The DOD Cyber Strategy includes five strategic goals focused on cyber  operations, cybersecurity, and international cooperation, among other  things. To accomplish these goals, DOD identified 49 tasks to complete.  For our review, however, we focused on the 22 tasks related specifically  to the cybersecurity goal.", "Third, we collected tracking information and planning documents on  DOD\u2019s cybersecurity efforts in order to learn about the internal controls  for, and determine the extent to which, the department reported  implementing the specific goals, objectives, or tasks associated with the  key strategic cybersecurity guidance. Documents we obtained included  monthly implementation status updates from the Principal Cyber Advisor  on the tasks related to The DOD Cyber Strategy, and DOD\u2019s  Cybersecurity Scorecard, which monitors key tasks from the four lines of  effort in the DOD Cybersecurity Discipline Implementation Plan. We  compared the internal control activities established in these documents  with the monitoring standards established in the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s Management Responsibility for Enterprise Risk  Management and Internal Control and the Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government. In addition, we discussed the department\u2019s  plans and implementation status with DOD officials within the component  organizations primarily responsible for implementing the key strategic  cybersecurity guidance in order to determine the extent to which the  efforts were implemented and closed and to learn more about the internal  control environment. Specifically, we met with DOD officials from the  offices of the DOD Principal Cyber Advisor; DOD CIO; Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy; and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions,  Technology, and Logistics. We also met with officials from the Joint Staff;  CYBERCOM, and the Defense Information Systems Agency. Finally, for  the efforts DOD reported as implemented, we compared documentary  evidence of the department\u2019s actions with the relevant cybersecurity  requirement to determine whether the actions satisfied the goal, objective,  or task identified in the key strategic cybersecurity guidance. However,  we did not test the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s implementation. For those  efforts DOD reported as in progress, we discussed the implementation  status and the challenges, if any, that might impede implementation.", "To determine the status of DOD\u2019s efforts to implement our cybersecurity  recommendations, we reviewed the implementation status of  cybersecurity recommendations made to DOD from fiscal years 2011  through 2016. For the purposes of this report, we focused our efforts on  our reports that included cybersecurity-related recommendations to DOD.  Once we identified the reports to include in our review, we used our  recommendation tracking system to determine the status of the  recommendations\u2014i.e., open, closed as implemented, or closed as not- implemented. Open recommendations represent those that DOD is still  taking actions to implement. For those recommendations that were listed  as open, we coordinated with DOD officials responsible for implementing  the recommendations to identify any actions DOD has taken to do so.  Where DOD has taken actions, we determined whether the actions taken  and documents DOD has provided would enable us to change the status  of the recommendation.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2016 to August 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

This strategy, according to DOD, presents an aggressive,  specific plan for leaders from across the department to take action and  hold their organizations accountable to achieve the strategy\u2019s objectives.  The DOD Cyber Strategy sets prioritized strategic goals and objectives  for DOD\u2019s cyber activities and missions to achieve over the ensuing five  years (that is, through 2020). The Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy; Office of the Principal Cyber Advisor to the Secretary  of Defense; the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics; and the Joint Staff work with the DOD  components to prioritize and oversee the implementation of this strategy  and its objectives and to assign responsibility for managing each  objective.

This working group  ensures that federal acquisition rules and guidance mature over time in a  manner consistent with standards, and it establishes an analysis  capability to improve protection of controlled technical information and  other critical information department-wide. In another example, DOD has  adopted activities that include both regulatory and voluntary programs to  improve the cybersecurity of defense industrial base companies.  Companies maintaining covered defense information or providing critical  support are now contractually required to report cyber incidents and use  security standards identified in a National Institute of Standards and  Technology special publication on protecting controlled unclassified  information in nonfederal information systems. In addition, in October  2015, DOD modified eligibility criteria for participants in the defense  industrial base cybersecurity information sharing program. Since this  revision, DOD officials reported that program participation expanded from  124 to 207 industry partners.", "While DOD has taken some actions on all 22 cybersecurity tasks, we  found that it has closed some tasks before they were fully implemented.  This increases the risk that DOD will not fully implement those tasks, and  also increases the risk that leadership will not be aware of delays or  complications related to fully implementing The DOD Cyber Strategy.  Specifically, the Principal Cyber Advisor has closed tasks when that office  confirms that the DOD component primarily responsible for  implementation has begun taking action on the tasks and follow-on work  to complete the tasks has been integrated into existing DOD processes,  operations, or policies. For example, DOD closed the task that required  the department to assess the cybersecurity of current and future weapon  systems. According to The DOD Cyber Strategy, DOD is to assess and  initiate cybersecurity improvements for existing weapon systems;  mandate cybersecurity requirements for future weapon systems; and  update acquisition and procurement policies to promote effective  cybersecurity. The Deputy Principal Cyber Advisor approved closing this  task in The DOD Cyber Strategy monitoring process when the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics submitted  a plan to Congress that was required by a provision in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and established a process  to develop cybersecurity requirements for future weapon systems. In  response to both The DOD Cyber Strategy task and the provision in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, DOD\u2014under  the leadership of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics\u2014initiated assessments of its  existing weapon systems. In addition to initiating these assessments and  establishing a process to develop cybersecurity requirements for future  weapon systems, the office updated acquisition and procurement policies  to promote effective cybersecurity by adding an enclosure to its  acquisition guidance, entitled Cybersecurity in the Defense Acquisition  System. All three of these efforts demonstrate that DOD has taken  actions toward implementing this one task.", "However, while DOD has taken actions to implement this task, we found  that the task had not been fully implemented. Officials from the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics acknowledged that the task had not been fully implemented and  that the office was on schedule for completing the initial 136 assessments  by December 31, 2019, as required by statute. Similarly, DOD has made  progress toward establishing cybersecurity requirements for future  weapon systems, but the effort is not complete.

The process is undergoing a one-year trial period and is scheduled to be  reassessed in 2018.", "In addition, once tasks have been closed by the Principal Cyber Advisor,  DOD has not continuously monitored task implementation; rather,  monitoring occurs on a case-by-case basis. For example, officials from  the office of the Principal Cyber Advisor told us that the office approved  the closure of a task to enhance the protection for critical acquisition  programs and technology on the condition that the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics provide  regular reports on progress in order to allow the Principal Cyber Advisor  to track progress and provide assistance when necessary. Further, the  officials from the office of the Principal Cyber Advisor told us that the  office reserves the right to re-open or initiate reviews of closed tasks; as  of April 2017, the office had not re-opened any closed tasks.", "We have previously determined that DOD components do not  consistently implement cybersecurity-related actions that are identified in  DOD directives, instructions, or memorandums from senior DOD  officials. In 2014, we reported on DOD\u2019s continuity planning and cyber  resiliency efforts. DOD closed a related cyber resiliency task identified in  The DOD Cyber Strategy after the department issued interim guidance for  incorporating cyber resilience into DOD component continuity of  operations plans; and DOD directed all of its components to establish or  update their continuity of operations plans to include cyber resiliency  measures by December 2017.

Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government explains that in defining objectives management  should clearly define what is to be achieved, how it will be achieved, and  the timeframes for achievement. Further, the standards state that  ongoing monitoring should be built into an entity\u2019s operations and be  performed continually.", "Based on these internal control standards, DOD\u2019s process is not sufficient  to ensure the completion or implementation of tasks.

In June 2015, the DOD CIO; the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; and the Commander of  CYBERCOM initiated a DOD Cybersecurity Campaign to identify specific  actions that drive commanders and DOD senior leaders to enforce full  cybersecurity compliance and accountability across the department.  According to the DOD Cybersecurity Campaign, its goals are to educate  commanders, civilian leaders, and all personnel responsible for the  cybersecurity of the DOD information network on the risk to the mission.  The three senior DOD leaders identified seven objectives to enable  commanders and DOD senior leaders to enforce full cybersecurity  compliance and accountability across the department. Table 7 below lists  each of these objectives and shows our determination of the status of  their implementation.", "As noted in the table above, DOD has implemented two of the objectives  identified in the DOD Cybersecurity Campaign. Specifically, in February  2017, the DOD Information Security Risk Management Committee  finalized a charter establishing a Platform Information Technology  Cybersecurity Working Group to focus on the cybersecurity of DOD  platform information technology systems, including but not limited to  weapon systems and industrial control systems. According to the charter,  this working group\u2014chaired by the DOD CIO; the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; and the Commander  of CYBERCOM\u2014will provide expertise on the cybersecurity of platform  information technology systems across DOD. A working group official  explained that platform information technology is currently applicable to  special purpose systems controlled and operated solely by technology,  including industrial control systems.", "The department has also implemented the DOD Cybersecurity Campaign  objective to develop a framework for defensive cyberspace operations  concept of operations that integrates defensive cyberspace operations  and DOD information operations across the DOD information network  forces. Specifically, in March 2017, the commander of CYBERCOM  approved operational guidance titled, Defensive Cyberspace Operations.  The operational guidance is applicable to CYBERCOM, all of its  supporting elements, and all DOD components performing defensive  cyberspace operations. Among other things, the guidance requires  defensive cyberspace operations to be integrated with other cyberspace  operations and information related activities. An official from CYBERCOM  told us that the operational guidance came from the work to develop a  concept of operations and was intended to address DOD\u2019s need for  guidance on defensive cyberspace operations.", "DOD has also developed processes and procedures to monitor the  implementation of four of the five DOD Cybersecurity Campaign  objectives that are in the process of being implemented. Specifically, the  DOD Cybersecurity Culture and Compliance Initiative monitors the  department\u2019s efforts in implementing two DOD Cybersecurity Campaign  objectives\u2014(1) execute priority initiatives for individual cybersecurity  awareness, and (2) develop and implement a program to reinforce the  traits and attributes of a healthy cybersecurity culture. In addition, DOD  uses the Cybersecurity Scorecard to monitor two other DOD  Cybersecurity Campaign objectives that are in progress\u2014development of  a DOD Cybersecurity Scorecard and the execution of the DOD  Cybersecurity Discipline Implementation Plan. According to DOD CIO  officials, the Cybersecurity Scorecard has allowed for better oversight of  DOD components\u2019 implementation of key cybersecurity measures and  provides a forum for elevating issues to the Secretary of Defense.  However, the scorecard is not fully implemented throughout the DOD  components, and DOD continues to work on automating data collection to  improve the data\u2019s reliability. Additionally, recognizing the importance of  resource prioritization, DOD CIO officials told us that the next phase is to  move to a risk-based scorecard, which DOD expects to have  implemented by March 2019.", "While DOD has taken steps to implement the DOD Cybersecurity  Campaign objectives that are still in process, the department does not  know when it will achieve full implementation for one of the objectives  because the department did not establish a timeframe for completing or  monitoring it to help ensure accountability for full implementation.  Specifically, the department does not have timeframes for the objective  associated with transitioning to commander-driven operational risk  assessments for cybersecurity readiness.", "DOD has begun implementing the objective to shift the focus of its  existing Command Cyber Readiness Inspection process to an operational  cybersecurity readiness assessment. Specifically, the Defense  Information Systems Agency and the Joint Force Headquarters-DOD  Information Network are leading an effort to transition the department  from a compliance-based Command Cyber Readiness Inspection process  to an operational risk-based inspection focused on missions,  vulnerabilities, and threats\u2014currently referred to as the Command Cyber  Operational Readiness Inspection process\u2014as the initial phase of  CYBERCOM\u2019s broader Command Cyber Readiness Inspection  improvement initiative. According to the Joint Force Headquarters-DOD  Information Network, the results of the new inspection process will be  expressed in terms of risk to the mission and the department\u2019s  information network, unlike the previous readiness inspection process,  which expressed results as pass or fail. DOD officials indicated that the  new operational risk assessments will better allow DOD components to  relate their cyber vulnerabilities to their mission.

In July 2011, we reported on DOD\u2019s  organization and planning of cyberspace operations, including its  defensive and offensive efforts to address cybersecurity threats. DOD  lacked clear and complete guidance on command and control  responsibilities, and DOD did not have a comprehensive approach to  assess its cyberspace capability needs and prioritize capability  gaps. We made 4 recommendations to strengthen DOD\u2019s  cyberspace doctrine and operations to better address cybersecurity  threats and ensure a more comprehensive approach to developing  and prioritizing the department\u2019s cyberspace capability needs. DOD  has implemented those 4 recommendations. In 2011, DOD updated  its guidance related to cyberspace command and control  relationships. In May 2012, DOD issued a capability gap assessment  memorandum that includes DOD cyberspace capability gaps,  proposed mitigation actions, and estimated completion dates. In  February 2013, DOD issued a joint doctrine publication on cyberspace  operations. These actions allowed the department to take a more  comprehensive approach to its cyberspace capabilities and clarify its  cyberspace command and control relationships.", "Cyberspace Budget Estimates. In July 2011, we reported that  DOD\u2019s cybersecurity budget estimates did not include all full-spectrum  cyberspace operations, including computer network attack, computer  network exploitation, and classified funding costs. The department  also lacked a central organization or a methodology for collecting and  compiling budget information on cyberspace operations. We made 2  recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s ability to develop and provide  consistent and complete budget estimates for its cyberspace  operations. DOD implemented these recommendations by issuing  new guidance for cyberspace operations budget submissions. The  new guidance documents enabled DOD to develop a single  cyberspace operations budget estimate that provides a complete  picture of its cyberspace operations investments.", "Small Business Cybersecurity Efforts. In September 2015, we  recommended that DOD identify and disseminate cybersecurity  resources to defense small businesses, because DOD\u2019s Office of  Small Business Programs had not done so. In their response to the  draft report, DOD officials stated that the department would implement  training events and education programs. Since then DOD has  implemented this recommendation by making a reference guide for its  workforce to use when engaging with small businesses.

In April 2014, we found that some DOD  components had not developed continuity plans, conducted continuity  exercises, or established oversight to hold the components  accountable. Therefore, we made 4 recommendations to strengthen  DOD\u2019s cyber continuity program by: (1) updating DOD\u2019s continuity  guidance; (2) providing planning tools for exercises with cyber  degradation; (3) increasing oversight of the components; and (4)  evaluating its process for tasking the components and evaluating their  continuity readiness. DOD concurred with and subsequently took  actions to begin implementing the 4 recommendations; however, DOD  has not fully implemented these recommendations. For example,  DOD drafted an update to its defense continuity policy guidance, but  as of January 2017, the revisions had not been completed. Without  this guidance, it will be difficult for the DOD components to provide  reasonable assurance that the systems and networks needed to  maintain continuity of operations in a degraded cyber environment will  be reliable, accessible, or available within needed timeframes.", "Insider Threat. In June 2015, we made 4 recommendations to  address challenges with DOD\u2019s insider threat program\u2014of which  DOD concurred with two, and partially concurred with two. DOD is  developing an insider threat implementation plan to address two of the  recommendations, but that plan has not yet been published. DOD  officials told us that the department is no longer taking action to  address our recommendation to evaluate the extent to which its  insider-threat programs address capability gaps. This  recommendation originated in part when DOD did not complete a  continuing analysis of gaps in security measures and of technology,  policies, and processes that are needed to increase the capability of  its insider-threat program to address these gaps, as required by  statute. This survey would have allowed DOD to define existing  insider-threat program capabilities; identify gaps in security measures;  and advocate for the technology, policies, and processes necessary  to increase capabilities in the future. In their comments to the draft  report, DOD officials stated that the department analyzes security  gaps each quarter through its self-assessments, which identify  program capability gaps. However, DOD has not evaluated and  documented the extent to which the current assessments describe  existing insider-threat program capabilities, as required by law.  Without a documented evaluation, the department will not know  whether its capabilities to address insider threats are adequate, or  whether the capabilities address statutory requirements.", "Defense Civil Support. In April 2016, we found that DOD\u2019s guidance  did not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of key DOD  entities\u2014such as DOD components\u2014for domestic cyber incidents.  For example, U.S. Northern Command\u2019s Defense Support of Civil  Authorities response concept plan states that U.S. Northern  Command would be the supported command for a mission to support  civil authorities in responding to a domestic cyber incident. However,  other guidance directs and DOD officials confirmed that a different  command, CYBERCOM, would be responsible for supporting civil  authorities in the event of a domestic cyber incident. Therefore, we  made a recommendation that DOD issue or update guidance that  clarifies roles and responsibilities to support civil authorities in a  domestic cyber incident. DOD concurred with this recommendation.  As of April 2017, the department had not implemented this  recommendation, but officials indicated that they are in the process of  drafting guidance that will clarify these roles. Specifically, the  department is drafting a memorandum on defense support for cyber  incident response that DOD officials believe will clearly articulate how  DOD would support domestic cyber incident response efforts. DOD  also scheduled exercises and a workshop to help it prepare to support  civil authorities in the event of a cyber incident. However, until DOD  clarifies the roles and responsibilities of its key entities for cyber  incidents, it will remain unclear which DOD component or command  should be providing support to civil authorities in the event of a major  cyber incident.", "We continue to believe that implementing these 12 recommendations  would improve DOD\u2019s cyberspace posture.
