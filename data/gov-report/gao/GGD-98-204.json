Microcap fraud is typically associated with \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes involving high pressure sales tactics designed to induce investors to purchase relatively worthless stocks in which the firm or other insiders hold a large inventory. When successful, these high pressure sales tactics result in an increase in the price of the targeted stock (pump). Insiders then sell (dump) their shares, sometimes realizing large profits at the expense of public investors. A variety of other fraudulent practices are also used as part of these schemes, including \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactics, unauthorized trading, failure to execute sell orders, and excessive markups or price increases. Firms investigated for microcap fraud have typically been owned or controlled by individuals with ties to other firms with a history of stock fraud.", "The securities markets, of which microcap securities are a part, are regulated by SEC, industry SROs, and state securities regulators. The SROs monitor members, including individuals and firms, for compliance with federal and SRO requirements. Among its responsibilities, SEC inspects SRO compliance programs for adequacy and conducts examinations of broker-dealers, including microcap firms. The states license firms and individuals to operate in their jurisdictions. Many states also conduct on-site examinations of broker-dealers.", "To centralize broker licensing and registration, NASD and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) established CRD in 1981. The database was designed to provide a more efficient licensing and registration process by eliminating redundant state reporting requirements. Operated by NASD Regulation Inc. (NASDR), CRD\u2019s centralized computer system has allowed individual brokers and firms to satisfy both state and NASD reporting requirements. Over the years, however, CRD\u2019s role has expanded to serve several other regulatory functions, such as gathering information for federal, state, and SRO enforcement and examination purposes, including identifying problem brokers or firms. CRD has also become the primary source of information for NASD\u2019s public disclosure program. Among other things, this program provides investors with information on the professional background, business practices, and conduct of NASD member firms and their brokers.

NASD district offices also target branch offices for review based on complaints of customers, termination of registered representatives for cause, and transactions in microcap stocks.

In addition to informing investors of the availability of information from state regulators, as of March 16, 1998, NASD reports information related to pending and final disciplinary actions, civil judgments, arbitration decisions, pending customer complaints, criminal convictions, settlements of $10,000 or more, and bankruptcies. On the same date, CRD information also became available to the public over the Internet, with disciplinary information available via electronic mail (discussed below).

As part of the sweep, 101 small- to medium-size broker-dealers were examined, focusing on the sales practices of selected problem brokers and the hiring and supervisory practices of the firms employing them (discussed further below). As a result of the sweep, 28 firms and 23 brokers were referred for enforcement action. In response to both the large firm project and sweep report recommendations, SEC and the SROs reported increasing their examination focus on sales practices and hiring and supervisory practices. In addition, SEC drafted several new examination modules to further address microcap and penny stock fraud, sales practices, and hiring and supervising problem brokers. SEC consolidated its SRO inspection and broker-dealer examination programs and created a separate office of broker-dealer examination oversight to expand and give greater focus to the broker-dealer examination program. As discussed above, NASD is developing an automated risk-based examination system. Furthermore, NYSE added questions and procedures to its examinations and implemented a surveillance system to track brokers with disciplinary histories.", "Also in response to the large firm report recommendations, SROs are now required to report all formal investigations as well as pending and final disciplinary actions to CRD for public disclosure. In addition, NASD members are required to report certain customer complaints within 10 business days and summary data on written customer complaints each quarter. In August 1994, SEC requested that the SROs closely monitor the timeliness of required filings and increase sanctions when noncompliance is discovered. In April 1998, NASD proposed a rule that would provide members with qualified immunity for statements made in good faith in filings related to disciplinary actions and terminations. In 1995, SEC approved a uniform industry continuing education program that requires periodic training in regulatory matters and ongoing programs by firms to keep brokers up to date.

The new modules should provide SEC a means of gauging adherence to the best practices. Also, in April 1997, NASD and NYSE issued a joint notice to members that encouraged the adoption of the best practices.

Among other things, the filings required by the proposed rule would have allowed bank regulators to consider a broker\u2019s disciplinary history in allocating examination resources, thereby, helping address the migration of unscrupulous brokers to the banking industry. To date, the proposed rule has not been finalized. In June 1998, NASD expressed concern to the banking regulators over bank employees taking the NASD examination. NASD communicated that the use of its examinations would not test for knowledge of bank rules and regulations. NASD recommended that new bank-specific examinations be developed and offered to assist in developing them. No further agreements on this point have been reached.", "In the absence of a rule change, no reporting has occurred and thus no record exists of the movement of unscrupulous securities brokers to banks or unregistered affiliates of banks.

CRD\u2019s original technology, however, was not able to accommodate this expansion. As a result, NASD began a redesign of CRD in 1992. This redesign has taken longer than expected, partly because of a switch in 1997 to technology that would allow Internet access. When completed, regulatory components of the new system will provide (1) automatic reports to regulators when certain predefined events occur, such as multiple customer complaints against a broker; (2) greater detection of late, deficient, or missed report filings; and (3) customized analytical capabilities to help regulators identify industry compliance trends, including those associated with specific problem brokers and firms. Also when completed, investors will be able to view broker and firm disciplinary information while on line.

The intent of our recommendation was to address SEC\u2019s inability to identify, across firms, trends in violations found during examinations that could warrant greater regulatory attention. Having such a capability would enhance the agency\u2019s ability to more efficiently and effectively target its resources. According to SEC, its planned replacement of EATS with the Super Tracking and Reporting System (STARS) will allow headquarters and regional office staff to identify and analyze trends in violations. For example, SEC staff said they will be able to query the system to determine the number of firms within a state or across the United States that have been cited for specific violations, such as those related to books and records violations or specific types of fraudulent conduct. Also, according to SEC, in order to gather more information about the significance and extent of violations found in examinations, the full text of all reports will be stored on a computerized system, called Zyindex, that will enable staff to search all reports using key words and to compile an analysis of the information. SEC staff told us that implementation of STARS and Zyindex is scheduled to begin in the fall of 1998.

However, this rule did not cover nonpenny stock transactions (i.e., securities priced at $5 or more).

These efforts have included information made available through federal, state, and SRO Internet web sites, free publications on investing, and SEC town meetings for investors. NASD also stated that it includes the toll-free hotline number and web-site address on every disciplinary action press release and has publicized them in a multilingual radio and television public service announcement campaign, in investor fairs and seminars, and in conjunction with investor and other associations.
