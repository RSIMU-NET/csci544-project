The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) develops safety standards and inspects and enforces railroads' compliance with these standards. On January 26, 2007, GAO reported on FRA's overall safety oversight strategy. (See GAO-07-149 .) The report discussed how FRA (1) focuses its efforts on the highest priority risks related to train accidents in planning its oversight, (2) identifies safety problems on railroad systems in carrying out its oversight, and (3) assesses the impact of its oversight efforts on safety. GAO recommended that FRA (1) put into place measures of the results of its inspection and enforcement programs and (2) evaluate its enforcement program.

FRA's May 2005 National Rail Safety Action Plan, the agency's overall strategy for targeting its oversight at the greatest risks, provides a reasonable framework for guiding these efforts. FRA's initiatives to address the most common causes of accidents are promising, although the success of many of them will depend on voluntary actions by the railroads. In addition, under the action plan, FRA has adopted a new inspection planning approach in which inspectors focus their efforts on locations that data-driven models indicate are most likely to have safety problems. In carrying out its safety oversight, FRA identifies a range of safety problems on railroad systems mainly by determining whether operating practices, track, and equipment are in compliance with minimum safety standards. However, FRA is able to inspect only about 0.2 percent of railroads' operations each year, and its inspections do not examine how railroads are managing safety risks throughout their systems that could lead to accidents. Such an approach, as a supplement to traditional compliance inspections, is used in the oversight of U.S. commuter railroads and pipelines and of Canadian railroads. GAO did not recommend that FRA adopt this approach because the agency's various initiatives to reduce the train accident rate have not yet had time to demonstrate their effects on safety. FRA uses a range of goals and measures to assess the impact of its oversight, such as (1) goals to target its inspection and enforcement programs at reducing various types of railroad accidents and (2) related measures, such as rates of track-caused accidents, to monitor its progress.

We reviewed FRA inspection and enforcement data for 1996  through 2005. In addition, we examined risk management principles and  safety oversight approaches used by other modal administrations within  the Department of Transportation and other organizations that have  similar safety missions in order to determine their possible application to  FRA. Our work focused on FRA oversight efforts to reduce the rate of  train accidents rather than those to reduce highway-rail crossing and  trespassing accidents because (1) the Department of Transportation\u2019s  Inspector General has recently assessed efforts to reduce highway-rail  crossing accidents and (2) trespassing accidents primarily involve issues  not related to railroad safety performance. As part of our review, we  assessed internal controls and the reliability of the data elements needed  for this engagement and determined that the data elements were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We conducted our work from  November 2005 through January 2007 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "In planning its safety oversight, FRA is focusing its efforts on the highest  priority risks related to train accidents through various initiatives aimed at  addressing the main causes of these accidents as well as through  improvements in its inspection planning approach. The agency\u2019s overall  strategy for targeting its oversight at the greatest risks is the National Rail  Safety Action Plan, which FRA issued in May 2005. This plan provides a  reasonable framework for guiding the agency\u2019s efforts to improve its  oversight. It includes initiatives to address the two main causes of train  accidents\u2014human factors and defective track\u2014and FRA has pursued  some additional initiatives to address these causes since issuing the plan.  These initiatives\u2014which include new regulations, research on new  technologies and approaches for improving safety, and new vehicles for  inspecting track\u2014are promising. However, most of them have not yet been  fully implemented, and their overall impact on safety will probably not be  apparent for a number of years. Furthermore, the ability of many of these  efforts to improve safety will depend on voluntary actions by railroads.

FRA\u2019s policy is for inspectors to  encourage railroads to comply voluntarily. When railroads do not comply  voluntarily or identified problems are serious, FRA may cite violations and  take enforcement actions, most frequently civil penalties, to promote  compliance with its regulations.

This approach to oversight enables FRA inspectors and  managers to identify a wide range of safety problems. Inspectors identify  specific compliance problems\u2014conditions that do not meet FRA\u2019s  standards\u2014at sites they visit by citing defects. Inspectors cite violations of  safety standards for those defects that they believe warrant enforcement  action.

Inspectors in some  disciplines cite more defects and violations than others.

It also can help in ensuring that the most  appropriate alternatives to prevent or mitigate the effects of hazards are  designed and implemented. A framework for risk management based on  industry best practices and other criteria that we have developed divides  risk management into five major phases: (1) setting strategic goals and  objectives, and determining constraints; (2) assessing risks; (3) evaluating  alternatives for addressing these risks; (4) selecting the appropriate  alternatives; and (5) implementing the alternatives and monitoring the  progress made and results achieved.", "Other transportation oversight organizations have developed and  implemented approaches for overseeing industries\u2019 overall management of  safety risks.

These approaches complement, rather than  replace, traditional compliance inspections. APTA provides guidelines to  commuter railroads on managing the safety of their systems\u2014including  safety risks\u2014and audits their plans for and implementation of this  management approach. PHMSA requires that pipeline operators develop  \u201cintegrity management\u201d programs to manage risk in areas\u2014such as those  that are densely populated\u2014where leaks or ruptures could have the  greatest impact on public safety and inspects operators\u2019 compliance with  these requirements. In Canada, the department responsible for  overseeing railroad safety, Transport Canada, requires that railroads  establish safety management systems that include risk management and  assesses these systems.
