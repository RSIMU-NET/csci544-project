Twenty-eight percent of these licenses involved dual-use exports to countries of concern such as China, India, and Russia. However, Commerce conducted PVC checks on few of these licenses. We found that, during fiscal years 2000 to 2002, Commerce completed PSV checks on 428, or about 6 percent, of the dual-use licenses it approved for countries of concern. Commerce and other departments attached conditions to nearly all (99 percent) of the licenses for countries of concern to alleviate concerns about potential diversion or misuse. We identified three key weaknesses in the PSV process that reduce the effectiveness of this important activity. First, PSVs do not confirm compliance with license conditions because U.S. officials frequently do not check license conditions, they often lack the technical training to assess compliance, and end users may not be aware of the license conditions by which they are to abide. Second, some countries of concern, most notably China, limit the U.S. government's access to facilities where dual-use items are shipped, making it difficult to conduct a PSV. Third, PSV results have only a limited impact on future licensing decisions. Companies receiving an unfavorable PSV may receive greater scrutiny in future license applications, but they can still receive an export license.

Commerce\u2019s Control List, which is  included in the regulations, specifies the items and technologies to be  controlled. The United States uses export controls to prevent sensitive  items from reaching persons, entities, or countries involved in terrorism or  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the vehicles to deliver  them.", "Commerce seeks to ensure that exports from the United States and  reexports of U.S.-origin items to other countries are consistent with U.S.  national security and foreign policy objectives.  At the same time,  Commerce works to avoid impeding the flow of legitimate trade.  PSV  checks are Commerce\u2019s primary method to detect and prevent illegal  transfer of controlled U.S.-origin goods and technology already shipped  overseas.  Commerce may conduct a PSV check on any controlled item it  licenses that is exported from the United States.  According to Commerce,  PSV checks strengthen assurances that exporters, shippers, importers, and  end users comply with the terms of export license and licensing conditions.", "U.S. exporters submit license applications to Commerce. The applications  include information on (1) the importer who takes delivery of the item, (2)  the end user who will use the item, and (3) the item\u2019s intended use.  The  importer and end user may or may not be the same company. An importer  may use, sell, or distribute the item to other companies for their use.  For  example, a U.S. company could export thermal imaging cameras to an  Indian company.  The Indian company, also known as the importer, might  then sell the cameras to other Indian companies, the end users.", "Several agencies review license applications for the national security,  domestic, or foreign policy implications of exporting dual-use items. After  the U.S. exporter submits a license application to Commerce, an  interagency team comprised of officials from Commerce, Defense, State,  and the Department of Energy determines whether the application should  be approved for a license, denied, or returned without action. If potential  concerns are raised about the end user or the end use, a prelicense check  may be conducted to verify the legitimacy of the importing company that  seeks to purchase U.S. items or technology. If concerns about the end user  or end use persist, conditions may be added to the license application  before approval. Once approved, Commerce issues the license, including  conditions, to the U.S. exporter.", "Commerce conducts PSV checks to confirm that the dual-use item arrived  at its destination and is being used as intended. Commerce special agents  or other U.S. government personnel visit companies overseas to meet with  importers or end users in an attempt to verify the use and location of these  items.  These checks are usually conducted by Commerce special agents,  Commerce export control attach\u00e9 posted at select U.S. embassies  overseas, or by Foreign Commercial Service (FCS) or State officials in  country.  The majority of PSVs are conducted by Commerce\u2019s special  agents; these U.S.-based officials conduct investigations of potential  violations of export controls. Special agents have traditional police powers,  including the authority to make arrests and execute warrants domestically.  Agents may also issue administrative subpoenas and detain and seize goods  to be illegally exported. They cannot, however, conduct investigations  while performing PSVs overseas.", "Commerce guidelines for conducting PSV checks state that an on-site visit  to the company is mandatory.

Conditions are placed on a license  according to the particular item\u2019s intended use and final destination. A  standard condition might state that no wide-area network connectivity is  allowed without specific U.S. government authorization or that military end  users or end uses are prohibited. In addition to the 54 standard conditions,  Commerce sometimes uses customized conditions to restrict specific end  uses and/or end users of an item. For example, a license for semiconductor  manufacturing equipment might contain a condition stipulating the  characteristics, such as the feature size of the integrated circuits, that could  be produced using the equipment.

Because of  this, Commerce developed guidance for selecting the licenses on which to  conduct PSVs. These selection criteria are based on the destination, item,  end use, and parties to the transaction. Commerce primarily targets PSVs  on items it refers to as \u201cchoke-point\u201d technologies.

Commerce targeted the remaining 27 percent on other items  and technologies controlled for export but that are not seen to be as critical  to proliferation activities as are choke-point technologies. Commerce  conducted some of these PSV checks on items exported with no license  required or without an export control classification number.  These checks  allow Commerce to determine if exporters are appropriately classifying  items on export licenses and if the items are being used properly.", "Between fiscal years 2000 and 2002, most PSV checks in countries of  concern that we reviewed were favorable. We examined trip reports and  cables of 428 PSV checks completed during this period in eight countries of  concern, including China, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan, Syria, Russia, and  Ukraine. Eighty-two percent of PSV checks in countries of concern were  rated favorable by the U.S. officials conducting the PSV (see fig. 2).", "According to Commerce\u2019s program guidance, a favorable PSV check  indicates that U.S. officials found (1) no discrepancies between the actual  and stated end use of the item and (2) that the item was at the location  indicated on the license.  An unfavorable PSV result indicates that U.S.  officials found discrepancies between the actual and stated end use. In one  case, special agents conducting a PSV found no business location for the  end user at the address on the license. According to Commerce officials, an  inconclusive check indicates that U.S. officials were unable to complete the  check. For example, the serial number obtained from a manufacturer might  not match the end-user\u2019s item, the agents may have been denied access to a  facility, or the importer might not have responded to the agents\u2019 request to  meet while they were in the country.

In  some instances, officials did not attempt to ask about license conditions.   For example, 36 percent of the companies (9 of 25) we visited or company  representatives we spoke with in China, Hong Kong, India, and Russia  reported that U.S. officials did not ask them about compliance or attempt  to verify compliance with license conditions.", "U.S. officials also frequently do not physically inspect the dual-use item  subject to the PSV because they conduct the PSV at the company that  imported the item rather than the company using the item.

Of the 428 PSV checks  we reviewed, Commerce special agents rated 62 PSV checks favorable,  although the item was not inspected or seen by an agent.  Based on PSV trip  reports, agents may not have seen an item because (1) the item was at a  location other than the one stated on the license, (2) the item had been  integrated into another product or was a consumable item, or (3) the item  was portable. For example, in January 2003, special agents visited a  company in Russia that imported thermal imaging cameras.  The company  purchased the cameras for sales promotion and demonstration purposes  across Russia.  Consequently, during the PSV check, all but one of the  cameras were in the field.  Agents were unable to physically inspect the  cameras or determine if they were being used in compliance with the  license conditions.

To address these objectives, we reviewed laws and regulations governing  export licensing, analyzed export licensing data, and reviewed the activities  and outcomes of the Department of Commerce\u2019s (Commerce) Export  Enforcement Office. We also interviewed Commerce officials in  Washington, D.C.; surveyed Commerce\u2019s special agents who conduct PSV  reviews; met with Commerce enforcement attach\u00e9s in Russia and China;  and observed a Commerce-led team conducting PSV checks in Russia.  In  addition, we met with officials from the Department of State; Department  of Homeland Security; Department of Defense, including the Defense  Technology Security Administration and Defense Intelligence Agency;  Department of Justice; Central Intelligence Agency; National Ground  Intelligence Center; and private firms in Hong Kong, India, and Russia that  were the subject of Commerce\u2019s PSV reviews.  Finally, we interviewed  government officials from China, Hong Kong, and India about their views  on U.S. export controls.", "To assess the number of dual-use export licenses approved and subject to  PSV, we reviewed Commerce documentation on how the licensing process  works and how it determines which items will be subject to PSV checks.  We interviewed knowledgeable Commerce officials about the licensing  process and the role of PSV checks in that process. Additionally, we  obtained statistical data from Commerce, including portions the Export  Control Automated Support System (ECASS), to analyze data on licenses  selected for PSVs. We assessed the reliability of the ECASS data by  performing electronic testing of required data elements and by interviewing  agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the statistical purposes of this report. We  also obtained PSV trip reports and cables for fiscal years 2000 through 2002  for countries of concern where PSVs were conducted.", "To evaluate how the PSV process ensures that sensitive exports are used as  intended, we reviewed Commerce\u2019s Special Agent Manual, guidance on  conducting PSV checks, trip reports, and cables for countries of concern.  We identified key countries of concern by performing a content analysis of  12 lists used by U.S. government agencies to designate countries they  believe may support terrorism or contribute to proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction.  Any country that appeared on 5 or more of the 12 lists  was selected as a country of concern for the purposes of this report. The  resulting list includes Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq,  Israel, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, and Ukraine.", "As part of our audit work, we traveled to Russia and observed a team  conduct a PSV check. We also traveled to China, Hong Kong, and India to  determine the host governments\u2019 requirements for conducting PSV checks  and to conduct follow-up meetings with companies and persons subject to  previous PSV checks.  We surveyed special agents at Commerce field  offices who had participated in PSV trips during 2000, 2001, and 2002, and  from January to April in 2003. We identified 35 active agents who  conducted PSV trips during this time frame, based on reports Commerce  provided to us. We did not survey six agents who had conducted PSVs and  had left the department or had been temporarily reassigned. We developed  and pretested a questionnaire that we administered by e-mail and fax. We  received responses from 26 officers, or 74 percent of the active agents.   Finally, we interviewed Commerce officials and asked Commerce to  provide us with data to determine how the results of PSVs are used in  future licensing and enforcement actions. We initially planned to use the  ECASS data to determine if companies that had received an unfavorable  PSV obtained a subsequent license. Due to limitations in Commerce\u2019s  database, however, this could not be done. We therefore relied on  Commerce officials\u2019 testimony about how unfavorable PSVs are used in the  licensing process.", "We conducted our review from October 2002 through October 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Commerce\u2019s Statutory Framework and Enforcement Activities", "paragraphs": ["Commerce undertakes a number of enforcement activities to deter  violations of export control laws and regulations, including prosecuting  both civil-administrative and criminal cases.  If U.S. exporters or foreign  importers are not following U.S. export law and regulations, they may face  penalties including fines, denial of export privileges, or imprisonment. In  accordance with the governing authority, when Commerce identifies a  potential dual-use violation, it may seek criminal or civil administrative  action, or both, against the U.S. company that exported the product,  employees at the U.S. exporting company, or foreign companies and  persons involved in importing the product.", "When Commerce obtains an unfavorable PSV or other indication that a  dual-use export control violation may have occurred, Commerce may  engage in an investigation. After an investigation, if Commerce determines  the violator acted with full knowledge and willful intent of breaking the  law, Commerce develops a criminal case and seeks an attorney in the  Department of Justice (Justice) to prosecute the violation. If Justice  accepts the case, they assign an assistant U.S. attorney for criminal  prosecution. If the criminal court finds a defendant guilty of dual-use  violations, then sanctions for criminal conduct are imposed; companies  may be fined while individuals may be fined and or imprisoned.  In addition  to or in lieu of criminal penalties, Commerce may pursue civil  administrative action. Civil-administrative penalties are issued directly by  Commerce. Attorneys working at Commerce handle these cases, which are  heard by an administrative law judge. Civil-administrative penalties may be  issued to either an individual or to companies and may include:  Denial of export privileges \u2013 This denies the violator the right to export  or to participate in the export of goods from the United States.", "Civil-administrative fines \u2013 Commerce charges the violator(s) monetary  penalties.", "In addition to civil-administrative penalties, Commerce may use the  following as preventative measures in response to export control law  violations:   Warning letter - A warning letter is an informal notification Commerce  issues to a company or person who may have violated the law. It  describes the alleged violations and possible sanctions, but does not  impose fines or restrictions on export privileges due to a lack of  evidence. Commerce considers any future violations in light of the  warning.", "Placement of an entity or individual on the Watch List \u2013 The Watch List  lists individuals and companies that Commerce has determined warrant  increased scrutiny for export licensing purposes.", "In fiscal year 2001 and 2002, Commerce closed 9 cases yielding criminal  convictions and issued 340 warning letters.

Since August  20, 1994, when the EAA first expired, temporary statutory extensions and  executive orders continued the application of this act.  Most recently, the  application of the act has been extended under an executive order issued  pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).", "While the executive order gives Commerce authority to enforce dual-use  export controls, IEEPA provides for maximum penalties that are  significantly lower than those permitted under the EAA, both for criminal  and civil administrative fines.  For example, criminal penalties for  companies that willfully violate dual-use export control laws under IEEPA  are limited to a $50,000-per-violation fine. Under the EAA, offenders were  subject to a fine of either $1 million per violation or five times the value of  the exports, whichever was greater. A violation is constituted as the  intentional export of a good in violation of export control law.

Commerce states that we overemphasized the use of PSVs as a method  for ensuring license compliance and underestimated their value for  informing future licensing decisions.  We disagree.  Commerce\u2019s June  2000 guidance on how to conduct PSVs states that PSVs are the first  line of defense in preventing illegal technology transfer after dual-use  items have been exported.  We also found that PSVs play a less  important role in future licensing decisions than other sources of  information.  As noted in the report, Commerce officials stated that  industry leads, information from other agencies, self-disclosures, and  visa referrals are more highly valued in licensing decisions than  information gathered during a PSV.   2. Commerce stated that the effectiveness of PSVs cannot be assessed in  isolation from other enforcement and compliance efforts of Commerce.   We agree.  Our report includes discussions of several of these  mechanisms, including prelicense checks (p. 4), screening against its  Watch List (p. 15), and using information on export transactions from  industry and other agencies (p. 16).  We also discuss the deterrent  effect of prosecuting criminal and administrative enforcement cases  (pp. 21-23, app. II).   3. Commerce notes that its new safeguards protocol requires training for  all safeguards trip team members prior to their departure.  However, as  of December 2003, two agents had received this training. 4. Commerce noted that it had undertaken to revise the priority of license  checks in countries of concern, by focusing on Hong Kong, Russia,  India, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates.
