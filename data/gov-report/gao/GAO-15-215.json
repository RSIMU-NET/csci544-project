GAO analyzed RMA crop insurance program data from 1994 through 2013 (the most recent year with complete program data) and premium rate data for 2013 and 2014; reviewed relevant studies, RMA documents, and documents from stakeholders including farm industry groups; and interviewed RMA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The federal government's crop insurance costs are substantially higher in areas with higher crop production risks (e.g., drought risk) than in other areas.

RMA made changes to premium rates from 2013 to 2014, but its plans to phase in changes to premium rates over time could have implications for improving actuarial soundness. USDA is required by statute to limit annual increases in premium rates to 20 percent of what the farmer paid for the same coverage in the previous year. However, GAO found that, for higher risk premium rates that required an increase of at least 20 percent to cover expected losses, RMA did not raise these premium rates as high as the law allows to make the rates more actuarially sound. Without sufficient increases to premium rates, where applicable, RMA may not fully cover expected losses and make the rates more actuarially sound.

The U.S.  Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA)  has overall responsibility for administering the crop insurance program,  including controlling costs. Currently, RMA partners with 19 private  insurance companies that sell and service the insurance policies and  share a percentage of the risk of loss and opportunity for gain associated  with each policy. The federal government pays for (1) part of farmers\u2019  crop insurance premiums, which averaged about 62 percent of total  premiums in 2013, and (2) administrative and operating expenses of  insurance companies to cover their expenses for selling and servicing  crop insurance policies.", "Since 2000, the government\u2019s costs for the federal crop insurance  program have increased substantially.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal crop  insurance costs will average $8.9 billion per year for fiscal years 2015  through 2024. The cost of the federal crop insurance program has come  under scrutiny as the nation\u2019s budgetary pressures have been increasing.  In an October 2013 review of the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal  outlook, we concluded that current fiscal policy is unsustainable over the  long term and that addressing the fiscal challenges of the future will  require looking at the entire range of federal activities and making difficult  choices in setting priorities.", "Budget pressures have been increasing in recent years and, at the same  time, net farm income reached historically high levels.

As a result, according to RMA, it must set premium rates and implement  changes to premium rates in a timely manner to cover expected losses  and allow for a reasonable reserve. Current law also directs RMA to  conduct periodic reviews of premium rates, including the methodology the  agency uses for establishing premium rates. RMA conducted its most  recent study of its methodology for setting premium rates in 2010. Among  other things, the study authors found that RMA\u2019s methodology was  sound, but that the underlying data should be revised. Specifically, they  concluded that the agency should place more weight on loss experience  from more recent years to better account for current risks faced by  farmers. RMA adopted findings from the study, and a revision of its  methodology necessitated a change in premium rates.

Existing law before the 2014 farm bill allowed a  farmer to replace a low actual yield in the APH with a yield equal to 60  percent of the historical county crop yield.

According to a USDA document, this provision  will provide relief to farmers affected by severe weather, including  drought, by allowing them to have a higher approved crop yield.

In  these comments, RMA disagreed with our first recommendation and  agreed with our second recommendation. RMA stated that, consistent  with the second recommendation, it will continue to revise premium rates  in an appropriate, prudent, and actuarially sound manner, taking proper  account of current rates and premium rate targets consistent with  generally accepted actuarial practices.", "In its written comments, RMA disagreed with our first recommendation to  monitor and report on crop insurance costs in areas that have higher crop  production risks and said it currently provides crop insurance data that  have all the information necessary to determine crop insurance costs in  all areas.  RMA\u2019s website provides some information\u2014such as county- level data on premiums, premium subsidies, loss claim payments, and  loss ratios\u2014that enables others to do some analysis of crop insurance  costs. However, that information is not complete for the purpose of  analyzing the government\u2019s costs and is not organized in a way that  facilitates an understanding of the government\u2019s costs in higher risk  areas. For example, regarding data on loss ratios (i.e., loss claim  payments divided by premiums) that is on RMA\u2019s website, a recent article  by an agricultural economist from the University of California notes that  this loss ratio information for crop insurance (1) is not informative about  and misrepresents the actuarial exposure borne by the   program and (2) by excluding administrative expenses, understates the  extent of public expenditure on the program. We agree with this  assessment.  Furthermore, placing data on a website does not constitute  the monitoring of crop insurance costs. We continue to believe RMA can  and should do more to monitor and report on crop insurance costs in  higher risk areas, where we found government costs to be substantially  higher than in other areas. As we said in this report, without additional  information from RMA on the government\u2019s crop insurance costs in higher  risk areas, Congress may not have all the information it needs to make  future assessments of the crop insurance program\u2019s design and costs.", "In addition, RMA commented on our analysis of the government\u2019s cost of  the crop insurance program in higher risk areas. RMA said it has  developed a definition of high-risk land, mapped out these areas, and  applied significant premium surcharges. RMA said our definition of what  we deem to be \u201chigher risk areas\u201d is much broader. RMA defines \u201chigh- risk land\u201d as acreage with identifiable physical limitations, such as  floodplains and high sand content soils. Our identification of higher risk  areas (i.e., the 20 percent of counties that had the highest weighted  average county target premium rates) enabled us to broadly assess crop  insurance costs, and we believe this approach, which we discussed with  RMA officials, was consistent with our purpose.", "In its comment letter, RMA said our use of crop insurance costs (or  benefits to farmers) per dollar of expected crop value \u201cappears to  exaggerate the difference in program costs in higher-risk areas versus  other areas, or at least masks some important details.\u201d To present  another perspective, RMA compared corn premium subsidies per acre for  two states that had a large number of higher risk counties with two states  that had no higher risk counties and stated that the premium subsidies  per acre were similar amounts. We believe our use of a dollar-based  measure (i.e., premium subsidies per dollar of expected crop value) is  more appropriate than a physical measure (i.e., acres) for comparisons  between costs and farmer benefits in higher risk areas and other areas.  This is consistent with the methodology of a 2013 article by agricultural  economists from The Ohio State University and the University of Illinois  that compared net farm insurance payments using a dollar-based  measure.", "Moreover, the use of a dollar-based measure is consistent with property  insurance methods, which are based on the value of the property being  insured. RMA stated that coverage levels were another offsetting effect,  noting that growers in higher risk areas tend to choose lower coverage  levels than in other areas, because higher premium rates make higher  coverage less affordable. RMA appears to be suggesting that our  analysis overlooks this difference, which is not true. As explained in our  report, one of the reasons that we expressed estimated government costs  in relation to expected crop value was to control for variations in farmers\u2019  purchase decisions. Farmers\u2019 decisions in selecting coverage levels vary  between higher risk areas and other areas. According to our analysis, in  2013, farmers in higher risk counties chose to insure, on average, 67  percent of their expected crop value, while farmers in the other counties  chose to insure, on average, 76 percent of their expected crop value.  Thus, we used expected crop value\u2014which is not affected by coverage  levels\u2014rather than insured crop value so that our analysis would not be  distorted by differences in coverage levels.", "RMA agreed with our second recommendation that, as appropriate, RMA  increase its adjustments of premium rates in areas with higher crop  production risks by as much as the full 20 percent annually that is allowed  by law, saying it mirrors how premium rate adjustments are currently  administered. However, RMA stated it disagreed with our assessment of  the extent to which premium rates need to be adjusted to the full amount  allowed by statute and that adjusting premium rates fully to changes in  premium rate targets would undercut the basic purpose of insurance\u2014to  provide financial stability.  We continue to believe RMA\u2019s adjustment of  premium rates should be consistent with insurance principles and the  statutory directive to set premium rates that improve actuarial soundness.  Furthermore, in its discussion of premium rates in \u201chigher-risk\u201d areas,  RMA states that the report makes certain assumptions about premium  rate targets in high risk areas that are not completely accurate and do not  necessarily result in improved actuarial soundness. RMA further states  that following each random variation to its fullest can subject growers to a  roller-coaster ride of ups and downs in their premiums. RMA presented a  simulation of yields and losses, showing that adjusting premium rates by  less than needed to meet the premium rate target leads to a smaller  variation in rates.", "RMA\u2019s simulation suggested that the agency\u2019s current method of  adjusting premium rates will yield an average premium rate that is  actuarially sound at the national level.  We agree that RMA\u2019s average  premium rate, nationwide, may allow the program to be considered  actuarially sound. However, our analysis focused on RMA\u2019s practices in  charging premium rates in areas with higher production risks that may be  lower or higher than the actuarially sound premium rate. In addition,  RMA\u2019s simulation did not account for systematic variation in risk at the  county and crop level. As we concluded, RMA could more quickly achieve  actuarial soundness at the county and crop level. Moreover, as we stated,  charging premium rates that are less than the actuarially sound premium  rates could also have implications for total costs to the federal  government in areas with higher production risks. Thus, we continue to  believe that increasing the adjustments of premiums rates in areas with  higher crop production risk by as much as the full 20 percent annually that  is allowed by law is prudent and in keeping with sound fiscal practices.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We interviewed USDA officials,  including officials from RMA, and reviewed documents they provided,  such as, descriptions of the agency\u2019s methodology for calculating  premium rates.", "We selected 2013 because it was the most recent year for which complete RMA data on  program costs was available at the time we performed this analysis.", "We recognize that an area or location may be high risk for one crop or crop type or  practice type but not for a different crop. However, by using 2013 premium dollars to  weight the average of the different target rates used in a given county, we maintain that  such a calculation allows a reasonable average approximation of a location\u2019s production  risk. practice, and crop-type combinations RMA used for premium calculations  in 2013. Additionally, the use of a weighted-average county target  premium rate allowed us to calculate a single measure for each county by  which we could examine government costs in specific geographic areas.  We then ranked the counties from the highest to lowest weighted average  target rate. We defined those counties ranked in the top 20 percent as  \u201chigher risk counties\u201d and the remaining 80 percent of counties as \u201clower  risk counties.\u201d To calculate total government costs in these higher risk  counties, we analyzed RMA data for 2005 through 2013. We used the  expected crop value to compare the costs in areas with higher production  risks to the costs in other areas. Expected crop value is equal to the  expected crop production multiplied by the expected (or elected) crop  price. However, we did not have information on expected crop prices, so  we calculated expected crop value by dividing the liability dollars by the  coverage rate. Finally, to address the first objective we interviewed RMA  officials, reviewed USDA\u2019s and other studies that examined the costs of  the crop insurance program and the role of premium subsidies, and  consulted documents from other stakeholders, including farm industry  groups.", "To address the second objective, we analyzed RMA data on production- based (or yield) premium rates for the five major crops (corn, cotton, grain  sorghum, soybeans, and wheat) for crop years 2013 and 2014.  Production-based premium rates are RMA\u2019s premium rates for  production-based policies and are used to determine the premium rates  for revenue policies.and crop-type combination, on the county base premium rate and the  county target premium rate. We used the same 2013 data on county  target premium rates to identify higher risk counties in our first objective.  Using the 2013 premium rate data, we ranked the county target premium  rates from highest to lowest and identified the highest 20 percent of  county target premium rates for each crop, practice, and crop-type  combination. For a given crop, a single county may have multiple county  target premium rates, depending on the number of combinations of  practices (e.g., irrigated and nonirrigated) and crop types (e.g., winter  wheat and spring wheat) insured in the county. For example, for wheat, a  county may have county target premium rates for two practice and crop- type combinations\u2014nonirrigated winter wheat and nonirrigated spring  wheat\u2015in which one or both of the premium rates may fall in the highest  20 percent in 2014. For example, for wheat, County A in state B had  county target premium rates for two practice and crop-type  combinations\u2014nonirrigated winter wheat and nonirrigated spring wheat\u2014 that were in the highest 20 percent in 2014. In total, there were 40  combinations or rankings of crops, practices, and crop types. Thus, if a  county target premium rate fell into the top 20 percent in its ranking, that  county target premium rate was placed in the \u201chigher risk premium rate\u201d  category. The remaining 80 percent were placed in the \u201clower risk  premium rate\u201d category. We compared each county base premium rate  with the applicable county target premium rate identified above. In each  instance, we compared the county base premium rate with the county  target premium rate for a single practice, and crop-type combination, and  calculated the percentage difference. We calculated the percentage  difference by subtracting the county base premium rate from the county  target premium rate and dividing the result by the county base premium  rate. If the percentage difference between the county base premium rate  and the county target premium rate was zero, we considered the county  base premium rate as having met the county target premium rate. If the  percentage difference was greater than zero, we placed the county base  premium rate in the \u201clower than\u201d category; and, if the percentage  difference was less than zero, we placed the county base rate in the  \u201chigher than\u201d category. Table 4 provides details on the crop-type and   RMA provided us with data, for each crop, practice,  practice combinations included in this review. Finally, we interviewed  RMA officials in headquarters and two field offices regarding the agency\u2019s  method for setting and implementing changes to county premium rates.  We judgmentally selected the field offices based on the offices having  had experience implementing premium rates in areas with higher  production risks. We also reviewed studies that examined the agency\u2019s  methodology for assigning premium rates and reviewed relevant audits by  USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.", "For the various data used in our analyses, as discussed, we generally  reviewed related documentation, interviewed knowledgeable officials, and  reviewed related internal controls information to evaluate the reliability of  these data. In each case, we concluded that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2013 to February  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
