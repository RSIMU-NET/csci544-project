In 1989, congressional legislation established that Ex-Im Bank should seek to provide at least 5 percent of its energy sector financing for renewable energy projects and should undertake certain efforts to promote renewable energy. The legislation required Ex-Im Bank to report annually to Congress on these efforts. The Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2002 directs Ex-Im Bank to promote the export of goods and services related to renewable energy sources and report the results annually to Congress; however, it does not establish specific targets.

Ex-Im Bank provides medium- and long-term loans and guarantees, export credit insurance, and working capital guarantees. Under the loan and guarantee program, Ex-Im Bank guarantees the repayment of loans or makes loans to foreign purchasers of U.S. goods and services. The export credit insurance program provides protection to U.S. exporters against the risks of nonpayment by foreign buyers for political or commercial reasons. The working capital guarantee program provides U.S. exporters with short-term loans and the necessary working capital to pay for raw materials, labor, and overhead to produce goods or provide services for export.", "Energy transactions represented a major component of transactions financed by Ex-Im Bank during the 1990s. The values financed for energy sector transactions compared to total Ex-Im Bank financing for loans and guarantees averaged around 27 percent during this period and represented as much as 47 percent of all Ex-Im Bank financing in 1995. Ex-Im Bank categorizes energy sector transactions according to the end-use industrial activity. That is, U.S. exports of services and equipment used in energy sector projects are considered energy transactions. Energy sector transactions are divided into subsectors that include fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and renewable energy. Examples of exports financed under fossil fuel projects include engineering services, drilling equipment, and turbines. Examples of renewable energy products or services financed include heat exchangers for geothermal power plants, solar electric modules for solar power generation, and engineering services to design a hydroelectric dam. Ex-Im Bank defines renewable energy to include geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass, wind, and solar activities.

The number of fossil fuel projects financed each year dropped sharply during the early 1990s, but the values financed annually showed significant fluctuations with no clear trend. For renewable energy, there has been a small volume of overall activity during this period, with most of the financing provided primarily in 1994 when two large geothermal power plants were financed.

While identifying the impacts of these factors is complex, macroeconomic factors have been identified as particularly important in the geothermal sector. According to industry representatives and analysts, the Asian financial crisis and subsequent economic and political turmoil in Southeast Asia was a key reason for a decline in construction of geothermal facilities in the region in the late 1990s.", "The relatively small share of most renewable resources in world energy consumption, due partly to cost disadvantages, is viewed as a key factor underlying the demand for Ex-Im Bank financing. According to Department of Energy estimates, in 1999 about 7 percent of world energy consumption was from hydroelectricity and 1 percent from other renewable sources. For energy used for electricity generation, hydroelectricity supplied 19 percent and other renewables 2 percent. A primary reason for this relatively small share of renewables is cost, according to government and industry assessments. While the costs of some renewable energy technologies have decreased, they have generally not been competitive with fossil fuels for most uses, according to these assessments. A related factor is that the feasibility of renewable energy projects often depends on environmental factors such as the location of rivers, geothermal heat sources, and wind supply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Renewable Energy Market Characterized by Diverse Sectors and Financing Needs", "paragraphs": ["The renewable energy market is diverse, with sectors and firms varying in terms of key characteristics that could affect the demand for Ex-Im Bank financing.

World photovoltaic shipments almost tripled between 1994 and 2000, due in part to subsidized programs in Europe and Japan.Similarly, the world wind energy market grew sharply between 1994 and 2001, due in part to government support and growth in Europe. The United States has had some production incentives and tax credits for renewable energy at the state and federal level but their impact has varied depending on amounts and certainty of initiatives. According to the Department of Energy, nonhydroelectric renewable electricity generation in the United States declined between 1993 and 1998.

Many industrialized countries, including the United States, view tied aid as potentially trade-distorting and agreed in 1992 to limits on its use. Renewable energy projects are often exempt from international restrictions due to not being commercially viable. Ex-Im Bank has matched tied aid offers by other countries in some instances. From 1991 to 2001, Ex-Im Bank funded four tied aid projects for renewable energy.According to some renewable energy industry representatives, tied aid has not generally been viewed as a viable export financing option for U.S. renewable energy exporters because of the documentation requirements and the length of the process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental Concerns Regarding Hydroelectric Projects May Have Affected Financing", "paragraphs": ["Increased public concerns about the environmental and social impacts of large hydroelectric dams may have affected financing of hydroelectric projects, according to Ex-Im Bank and industry officials.
