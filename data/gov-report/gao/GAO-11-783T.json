Appraisals provide an opinion of market value at a point in time and reflect prevailing economic and housing market conditions. Data provided to us by the five largest lenders (measured by dollar volume of mortgage originations in 2010) show that, for the first-lien residential mortgages for which data were available, these lenders obtained appraisals for about 90 percent of the mortgages they made in 2009 and 2010, including 98 percent of home purchase mortgages. The data we obtained from lenders include mortgages sold to the enterprises and mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which together accounted for the bulk of the mortgages originated in 2009 and 2010. The enterprises and FHA require appraisals to be performed for a large majority of the mortgages they purchase or insure. For mortgages for which an appraisal was not done, the lenders we spoke with reported that they generally relied on validation of the sales price (or loan amount in the case of a refinance) against a value generated by an automated valuation model (AVM), in accordance with enterprise policies that permit this practice for some mortgages with characteristics associated with a lower default risk. Factors such as the location and complexity of the property affect consumer costs for appraisals. For example, a property may have unique characteristics that are more difficult to value, such as being much larger than nearby properties or being an oceanfront property, which may require the appraiser to take more time to gather and analyze data to produce a credible appraisal. Mortgage industry participants we spoke with told us that the amount a consumer pays for an appraisal is generally not affected by whether the lender engages an appraiser directly or uses an appraisal management company (AMC)--which manages the appraisal process on lenders' behalf--to select an appraiser. They said that AMCs typically charge lenders about the same amount that independent fee appraisers would charge lenders directly, and lenders generally pass on these charges to consumers. In general, lenders, AMC officials, appraisers, and other industry participants noted that consumer costs for appraisals have remained relatively stable in the past several years. However, appraisers have reported receiving lower fees when working with AMCs compared with working directly with lenders because AMCs keep a portion of the total fee. Recently issued policies reinforce long-standing requirements and guidance designed to address conflicts of interest that may arise when direct or indirect personal interests bias appraisers from exercising their independent professional judgment. In order to prevent appraisers from being pressured, the federal banking regulators, the enterprises, FHA, and other agencies have regulations and policies governing the selection of, communications with, and coercion of appraisers. Examples of recently issued policies that address appraiser independence include HVCC, which took effect in May 2009; the enterprises' new appraiser independence requirements that replaced HVCC in October 2010; and revised Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines from the federal banking regulators, which were issued in December 2010. Provisions of these and other policies address (1) prohibitions against loan production staff involvement in appraiser selection and supervision; (2) prohibitions against third parties with an interest in the mortgage transaction, such as real estate agents or mortgage brokers, selecting appraisers; (3) limits on communications with appraisers; and (4) prohibitions against coercive behaviors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on residential real  estate valuations.

Most notably, appraisals and appraisers are subject  to specific requirements and standards. In particular, the Uniform  Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) outlines the steps  appraisers must take in developing appraisals and the information  appraisal reports must contain. USPAP also requires that appraisers  follow standards for ethical conduct and have the competence needed for  a particular assignment. Furthermore, state licensing and certification  requirements for appraisers include minimum education and experience  criteria, and standardized report forms provide a way to report relevant  appraisal information in a consistent format.", "In contrast, other valuation methods, such as broker price opinions (BPO)  and AVMs, are not permitted for most purchase and refinance mortgage  originations. The enterprises do not permit lenders to use BPOs for  mortgage originations and only permit lenders to use AVMs for a modest  percentage of mortgages they purchase. Additionally, the federal banking  regulators\u2019 guidelines state that BPOs and AVMs cannot be used as the  primary basis for determining property values for mortgages originated by  regulated institutions. However, the enterprises and lenders use BPOs  and AVMs in a number of circumstances other than purchase and  refinance mortgage originations because these methods can provide  quicker, less expensive means of valuing properties in active markets.", "When performing appraisals, appraisers can use one or more of three  approaches to value\u2014sales comparison, cost, and income. The sales  comparison approach compares and contrasts the property under  appraisal with recent offerings and sales of similar properties. The cost  approach is based on an estimate of the value of the land plus what it  would cost to replace or reproduce the improvements minus depreciation.  The income approach is an estimate of what a prudent investor would pay  based upon the net income the property produces. USPAP requires  appraisers to consider which approaches to value are applicable and  necessary to perform a credible appraisal and provide an opinion of the  market value of a particular property. Appraisers must then reconcile  values produced by the different approaches they use to reach a value  conclusion.", "The enterprises and FHA require that, at a minimum, appraisers use the  sales comparison approach for all appraisals because it is considered  most applicable for estimating market value in typical mortgage  transactions. Consistent with these policies, our review of valuation data  that we obtained from a mortgage technology company\u2014representing  about 20 percent of mortgage originations in 2010\u2014indicates that  appraisers used the sales comparison approach for nearly all (more than  99 percent) of the mortgages covered by these data. The cost approach,  which was generally used in conjunction with the sales comparison  approach, was used somewhat less often\u2014in approximately two-thirds of  the transactions in 2009 and 2010, according to these data. The income  approach was rarely used. Some mortgage industry stakeholders have  argued that wider use of the cost approach in particular could help  mitigate what they view as a limitation of the sales comparison approach.  They told us that reliance on the sales comparison approach alone can  lead to market values rising to unsustainable levels and that using the  cost approach as a check on the sales comparison approach could help  lenders and appraisers identify when this is happening. For example,  these stakeholders pointed to a growing gap between average market  values and average replacement costs of properties as the housing  bubble developed in the early to mid-2000s. However, other mortgage  industry participants noted that a rigorous application of the cost  approach may not generate values much different from those generated  using the sales comparison approach. They indicated, for example, that  components of the cost approach\u2014such as land value or profit margins of  real estate developers\u2014can grow rapidly in housing markets where sales  prices are increasing. The data we obtained did not allow us to analyze  the differences between the values appraisers generated using the  different approaches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Policy Changes May Affect Consumer Costs for Appraisals, while Other Policy Changes Have Enhanced Disclosures to Consumers", "paragraphs": ["Factors such as the location and complexity of the property affect  consumer costs for appraisals.

The effect of this change on consumer costs may depend  on the approach lenders and AMCs take in order to demonstrate  compliance. For example, some lenders and industry groups are having  fee studies done to determine what constitutes customary and reasonable  fees. According to the Dodd-Frank Act, these studies cannot include the  fees AMCs pay to appraisers. As a result, some industry participants,  including some AMC officials, expect these studies to demonstrate that  appraiser fees should be higher than what AMCs are currently paying. If  that is the case, these lenders would require AMCs to increase the fees  they pay to appraisers to a rate consistent with the findings of those  studies, which in turn could increase appraisal costs for consumers.  However, some lenders are evaluating the possibility of no longer using  AMCs and engaging appraisers directly, which would eliminate the AMC  administration fee from the appraisal fee that consumers pay.", "Other recent policy changes that took effect in 2010 aim to provide  lenders with a greater incentive to estimate costs accurately when  providing consumers with an estimated price for third-party settlement  services, including appraisals. If actual costs exceed estimated costs by  more than 10 percent, the lender is responsible for making up the  difference. The Dodd-Frank Act permits, but does not require, lenders to  separately disclose to consumers the fee paid to the appraiser by an  AMC and the administration fee charged by the AMC. Another policy  change enhances disclosures by requiring lenders to provide consumers  with a copy of the valuation report prior to closing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conflict-of-Interest Policies Have Changed Appraiser Selection Processes, with Implications for Appraisal Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Recently issued policies reinforce long-standing requirements and  guidance designed to address conflicts of interest that may arise when  direct or indirect personal interests bias appraisers from exercising their  independent professional judgment.

Some appraisal industry participants said that HVCC, which required  additional layers of separation between loan production staff and  appraisers for mortgages sold to the enterprises, led some lenders to  outsource appraisal functions to AMCs because they thought using AMCs  would allow them to easily demonstrate compliance with these  requirements. In addition, lenders and other mortgage industry  participants told us that market conditions, including an increase in the  number of mortgages originated during the mid-2000s, and lenders\u2019  geographic expansion over the years, put pressure on lenders\u2019 capacity  to manage appraisers and led to their reliance on AMCs.", "Greater use of AMCs has raised questions about oversight of these firms  and their impact on appraisal quality. Direct federal oversight of AMCs is  limited. Federal banking regulators\u2019 guidelines for lenders\u2019 own appraisal  functions list standards for appraiser selection, appraisal review, and  reviewer qualifications. The guidelines also require lenders to establish  processes to help ensure these standards are met when lenders  outsource appraisal functions to third parties, such as AMCs. Officials  from the federal banking regulators told us they review lenders\u2019 policies  and controls for overseeing AMCs, including the due diligence they  perform when selecting AMCs. However, they told us they generally do  not review an AMC\u2019s operations directly unless they have serious  concerns about the AMC and the lender is unable to address those  concerns. In addition, a number of states began regulating AMCs in 2009,  but the regulatory requirements vary and provide somewhat differing  levels of oversight, according to officials from several state appraiser  regulatory boards.", "Some appraiser groups and other appraisal industry participants have  expressed concern that existing oversight may not provide adequate  assurance that AMCs are complying with industry standards. These  participants suggested that the practices of some AMCs for selecting  appraisers, reviewing appraisal reports, and establishing qualifications for  appraisal reviewers\u2014key areas addressed in federal guidelines for  lenders\u2019 appraisal functions\u2014may have led to a decline in appraisal  quality. For example, appraiser groups said that some AMCs select  appraisers based on who will accept the lowest fee and complete the  appraisal report the fastest rather than on who is the most qualified, has  the appropriate experience, and is familiar with the relevant  neighborhood. AMC officials we spoke with said that they have processes  that address these areas of concern\u2014for example, using an automated  system that identifies the most qualified appraiser based on the  requirements for the assignment, the appraiser\u2019s proximity to the subject  property, and performance metrics such as the timeliness and quality of  the appraiser\u2019s work.", "While the impact of the increased use of AMCs on appraisal quality is  unclear, Congress recognized the importance of additional AMC oversight  in enacting the Dodd-Frank Act by placing the supervision of AMCs with  state appraiser regulatory boards. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the  federal banking regulators, FHFA, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial  Protection to establish minimum standards for states to apply in  registering AMCs, including requirements that appraisals coordinated by  an AMC comply with USPAP and be conducted independently and free  from inappropriate influence and coercion. This rulemaking provides a  potential avenue for reinforcing existing federal requirements for key  functions that may impact appraisal quality, such as selecting appraisers,  reviewing appraisals, and establishing qualifications for appraisal  reviewers. Such reinforcement could help to provide greater assurance to  lenders, the enterprises, and federal agencies of the quality of the  appraisals provided by AMCs.", "To help ensure more consistent and effective oversight of the appraisal  industry, the report we are issuing today recommends that the heads of  the federal banking regulators (FDIC, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and  OCC), FHFA, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection\u2014as part  of their joint rulemaking required under the Dodd-Frank Act\u2014consider  including criteria for the selection of appraisers for appraisal orders,  review of completed appraisals, and qualifications for appraisal reviewers  when developing minimum standards for state registration of AMCs.
