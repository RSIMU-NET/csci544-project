GAO was asked to review the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) efforts to help ensure pipeline security. This report addresses the extent to which TSA's Pipeline Security Division (PSD) has (1) assessed risk and prioritized efforts to help strengthen pipeline security, (2) implemented agency guidance and requirements of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Commission Act) regarding pipeline security, and (3) measured its performance in strengthening pipeline security. GAO reviewed PSD's risk assessment process and performance measures and observed 14 PSD reviews and inspections scheduled during the period of GAO's review. Although these observations are not generalizable, they provided GAO an understanding of how PSD conducts reviews and inspections."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["PSD identified the 100 most critical pipeline systems and developed a pipeline risk assessment model based on threat, vulnerability, and consequence, but could improve the model's consequence component and better prioritize its efforts. The consequence component takes into account the economic impact of a possible pipeline attack, but not other possible impacts such as public health and safety, as called for in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) risk management guidance. PSD plans to improve its model by adding more vulnerability and consequence data, but has no time frames for doing so. Establishing a plan with time frames, as called for by standard management practices, could help PSD enhance the data in, and use of, its risk assessment model. Also, PSD procedures call for scheduling Corporate Security Reviews (CSR)--assessments of pipeline operators' security planning--based primarilyon a pipeline system's risk, but GAO's analysis of CSR data suggests a system's risk was not the primary consideration. Documenting a methodology for scheduling CSRs that includes how to balance risk with other factors could help PSD ensure it prioritizes its oversight of systems at the highest risk. PSD has taken actions to implement agency guidance that outlines voluntary actions for pipeline operators and 9/11 Commission Act requirements for pipeline security, but lacks a system for following up on its security recommendations to pipeline operators. PSD established CSR and Critical Facility Inspection (CFI) Programs in 2003 and 2008, respectively, and has completed CSRs of the 100 most at-risk systems, started conducting second CSRs, and completed 224 of 373 one-time CFIs. Both programs result in recommendations, but PSD does not generally send CSR recommendations to operators in writing or follow up to ensure that CSR and CFI recommendations were implemented. Standard project management practices call for plans that define approaches and start dates and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for monitoring to ensure review findings are resolved. Developing a plan for how and when PSD will begin transmitting CSR recommendations to operators, and following up on CSR and CFI recommendations could better inform PSD of the state of pipeline security and whether operators have addressed vulnerabilities. PSD has taken steps to gauge its progress in strengthening pipeline security, but its ability to measure improvements is limited. In its pipeline security strategy, PSD does not include performance measures or link them to objectives, which GAO previously identified as desirable in security strategies. In addition, PSD developed performance measures, including one outcome measure to gauge its efforts to help operators reduce vulnerabilities identified in CSRs. However, the outcome measure does not link to all three of PSD's objectives and provides limited information on improvements in areas such as physical security. According to DHS risk management guidance, outcome measures should link to objectives. Including measures linked to objectives in its strategy and developing more outcome measures directly linked to all of its objectives could help PSD improve accountability and assess improvements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that TSA, among other things, establish time frames for improving risk model data, document its method for scheduling reviews, develop a plan for transmitting recommendations to operators, follow up on its recommendations, include performance measures linked to objectives in its pipeline strategy, and develop more outcome measures. DHS concurred with the recommendations and discussed planned actions, but not all will fully address the recommendations, as discussed in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. citizens and businesses depend on the continued operation of vast  networks of pipelines that traverse hundreds of thousands of miles to  transport energy for operating air and surface vehicles, running industrial  equipment, heating homes, and generating electricity. The United States  has the largest network of energy pipelines of any nation in the world.  These pipelines transport nearly all the natural gas and about two-thirds of  the hazardous liquids, including crude and refined petroleum products,  consumed in the United States, making them a potential target to those  wanting to disrupt commerce and other activities. Although attacks on  U.S. pipelines have been rare\u2014carried out, for example, by individuals  with unclear motives\u2014attacks on pipelines outside the United States by  groups such as militant rebels highlight potential vulnerabilities of  pipelines. For example, in Colombia, rebels attacked a major pipeline  using explosives more than 600 times from 1996 through 2005, and in  Nigeria, militant rebels have repeatedly attacked pipelines and oil  facilities. Within the United States, a terrorist plot to attack jet fuel  pipelines and storage tanks at JFK International Airport was uncovered  and foiled in 2007. The same year, a U.S. citizen was convicted of  attempting to provide material support to terrorists, among other things,  after he tried to conspire with Al-Qaeda to blow up sections of the Trans  Alaska Pipeline System and sections of the Transcontinental Pipeline  System, which carries natural gas from the Gulf Coast to New York City.  Such events raise concerns that attacks could occur in the United States.", "Securing the nation\u2019s pipeline system is a responsibility shared by the  federal government and the private sector. Prior to the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001, the federal government\u2019s involvement in pipelines  largely focused on safety, and security efforts were minimal. In November  2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act established the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the Department of  Transportation (DOT) and gave TSA the lead responsibility for security in  all modes of transportation, including pipeline. In November 2002, the  Homeland Security Act was enacted, and upon the creation of the  Department of Homeland Security, TSA was transferred from DOT to DHS,  where it currently resides. In August 2007, the federal government  enacted the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act  of 2007, which required the Secretary of Homeland Security, in  consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, to take specific pipeline  security actions. Within DHS, TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Division (PSD)  leads pipeline security activities. TSA has not issued pipeline security  regulations, but works with the pipeline industry to implement suggested  security measures to make pipeline systems more secure. Private  companies who own and operate pipeline systems are responsible for  assessing their own specific security needs and incur the costs associated  with implementing security measures.", "Since it is not feasible to protect all assets and systems against every  possible threat, DHS has called for using a risk management approach to  prioritize its investments, develop plans, and allocate resources in a risk- informed way that balances security and commerce. DHS detailed this  approach in its National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which it  issued in June 2006 and updated in 2009.", "You requested that we review TSA\u2019s efforts to help ensure pipeline  security. Specifically, this report addresses the following objectives:    To what extent has TSA\u2019s Pipeline Security Division (PSD) identified  critical pipeline systems, assessed risk, and prioritized efforts,  consistent with the NIPP, to help strengthen the security of hazardous  liquid and natural gas pipeline systems?", "To what extent has PSD taken actions to implement agency guidance  and requirements of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11  Commission Act of 2007 regarding the security of hazardous liquid and  natural gas pipeline systems?", "To what extent has PSD measured its performance to help strengthen  the security of hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline systems and  improvements in pipeline security?", "To determine the extent to which PSD used a risk management process to  help strengthen the security of pipelines, we reviewed PSD\u2019s efforts to  identify critical pipeline systems, assess risk, and prioritize its pipeline  review efforts. We reviewed relevant documents, including PSD\u2019s list of  the 100 most critical pipeline systems, and interviewed PSD officials about  the methods they used to identify these systems. We reviewed TSA  assessments of threat, vulnerability, and consequence from 2003 through  May 2010\u2014such as TSA\u2019s annual pipeline threat assessment, Corporate  Security Reviews (CSR) that PSD uses as a vulnerability assessment, and  consequence assessments on natural gas disruptions sponsored by the  Department of Energy (DOE) and PSD\u2014and discussed these with relevant  agency officials. TSA characterized these as threat, vulnerability, and  consequence assessments, but we did not assess the extent to which these  assessment activities met the NIPP criteria for such assessments, as this  was outside the scope of our work. We analyzed PSD\u2019s risk assessment  model, which integrates the various assessments to develop a risk  estimate and relative risk ranking for each pipeline system, and the data  PSD inputs into the model. We also compared the time elapsed between  PSD\u2019s first and subsequent CSRs for each pipeline system with the  system\u2019s ranking based on risk to measure the strength of their  relationship. Additionally, we compared the order in which PSD  conducted the first Critical Facility Inspection (CFI) for each system with  each system\u2019s risk ranking, and measured the strength of that  relationship. To assess the reliability of April 2003 through May 2010 risk  assessment model data, we (1) performed testing of required data  elements, (2) compared the data with other sources of information, and  (3) interviewed knowledgeable agency officials. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We analyzed  agency guidance on risk management, including the NIPP and the  Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan, to determine criteria for  effectively implementing a risk management framework and associated  best practices for conducting risk assessments, and compared these with  PSD\u2019s risk management strategy. We also compared PSD\u2019s approach for  advancing its risk management program to standard practices in program  management planning.", "To determine the extent to which PSD has taken actions to implement  agency guidance and Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11  Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Commission Act) requirements regarding  pipeline security, we reviewed the Pipeline Security Information Circular  (2002 circular) and the 9/11 Commission Act and actions described in  agency documents. To learn more about PSD\u2019s actions, we interviewed  officials from PSD and DOT as well as representatives of the major  associations with ties to the pipeline industry (American Petroleum  Institute, Association of Oil Pipe Lines, American Gas Association,  Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, and American Public Gas  Association); attended the 2008 International Pipeline Security Forum  organized by PSD and Natural Resources Canada; and met with security  personnel from 10 pipeline operators with headquarters or significant  operations in Houston. We chose Houston because it has the highest  concentration of operators with systems on PSD\u2019s list of the 100 most  critical pipeline systems, and those with whom we met operate about one- third of those systems. While the results of these interviews cannot be  generalized to all pipeline operators and industry associations, they  provided perspectives on how operators view PSD\u2019s security efforts.  Further, we accompanied PSD officials on 4 reviews of pipeline systems  operated by 4 different operators and 10 inspections of critical facilities  operated by 3 different operators. We observed these reviews and  inspections because PSD had scheduled them while we were conducting  our work. These involved hazardous liquid and natural gas pipelines as  well as different size operators with pipeline systems that varied in the  amount of energy they carry, their relative risk ranking, and their location  (we observed CSRs in four states and CFIs in three states). While the  results of these observations cannot be generalized to all CSRs and CFIs or  all pipeline systems and critical facilities, they provided us with an  understanding of how PSD conducts these reviews and inspections, and  some perspective on the security posture at different critical facilities. We  also interviewed representatives of Secure Solutions International\u2014a  security and risk management consulting firm that assisted PSD in  developing and carrying out CFIs\u2014about critical facilities and the  inspection process. In addition, we independently observed the exterior of  10 other critical facilities. We selected these facilities, which were located  in four states and operated by 6 different operators, because of their  proximity to our offices. Although the results of these observations cannot  be generalized to all critical facilities, they provided us insight on security  measures at additional critical facilities. We compared PSD\u2019s processes for  transmitting and following up on CSR and CFI recommendations with  criteria in GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  regarding recording and communicating deficiencies found during  evaluations. We also compared PSD\u2019s approach for advancing its process  for communicating CSR recommendations to standard practices in project  management.", "To determine the extent to which PSD measured its performance in  strengthening the security of pipelines and improvements in pipeline  security, we reviewed PSD\u2019s performance measures and interviewed  Office of Transportation Sector Network Management and PSD officials  regarding those measures, and discussed PSD\u2019s related data collection  methodologies with PSD officials. We analyzed TSA\u2019s national security  strategy for pipeline systems\u2014the Pipeline Modal Annex\u2014to determine  the extent to which it conformed to provisions related to goal setting and  performance measurement found in Executive Order 13416: Strengthening  Surface Transportation Security, the NIPP, the Transportation Systems  Sector-Specific Plan, and guidance on desirable characteristics for a  national strategy that we developed in a previous report. We also  reviewed the NIPP and the 2007 Transportation Systems Sector-Specific  Plan to determine the risk management framework\u2019s recommended  approach to performance measurement and compared TSA\u2019s actions with  that guidance. In addition, we analyzed data PSD used as an outcome  measure to determine the extent of improvements in pipeline security and  evaluated both the reliability of the data and its sufficiency as a measure of  pipeline security outcomes. As part of this analysis, we compared two  successive data collection instruments\u2014the original instrument PSD  developed in 2003 and used in conducting early CSRs with the one TSA  developed in 2004, which PSD subsequently used. Later in this report we  discuss concerns about the reliability of some of these data.

PSD relied on each pipeline system\u2019s energy throughput to  identify the most critical systems from more than 3,000 systems in the  United States. It has since been focusing its risk management efforts on  these 100 most critical systems, which, according to PSD officials, move 85  percent of all energy within the United States.", "Once critical systems have been identified, the NIPP calls for agencies to  assess risk as a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence, and to  integrate these individual assessments into a model to produce a risk  estimate. It further requires that the consequence component of a risk  assessment take into account the impact that an event or incident would  have on the economy and public health and safety, among other things.  PSD was the first of TSA\u2019s surface transportation modes to develop a risk  assessment model that combines all three components of risk\u2014threat,  vulnerability, and consequence\u2014to generate a risk score. PSD\u2019s pipeline  risk assessment model generates a risk score for each of the 100 most  critical systems and ranks them according to risk. PSD holds the threat  score constant for all pipeline systems and uses the results of its  Corporate Security Reviews (CSR) in its vulnerability component.  However, its consequence component is incomplete in that it accounts for  economic impact, but not the impact on public health and safety. The  following provides more information on the assessments or information  for the threat, vulnerability, and consequence data that PSD uses in its risk  assessment model.", "Threat: In the case of terrorist attacks, the NIPP calls for the threat  component of the assessment to be calculated based on the likelihood  of the intent and capability of a terrorist attack on a particular asset,  system, or network. However, if threat likelihoods cannot be estimated,  an agency can use conditional risk values based on vulnerability and  consequence. TSA\u2019s Office of Intelligence develops Pipeline Threat  Assessments and, according to officials from that office, the approach  they use to assess threat is consistent across transportation modes.  They further explained that because they have no actionable  intelligence for specific pipeline systems, they can not develop  likelihood estimates. As such, PSD holds threat constant in its model  and bases each pipeline system\u2019s risk score on vulnerability and  consequence. Office of Intelligence officials explained that if they were  to receive intelligence regarding a credible threat to a specific pipeline  system, they would work with PSD officials to adjust the threat level  for that system in PSD\u2019s risk assessment model.", "Vulnerability: According to the NIPP, agencies are responsible for  ensuring that vulnerability assessments are performed within their  sector in order to identify areas of weakness within a system under  review. PSD uses the results of the CSRs it conducts on each of the  most critical pipeline systems as the basis for the vulnerability  component in its risk assessment model. PSD uses a CSR protocol (i.e.,  a questionnaire that guides the CSR interview) to collect information  on an operator\u2019s security planning and management practices for a  given pipeline system, and calculates a CSR score by tallying points  associated with responses to each of 73 standard questions in the  protocol. Using the CSR score, PSD determines a pipeline system\u2019s  vulnerability by calculating the difference or \u201cgap\u201d between a total  possible score of 100 and an operator\u2019s CSR score. PSD uses this gap,  known as the \u201cvulnerability gap,\u201d as the basis for the vulnerability  component in its risk assessment model. Using CSRs as vulnerability  assessments is consistent with the approach taken by other surface  transportation modes, such as freight rail and highway infrastructure,  on which we have previously reported.", "Consequence: According to the NIPP, consequence assessments  should measure key effects on the well being of the nation. This  includes the negative consequences on the economy, public health and  safety, and the environment, as well as the functioning of government  that can be expected if an asset, system, or network is damaged,  destroyed, or disrupted by a terrorist attack. Within its risk assessment  model, PSD uses the annual energy throughput of a pipeline system to  help measure the possible adverse economic impact of a terrorist  attack or other event on a pipeline system, but does not take into  account other possible adverse impacts, such as on public health and  safety. According to PSD officials, because the major consequence of  an attack on a pipeline would be the loss of energy, annual energy  throughput provides a good measure of this expected loss. However,  the consequences of some potential attacks might not be limited to the  economy. For example, under some circumstances, an attack on a  critical pipeline facility located near a waterway has the potential to  significantly contaminate drinking water or, if located in a highly  populated area, could result in significant casualties.", "PSD officials explained that the pipeline risk assessment model is in the  early stages of development and they intend to improve it over time by  incorporating additional data. PSD has sponsored or conducted  assessments and collected information on pipeline systems, some of which  could be used to enhance individual components of its model. For  example, through its Critical Facility Inspection (CFI) Program, PSD has  collected information on critical facilities, such as the number of facilities  per system, and officials say they plan to eventually use these data in their  risk estimates. PSD officials explained that the number of critical facilities  can be an indicator of a system\u2019s vulnerability\u2014that is, the more critical  facilities a system has, the more vulnerable the system. Thus,  incorporating this information into the vulnerability component of PSD\u2019s  risk assessment model and including it in the risk estimate could enhance  the model. In addition, including information that might be available from  other sources, such as the number of miles of pipeline that run through a  high-consequence, or highly populated, area could also enhance the  consequence component of the model. PSD officials noted that such data  could be a good measure of the effects on public health and safety.  However, the officials explained that with a small staff, they have not had  time to make any specific enhancements to the model.", "PSD officials also agreed that adding other information that could be  available in the future might further improve its model. For example, PSD  and DOE sponsored regional gas pipeline studies that include information  that could be used to improve the consequence component of the model.  These studies use computer-based modeling to evaluate the impact of a  major natural gas pipeline disruption. PSD officials told us they would like  to incorporate such information into the consequence component of its  risk model, but adding such information for natural gas pipelines without  adding comparable information for hazardous liquid pipelines would skew  its risk ranking of the most critical pipeline systems. PSD officials told us  in May 2010 that they had secured funds to contract for a similar  assessment of the hazardous liquid pipeline market and expect the work to  begin later in fiscal year 2010. They also said they plan to use the results of  their CFIs to enhance the vulnerability components of the risk model;  however, they will need to wait until they complete inspections of all  critical facilities associated with the 100 most critical pipeline systems.  The officials told us they expect to complete these inspections by the end  of 2011.", "Although PSD officials said they would like to add more information to  their pipeline risk assessment model and have included placeholders in  the model for incorporating other vulnerability and consequence factors  when additional information is known, they have not established time  frames or milestones (i.e., a schedule of actions needed to achieve goals)  for doing this. Standard practices for program management call for  establishing time frames and milestones as part of a plan to ensure that  results are achieved. Developing a plan that includes time frames and  milestones could help PSD accomplish its goal of improving the data in its  risk assessment model. By including additional information in its risk  model\u2014some that exists and some that should be available in the future\u2014 PSD could improve its risk assessment of the most critical pipeline  systems and better assure it has the information it needs to guide  decisions, including allocating resources to the highest risk pipeline  systems.

This suggests that a system\u2019s risk ranking was not the  primary consideration in scheduling these reviews. For the pipeline  systems included in PSD\u2019s risk assessment model dated May 2010, PSD  had conducted 54 initial CSRs of pipeline operators who operate the 100  most critical systems, and 27 second CSRs of those operating 65 of the  most critical pipeline systems. Figure 4 illustrates the weak correlation  we found between risk ranking and time between reviews for the 27  operators with which PSD conducted a second CSR, as denoted by data  points that are not clustered near or on the line of best fit. If a stronger  correlation existed between these variables, the data points would be  clustered closer to the line of best fit.", "According to CSR procedures, using a pipeline system\u2019s risk ranking when  scheduling CSRs allows PSD to consider the importance of the system to  the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure and the likelihood that the  system could be attacked. Similarly, according to the NIPP, the highest  priority in risk management efforts should be accorded to those systems  with the highest expected losses. In addition, the 9/11 Commission Act  requires that risk assessment methodologies be used to prioritize risk and  to target inspection actions to the highest risk pipeline assets. According  to PSD officials, a pipeline system\u2019s relative risk ranking is the primary  factor driving their decision of when to schedule a subsequent CSR,  however, other factors, such as geographic proximity, also affect the  decision. For example, in some cases PSD officials schedule a CSR for a  lower risk-ranked system that might be located in the same geographic  area as a higher risk-ranked system to be efficient and reduce travel time  and costs.", "We also found considerable variation in the time elapsed before PSD  returned to conduct a second CSR. For example, our analysis of the data  in PSD\u2019s risk assessment model showed:    Within the 15 highest risk-ranked pipeline systems, the time between  the first and second CSR ranged from 1 to 7 years.", "For all pipeline systems, the average time elapsed between a first and  second CSR was 4.8 years, regardless of the system\u2019s risk ranking.", "For 5 systems that rank in the top 15 in terms of risk, approximately 6  years elapsed between a first and second CSR\u2014more than the average  time for all systems.", "PSD officials stated that although the time elapsed between a first and  second CSR might be longer than average for some of the highest risk  pipelines, this does not mean that PSD has not been focusing its attention  on these operators. For example, in one of these cases, the officials  explained they spent 6 weeks in 2009 inspecting dozens of critical facilities  belonging to this operator through the CFI program, met with the  company president to discuss the need for security improvements, and  had other contacts with the operator. However, even after accounting for  PSD inspecting one or more of an operator\u2019s critical facilities before  conducting a second CSR, we still found a weak relationship between a  pipeline system\u2019s risk ranking and the time elapsed between that system\u2019s  first and subsequent CSR.", "The NIPP calls for systems that are considered to have the highest  expected losses if damaged, disrupted, or destroyed, to receive more  scrutiny. Furthermore, PSD\u2019s CSR procedures state that the CSR program  should consider a pipeline system\u2019s risk level as one of the most crucial  factors when scheduling CSRs and PSD officials told us they consider a  system\u2019s risk to be the primary factor in these decisions. However, PSD  has not clearly stated in its CSR procedures that risk should be the  primary criteria in scheduling CSRs, nor has it documented a methodology  addressing how it is to balance other practical considerations, such as  travel efficiencies, with its consideration of risk. Doing so could help PSD  ensure it prioritizes its oversight of pipeline systems that are most at risk.", "Similarly, PSD has no documented procedures or methodology for using a  system\u2019s risk ranking when scheduling CFIs. According to PSD officials,  when they began the CFI program in November 2008, their primary  consideration in scheduling CFIs was to do so in a manner that would  allow them to complete a large number of inspections as soon as possible.  For example, if 10 critical facilities were located close enough to each  other to complete all 10 in 1 week, PSD would schedule those inspections  and leave the inspections of more geographically dispersed critical  facilities for a later time. The officials further explained that because  inspecting outdoor space is critical to a CFI, they also consider weather  when scheduling inspections (i.e., scheduling cold weather locations in  warmer months). However, the NIPP calls for according the highest  priority in risk management efforts to those systems with the highest  expected losses. Furthermore, the 9/11 Commission Act requires that risk  assessment methodologies be used to prioritize risk and to target  inspections to the highest risk pipeline assets. Documenting a  methodology for scheduling CFIs and including a pipeline system\u2019s risk  ranking as the primary criteria while recognizing other considerations that  can affect scheduling could help PSD ensure it prioritizes its oversight of  pipeline systems that are most at risk.", "We identified almost no statistical correlation between the order in which  PSD conducted critical facility inspections and the risk ranking of the  pipeline system containing those facilities. For example, PSD did not  inspect any of the critical facilities of three of the highest risk-ranked  systems until early 2010, although it had conducted CFIs of some of the  lowest risk-ranked systems in the previous year.

In  carrying out its CFI program, PSD has invested resources in hiring a  contractor, conducting inspections, making recommendations, and  developing a database. However, PSD officials agreed that without  including its CFI recommendations in that database and following up on  their implementation, they cannot analyze the recommendations they have  made and have limited information on whether pipeline operators are  addressing security vulnerabilities identified at each critical facility.

For its output measures, PSD tracks  the number of CSRs it conducts, with a milestone, or interim goal, of 12  CSRs each year; and the number of CFI trips it completes, with a milestone of 15 trips each  year.", "According to PSD officials, they track CSR and CFI program progress  against these two performance milestones, and provide this information to  TSNM to consider in developing the transportation sector annual report.", "In addition, PSD officials told us that they collect performance output data  on other activities and have established the following annual milestones:  ten stakeholder conference calls,   an International Pipeline Security Forum,    quarterly meetings with DOT (per PHMSA\u2019s and TSA\u2019s annex to the  MOU between DHS and DOT), and two pipeline Intermodal Security Training Exercise Program  exercises.", "In 2009, PSD developed an outcome measure\u2014the vulnerability gap\u2014that  uses CSR program data to help evaluate the impact of its efforts to  improve pipeline security.

The NIPP further states that the key to NIPP performance  management is aligning outcome performance measures to goals and  objectives.", "According to the Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan, outcome  measures should be used to assess program goals and objectives; however,  output measures may be used as proxies for outcome measures in the  early stages of its programs. In addition, we have reported on the  limitations of output-based measures in our prior work. Specifically, we  have stated that using output measures to evaluate security program  performance may not systematically target areas of higher risk and may  not result in the most effective use of resources because these measures  are not pointed toward outcomes, or what activities are accomplishing.", "PSD\u2019s outcome measure\u2014the vulnerability gap\u2014measures aspects of two  of its pipeline security objectives; however, PSD has not developed  outcome measures that enable it to fully assess improvements related to  pipeline security as a whole. The vulnerability gap focuses on what PSD  measures through its CSR program\u2014primarily improvements in pipeline  operators\u2019 security planning and preparedness\u2014but provides limited  information on improvements in other areas, such as physical security.  According to the Pipeline Modal Annex, the CSR program evaluates  aspects of two of the pipeline security objectives\u2014(1) to reduce risk and  (2) to increase information sharing and response planning and  coordination. By extension, the vulnerability gap measures these as well.  For example, the vulnerability gap takes into account operators\u2019 risk  reduction activities such as how they assess threats and vulnerabilities. It  also measures increased information sharing, such as how operators  manage threat information.", "However, according to the Pipeline Modal Annex, the CSR program does  not evaluate the third pipeline security objective\u2014to increase the level of  resiliency and robustness of pipeline systems\u2014and, thus, the vulnerability  gap does not measure this objective. As a result, PSD is limited in its  ability to measure or report on improvements in this latter area of pipeline  security. Furthermore, according to PSD officials, collecting CSR  information every 4 to 5 years limits their ability to measure the security  improvements that operators are making. Nevertheless, they said the  changes they have observed from operators\u2019 first to second CSRs provide  them with a strong level of confidence that improvements have occurred.", "PSD officials explained that they are in the early stages of performance  measurement and have not yet developed additional outcome measures or  established time frames for doing so. We recognize challenges PSD might  face in developing outcome measures related to reducing risk. In our prior  work we acknowledged that assessing the deterrent benefits of a program  is inherently challenging because it is often difficult to isolate the impact  of an individual program on behavior that may be affected by multiple  other factors. In the case of pipeline security, it may be difficult to isolate  the impact of PSD\u2019s programs on operators\u2019 security actions. Nevertheless,  outcome-based data could better inform decision makers of the extent to  which programs and activities have been able to reduce risk and better  enable them to determine funding priorities within and across agencies.

When PSD officials began conducting CSRs in 2003, they developed a CSR  protocol to collect information on pipeline systems\u2019 corporate security  planning and preparedness. However, according to PSD officials, they  began using a different protocol in August 2004 that TSA developed for all  surface transportation modes to use during their respective CSRs to  ensure consistency among modes. Many questions in the second protocol  differed from those in the first, although the topic areas were similar.", "Although changes in the CSR protocol provide PSD with more information  on some topics, differences between the two protocols limited PSD\u2019s  ability to use CSR program data collected with the first protocol. PSD  officials explained they, therefore, sought to develop comparable CSR data  for all operators, regardless of which protocol PSD used during CSRs. To  accomplish this, PSD officials instructed staff to reconstruct a new  protocol (using the second CSR protocol) for each pipeline operator PSD  reviewed from mid-April 2003 through mid-July 2004\u2014the 15-month  period during which the first protocol was used. Staff were to do this  using available information from the first completed protocol, any notes  PSD officials took during the CSR, and security plans or other documents  PSD gathered during the CSR. However, PSD officials said they did not  provide written instructions to staff or verify that staff accurately  reconstructed the data. Although the officials expressed confidence in  their staff\u2019s work, we could not be assured that the CSR information staff  reconstructed was accurate and reliable.", "We analyzed the content, or substance, of the questions in both the first  and second protocols and identified concerns about whether operator  information could have been transferred reliably from the first to the  second protocol after the fact. We found that 41 of the 73 newer CSR  protocol questions were either consistent with the content of the first  protocol or could have been consistently verified using the security plan  operators provided during the original CSR. We therefore found it  reasonable that PSD staff would have been able to accurately transfer the  completed information from the first protocol to the second protocol for  these 41 questions. However, we could not be reasonably assured that PSD  staff accurately transferred information for the remaining 32 questions  onto the second protocol because the content of these questions was  inconsistent and, thus, PSD staff may not have been able to reliably  reconstruct the data using the security plans operators provided during  the original CSRs. For example, the second protocol contained the  following questions directed to operators, but we found no similar  questions on the first protocol:    Do you have a 24/7 emergency response/operations center?", "Do you conduct different levels of background checks based on type of  employment (e.g., executive, operational, police)?", "Do you periodically conduct exercises and drills?", "For these questions, and 29 others like them, PSD staff may have been able  to locate the information they needed in notes and documents to  reconstruct the second protocol, but we had no assurance that this was  possible or done in an accurate and reliable manner. We have previously  reported that performance measures should reliably assess progress such  that the same results would be achieved if applied repeatedly to the same  situation. Furthermore, errors in data accuracy could alter conclusions  about the extent to which performance goals have been achieved, such as  reporting performance at either a higher or lower level than is actually  being attained.", "We have also reported that decision makers must have assurance that the  program data being used to measure performance are sufficiently accurate  and reliable if the data are to inform decision-making. Thus, the  usefulness of agency performance information depends to a large degree  on the reliability and accuracy of performance data. Because of the  changes in the CSR protocol questions and concerns about the reliability  of reconstructed operator responses transferred to a different form, the  baseline data PSD used in comparing operators\u2019 first and second CSR  scores and resulting reports may not be accurate. As such, PSD\u2019s outcome  performance measure\u2014the differences in vulnerability gaps as calculated  using CSR scores\u2014suggests a level of precision that may not be  supported. PSD officials said they did not see this as a significant  problem because not all the baseline CSRs involved reconstructed data  and, as they continue to conduct CSRs, they will eventually be able to  compare the results of operators\u2019 second to third CSRs in reporting  improvements. Furthermore, although PSD\u2019s CSR data may be useful for  some analytical purposes, such as analyzing industry trends and assessing  individual operators\u2019 security planning and preparedness, some of the  early data are not useful for reporting the extent to which the vulnerability  gap has closed.

The importance of pipeline systems  to the nation\u2019s economy underscores the need for PSD to employ a risk  management approach to prioritize its security efforts. PSD has taken  actions to implement a risk management approach, including identifying  the 100 pipeline systems it considers most critical and being the first of the  surface transportation modes to develop a risk assessment model.  Nevertheless, work remains to ensure that the highest risk pipeline  systems are given the necessary scrutiny. PSD\u2019s risk assessment model is  in its early stages of development; however, information is available or  expected that could enhance the vulnerability and consequence  components of the model. By developing a plan that includes time frames  and milestones for adding information to its risk assessment model, PSD  could be better assured of reaching its goal to improve the model. This  could help PSD more accurately rank pipeline systems according to risk  and help guide resource allocation decisions. In addition, documenting a  methodology for scheduling CSRs and CFIs that includes a pipeline  system\u2019s risk ranking as the primary criteria, while recognizing other  considerations that can affect scheduling, could help PSD ensure it  prioritizes its oversight of pipeline systems that are most at risk.", "PSD has taken actions to encourage private pipeline operators to employ  security measures that will protect their pipeline systems, including  critical facilities.

As such, an  important aspect of the CSR and CFI programs is the specific  recommendations PSD makes and tailors to each operator to address the  vulnerabilities PSD has identified. However, PSD is missing opportunities  with respect to these recommendations. PSD officials agreed that  routinely transmitting CSR recommendations in writing to operators could  better ensure that operators are clear on the actions they can take to  enhance the security of their pipeline system or systems, and they have  said they intend to do this. Developing a plan that includes a defined  approach and time frames for how and when PSD intends to begin  transmitting CSR recommendations in writing to pipeline operators could  help PSD accomplish its intended goal.", "In addition, by establishing databases of the CSR and CFI  recommendations it makes, PSD could more readily and systematically  analyze its recommendations and be better informed of security  vulnerabilities in the pipeline industry. Furthermore, because CSRs take  place infrequently and CFIs are not repeated, following up on the  implementation of CSR and CFI recommendations is particularly  important. By doing so, PSD could enhance its knowledge of the state of  security of the pipeline industry as well as individual systems and  facilities, have an additional means for measuring the effectiveness of its  programs, and obtain information that could help inform its decision on  whether it would be appropriate to issue pipeline security regulations.", "The 2007 Pipeline Modal Annex represents a positive step toward  conveying TSA\u2019s strategy for helping the pipeline industry secure the  nation\u2019s pipelines. However, incorporating PSD\u2019s performance measures  and milestones and linking them to the goals and objectives in its national  security strategy for pipeline systems could aid PSD and the pipeline  industry in achieving results within specific time frames and could  facilitate more effective oversight and accountability. PSD has developed  some output-based performance measures and milestones to track the  progress of its programs and activities and has developed an outcome  measure to evaluate the impact of some of its efforts to improve pipeline  security. However, PSD\u2019s dependence on a single outcome measure  hinders its ability to evaluate the extent of improvements related to all of  its pipeline security objectives. Developing additional outcome measures  aligned with its objectives could facilitate PSD\u2019s efforts to better evaluate  its performance.", "Moreover, PSD has collected data on the security posture of pipeline  operators through its CSR program and compared vulnerability gap data  over time to measure the progress operators have made. PSD\u2019s CSR data  may be useful to PSD for various analytical purposes. However, because of  reliability issues affecting the baseline data PSD uses for calculating its  vulnerability gap outcome measure, PSD would be better informed if,  going forward, it establishes reliable baseline data for measuring and  reporting improvements in pipeline security. Although this would limit  PSD\u2019s ability to report on improvements in operators\u2019 security efforts from  the first 15 months of the CSR program, it could provide greater assurance  that, in the future, PSD is more accurately and reliably measuring those  pipeline security improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve aspects of the Pipeline Security Division\u2019s (PSD) efforts to  help ensure pipeline security, we recommend that the Assistant Secretary  for the Transportation Security Administration take the following eight  actions.", "To ensure that PSD is managing risk effectively,    Develop a plan with time frames and milestones for improving the data  in the pipeline risk assessment model by, for example, adding more  data to the consequence component.", "Document a methodology for scheduling Corporate Security Reviews  (CSR) and Critical Facility Inspections (CFI) that considers a pipeline  system\u2019s risk ranking as the primary scheduling criteria and balances it  with other practical considerations.", "To help PSD maximize its CSR and CFI efforts and keep its knowledge of  the security posture of the pipeline industry current,    Develop a plan that includes a defined approach and time frame for  how and when PSD intends to begin transmitting CSR  recommendations in writing to pipeline operators.", "Establish a database of CSR recommendations and develop a process  for following up on the implementation of those recommendations.", "Establish a database of CFI recommendations and develop a process  for following up on the implementation of those recommendations.", "To better achieve the security strategy laid out in the Pipeline Modal  Annex\u2014the national security strategy for pipeline systems\u2014to the extent  feasible, revise future updates of the annex to incorporate performance  measures for assessing PSD and pipeline industry progress and link those  measures to pipeline security objectives.", "To better evaluate PSD\u2019s performance in helping strengthen the security of  hazardous liquid and natural gas pipelines and improvements in pipeline  security, develop additional outcome measures that are directly linked to  sector goals and modal objectives and track progress towards its stated  pipeline security objectives.", "To help ensure reliable reporting of security improvements in the pipeline  industry, establish reliable baseline data and, until that time, refrain from  using reconstructed baseline data to report progress in closing the  vulnerability gap."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of our report to DHS on July 2, 2010, for review and  comment.

Developing a  database will partially address this recommendation. However, while we  support a plan that includes PSD following up on prior CSR  recommendations during subsequent CSRs, this, alone, will not fully  address the intent of our recommendation.

Specifically, the regression equation compared the time elapsed between  the first and second CSR against system risk rank and a dummy variable to  denote if PSD inspected at least one critical facility belonging to an  operator between the first and second CSR. This regression equation  explained about 21 percent of the total variation in elapsed time between  the first and second CSR. To determine the extent to which PSD  prioritized the CFIs it conducted, we performed a correlation analysis to  measure the strength and direction of the relationship between a system\u2019s  risk ranking and the order in which PSD conducted a first CFI for that  system compared with other systems.

We observed these reviews and inspections  because PSD had scheduled them while we were conducting our work.  These involved hazardous liquid and natural gas pipelines as well as  different size operators with pipeline systems that varied in the amount of  energy they carry, their relative risk ranking, and their location (we  observed CSRs in four states and CFIs in three states). These observations  further included one cross-border pipeline system and one port facility  regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act. While the  results of these observations cannot be generalized to all CSRs and CFIs or  all pipeline systems and critical facilities, they provided us with an  understanding of how PSD conducts these reviews and inspections, and  some perspective on the security posture at different critical facilities.

As part of this analysis, we compared two successive  data collection instruments\u2014the original CSR protocol that PSD  developed and used in conducting CSRs from April 2003 to July 2004 and a  newer protocol that PSD officials said they began using in August 2004,  after TSA developed a protocol to be used by all the transportation modes.", "More specifically, to analyze and categorize specific differences between  the two protocols, two analysts compared the first and second protocols  to determine the extent to which content from the 73 questions in the  newer protocol corresponded with content in the original protocol. To  ensure the validity and reliability of our analysis, the two analysts  discussed and reconciled any differences. With the assistance of a  methodologist, the analysts mutually agreed on how to categorize their  assessment of the newer protocol questions. They agreed on the following  two categories to describe whether the information could have been  reliably transferred from one protocol to the other:    We were reasonably assured that PSD staff would have been able to  accurately transfer completed information from the first protocol to  the second.", "We could not be reasonably assured that PSD staff would have been  able to accurately transfer completed information from the first  protocol to the second.", "Because we could not be reasonably assured of the accuracy of the  transferred data, we concluded that some of the baseline data key to PSD\u2019s  outcome measure may not be reliable, as called for in our prior work that  describes nine key attributes of successful performance measures.  Furthermore, we determined that these data were not sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2008 to August 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Edward J.
