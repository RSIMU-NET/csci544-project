IMBRA mandated that GAO study the act's impact on the visa process for noncitizen spouses and fiance(e)s. This report addresses the extent to which the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); the Department of State (DOS); and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have implemented IMBRA, and the extent to which USCIS and DOS have collected and maintained data for this GAO report as required by IMBRA. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the act and related legislation, analyzed IMBRA implementation guidance and available data on applications filed, and interviewed officials at USCIS, DOS, and DOJ."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USCIS, DOS, and DOJ have implemented two of seven key IMBRA requirements identified by GAO, but five key provisions intended to provide beneficiaries with information about the petitioners seeking to bring them to the United States have yet to be completed. First, although IMBRA requires DOS to mail a copy of the approved petition to each beneficiary, the agency is not currently fulfilling this requirement. Second, IMBRA limits the number of petitions a person may file for a noncitizen fiance(e) unless USCIS grants a waiver of the filing limits. However, USCIS officials told GAO that they do not check all petitioners against records to determine if a petitioner has previously filed a fiance(e) petition. USCIS adjudicators are required to check the record if the petitioner self-attests that he or she has previously filed a petition. By limiting its checks to those petitioners who acknowledge prior filings, USCIS increases the risk that it will approve more fiance(e) petitions than allowed under IMBRA. Third, IMBRA mandates that after two approved petitions, upon filing of a third petition within 10 years of the first, USCIS is to notify both the petitioner and beneficiary of previously approved petitions filed by the petitioner. USCIS officials told GAO that they no longer try to notify beneficiaries because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate overseas mailing addresses. Thus, beneficiaries are left without all required information for making a decision about the person petitioning on his or her behalf. USCIS officials told GAO that they plan to ask DOS to notify beneficiaries during their visa interview with a DOS consular officer. Fourth, the requirement to provide beneficiaries with a pamphlet that discusses the visa application process and available resources if the beneficiary encounters domestic violence or abuse is not being met. USCIS has drafted the pamphlet, but has not established time frames for finalizing the pamphlet. Until the pamphlet is finalized, translated, and distributed, USCIS increases the risk that beneficiaries are not being made aware of their rights or the resources that are available should they encounter domestic violence. Lastly, IMBRA establishes federal criminal and civil penalties for IMBs who violate its provisions. Although DOJ has drafted IMBRA-related regulations regarding how civil penalties would be administered, these regulations cannot be finalized until DOJ, USCIS, and DOS decide which agencies will be responsible for investigating, referring, and prosecuting potential IMBRA violations. Until the agencies resolve these issues and establish an enforcement framework, it will be difficult for IMBRA violators to be penalized. USCIS is collecting and maintaining some of the data for this report as required by IMBRA; however, most of the data are not in a summary or reportable form and other required data have not been collected. For example, GAO could not determine the extent to which petitioners with a criminal history or history of violence have filed petitions because USCIS does not capture this data electronically. USCIS officials told GAO that they are considering modifying their data management system to collect data that is currently not being collected. However, no decisions have been made."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows U.S. citizens  (petitioners) to petition for noncitizen fianc\u00e9(e)s, spouses, and minor  children (beneficiaries) to immigrate to the United States. Some  petitioners have criminal histories that could put these beneficiaries at risk  of abuse, such as sexual assault. The International Marriage Broker  Regulation Act of 2005 (IMBRA) was enacted to address issues of  domestic violence and abuse against beneficiaries by petitioners, including  those who met their foreign-born spouses through an international  marriage broker (IMB). Among other things, IMBRA contains  requirements that are intended to ensure that a beneficiary is informed in  the event that his or her petitioner has a criminal history or a history of  filing multiple petitions for fianc\u00e9(e)s to immigrate into the United States.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) within the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Bureau of Consular Affairs within  the Department of State (DOS) play key roles in the disclosure of a U.S.  citizen\u2019s criminal background information, including sex crimes, to  beneficiaries protected by IMBRA. For the purposes of making this  disclosure, USCIS must obtain and furnish the petitioner\u2019s criminal  background information, along with the approved petition, to DOS, which  is to forward these materials to the beneficiary by mail. DOS, which is  responsible for reviewing beneficiary visa applications for approved  petitions for the purpose of issuing a visa, must also disclose the  petitioner\u2019s criminal background information to the beneficiary during the  consular interview. While DOS is responsible for disclosing criminal  background information to the beneficiary, IMBRA requires USCIS to  inform beneficiaries if a U.S. citizen who has been approved twice before  files another fianc\u00e9(e) or spouse petition within 10 years of the first filing.", "IMBRA also establishes disclosure and other requirements for IMBs to  help inform and provide greater assurance for the safety of noncitizen  fianc\u00e9(e)s who meet their U.S. citizen fianc\u00e9(e)s through an IMB. IMBs  who violate IMBRA\u2019s provisions are subject to federal criminal and civil  penalties. IMBRA makes the Department of Justice (DOJ) responsible for  the imposition of civil penalties after notice and an opportunity for a  hearing.", "Section 833(f) of IMBRA mandated that GAO study the impact of IMBRA  on the visa process for noncitizen fianc\u00e9(e)s, including reporting specific  data USCIS and DOS were to collect and maintain for GAO to do its study.  Other information IMBRA required GAO to report, such as the number of  international marriage brokers doing business in the United States and the  extent of brokers\u2019 compliance with IMBRA, was not available, and  therefore we are not able to report such information. In accordance with  the congressional mandate and as discussed with the offices of the  Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate and House Judiciary  Committees, this report addresses the following questions:    To what extent have USCIS, DOS, and DOJ implemented the  requirements of IMBRA?", "To what extent have USCIS and DOS collected and maintained data for  GAO reporting as required by IMBRA?"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which USCIS, DOS, and DOJ implemented the  requirements of IMBRA, we reviewed the Act, its legislative history,  relevant provisions of the INA, and related legislation, the Adam Walsh  Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 which contains provisions that  may affect a petitioner\u2019s ability to have beneficiaries immigrate. For  purposes of this review, we summarized and grouped IMBRA\u2019s  requirements into seven key areas and identified the actions taken and the  actions remaining in each of the key areas. To determine what actions had  and had not been taken, we obtained and analyzed pertinent  documentation, such as USCIS\u2019s and DOS\u2019s IMBRA implementation  guidance for its adjudicators and consular officers, respectively. We also  interviewed cognizant officials at USCIS headquarters and at its California  and Vermont Service Centers\u2014the two service centers responsible for  processing petitions for alien fianc\u00e9(e)s; at DOS, and at DOJ. We  interviewed three DOS Consular Affairs Unit Chiefs by telephone and  received written responses to our questions from four other Unit Chiefs all  of whom were responsible for processing immigrant visa applications,  including fianc\u00e9(e) visas. These Unit Chiefs were at seven consular posts  located in Bangkok, Thailand; Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Ciudad Juarez, Mexico;  Guangzhou, China; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Manila, Philippines; and  Moscow, Russia. We chose these posts because they issued about two- thirds of alien fianc\u00e9(e) visas in fiscal year 2007. While information we  obtained at these locations may not be generalized across all consular  posts, because we selected the posts based on the volume of activity, we  believe the posts provided us with a general overview and perspective on  the implementation of IMBRA at the selected posts.", "To determine whether USCIS and DOS have collected and maintained data  for our report as required by IMBRA, we obtained and analyzed available  data for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 on fianc\u00e9(e) petitions filed from  USCIS\u2019s application management system, and on visas issued to fianc\u00e9(e)s  from DOS\u2019s visa database. To determine the reliability of data in USCIS\u2019s  and DOS\u2019s database, we observed how petitioner data are entered into  USCIS\u2019s data system, reviewed pertinent USCIS and DOS documents, and  interviewed relevant USCIS and DOS officials. We determined that the  data we used from USCIS and DOS databases were sufficiently reliable for  purposes of this report. In addition, we interviewed cognizant officials at  DHS/USCIS in headquarters, Washington, D.C.; at the California and  Vermont Service Centers, and at DOS. We conducted this performance  audit from October 2007 to August 2008, in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

Only U.S. citizens can request or  petition for noncitizen fianc\u00e9(e)s to immigrate to the United States. To do  so, citizens must file a form I-129F, Petition for Alien Fianc\u00e9(e), with  USCIS to enable their fianc\u00e9(e) to come to the United States as a K-1  nonimmigrant and then apply for permanent residence. U.S. citizens who  have already married noncitizens living abroad may also file Form I-129F  to enable their spouse to come to the United States on a K-3 nonimmigrant  visa and then apply for permanent residency. The purpose of the form I- 129F is to establish the relationship of the petitioner to the beneficiary  who wishes to immigrate to the United States. For K-1 fianc\u00e9(e) petitions,  the petitioner must establish that the petitioner and fianc\u00e9(e) are free to  marry and that they have previously met in person within 2 years of filing  the petition. For K-3 spouse petitions, the petitioner must establish the  bona fide marital relationship to the beneficiary.", "Two USCIS Service Centers, one in California and another in Vermont,  process all I-129F petitions. As part of its I-129F petition review, USCIS  obtains criminal history information for specified crimes from the  petitioner and conducts background checks on both the beneficiary and  petitioner. If the petitioner has ever been convicted of any of the  specified crimes, the petitioner is to provide to USCIS certified copies of  court and police records showing the charges and dispositions for every  such conviction. USCIS conducts name-based background security  checks\u2014checks of a petitioner\u2019s name and date of birth\u2014-against the  Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS). According to USCIS, IBIS  queries include a check of five National Crime Information Center  (NCIC) data files, which include the Convicted Sexual Offender Registry;  the Foreign Fugitive; Immigration Violator; Violent Gang and Terrorist  Organization; and Wanted Persons files. During a background security  check, if an IBIS query returns a \u201chit\u201d where the name and date of birth  information entered returns a response from one or more of the databases  and it appears the petitioner may have a criminal background, USCIS  adjudicators forward this information to the Background Check Unit  located within the Service Center. This unit conducts further system  searches for verification of the criminal histories. After researching and  summarizing the criminal information on the petitioner, if there is no  national security or criminality issue requiring further investigation, unit  staff notate their findings in a memorandum, which they send back to the  adjudicator responsible for the file.", "While IMBRA requires USCIS to collect petitioner criminal history  information, we reported in 2006 that USCIS does not have general  authority to deny a family-based petition solely on grounds that the  petitioner has a criminal sexual history. Since we issued our report,  Congress enacted legislation limiting a petitioner\u2019s ability to immigrate  relatives, including fianc\u00e9(e)s. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and  Safety Act of 2006 prohibits DHS from approving any family-based  petition, including a fianc\u00e9(e) petition, for any petitioner convicted of a  specified offense against a minor unless the DHS Secretary, in his sole and  unreviewable discretion, determines that the petitioner poses no risk to  the beneficiary.", "DOS is responsible for processing all approved visa petitions received  from USCIS and for determining whether to issue a visa to beneficiaries  who are overseas, such as fianc\u00e9(e)s and K-3 spouses.

USCIS officials from both the California and Vermont Service Centers told  us that criminal background information is being forwarded to DOS for  disclosure to the beneficiary and as discussed later in this report DOS  consular officers are receiving this information. DOS also issued IMBRA  implementation guidance to its consular officers. DOS\u2019s guidance states  that consular officers are to disclose criminal history information to  beneficiaries on two separate occasions: (1) when the visa application  instructions are mailed to the beneficiary and (2) during the consular  interview (which we will discuss later in this report). Although DOS\u2019s  guidance does provide for the mailing of criminal history information to  beneficiaries, the guidance does not specifically require DOS to mail  beneficiaries a copy of the approved I-129F petitions, as required by  IMBRA. The I-129F petitions require petitioners to disclose additional  information beyond criminal background information, such as their  marital status and the number of prior I-129F petitions filed, approved or  denied. Thus, not mailing the petitions themselves could prevent  beneficiaries from obtaining relevant non-criminal information about their  petitioners that could affect their immigration decision.

According to USCIS, checking every name against  CLAIMS would require a significant amount of review and research to try  and determine if the petitioner is a match to any of those already in  CLAIMS. However, USCIS officials did acknowledge that a more refined  search using the petitioner\u2019s name and another piece of identifying  information, such as the petitioner\u2019s date of birth, could reduce the  multiple hits and therefore reduce the number of petitioners who would  require additional research.", "As shown in Table 1, USCIS adjudicators are to routinely check CLAIMS if  the petitioner self-attests that he or she has previously filed a petition.  Nevertheless, relying on petitioners\u2019 self-attestation to identify previous  filers may not always provide accurate results, regardless of whether  petitioners must certify the truthfulness of their form I-129F attestations  under penalty of perjury. For example, in March 2006, we reported that  evidence suggested that immigration benefit fraud was an ongoing and  serious problem, although the full extent was not known. As a result, by  limiting USCIS checks to those petitioners that acknowledge prior filings,  USCIS increases its risk that it will approve more fianc\u00e9(e) petitions than  allowed under IMBRA, including petitions filed by persons with a record  of violent criminal offenses, who are not entitled to a waiver of IMBRA\u2019s  filing limits except in extraordinary circumstances. USCIS\u2019s reliance on  self-attestation also increases the risk that USCIS will not have accurate  multiple filer information to disclose to prospective beneficiaries.

At  the time of our review, DOS officials said they had not held a discussion  with USCIS about providing such notification. According to USCIS  officials, USCIS has drafted a memo to its adjudicators addressing the  planned notification process.

An official from  the remaining post told us that consular officers at her post had not been  disclosing a petitioner\u2019s criminal history to beneficiaries, but based upon  our inquiry, she now planned to have consular officers begin disclosing  criminal history information to beneficiaries. At the time of our interviews  with consular officials during February 2008, DOS had not yet issued  formal guidance to its consular posts regarding implementation of IMBRA.  In March 2008, DOS issued guidance to its posts on implementation of  IMBRA including the need to disclose petitioner criminal conviction  information for certain offenses and information related to any protection  orders related to the petitioner.

If so, DOS is to obtain the IMB\u2019s name from the  beneficiary and confirm whether the IMB gave the beneficiary all the  information required by IMBRA, such as the petitioner\u2019s marital, criminal,  and protection order history. Officials from four of the seven consular  posts we contacted told us that their officers had not been inquiring about  whether services of an IMB were used. Officials from two posts told us  their consular staff asked questions about how the petitioner and  beneficiary met, but not specifically whether the services of an IMB were  used. An official from one post stated that the post\u2019s consular staff asked  questions about how the petitioner and beneficiary met as well as whether  or not the services of an IMB were used.

For example, officials from one consular post that processed over  11,000 K-1 and K-3 visa applications in 2007, told us that the post  encounters about 20 applications per year (about 0.2 percent) where the  petitioner had a criminal history involving violent IMBRA-specified  offenses. Officials from two of the seven offices told us that they could not  recall any fianc\u00e9(e) visa applicants that acknowledged using an IMB.

On July 22, the Federal Register notice  and pamphlet were published and USCIS intends to utilize the 60-day  public comment period to provide the public, including any interested  nongovernmental organizations, an opportunity to comment on the draft  pamphlet before USCIS finalizes the pamphlet for distribution and  publication. USCIS officials told us they did not know when the pamphlet  would be finalized, nor did they have a specific time frame for finalizing  the pamphlet. Figure 2 below shows a timeline which illustrates key steps  in the development of the information pamphlet.", "Since USCIS has not finalized the information pamphlet, DOS has been  unable to translate it.

The Chief Administrative Hearing Officer within EOIR had  drafted IMBRA-related regulations regarding how civil penalties would be  administered, but these regulations cannot be finalized until the agencies  decide who will be responsible for investigating, referring, and ultimately  prosecuting potential violations at a hearing before DOJ\u2019s Chief  Administrative Hearing Officer.

Although IMBRA mandated that USCIS  and DOS collect and maintain the data necessary for us to conduct such a  study, the data we are requested to report on are essentially petition- driven data for which USCIS would have responsibility to collect and  maintain. While USCIS has collected some data necessary for this study,  most of the data IMBRA calls for us to report are not available in a  summary or reportable format. For example, USCIS provided us with data  on the number of fianc\u00e9(e) petitions filed in the past three fiscal years.  However, data on which petitioners had criminal convictions or a history  of violence were not available in a summary or reportable format.

In fiscal year 2007, of the approximately 62,500 petitions  filed, 309 (less than 1 percent) petitioners applied for a waiver of the filing  limitations through the service centers. USCIS service centers approved  308 waiver applications and denied one; however, the reasons for the  approval and denial decisions are unknown since USCIS does not  currently maintain such data. In fiscal year 2007, the California Service  Center reported 1,529 petitions filed by people who had previously filed.  During that same period, USCIS service centers reported 176 petitions  filed by concurrent filers.", "USCIS officials told us that for the data elements currently not available in  summary or reportable format they are actively seeking to modify the  CLAIMS application management system to capture this data.

USCIS officials told us that they were in the process of  developing a business case to modify CLAIMS for USCIS senior  management review. If USCIS senior management approves the business  case, then the changes to CLAIMS would be made.

DOS\u2019s current procedures do not provide for mailing the  approved I-129F petitions to beneficiaries. During the course of this  review, DOS informed us that it will revise its guidance to require the I- 129F petition to be mailed to beneficiaries when it mails the visa  instruction packet. USCIS\u2019s current procedures do not ensure that all  petitioners are within IMBRA\u2019s multiple filing limitations because USCIS  does not check all petitioners for prior filings. Beneficiaries are not being  notified of the number of previously approved petitions filed by their  petitioner as required by IMBRA. Without developing a mechanism to  check all petitioners for prior filings nor a mechanism for sharing  information with beneficiaries about the number of previously approved  petitions filed by their petitioner, beneficiaries may not have all the  information they need to make an informed decision about whether to  immigrate to the United States.
