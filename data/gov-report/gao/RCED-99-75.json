According to the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA), the industry had total assets worth about $700 billion in 1993 and has revenues of about $200 billion annually.", "Nuclear power plants have provided about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity in recent years. Most nuclear power plants are owned and operated by investor-owned utilities. Investor-owned utilities comprise only about 8 percent of the nation\u2019s 3,200 electric utilities but generate and sell over 75 percent of the electricity. One such utility\u2014the Commonwealth Edison Company\u2014received the former Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s first license to operate a civilian nuclear power plant almost 40 years ago. Since then, the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor regulatory agency\u2014the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)\u2014have issued operating licenses for a total of 125 plants. Twenty-one of the plants licensed to operate have been permanently retired, leaving 104 with operating licenses.", "The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, require NRC to, among other things, protect the radiological health and safety of the public. Under this mandate, NRC licenses nuclear power plants to operate for up to 40 years and continually regulates the utility-licensees\u2019 operation of these plants. In addition, NRC permits utilities to seek license extensions of up to 20 years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulatory Challenges to Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants", "paragraphs": ["Decommissioning a nuclear power plant involves dismantling the structures and equipment at the plant, properly disposing of the resulting radioactive and other wastes, and then ensuring that the plant site complies with applicable environmental standards. Decommissioning involves a combination of technical, financial, and regulatory challenges. For example, the nuclear reactor vessel, other plant components, and concrete surfaces of various rooms in the plant are radioactive or contaminated with radioactive material. Therefore, the processes of maintaining the plant in a safe condition prior to dismantling it and disposing of the resulting radioactive wastes requires constant attention to protecting workers and the public from exposure to radiation.", "The interval of time between the initial operation of a plant and its eventual dismantling also presents challenges to licensees and NRC. This interval can be as short as a few years if a plant is retired earlier than expected and dismantled shortly thereafter or as long as 40 to 60 years if a plant operates for an extended license period. In lieu of dismantling a plant immediately after its retirement, a utility may instead elect to decommission a plant by placing the plant in safe storage before dismantling it, as long as the entire decommissioning process is completed within 60 years. This feature of NRC\u2019s regulation allows utilities to defer dismantling a retired plant if they (1) are awaiting the retirement of a colocated plant, (2) need to give DOE time to remove all of the spent (used) fuel from the plant, and (3) need to allow the radioactivity in the plant to decay before dismantling the plant, among other things.", "Finally, the financial aspects of decommissioning also present challenges to utility-licensees. For example, although actual decommissioning experience is limited, decommissioning a single plant is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. NRC does not have the authority to regulate the manner in which licensees recover from their customers the costs of constructing, operating, and decommissioning nuclear power plants. Most licensees are investor-owned utilities that traditionally have been provided a monopoly within their service areas. In return, these utilities built generating plants, including nuclear, coal, gas, and hydro power plants, and transmission and distribution facilities to provide electricity for all of the existing and future customers within their service areas. Under this traditional \u201ccost-of-service\u201d regulation, state public utility commissions approved electricity rates that reflected the utilities\u2019 costs of building and operating their electricity systems and approved the financial returns on these investments. Similarly, the interstate aspects of the electric utility industry, including financial transactions, wholesale rates, and interconnection and transmission arrangements, are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In this context, utilities\u2019 proposed arrangements to finance the decommissioning of their nuclear plants are a part of their financial operations that are subject to review and approval by their respective state public utility commissions and FERC.", "NRC\u2019s authority to require utilities to accumulate funds to decommission their nuclear power plants is derived from its responsibilities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to regulate the safety of nuclear power. Until 1988, NRC required licensees to certify that sufficient financial resources would be available when needed to decommission their nuclear power plants but did not require these licensees to make specific financial provisions for decommissioning. On July 26, 1988, NRC\u2019s original regulations on the technical and financial aspects of decommissioning became effective. By then, NRC had licensed 114 plants to operate.", "NRC\u2019s 1988 regulations provided utilities with the following options for providing decomissioning financial assurance:", "The prepayment of cash or liquid assets into an account segregated from the licensee\u2019s assets and outside the licensee\u2019s administrative control. Prepayment may be made in the form of a trust, escrow account, government fund, certificate of deposit, or deposit of government securities.", "External sinking funds. These types of funds are established and maintained through the periodic setting aside of funds in an account segregated from the licensee\u2019s assets and outside the licensee\u2019s administrative control. An external sinking fund may be in the same forms permitted for prepayment.", "A surety method or insurance. A surety method may be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or line of credit payable to a trust established for decommissioning costs.", "For \u201cfederal licensees,\u201d such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, a statement of intent that decommissioning funds will be obtained when necessary.", "NRC recognized both the uncertainty over decommissioning costs and the authority of public utility commissions and FERC to regulate the economic affairs of utilities. Therefore, NRC approached the regulation of the financial aspects of decommissioning by requiring utilities to provide \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that sufficient funds would be available to decommission their nuclear power plants when the plants are permanently shut down. Among other things, NRC required, by July 27, 1990, each holder of an operating license to (1) certify that the licensee would provide the required financial assurance for decommissioning; (2) calculate, using a formula contained in NRC\u2019s regulations, the minimum amount (expressed in current-year dollars) that utilities would accumulate for decommissioning their plants by the time they expect to retire them; and (3) provide a copy of the financial instrument(s) executed to provide the required financial assurance. Essentially all utilities have elected the option of establishing external sinking funds to finance future decommissioning costs. A portion of the charge that utilities\u2019 customers pay for their electricity is earmarked for deposit in these funds, and the funds are invested to earn income.", "In its regulations, NRC deferred to utilities and their rate regulators the details of collecting the required decommissioning funds. NRC requires only that the amount actually accumulated by the end of a plant\u2019s operating life equals the projected cost to decommission the plant. About 5 years before the projected end of plant operations, NRC requires a utility to submit a preliminary decommissioning cost estimate that includes an up-to-date assessment of the major factors that could affect the cost to decommission its plant. Also, if necessary, the cost estimate shall include plans for adjusting needed funds for decommissioning to demonstrate that a reasonable level of assurance will be provided so that funds will be available when needed to cover the cost of decommissioning. Finally, not later than 2 years after a plant has been permanently shut down, the utility must submit to NRC a decommissioning report that includes, among other things, a site-specific decommissioning cost estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deregulation of the Electricity Industry", "paragraphs": ["After about 10 years of experience with NRC\u2019s 1988 decommissioning regulations, the electricity industry has begun to change in ways that have prompted NRC to reassess the adequacy of its regulations governing nuclear power plants, including financial assurances for decommissioning retired plants. Over the next 10 years or so, many states are expected to replace their traditional systems of economic regulation of monopolistic electric utilities with more-competitive, less-regulated environments mainly for the generation of electricity but, to a lesser degree, for the transmission and distribution of electricity as well. Competition, according to NRC, could result in economic pressures that will affect the availability of adequate funds for decommissioning and how utilities address maintenance and safety in nuclear power plant operations.", "Currently, the Congress is considering a number of bills to restructure the retail electricity industry to promote a more efficient and market-driven industry. Also, as of September 1997, 49 states had considered reforming their retail electricity markets. As of June 1, 1998, FERC and at least 18 states had either enacted legislation or issued comprehensive regulatory orders implementing plans to restructure the industry. In California, for example, a plan to produce competitive electricity markets and allow consumers to choose their electricity supplier went into effect in March 1998. Also, some of these initiatives would encourage or require the restructuring of the affected electricity industry. Specifically, utilities that have traditionally generated, transmitted, and distributed electricity would be encouraged or required to separate the operation of electricity generation systems from the operation of transmission and distribution systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about the potential costs to decommission nuclear plants and the implications of a competitive electricity environment on the ability of plant owners to finance decommissioning projects, the congressional requesters of this report asked us to determine if (1) there is adequate assurance that NRC\u2019s licensees are accumulating enough funds to decommission their nuclear power plants when the plants are retired and (2) NRC is adequately addressing the effects of electricity deregulation on the funds that will eventually be needed for decommissioning.", "To address both of our objectives we met with, and obtained documentation from, officials of the following organizations:", "NRC, Rockville, Maryland.", "Nuclear Energy Institute, Washington, D.C.

We also analyzed whether licensees or their parent companies have (1) accumulated decommissioning funds at a rate consistent with the percentages of their reactors\u2019 operating life already used up (i.e., the fund for each reactor should equal this percentage times the present value of its future decommissioning cost) and are (2) currently (viz., 1997) adding enough money to their decommissioning funds (i.e., assuming that contributions in future years will increase at the funds\u2019 after-tax rate of return) to accumulate sufficient funds to decommission their plants when they are retired. The scope and methodology that we used in these two analyses are discussed in appendix I. To address whether NRC is adequately considering the effects of electricity deregulation on the funds that will eventually be needed for decommissioning, we also obtained and reviewed public comments on NRC\u2019s advance notice of proposed rulemaking for decommissioning financial assurances and on the subsequent proposed rule.", "We conducted our review from October 1997 through March 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NRC\u2019s System Did Not Ensure That Licensees Were Accumulating Adequate Decommissioning Funds", "paragraphs": ["We analyzed the status of decommissioning funding as of December 31, 1997, (the year of the most recent data available) for 76 licensees that own all or part of 118 operating and retired nuclear power plants. We performed this analysis because NRC had not, for its own regulatory purposes, systematically collected and analyzed information on its licensees\u2019 decommissioning funds. Our analysis showed that, under likely assumptions about future rates of cost escalation, net earnings on the investments of funds, and other factors, 36 of the licensees had not accumulated funds at a rate that is sufficient for eventual decommissioning. Under these conditions, these licensees will have to increase the rates at which they accumulate funds to meet their future decommissioning financial obligations. Under more pessimistic (unfavorable) and more optimistic (favorable) assumptions, 72 and 8 licensees, respectively, had not accumulated funds at a sufficient rate.", "We also analyzed whether licensees had recently increased the amount of funds that they had collected to make up for under-collections in earlier years. For this analysis, we compared the amounts collected in 1997 with the annual average of the present value of the amount of funds needed to meet licensees\u2019 funding obligations when their plants\u2019 licenses expire. We found that, under likely assumptions, 17 companies collected less funds in 1997 than they need to collect each year over their plants\u2019 remaining operating life. The 17 companies included 15 companies that had not collected sufficient funds through 1997. Under more pessimistic and optimistic assumptions, 66 and 4 licensees, respectively, need to increase the amount of funds that they collect in future years.", "Our funding analysis generally assumes that nuclear power plants would operate for their current licensed operating period\u2014usually 40 years\u2014and that the licensees will remain financially solvent. No plant, however, has yet operated for the full period of its operating license, and electricity deregulation is expected to cause or contribute to more premature plant retirements. Furthermore, 19 of 26 plants that one Wall Street firm considers at risk for early retirement are owned, in whole or in part, by companies that have been slow to accumulate funds to decommission their plants. So far, however, neither early plant retirements nor licensee bankruptcies have adversely affected decommissioning. Economic regulators have allowed utilities to charge their customers rates that included amounts for decommissioning plants that were retired early, and courts have permitted the continued accumulation of decommissioning funds during bankruptcy proceedings.", "From 1990 through 1997, most licensees\u2019 estimates of the costs to decommission their plants have increased rapidly. Likewise, the utilities\u2019 periodic calculations, using a formula contained in NRC\u2019s regulations, of the minimum amount that they must accumulate in their decommissioning funds generally have been escalating more rapidly (particularly in recent years) than the site-specific cost estimates. Also, there are uncertainties over what the actual decommissioning costs might be. For example, the eventual resolution of a protracted dispute between NRC and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over appropriate radiation standards for decommissioned sites could affect final decommissioning costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rates at Which Decommissioning Funds Are Being Accumulated", "paragraphs": ["NRC requires licensees using external sinking funds for decommissioning financial assurance to deposit funds collected for decommissioning into their funds each year. For two reasons, however, NRC does not know if licensees are accumulating decommissioning funds at rates that will provide enough funds to decommission their plants when the plants have been retired. First, NRC leaves the amounts to be put aside up to licensees and their public utility commissions. Second, until recently, NRC has not required that licensees report on the status of their decommissioning funds.", "We analyzed the status of decommissioning funds, as of the end of 1997, for 118 operating and retired nuclear plants owned by 76 licensees (or the parent companies of subsidiaries that are the legal owners of the plants). In our first analysis, we compared the total amount of each licensee\u2019s decommissioning funds with the expected amount of funds that should have been accumulated by that date. To determine the expected amount, we assumed that licensees would accumulate increasing (but constant present-value) amounts annually. Once in the fund, each yearly contribution would continue to grow at the fund\u2019s after-tax rate of return. The sum of these annual amounts, plus the income earned on the investments of the funds, would equal the total estimated decommissioning costs when the licensees\u2019 plants\u2019 operating license expires. For example, at the end of 1997, a licensee\u2019s decommissioning fund for a plant that had operated half of a 40-year license period (begun in 1977) should equal one-half of the present value of the estimated cost to decommission the plant beginning after 2017. This expected level of funding is not the only funding stream that could accrue to equal future decommissioning costs but provides us with both a common standard for comparisons among licensees and, from an equity perspective among ratepayers in different years, a financially reasonable growing current-dollar funding stream over time. Appendix I describes our methodology, assumptions, and results for each of the 76 licensees.", "Performing this analysis required that we make assumptions about future economic and plant-operating conditions. Key assumptions included initial decommissioning cost estimates, rates of cost escalation, net earnings on the investments of funds (discount rate), plant-operating periods, and the use of decommissioning funds for both radiation- and non-radiation-related decommissioning activities. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with assuming future conditions over many years, we used assumptions of the most likely future conditions to develop a baseline scenario. And, to bound the results of the baseline scenario, we developed pessimistic and optimistic scenarios using unfavorable and favorable economic and plant-operating conditions, respectively.", "For our baseline scenario, 36 of the 76 licensees (47 percent) had not accumulated funds at a rate that is sufficient for eventual decommissioning. Under these conditions, these licensees will have to increase the rates at which they accumulate funds to meet their future decommissioning financial obligations. Changing assumptions to reflect the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, greatly affects the adequacy of the licensees\u2019 funding. Under pessimistic and optimistic assumptions, 72 (95 percent) and 8 (11 percent) licensees, respectively, had not accumulated funds at a sufficient rate for eventual decommissioning.", "The fact that a licensee might have collected funds for decommissioning at a lesser rate than the expected rate does not, by itself, mean that the licensee will not meet its financial obligations by the time it retires its plants. By increasing their rates of collection, these licensees can still accumulate the funds that are necessary. Therefore, to obtain insights on whether licensees are now collecting funds at adequate rates, we undertook a second analysis. We compared the available amounts that each licensee collected in 1997 with the average yearly present value of the amounts that the licensees would have to accumulate each year over the remaining life of their plants to have enough decommissioning funds upon the retirement of the plants. This analysis assumes that the licensees will increase their yearly future funding at the after-tax rate of return on the investments of their funds. And, once in the fund, these yearly contributions will grow at this same rate. Our analysis shows these results for the baseline (most likely), pessimistic, and optimistic scenarios.", "For the baseline, the results show that only 17 of 76 licensees (22 percent) were not yet collecting the amounts that they will need to meet their decommissioning obligations. Thus, while 47 percent of the licensees had less than expected levels of funds at the end of 1997, only 22 percent did not appear to be currently on track, as represented by the funds that they collected in 1997, to eventually meet their decommissioning financial obligations. In other words, while licensees might not have funded sufficiently in the early years of their plants\u2019 operating life, our results suggest that most licensees have recently increased funding to make up the funding shortfalls from earlier years. But if conditions deteriorate from those assumed in our baseline scenario, as represented by the pessimistic scenario, 66 licensees (87 percent) under-collected funds in 1997. Conversely, under the optimistic scenario, only 4 licensees (5 percent) are currently accumulating funds too slowly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plant Operating Life\u2019s Effect on Decommissioning Funding", "paragraphs": ["If a nuclear power plant is retired prematurely, sufficient funds may not have been collected by the retirement date to pay all decommissioning costs.

For example, the Trojan plant was retired in 1992 after 17 years of operation. At that time, the plant\u2019s licensees estimated that decommissioning the plant would cost $198 million (in 1993 dollars). However, the licensees had accumulated only $43 million, or 22 percent, of that amount. The Maine Yankee plant was permanently shut down in 1997 after 24 years of operation. When the plant was retired, the licensee had accumulated $188 million for decommissioning. That amount was only 53 percent of the $357 million (in 1997 dollars) that the licensee estimated would be needed to decommission the plant.

In April 1998, Standard & Poor\u2019s predicted that poor economics would cause the early retirements of six plants by 2001. (See table 2.2.) The company also concluded that another 20 units are \u201cat risk\u201d through 2020 for early retirement on the basis of expected poor operating and economic performance over the remainder of the plants\u2019 license. According to the company, in a competitive market, plant owners will attempt to improve profitability; however, the vulnerability of these plants to unscheduled outages may squeeze operating margins and cause the plants to lose their long-term value.", "In commenting on our report, NRC pointed out that one plant that Standard & Poor\u2019s listed as \u201cat risk\u201d for premature retirement\u2014Pilgrim\u2014is in the process of being sold. The prospective buyer, NRC added, intends to operate the plant for its full license term and will consider seeking a license extension for the plant. This example, NRC said, serves to illustrate both the speculative and controversial nature of projecting the premature retirements of nuclear power plants.", "Other experts, however, have reached conclusions that are similar to Standard & Poor\u2019s. For example, in January 1999, Synapse Energy Consultants, Inc., a firm that often testifies in electricity rate proceedings conducted by state public utility commissions, concluded in a report that, depending upon the assumptions used, from 20 to 90 nuclear power plants may be retired early. The most likely case, according to the authors of the report, is that 34 plants will be retired early. Nineteen of the 26 plants that Standard & Poor\u2019s predicts may be retired early are also included in Synapse\u2019s list of 34 plants that it believes may be retired early.", "Compounding the risk that more nuclear power plants may be retired prematurely is the possibility that the licensees that own these plants may have, so far, under-accumulated funds to decommission these plants. For example, 19 of the 26 plants that may be retired early, according to Standard and Poor\u2019s predictions, are owned, in whole or in part, by 14 licensees that have not accumulated sufficient decommissioning funds, according to our analysis. Additional predictions of more early plant retirements have also been made. For example, in December 1997, EIA projected that 24 nuclear plants would retire as early as 10 years before their license expires. In 1995, Moody\u2019s concluded that at least 10 nuclear plants may be closed for economic reasons if the generation of electric power is completely deregulated. One year later, Moody\u2019s downgraded the bond ratings of 24 electric utilities that operate nuclear plants. Again, in 1997, Moody\u2019s said that the frequency that certain nuclear plants tend to require expensive capital additions to comply with their operating license increases the likelihood of even more early plant retirements.", "The premature retirement of the Zion-1 and Zion-2 nuclear power plants in January 1998 illustrates the effect of deregulation on power plant economics. The Commonwealth Edison Company determined that the plants could not generate electricity at competitive prices in the deregulated environment. Therefore, the utility decided to retire both plants after about 24 years, or 60 percent, of their licensed operating life. When the plants were permanently shut down, the utility had put aside $362 million, or less than 43 percent of the $834 million estimated to be needed to decommission the two units.

The Cooperative went bankrupt in 1994, and a bankruptcy settlement was approved on August 26, 1996. The settlement provided for the transfer of $125 million to an external trust to satisfy Cajun\u2019s share of River Bend\u2019s estimated decommissioning cost of $419 million (in 1996 dollars). But the settlement left the successor to Cajun\u2019s share of the plant open.

For each plant using NRC\u2019s mathematical formula, the utility must make an initial calculation in 1986 dollars that is based on the size and type of plant. Then, the utility must escalate the initial calculated value to that of the current year on the basis of prescribed escalation factors. Also, to support proposed charges to electricity customers, plant owners periodically develop detailed estimates of the cost to decommission their specific plants and submit the estimates to their public utility commission regulators. In the absence of significant actual experience, site-specific estimates of decommissioning costs provide the best check on the reasonableness of NRC\u2019s formula for calculating potential decommissioning costs.", "Since 1990, decommissioning cost estimates prepared on a site-specific basis and calculated using through NRC\u2019s formula have increased substantially. For example, site-specific cost estimates (excluding costs that licensees may incur during decommissioning, such as spent fuel storage costs, that NRC does not consider to be decommissioning costs) have increased, on average, at a rate of about 6.6 percent per year. One reason for this increase is the expansion of the scope of decommissioning. The estimates made through NRC\u2019s formula are now, on the average, about one-third higher than the site-specific estimates for the same plants. The main reason for this condition is that the waste disposal part of NRC\u2019s formula was not designed to reflect licensees\u2019 efforts to reduce the volume of waste from decommissioning in response to increasing prices for disposal that have traditionally been based on waste volume. In December 1998, NRC corrected this weakness, which brought calculations through its formula more in line with licensees\u2019 site-specific cost estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty Related to Spent Fuel Management Costs", "paragraphs": ["Largely because DOE is not taking spent fuel from licensees\u2019 nuclear power plants, licensees that intend to immediately dismantle their retired plants must store their spent fuel outside of their plants. For the purpose of estimating and accounting for decommissioning costs, some licensees treat storage costs related to the retirement of their plants as decommissioning costs. The inclusion by licensees of these storage costs in their decommissioning costs is a major reason why licensees\u2019 cost estimates have increased in recent years. A second reason is that licensees may include the cost to dismantle nonradioactive structures, such as administrative buildings, in their estimates of decommissioning costs.", "In contrast, NRC excludes both spent fuel management costs and non-radioactive-related cleanup costs from its formula for calculating the funds that licensees must accumulate to decommission their nuclear power plants. NRC\u2019s reasons for excluding these types of costs are that it (1) regulates independent spent fuel storage facilities (facilities that are separate from the spent fuel pool, which is an integral part of a nuclear power plant) under regulations that are separate from those applicable to the construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants and (2) only regulates the possession, use, and disposal of radioactive materials. Nevertheless, spent fuel management costs have been and will continue to be a real cost for utilities that choose to immediately dismantle their retired plants. For example, in 1995 the licensee for the retired Trojan plant in Oregon estimated that spent fuel management costs to construct, operate, and maintain a dry storage facility at that plant would cost about $102 million (in 1993 dollars)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty Related to Standards for Residual Radiation", "paragraphs": ["Uncertainty over the standards for residual radiation that utilities will have to meet in cleaning up the sites of their retired nuclear power plants affects the accuracy of the current estimates of future decommissioning costs.", "EPA is responsible for setting acceptable radiation limits outside of the boundaries of nuclear facilities and for developing residual radiation standards to protect the health and safety of the public and to protect the environment. EPA has been responsible since 1970 for establishing radiation standards for all aspects of decommissioning, including acceptable levels of residual contamination. To date, however, EPA has not issued such standards. \u201cA site will be considered acceptable for unrestricted use if the residual radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation does not exceed 25 [millirem ] per year, including that from groundwater sources of drinking water, and that the residual radioactivity has been reduced to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable.\u201d", "EPA does not agree with NRC\u2019s standard. In fact, the disagreement between the two agencies has been characterized by both its length and its acrimony. EPA started to develop residual radiation standards in 1984 but has not yet finalized these standards. Nevertheless, EPA\u2019s position is that NRC\u2019s licensees should be required to decontaminate nuclear plant sites to a residual radioactivity level of 15 millirems per year and to limit the exposure to an individual from his/her consumption of groundwater to 4 millirems per year. Most recently, EPA\u2019s administrator stated that the agency would apply the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to sites that are being decommissioned if NRC and EPA do not reach an agreement on applicable standards. Also, in April 1998, one of NRC\u2019s commissioners publicly commented that the impasse between EPA and NRC over appropriate radiation protection standards may have to be resolved by the Congress. In fact, to resolve this disagreement, NRC has sought legislation that would eliminate the overlap in the standard-setting authority of NRC and EPA.", "Currently, NRC\u2019s licensees are using NRC\u2019s regulations and related guidance on decommissioning the sites of retired nuclear facilities to plan and/or implement the decommissioning of their nuclear power plants and related nuclear fuel facilities. If, however, EPA\u2019s residual radiation standards are ultimately used in lieu of NRC\u2019s standards, licensees may have to perform additional cleanup when decommissioning their nuclear plant sites. If this occurred, it would increase decommissioning costs, but by how much is uncertain.

In anticipation of electricity deregulation initiatives, NRC, in September 1998, amended its regulations (effective in Nov. 1998) to address situations in which a licensee\u2019s continued collection of decommissioning fees from its electricity customers may no longer be guaranteed by the economic regulation of electricity rates. To the extent that the collection of decommissioning funds is no longer guaranteed, a licensee may provide up-front financial assurance. The options available to licensees include the prepayment of the estimated decommissioning cost or purchase of surety bonds or insurance to cover decommissioning costs. The assurances may also be in the form of guarantees of payments by the licensees or, as appropriate, their parent company, provided that such guarantees are accompanied by the passing of specified financial tests. Both NRC and the nuclear industry have expressed concern about whether these up-front payment methods would be affordable for licensees. However, in commenting on our draft report, NRC stated that the terms for the recent sales of the Three Mile Island Unit 1, Pilgrim, and Seabrook (partial sale) nuclear power plants have included the prepayment of all estimated decommissioning costs. NRC added that it believes that the prepayment option will likely be the preferred means of assuring decommissioning funds in future sales transactions.", "When NRC published its proposed amended regulations for public comment in September 1997, it expressed concern that surety instruments and insurance may not be available to some nuclear power plant licensees; therefore, NRC specifically asked for comments on this issue. In response, some commenters said they were concerned about the feasibility of the up-front methods (prepayment, surety instruments, and insurance) for assuring decommissioning funding. For example, the Edison Electric Institute, which represents electric utilities, stated that it could be difficult, if not impossible, for licensees to provide such assurances. Also, seven licensees jointly stated that these funding methods would bar prospective new owners from purchasing interests in nuclear power plants. The seven utilities added that the (then) proposed regulations could impose a financial burden that would likely prevent the sale of a nuclear plant. Finally, the utilities stated that (1) it is uncertain if an insurance product or a surety bond could be procured to secure a nonelectric utility\u2019s share of decommissioning costs, and (2) the cost of procuring such a bond could potentially exceed the cost of prepaying decommissioning expenses.", "The difficulty in obtaining a surety bond or insurance product is illustrated by the experience of one of NRC\u2019s licensees. Great Bay Power Corporation, which owned 12 percent of the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, was formed out of bankruptcy proceedings involving four former part-owners of the Seabrook plant. NRC concluded that Great Bay, as a part owner of the plant, did not appear to meet the definition of an \u201celectric utility\u201d because its ability to collect funds for decommissioning from its electricity customers was not guaranteed by the traditional regulation of electricity prices. Therefore, according to NRC\u2019s regulation, Great Bay could not rely exclusively on external sinking funds to provide decommissioning financial assurance. Although NRC gave Great Bay until July 1998 to obtain a surety bond or other financial guarantee to fulfill its decommissioning obligations, the company was unable to obtain such a guarantee. Out of concern for the possible bankruptcy of Great Bay if NRC were to mandate that the company prepay its decommissioning obligation, the state of New Hampshire, in June 1998, passed legislation that would make the co-owners of Seabrook proportionately responsible for making Great Bay\u2019s decommissioning payments if the company defaults on this obligation. According to NRC, this approach qualifies as an acceptable \u201cother method\u201d of providing decommissioning financial assurance.", "In addition to the traditional financial assurance methods discussed above, NRC adopted other methods that licensees may use to provide decommissioning financial assurance.", "Other guarantee methods, including parent company guarantees and self-guarantees coupled with financial tests. For parent company guarantees, a licensee\u2019s parent company must, among other things, have net working capital, tangible net worth, and assets located in the United States worth at least six times the amount of decommissioning funds being assured by the parent company for all of its nuclear power plants. Tangible net worth must exclude the net book value of the nuclear unit(s). For self-guarantees, tangible net worth and assets located in the United States must be 10 times the amount of the decommissioning funds being assured.", "Contractual obligations of a licensee\u2019s customers to purchase enough electricity to provide the licensee\u2019s total share of uncollected funds for decommissioning.", "Any other method, or combination of methods, that provides, as determined by NRC upon its evaluation of the specific circumstances, assurance of decommissioning funding equivalent to that provided by the other acceptable methods.", "These methods are similar to financial assurance methods that NRC permitted in its 1988 decommissioning regulations for other types of licensees, such as operators of nuclear fuel facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Adopts Financial Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Prior to November 1998, NRC had reserved the right to inspect licensees\u2019 decommissioning fund arrangements and status. Under the 1998 amendments, NRC also explicitly reserved the right to take additional action, either independently or in cooperation with economic regulators. These actions could include modifying a licensee\u2019s schedule for accumulating additional funds. In addition, NRC\u2019s 1998 decommissioning regulations required licensees, beginning by the end of March 1999, to report to NRC, every 2 years, certain financial information that would ensure that licensees are collecting their required decommissioning funds.", "Information that must be provided in licensees\u2019 financial reports includes (1) the amount of decommissioning funds estimated to be required according to NRC\u2019s formula; (2) the funds accumulated as of the end of the year prior to the report date; (3) the annual amounts remaining to be collected; (4) the assumptions used to escalate decommissioning costs, project rates of earnings on investments of external sinking funds, and discount funding projections; and (5) modifications to external sinking fund agreements. Utility representatives have not opposed financial reporting. For example, the Edison Electric Institute told NRC that periodic reporting on the status of external sinking funds for decommissioning is appropriate. In addition, in commenting on the proposed regulations, a group of seven utilities stated that a comprehensive reporting requirement is long overdue and is particularly appropriate, given that economic regulators have not been actively monitoring the status of licensees\u2019 external sinking funds on an ongoing basis.", "When NRC published its final regulations, it stated that, after licensees have submitted their initial reports by the end of March 1999, it would review the reports and consider whether to issue additional guidance on the format and content for subsequent licensee reports. Also, in June 1997, when NRC\u2019s commissioners approved the proposed regulations for public comment, the commissioners stated that after NRC\u2019s staff has reviewed licensees\u2019 initial reports, the staff should advise the commissioners on the need for further rulemaking. When NRC issued the 1998 amendments to its decommissioning regulations, however, it did not explain when and how it intends to act on the financial information reported by individual licensees if that information does not clearly demonstrate that an individual licensee is accumulating decommissioning funds at a satisfactory rate.", "The lack of any criteria for acting on licensees\u2019 decommissioning financial reports contrasts with the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to establish a more objective, understandable, and predictable approach to safety oversight of nuclear power plants.

The new safety oversight process should, according to NRC, allow for the integration of various information sources relevant to a licensee\u2019s safety performance, make objective conclusions regarding the significance of the integrated performance information, take actions based on these conclusions in a predictable manner, and effectively communicate these results to the licensees and to the public.", "Therefore, NRC is in the process of establishing a new oversight approach in which it will, among other things, use indicators of nuclear power plants\u2019 performance to establish thresholds for clearly identifying acceptable levels of performance.

NRC rejected this option because it believes that some plants will probably continue operating for their licensed operating period of up to 40 years and, with license extensions, beyond 40 years. Therefore, NRC said, requiring all licensees to accelerate their accumulation of decommissioning funds because of some premature plant retirements would be arbitrary and lead to widely varying effects on licensees. Thus, NRC intends to continue its practice of addressing early plant retirements on a case-by-case basis. NRC\u2019s position, as expressed in the supplementary information accompanying the publication of its amended decommissioning regulations, is that accelerated funding is inequitable. NRC believes that accelerated funding places too much of the financial burden on current utility ratepayers and a lesser burden on ratepayers in the later years of a nuclear power plant\u2019s operation. However, when licensees have retired plants before the plants\u2019 operating license expired, the licensees\u2019 electricity customers have had to pay decommissioning costs for plants from which they no longer receive electricity. The Trojan, Maine Yankee, and Zion cases, discussed earlier, demonstrate this fact. During the years that the Trojan and Zion plants operated, the respective licensees\u2019 customers paid for less than half of the costs to decommission the plants. The customers of the Maine Yankee plant paid for 53 percent of the decommissioning cost. Now, although these retired plants no longer generate electricity, the current and future customers of the licensees will pay the remaining decommissioning costs without receiving comparable benefits from the plants.", "NRC elaborated on its reasons for opposing accelerated decommissioning funding in its comments on our draft report. NRC said that requiring accelerated funding for decommissioning would cause substantial cost increases to be incurred by either licensees\u2019 stockholders or their ratepayers. Also, there would be a myriad of difficulties in determining the appropriate rate of acceleration; for example, at what rate should the collection of funds be accelerated? These issues, NRC added, were considered in its evaluation of accelerated funding as part of its process of amending its decommissioning regulations. NRC concluded that accelerated funding does not provide sufficiently increased decommissioning funding assurance commensurate with its potential cost impacts.", "State legislatures, state public utility commissions, and FERC appear to be addressing assurances for decommissioning funding in their electricity deregulation initiatives. Utility officials in Illinois, New Hampshire, and Oregon, for example, pointed out that laws in those states provide for the collection of necessary and prudent funds for decommissioning nuclear power plants regardless of whether the plants operate until their current licenses expire or are retired prematurely. Thus, licensees have continued collecting from electricity customers the fees earmarked for decommissioning three prematurely retired plants in Illinois and one in Oregon. Similar examples are occurring in California and Massachusetts.", "With respect to the bankruptcy of licensees, New York\u2019s Public Service Commission, in commenting on NRC\u2019s proposed amendments to its decommissioning regulations, urged NRC and states to consider proposing legislation that would make decommissioning liabilities a first priority in the event of the bankruptcy of a private nuclear facility owner. Current bankruptcy law does not make the subject of nuclear decommissioning costs a priority, but NRC has said it does enter bankruptcy proceedings to protect the integrity of decommissioning funding.

Specifically, some licensees have not set aside sufficient amounts of funds for decommissioning, and there is uncertainty over the availability and affordability of the up-front payment methods of providing financial assurance. With electricity deregulation emerging, the possibility exists that a licensee may, in the future, prematurely retire a plant and be faced with paying the remaining decommissioning funds from its own resources. The ability of the licensee to do so might then depend upon its overall financial condition. Thus, self-guarantees that decommissioning funds will be available are only as good as the financial condition of the licensee. (We recognize that to date, early plant retirements have not resulted in a shortfall in decommissioning funds because regulators have allowed licensees to continue collecting funds after plants have been retired.)", "To NRC\u2019s credit, it recognized its need to increase its oversight of decommissioning financial assurance when it modified its decommissioning regulations by requiring licensees to provide financial reports every 2 years.
