A number of laws and executive orders have been promulgated to end discrimination and promote affirmative employment within the federal government. The initial focus of the legislation was on ensuring fair employment practices and nondiscrimination. The attention to affirmative action as a means of addressing the historical underrepresentation of women and minorities in the federal workforce began in the 1960s.", "Two major pieces of legislation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, provide the statutory basis for the establishment of affirmative employment and recruitment programs in the federal government. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has primary responsibility for providing federal agencies with guidance on their affirmative action programs and for monitoring and evaluating program implementation. Although affirmative action programs are currently the subject of some review and debate, these laws and programs remain in effect and guided the actions of the agencies we reviewed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This report is one in a series that we have prepared on the federal affirmative employment program for the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. In May and October 1991, we reported on the federal affirmative employment planning guidance and the representation of women and minorities in the federal workforce. In March 1993 and July 1994, respectively, we reported on the progress of EEO groups in the key job workforces of large and small federal agencies.", "As agreed with the Committee, the objectives of this study were to determine the representation of women and minorities at the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Navy, and State and changes in the representation levels of these groups, particularly at the upper grade levels and in occupations that lead to those grades; evaluate whether the agencies\u2019 affirmative employment program plans complied with EEOC\u2019s instructions, particularly those that address factors affecting women and minority underrepresentation; and assess the adequacy of EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s oversight of the affirmative employment and recruitment programs.", "As table 1 shows, the four agencies we were asked to review differed in size, and showed different changes in the numbers of permanent employees in their workforces between 1984, 1992, and 1994.", "The four agencies also differed in terms of the percentages of their total workforces that were in white-collar and in key white-collar jobs. EEOC defines key jobs as nonclerical occupations with 100 employees or more that are or can lead to middle and senior-level positions. In fiscal year 1992,", "88.8 percent of Interior\u2019s permanent employees were in white-collar jobs, and 33.7 percent in key white-collar jobs.", "98 percent of Agriculture\u2019s permanent employees were in white-collar jobs, and 52.8 percent in key white-collar jobs.", "68.7 percent of Navy\u2019s permanent employees were in white-collar jobs, and 14.8 percent in key white-collar jobs.", "42.4 percent of State\u2019s permanent employees were in white-collar jobs. (State\u2019s Foreign Service workforce accounted for 56.7 percent of the agency\u2019s total permanent employees).", "The analyses presented in chapter 2 address the total, white-collar, and key job workforces at each agency except at the State Department. At State, we examined the Foreign Service workforce in addition to the total and white-collar civil service workforces.", "To determine the representation status of women and minorities, we compared each agency\u2019s workforce profile with the CLF profile to determine whether the agencies\u2019 workforces were representative of the race, ethnic, and gender groups in the CLF. MD-714 and its predecessors instruct that agencies make this comparison for affirmative employment planning purposes. There are different approaches to determining the appropriate CLF for use in this analysis. The directives encourage agencies to use broad occupational categories\u2014professional, administrative, technical, clerical, other, and blue collar (PATCOB). However, its instructions for the last affirmative planning cycle provided as an alternative the use of occupation specific data. Each approach, as we discussed in a previous report, has advantages and disadvantages. For example, PATCOB categories can be too general if an occupation being compared requires particular qualifications and educational levels. A disadvantage of the occupation specific data is that it may be difficult to find occupations in the CLF that precisely match the agencies\u2019 occupations.", "For this report, we made two different comparisons against the CLF. First, we analyzed the agencies\u2019 EEO profiles on an overall basis (i.e., all occupations combined) against the national CLF profile. This provided a broad overview of the standing of the different EEO groups in the agencies\u2019 total and white-collar workforces. However, this comparison does not take into account the differences in the agencies\u2019 occupational mixes and the occupational mix in the CLF. Second, we compared key white-collar occupations that agencies had identified in their affirmative employment plans against specific occupations in the national CLF. Our analyses covered 10 different EEO groups\u2014white men and women, black men and women, Hispanic men and women, Asian men and women, and Native American men and women.", "To assess the degree of representation, we computed representation indexes for overall employment and for key jobs. These indexes were computed by dividing the percentage of each EEO group in each of the four agencies by the corresponding percentage of each EEO group in the CLF and multiplying the result by 100. The indexes can range from 0 to more than 100, with 100 indicating full representation and numbers less than 100 indicating underrepresentation. To the extent an index is much smaller than 100, the underrepresentation is correspondingly more severe.", "The federal workforce data we used came from OPM\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF). Our analyses included full-time and part-time permanent employees. CPDF data comes from federal departments and agencies that report to it. We did not verify the accuracy of the CPDF data.", "Following EEOC\u2019s guidelines, we used the 1990 decennial census CLF data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau as the benchmark for calculating 1992 representation levels. The use of decennial census data for CLF comparisons is a common approach to measuring the representation of EEO groups in the federal government. However, we recognize that census data, like all other existing benchmarks, have strengths and weaknesses. Census-based CLF data are readily available by EEO group to do analyses of total employment and key jobs (e.g., civil engineers, computer specialists). However, the data become outdated with time and may require adjustments to compensate for undercounting of minorities. We did not make adjustments to the census data.", "EEOC, working with OPM, created a \u201ccrosswalk\u201d that matches federal occupations with similar occupations in the decennial census CLF. The crosswalk does not always provide a perfect match between the federal and census occupations, but it is the closest readily available source for making comparisons. We used the crosswalked census occupations for our analysis of agency key jobs.", "We analyzed changes in representation levels of different EEO groups at two points in time\u2014the end of fiscal years 1984 and 1992. Fiscal year 1984 was the most distant year for which we had complete data and 1992 the most recent data available. To analyze changes in representation over this period, we used a ratio-based approach.", "The ratio-based technique involves comparing ratios of numbers in differing EEO groups. To determine the change in representation levels between 1984 and 1992 for particular EEO groups, we divided the number of employees in the EEO group by the number of white men in each year and then took ratios of those numbers across the years. The term \u201crelative number\u201d used in this report refers to the number of women and minorities for every 100 white men. White men were selected as the benchmark because they dominated the agencies\u2019 workforces in 1984 and 1992, especially at General Schedule (GS) grades 14, 15, and senior management levels. It seemed reasonable to consider how the numbers of women and minorities had changed over time relative to them. The ratio-based technique is especially useful in comparing relative changes in workforce representation across EEO groups of very different sizes and when the size and growth rates of the total employee population vary during the period studied.", "We also used this technique to analyze data on hires, separations, and promotions. These personnel events have an effect on the composition of the workforce, and the distribution of EEO groups across grade levels and analyses of these events may provide information to further explain representation trends. For our grade level analysis, we grouped the GS grades as follows: GS grades 1 through 10, 11 through 12, and 13 through 15. We converted the State Department Foreign Service grades to GS-equivalent grades using OPM\u2019s guidelines. Our definition of senior management included employees in the SES, State Department\u2019s Senior Foreign Service, and State Department\u2019s Chief of Mission positions.", "To address our second objective\u2014agency compliance with EEOC\u2019s instructions\u2014we reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and EEOC directives. We examined MD-714 and supplemental memorandums issued by EEOC which contain the affirmative employment planning instructions applicable to the period covered in our review.", "We discussed the affirmative employment planning instructions with former and current officials from EEOC\u2019s Office of Federal Operations in Washington, D.C., and EEOC\u2019s Atlanta and Philadelphia District Offices who are responsible for reviewing and approving agencies\u2019 affirmative employment plans. (The Atlanta and Philadelphia offices had oversight responsibilities over components of the Navy that we reviewed.) These officials described the factors they considered in reviewing and approving plans and provided us with compliance information for the four agencies we examined. We obtained examples of approval letters and other relevant documentation on the approval process. In addition, we independently reviewed the multiyear affirmative employment plans that the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Navy, and State prepared for fiscal years 1988 through 1992 and matched their contents against EEOC\u2019s instructions.", "To determine whether agencies had analyzed each of the eight program elements as required by MD-714, we talked to agency officials about the affirmative employment planning process. We discussed the agencies\u2019 multiyear plans with EEO and personnel specialists who described the analysis process and how the documents were prepared. We also asked for and reviewed documentation on the program analyses, comparing the analysis done to the guidance in MD-714. In addition, we interviewed agency supervisors, managers, SES members, and unit heads to document their roles and extent of involvement in affirmative employment planning and confirm whether certain required tasks were completed in the analyses.", "To assess the adequacy of EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s oversight efforts, we reviewed 13 on-site evaluation reports of federal agencies or components that EEOC prepared between 1988 and 1992 to determine program coverage at each site. (EEOC reports included evaluations of the Departments of the Interior and the Navy.) We met with officials in EEOC\u2019s Office of Federal Operations to discuss the methodology they used for on-site reviews and their monitoring of agency program implementation. We reviewed EEOC\u2019s standard operating procedures for conducting on-site reviews and staff and budget information on the resources that EEOC has allocated to affirmative action planning since fiscal year 1988. In addition, we reviewed EEOC\u2019s fiscal year 1990 Annual Report on the Employment of Women, Minorities, and People with Disabilities in the Federal Government.", "Likewise, we met with officials from OPM\u2019s former Office of Affirmative Recruitment and Employment (now the Office of Diversity) and OPM\u2019s Office of Agency Compliance and Evaluation (ACE) (recently merged into the Office of Merit Systems Oversight and Effectiveness) to discuss (1) OPM\u2019s responsibilities in monitoring agencies\u2019 affirmative recruitment programs; (2) the approach OPM uses to carry out its responsibilities, including the criteria used to evaluate agency FEORP plans; and (3) past and current activities to monitor and evaluate agency affirmative recruitment programs. In addition, we reviewed OPM FEORP reports to Congress for fiscal years 1990 to 1993.", "Our audit work was done from February 1992 to March 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

To determine where underrepresentation exists, MD-714 (and its predecessor) provide that federal agencies compare the percentage of a particular minority/gender group in an occupation or job category with the percentage of that same group in the CLF. MD-714 (and its predecessor) further provide that when the federal employment percentage is less than the CLF percentage, underrepresentation exists and should be addressed in the agency\u2019s affirmative employment plan. Our analysis of agency compliance with requirements for affirmative employment planning is discussed in chapter 3.", "We used two approaches to analyze agency workforce data to determine the representation of women and minorities in the workforce. The first approach involved the use of a ratio-based technique to estimate the relative numbers of women and minorities in the agencies and also the numbers involved in certain personnel events in each year. The technique, which involves comparing ratios of numbers in differing occupational categories, grade levels, or EEO groups, enabled us to perform analyses that are useful for depicting the direction and magnitude of changes over time, and they are especially well suited to comparing the relative changes in workforce representation across groups of very different sizes.", "The second approach required comparisons to CLF data, a benchmark external to the agencies. To determine representation levels, we computed representation indexes using agency workforce data and national CLF data from the 1990 census. The indexes indicate the extent to which an EEO group is represented in a workforce as compared to that group\u2019s representation in the CLF. The index can range from 0 to 100 plus, with 100 indicating full representation and lower numbers indicating underrepresentation.", "Generally, we found that the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Navy, and State made progress towards improving the EEO composition of their workforces. The relative numbers of white women and minorities in the agencies\u2019 workforces increased between 1984 and 1992. Moreover, the relative number of women and minorities in the agencies\u2019 key white-collar jobs increased across all grade levels between 1984 and 1992. Also, the agencies hired and promoted women and minorities into key white-collar jobs in relative numbers that generally equalled or exceeded their relative numbers employed over the period reviewed. However, white and minority women in all agencies and minority men at Interior in 1992 separated at higher rates than white men. Underrepresentation of women and minorities\u2014especially in key jobs\u2014remained in these agencies. White women in all the agencies and minority women at Agriculture were underrepresented on an overall basis in the total and white-collar workforces in fiscal year 1992 when compared to the national CLF. Most EEO groups continued to be underrepresented in key white-collar jobs in relation to their representation in similar occupations in the CLF.", "Appendix I provides more data on the results of our analyses.

According to an EEOC memorandum on affirmative employment planning, agencies should maintain documentation to support their identification of barriers and development of objectives.", "None of the agency program analyses we reviewed fully addressed the eight program elements. Interior fully analyzed only one of the eight program elements; Agriculture, three; State, three; and Navy, two. None of the four agencies fully addressed four of eight program elements (recruitment and hiring, promotions, separations, and program evaluation). Handling discrimination complaints was the only program element that all four agencies fully analyzed.", "For example, the workforce composition component of Interior\u2019s analyses did not address EEO representation levels by key jobs as required by MD-714. In addition, Interior combined all the women and minority groups in its grade level analysis. A breakdown of grade level data by EEO group is called for by MD-714. A breakdown by EEO group is particularly important at Interior because of its high concentration of Native Americans and underrepresentation of other EEO groups. An official from Interior\u2019s Office of Equal Opportunity said that analyzing workforce data by key jobs and grade requires significant manual effort. He added that the department lacks the computer capability and staff resources to conduct detailed analyses.", "Only one of the four agencies\u2019 analysis addressed all the relevant information on employee development programs. For example, two key training questions listed in MD-714 and not addressed in the agencies\u2019 analyses were: \u201cHas a survey of current skills and training of the agency\u2019s workforce been conducted to determine the availability of employees from the EEO Groups, having skills required to meet agency staffing needs?\u201d \u201cHave studies been conducted on time-in-grade to determine the reasons for any differentials which may exist by minority status and sex?\u201d", "EEOC stated that the program analysis questions in MD-714 are considered as guidance and not specific requirements. However, EEOC\u2019s memorandum on federal affirmative employment planning dated January 21, 1988, suggests otherwise.

Therefore, each agency should ensure that it performs a comprehensive assessment of how the agency\u2019s efforts are directed toward the eight major program elements. The analysis must provide complete rationale for responses to the questions that follow each element. It is not necessary that the analysis be limited to just those questions.\u201d The memorandum also states that agencies should maintain documentation which supports the agency\u2019s identification of barriers and development of objectives.", "However, agency officials from two of the agencies we reviewed also said that they considered the questions in MD-714 as guidance rather than requirements that must be met. Agency officials also said that EEOC did not always ask agencies to provide comprehensive answers to the program analysis questions when it reviewed their plans.", "Another reason for the incomplete analysis of the program elements is that agencies did not fully analyze personnel event data (e.g., data on recruitment, hires, training, promotions, and separations). We discuss this issue later within this chapter. In prior reports we have recommended that EEOC expand the agency workforce analysis requirements to include (1) major occupation workforce data by grade level or grade groupings, and (2) analysis of hiring, training and development, promotion, and separation data. We believe that these additional analyses are critical to fully understanding the causes for trends in underrepresentation and overcoming barriers to achieving a representative workforce.

While the agency plans we reviewed often acknowledged that agencies had made some progress in the areas of recruitment, hiring, and promotion of EEO groups, none included any explanation of the fundamental causes of underrepresentation where it existed.", "The State Department initiated studies to validate its procedures for examining and hiring Foreign Service employees partly in response to our 1989 report. Our report recommended, among other things, that the Secretary of State analyze personnel processes to determine (1) whether the Foreign Service written examination was a valid predictor of success, (2) why minorities and women were eliminated at a higher rate than white men by the final review panel process, and (3) why women and minorities were disparately assigned to certain functional work areas.", "The State Department has taken steps to address these first two recommendations. State\u2019s multiyear plan acknowledged that the Foreign Service written exam had adversely affected EEO groups. According to the Director, Office of Recruitment, Examination, and Employment, the State Department is validating the requirements of Foreign Service positions and correlating them with the test used to determine whether revisions are needed. The Director said that the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures do not require that the agency automatically discard or change the exam; they only require that State determine whether the exam is a valid indicator of job performance. According to State officials, they have implemented, in 1994, a new system for assigning functional work areas which addresses the allegations of disproportionate assignment of women and minorities to certain areas.", "The affirmative employment plans we reviewed generally acknowledged that the agencies lacked information on employee skills and training.

While these are important aspects of the affirmative employment program, none of the multiyear plans focused on the root causes of underrepresentation or the specific remedies required to correct the problem. Agency personnel and EEO specialists at three of the four agencies we reviewed told us that the affirmative employment plans were deficient because they were treated as a paperwork requirement instead of as plans of action to be taken seriously by the agencies\u2019 managers.

Both provided technical suggestions that we have incorporated, where appropriate.", "In a letter dated July 7, 1995, the Chairman, EEOC, disagreed with our assertions that (1) federal agencies had not followed EEOC\u2019s instructions in their analyses of affirmative employment programs and had submitted incomplete plans, and (2) EEOC had approved the incomplete plans, thereby indicating that EEOC was not providing the oversight necessary to ensure that the proper affirmative action program analyses were being done (see app. VI).", "In support of its position, EEOC articulated an interpretation of MD-714\u2019s reporting requirements that was different from the one we had been provided by EEOC officials during the course of past reviews. According to the interpretation EEOC articulated in its comments, MD-714 provides agencies leeway in determining which program elements to report in their plans. Under this interpretation, we agree that the plans that our draft report had characterized as incomplete could instead be viewed as complete. We have revised the report to reflect this interpretation and to incorporate additional technical suggestions, as appropriate.", "A more important issue than the completeness of the plans is the underlying analyses upon which the plans are based. In its comments, EEOC said that the program analysis questions in MD-714 are also considered as guidance and not specific requirements. However, EEOC\u2019s January 21, 1988, memorandum to federal agencies on affirmative employment planning says otherwise. The memorandum states that \u201cThe program analysis is the foundation upon which the agency\u2019s entire plan will be based. Therefore, each agency should ensure that it performs a comprehensive assessment of how the agencies\u2019 efforts are directed toward the eight major program elements. The analysis must provide complete rationale for responses to the questions that follow each element. It is not necessary that the analysis be limited to just those questions.\u201d The memorandum also states that agencies should maintain documentation which supports the agency\u2019s identification of barriers and development of objectives.", "Thus, while agencies need not report on all eight program elements in their plans, current MD-714 guidance requires that agencies use those elements in their analyses and maintain supporting documentation. Because reports may not include all of the relevant information, it is important for EEOC to perform on-site reviews which include evaluations of agencies\u2019 program analyses. We believe that, as discussed in Chapter 4, EEOC\u2019s increased rate of completed on-site reviews, if continued and done effectively, should help provide the necessary oversight for agency affirmative employment programs.", "On the issue of collecting data on job applicants, OPM\u2019s and EEOC\u2019s comments reflect different points of view. OPM said that it is opposed to collecting data from job applicants concerning their race and national origin because it believes that the collection of such data would be costly, ineffective, and a reporting burden. OPM also said that agencies should be held accountable for the compositions of their selections. In contrast, EEOC said that it believes the collection of applicant flow data is necessary to hold agency officials accountable and is also required by regulation. We have previously found that agencies frequently believed applicant flow data was useful and recommended reestablishing collection of that data."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
