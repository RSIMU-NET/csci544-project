For example, earlier versions valid until 2011, of which there are more than 20 million in circulation, remain vulnerable to fraudulent alteration by such means as photo substitution. Although State has updated or changed the security features of its travel documents, State does not have a structured process to periodically reassess the effectiveness of the security features in its documents against evolving threats and to actively plan for new generations. State has taken a number of measures to ensure the security and quality of passports and visas, including establishing internal control standards and quality assurance measures, training of acceptance agents, and initiating new visa policies and procedures. However, additional measures are needed in the passport issuance process to minimize the risk of fraud. State lacks a program for oversight of the thousands of passport acceptance facilities that serve an important function in verifying the identity of millions of passport applicants each year. Officers in primary inspection--the first and most critical opportunity to identify fraudulent travel documents at U.S. ports of entry--are unable to take full advantage of the security features in passports and visas. These officers rely on both their observations of travelers and visual and manual examination of documents to detect fraudulent documents. However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not yet provided most ports of entry with the technology tools to read the new electronic passports and does not have a process in place for primary inspectors to utilize fingerprints collected for visas, including BCCs, at all land ports of entry.

However, we found that many  of the problems with the oversight of passport acceptance facilities we  identified in 2005 persist. Specifically, State lacks an internal control plan  for its acceptance facilities to ensure that effective controls are  established and monitored regularly. An internal control plan should  identify the roles and responsibilities of all individuals whose work affects  internal control; lay out specific control areas; cover risk assessment and  mitigation planning; and include monitoring and remediation procedures.  Moreover, ICAO guidance for the issuance of travel documents  recommends several procedures to combat fraudulent applications,  including (1) regular training to individuals who accept applications to  increase their awareness of potential fraud risks and (2) processes to  ensure random access between the acceptance agent and applicant.", "Numerous passport officials and Diplomatic Security investigators told us  that the acceptance agent program remains a significant fraud  vulnerability. State passport officials told us there have been investigated  fraud cases associated with passport acceptance facilities or the  individuals working there; however, they did not provide us with  additional information on these cases. Examples of acceptance agent  errors that were brought to our attention include important information  missing from documentation, such as evidence of birth certificates and  parents\u2019 affidavits concerning permission for children to travel, as well as  photos that were not properly attached to the application. One passport  specialist also cited a case where the photo submitted with the application  did not match the identity of the applicant. In another example, another  passport official told us of a case where an acceptance facility had  accepted a passport application for an individual without the person being  present and, therefore, did not verify the applicant\u2019s identity. In addition,  managers at two passport offices said their offices often see the same  mistakes multiple times from the same acceptance facility. These  problems are of particular concern given the persistent attempts to  fraudulently obtain legitimate passports using stolen identity documents.", "Although resources and other tools are available to passport examiners at  domestic passport offices to verify citizenship evidence and potentially  detect false claims of identity, there are a number of indicators in the  inspection of applicants that enhance the ability to detect efforts to use a  false identity to obtain a genuine passport. Moreover, passport examiners  and other officials at passport offices told us it is easier to detect  application fraud when interviewing applicants directly at the passport  counter. However, the majority of passport applications that passport  examiners adjudicate are accepted by individuals at passport acceptance  facilities.", "State has taken action to address some weaknesses we previously  identified with the acceptance facility program. These actions include the  following:  In mid-2006, State began to develop a system to track the names and  signatures of authorized acceptance agents, the training status of these  agents, and the level of proficiency achieved in the training. According to  State officials, this system is expected to be fully implemented by the end  of 2007.", "In May 2007, State implemented an online training program for use by  nonpostal passport acceptance agents. This program was adapted from a  computer-based training program previously developed by State and the  U.S. Postal Service to train passport acceptance agents at postal service  facilities.", "In the spring of 2007, State began to discuss a system for tracking accepted  passport applications by acceptance facility.", "In addition, State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs is proposing to update and  amend some of its passport regulations. These amendments would, among  other things, codify the requirement that passport acceptance agents be  U.S. citizens, permanent employees, and 18 years or older, and have  successfully completed the training as detailed by guidance provided by  State. While these requirements are already State policy, the proposed  changes would make them formal regulations. In addition, another change  would require passport acceptance facilities within the United States to  maintain a current listing of all passport acceptance agents. If enforced,  these regulations would strengthen the application acceptance process.", "State officials attribute problems with applications received through  acceptance agents to the limited oversight of acceptance agents. For  example, accountability for the number of passport agents authorized to  accept passport applications remains unclear. Officials at two passport  offices confirmed that their passport offices now maintain records of the  names of individuals accepting passport applications at designated  acceptance facilities in their region. However, they expressed reservations  about relying too heavily on the accuracy of this information given the  absence of a program to audit or verify the performance of acceptance  agents. In addition, State makes a limited number of oversight visits to  acceptance facilities. Primarily due to the large number of acceptance  facilities in each passport office region, these offices concentrate their  training and oversight visits on acceptance facilities geographically close  to the passport office or those acceptance facilities identified to have  problems. In the absence of a formal mechanism for monitoring the  performance of acceptance agents, officials at two of the passport offices  we visited had developed individual systems for tracking the passport  acceptance facility or agent with an application detected to be fraudulent  by passport examiners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Continues to Address Vulnerabilities in the Visa Issuance Process", "paragraphs": ["GPO and State have measures for ensuring the quality of visas, including  BCCs.

Examples include controls to ensure random access between applicants  and adjudicators, to minimize the risk of malfeasance; controls for its  accountable items; and daily supervisory review of all visa refusals and a  sample of visa issuances. As we reported, State has taken a number of  steps to strengthen its efforts to protect against malfeasance in the  issuance process. For example, to prevent the issuances of nonimmigrant  visas to unqualified applicants, Consular Affairs has strengthened its  efforts to limit employee access to automated systems that issue visas and  has taken steps to ensure that visa applicants cannot predict which  officers will interview them. It has also strengthened its criteria for  applicants referred by post employees for favorable consideration in  obtaining a visa and expedited processing by consular officers.

Without an official exemplar,  a CBP training officer at one port we visited used his own e-passport to  provide officers training on the security features of the e-passport. This  training officer stated that while he used the FDL alert to train officers, use  of the alert alone does not provide officers with an understanding of the  look and feel of the actual document. In addition, CBP officers at several  ports we visited stated they had inspected e-passports but were not aware  of how the security features of the e-passport differed from previous  generations and how changes to the security features addressed the types  of fraudulent attacks commonly committed against older generations of  passports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Ongoing Training Impedes Officers\u2019 Understanding of Security Features of Valid Generations of Passports and Visas at Some Ports", "paragraphs": ["Given evolving fraud trends and the quality of attempts to alter passports  and visas, ensuring officers are properly trained to recognize the  fraudulent use of these travel documents is essential. Training officers at  most of the ports we visited identified the importance of continual training  on the security features and evolving fraudulent trends related to all  generations of valid passports and visas; however, the extent to which  mandatory training is supplemented by refresher training in the subject  varied among these ports. For example, two ports we visited provide  continual training on fraudulent document detection to all officers yearly,  while other ports provided refresher training less frequently. While CBP  requires officers to complete courses that include segments in fraudulent  document detection relating to passports and visas, CBP officials stated  there is currently no program in place to ensure officers receive such  training continually.

At most of the  ports we visited, port officials explained there is not enough time to  provide all officers with additional training on the security features of  valid generations of passports and visas due to inspection priorities and  limited staffing at ports. To provide greater opportunities for continual  document examination training relating to passports and visas, many ports  we visited undertook their own training initiatives. For example, four of  the ports added segments on fraudulent document detection to mandated  courses that did not already include such information. In addition, based  on training developed in the field, CBP developed a Web-based course on  the security features of visas. Officials at ports undertaking these  initiatives said they realized that without continual training, officers often  felt less prepared to understand and recognize security features and  fraudulent trends. They stated that because passports and visas could  remain valid for 10 years, fraudulent attacks committed against older  generations of these travel documents often recur, and officers should be  reminded of these fraud trends through continuing training. In addition, to  identify and adopt best practices on fraudulent document detection  training, CBP held a forum in January 2005 that led to the development of  a nationwide training effort requiring supplemental training on fraudulent  document detection at all ports. However, CBP does not have any plans to  hold such forums in the near future, and while CBP encourages ports to  adopt initiatives to improve the delivery of refresher training on the  examination of passports and visas, it is often not possible to mandate  initiatives that are appropriate for all ports because ports differ in the  types of fraudulent travel documents they encounter."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring the integrity of passports and visas is an essential part of border  security requiring continual vigilance and new initiatives to stay ahead of  those seeking to enter the United States illegally. Preventing the fraudulent  use of travel documents requires a combination of enhanced document  features, solid issuance measures, and an inspection process that utilizes  the security features of these documents. A well-designed document has  limited utility if it is not well-produced or the inspection does not utilize  the available security features to detect attempts to falsely enter the  United States. State has added technical features and security techniques  to the design and production of these documents that make it much harder  to counterfeit or alter new generations of passports and visas.  Nonetheless, older documents have been fraudulently used. Further,  counterfeit and alteration threats to the security of these documents are  always changing, requiring regular reassessments of the security features  in the documents\u2019 design. In addition, because it takes several years to  address a vulnerability that has been identified in a document\u2019s design, a  structured process for reassessing the features and planning for new  generations of these documents is critical. State has also strengthened the  issuance process for visas and passports. Despite some improvements,  however, the passport issuance process remains vulnerable, especially at  the application acceptance stage, where oversight of the thousands of  acceptance facilities\u2014responsible for verifying the identity of applicants\u2014 remains weak. Finally, many CBP inspectors at U.S. ports of entry face  time constraints in processing large volumes of people and therefore rely  on a few visual and tactile security features of passports and visas, in  addition to their interviews, to identify fraudulent use of these documents.", "Moreover, CBP officers are unable to take full advantage of the improved  technical and security features in passports and visas because of  insufficient training and uneven access to equipment.

For example, while at  each port, primary officers question travelers regarding their identity and  purpose of travel, and examine their passports or visas, the availability and  use of equipment to conduct identity and records checks of travelers  during primary inspection differ based on whether travelers arrive by  plane, sea vessel, vehicle, or on foot. If the primary officer determines that  further review is needed, the officer will refer the traveler to secondary  inspection.

With information from APIS, CBP officers conduct queries  of lookout records for each traveler in the Treasury Enforcement  Communications System (TECS).

For a traveler with a U.S. nonimmigrant visa subject to  processing in DHS\u2019s U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator  Technology (US-VISIT) systems, primary officers collect scans of the  traveler\u2019s two fingerprints (the right and left index fingers) and take a  digital photograph of the traveler.

It is not our intention to  inhibit or replace the informal process already in place. However, we  believe that an informal process by itself is not an effective way to re- evaluate the security features of passports and visas against evolving  counterfeit and alteration threats. While State has made adjustments in  the design of passports and visas, its approach has been largely  reactive.  A structured process for reassessing the features and  planning for new generations of passports and visas is critical because  counterfeit and alteration threats to the security of these documents  are always changing, many passports and visas have a long lifespan,  and it takes State several years to fully implement a new document  design. The increasing pace of technology change and use of  electronics makes State\u2019s current approach less viable than it might  have been in the past, and best practices, such as for currency design,  suggest that periodic evaluation of designs and introduction of new  security features are more viable approaches in the management of  counterfeit and alteration threats.
