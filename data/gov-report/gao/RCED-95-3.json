All of this waste requires processing by either recycling, incineration, or disposal. State and local authorities are responsible for planning for the safe management of solid waste; granting permits for landfills; and, in some cases, arranging for waste collection and other waste management services. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a hierarchy of preferred methods for managing solid waste that emphasizes first, reducing the amount of waste generated (source reduction); second, recycling and reuse; and finally, incineration and the use of landfills. According to EPA, total expenditures for managing nonhazardous solid waste in 1972 were $8.4 billion, and these costs could reach $75 billion by 2000."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Amounts of Waste Generated and Disposal Methods", "paragraphs": ["Of the 13 billion tons of nonhazardous waste generated in 1992, 7.6 billion tons was nonhazardous industrial waste, 5.2 billion tons was special wastes (wastes from mining, oil and gas production, electric utilities, and cement kilns), and about 200 million tons was municipal waste (both commercial and residential wastes). Figure 1.1 shows the percentage, by type, of all the waste generated in 1992. The amount of nonhazardous solid waste generated was almost 50 times greater than the amount of hazardous waste.", "In 1990, we reported that more than 95 percent of industrial waste goes to surface impoundments (such as ponds and lagoons), where it is stored, treated, and released into surface water. The rest is disposed of in landfills or waste piles, or applied to the land. The waste management method used for special wastes varies according to the type of waste. For example, EPA estimates that in the early 1980s, about 56 percent of waste rock was disposed of in on-site waste piles and 61 percent of tailings were disposed of in on-site surface impoundments. Municipal waste is managed quite differently than industrial or special wastes. In 1993, the states reported that about 17 percent of municipal solid waste was recycled, 11 percent was incinerated, and 72 percent was sent to landfills. (App. I provides state-by-state data on the percentage of municipal waste recycled, incinerated, and sent to landfills.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Requirements for Solid Waste Management", "paragraphs": ["The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, establishes a cooperative framework for federal, state, and local authorities to manage solid waste in an environmentally sound manner and to maximize the use of limited resources. The act requires EPA to establish minimum criteria for facilities that may receive hazardous waste from households or from generators of small quantities, in order to ensure that there is no reasonable probability that human health or the environment will be adversely affected. It also requires states to adopt a permit program or other means of prior approval to ensure that landfills meet EPA\u2019s minimum criteria. Furthermore, EPA must establish guidelines and may provide technical and financial assistance to state and local authorities for the development and implementation of state plans for managing waste. Between fiscal year 1978 and fiscal year 1981, EPA provided funds to states to develop and implement waste management plans. Beginning in 1982, EPA eliminated financial assistance for state and local planning.", "Both RCRA and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508) address alternatives to land disposal of waste. RCRA advocates the use of resource recovery, either through facilities that convert waste to energy or through recycling. To promote recycling, RCRA requires federal agencies that procure goods to purchase products, such as paper, that contain recovered material. The act requires EPA to develop guidelines that identify products that are or can be produced with recovered materials and to recommend practices for agencies to follow when purchasing the products. RCRA also requires the Department of Commerce to encourage more commercialization of resource recovery technologies through (1) promoting proven technologies, (2) providing a forum for the exchange of technical and economic data on resource recovery facilities, (3) providing accurate specifications for recovered materials, and (4) stimulating the development of markets for recovered material.", "The Pollution Prevention Act also promotes reducing the amount of material generated and thus reducing the amount of waste requiring recycling, treatment, or disposal. The act requires EPA to develop and implement a strategy to promote source reduction. As part of that strategy, EPA is directed to, among other things, (1) establish standard methods for measuring source reduction; (2) coordinate source reduction activities in each office within EPA; (3) facilitate the adoption of source reduction techniques by businesses; and (4) identify, where appropriate, measurable goals, tasks necessary to achieve the goals, dates for achieving these goals, and organizational responsibilities.", "In 1979, EPA issued minimum criteria for solid waste landfills. Under these criteria, waste had to be covered and protected against floodwater, and open burning of waste was prohibited. In 1988, EPA proposed new criteria for municipal waste landfills that accept hazardous waste from households or from small-quantity generators because the Congress determined that the 1979 criteria may not adequately protect human health and the environment. Beginning in October 1993, the new criteria for new or expanding municipal landfills require (1) liners to prevent liquids from leaking into the groundwater, (2) collection systems to remove liquids that accumulate in the waste, (3) monitoring of groundwater for hazardous substances, and (4) plans for closing and then monitoring the waste sites. EPA projected that these regulations would reduce the number of municipal landfills in operation.", "EPA has not revised its 1979 criteria for solid waste landfills other than those that accept municipal waste. As a result of a January 1994 settlement agreement between EPA and the Sierra Club, EPA is required, by May 1995, to propose rules revising criteria applicable to all nonmunicipal solid waste facilities that may receive hazardous waste from households or from small-quantity generators.

EPA\u2019s strategy included a national goal of reducing solid waste through source reduction or recycling by 25 percent by 1992. No specific goal for source reduction or recycling was set beyond 1992.", "In addition, the Agenda for Action identifies several objectives for municipal waste management. These objectives included increasing (1) the amount of information on waste planning and management available to states, local communities, waste handlers, citizens, and industry; (2) effective planning for municipal waste; (3) source reduction activities by the manufacturers, the government, and citizens; and (4) recycling by government, individuals, and corporations.

A solid waste manager is responsible for selecting and arranging for waste management services, such as waste collection, land disposal or incineration, or recycling and composting. The services selected are those that appropriately address each component of solid waste in the most cost-effective and environmentally beneficial way. For example, recycling and reuse are appropriate for things whose physical properties make it technically and economically feasible to use them further; composting is used for organic substances; and incineration and land disposal are used for waste with little or no commercial value or for which recycling and reuse markets are poorly developed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ownership Options", "paragraphs": ["Once the types of services needed to manage solid waste are selected, a solid waste manager must determine who will provide that service. Depending on location, the services could be provided by municipalities, private companies, large commercial firms, or the company or business needing the waste management services. For example, collection and disposal services may be owned and provided by the government, or the government may contract with commercial firms to provide these services. In some municipalities, households, businesses, and manufacturers may make their own arrangements with commercial haulers for waste collection. These haulers, in turn, may either own recycling and disposal facilities or contract to use services owned by commercial waste management companies. Other options include (1) public ownership of the infrastructure, with municipal waste collection services contracted to commercial operators, and (2) public collection, with waste taken to privately or commercially owned and operated facilities. For example, Los Angeles and New York City both own and operate collection vehicles that dispose of residential waste at publicly owned and operated landfills. The city of Las Vegas and the surrounding county partially contract out collection and disposal services to a commercial firm. In areas of Colorado and New Jersey, homeowners must contract with commercial firms for collection because the municipalities do not provide or arrange for this service.", "Ownership options for solid waste management services may also vary by the type of solid waste being managed. Local governments may provide services to households and small commercial establishments but exclude large commercial establishments and industrial firms from using those same services. Commercial waste collection and disposal companies may provide collection and disposal services to commercial establishments and industrial firms that generate nonhazardous industrial waste or construction and demolition debris. Large industrial firms may also treat, recycle, incinerate, or dispose of their own waste on-site. According to 1991 estimates by the National Solid Wastes Management Association, commercial firms served around 60 percent of all households and removed more than 90 percent of the nation\u2019s commercial refuse. According to other estimates, commercial land disposal facilities handled about 50 percent of the volume of municipal solid waste, although they represented only 15 to 30 percent of the landfills operating in 1992."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Intrastate, Interstate, and International Transportation Options", "paragraphs": ["Solid waste managers must also decide whether waste can be shipped to a local private, public, or commercial landfill, incinerator, or processing facility\u2014such as a recycling facility\u2014or to facilities located elsewhere in the same state, in other states, or in other countries. In 1992, there were only about 170 incinerators and fewer than 5,400 landfills within the United States.

International shipments of waste between the United States and Canada and Mexico are governed by international agreements. The agreement between Canada and the United States was amended in 1992 to require that the receiving country be notified before municipal solid waste is shipped for final disposal or for incineration with energy recovery.

The guidelines call for industry to (1) eliminate packaging whenever possible; (2) minimize the amount of material used in packaging; (3) design packages that are returnable, refillable or reusable; and (4) produce packages that can be recycled and use recovered material in packages. Although these guidelines are voluntary, as of August 1993, 8 of the top 40 retailers in the country have endorsed them. For example, Sears, Roebuck and Company adopted these guidelines and is working with its private-label manufacturers to reduce the packaging used for appliances and clothing. The company had eliminated 1.5 million tons of packaging by September 1994.", "The coalition also developed model legislation that establishes standards for packaging sold or distributed in the Northeast. The legislation was developed to make the individual states\u2019 legislative initiatives to achieve source reduction more effective and, at the same time, to minimize economic disruptions by having a regional (if not a national) approach. The model legislation would (1) formalize and codify the coalition\u2019s 1989 guidelines on preferred packaging; (2) provide industry options for achieving, by January 1996, a 15-percent reduction in the amount of packaging used; and (3) encourage industry to take additional actions to reduce packaging. In addition, the legislation sets a goal of reducing solid waste by 50 percent by the year 2000 and calls for an evaluation to determine if more stringent packaging standards should be adopted to achieve that goal.", "Some states have also initiated source reduction efforts aimed at consumers and industries.

Similarly, in Colorado, EPA Region VIII and the Colorado Office of Energy Conservation produced a public service video urging citizens to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources offers an award for innovative projects to minimize waste, giving preference to industries and municipalities that prevent waste from being generated.

Some localities use interstate shipments as a solution to their local problems with waste disposal. For example, commercial haulers of business waste in New York City export about 3 million tons annually for disposal because the publicly owned landfill raised its rates for commercial waste to the point that it was less expensive to transport and dispose of waste out of state. New York City officials raised the commercial rates in an effort to conserve the disposal space for residential waste in their only remaining landfill.", "Interstate shipments have also been attributed to new and stricter federal criteria for landfills; increasing state regulation; economic and environmental factors, such as the increasing privatization of municipal solid waste management; and trends towards building larger and better but fewer landfills for municipal solid waste. Also, as a result of stricter federal and state regulations, the cost of constructing small locally owned and operated solid waste management facilities has exceeded the resources of many governmental bodies.

According to state officials and industry experts, bans or limits would also allow the state to address citizens\u2019 concerns that the state is being used as a dumping ground for other states less willing to make decisions about solid waste management, the imported waste may contain hidden environmental and health hazards, the imported waste adversely affects local recycling efforts by discouraging some citizens from recycling because they believe their local capacity will be used for out-of-state waste, and increased traffic will result in additional costs for maintaining publicly financed roads.", "Likewise, allowing state and local governments to control the flow of waste to certain facilities could benefit those communities that have made major financial commitments in waste management operations, either through \u201cput or pay\u201d contracts or through construction funded by public debt, by providing those communities with more certain financing for these efforts.", "However, allowing state and local authorities to limit or restrict waste received at private or commercial facilities, or to control where waste must be taken, also has potential negative consequences. First, competition could be impeded, opening the way for potential inefficiencies that drive up the costs to the public. Second, the number of options that state and local authorities, households, commercial firms, and manufacturers have for managing their solid waste could decrease if the waste cannot be shipped across state lines, thus possibly raising the cost to those who pay for the services. Third, communities with insufficient capacity could be required to make significant outlays as they attempt to finance and construct local waste management capacity because they would no longer be able to use out-of-state facilities. Fourth, land disposal facilities that may not comply with EPA\u2019s revised criteria on landfills could continue to be used because options to ship waste out of their jurisdictions would have been precluded. Finally, communities that could be precluded from shipping waste out of their jurisdictions might be required to construct new facilities locally, where land and water resources could more easily be compromised, thus posing a potential threat to human health and the environment.", "The conference committee report accompanying EPA\u2019s fiscal year 1993 appropriating legislation directed EPA to provide the Congress with a review of flow control laws and an analysis of their effect on health and environmental protection, state and local management capacity, and source reduction, reuse, and recycling. EPA estimates that its study will be provided to the Congress by early 1995. According to EPA solid waste officials, the study will compare states that have flow control with those that do not to determine the impact that flow control has on planning, interstate shipments of solid waste, and recycling. However, according to one official, EPA does not have a position on flow control. It is not known if EPA\u2019s study will provide sufficient information to determine whether legislative action to address flow control is necessary.", "Federal legislation that was proposed but not acted upon during the 103rd Congress on the interstate shipment of waste addressed a number of issues, but that Congress did not direct EPA to conduct a study, similar to the one currently being conducted on flow control, to review state laws affecting interstate waste shipments and the impact these laws have on waste management issues. While we attempted to obtain data useful to the Congress to address interstate shipments of solid waste, we were unable to identify sources for that data. This lack of data makes it difficult to determine the impact of legislative action that places restrictions on interstate waste shipments."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
