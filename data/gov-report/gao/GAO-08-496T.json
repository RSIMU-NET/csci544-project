Information  security is a critical consideration for any organization that depends  on information systems and computer networks to carry out its  mission or business. It is especially important for government  agencies, where the public\u2019s trust is essential. The need for a vigilant  approach to information security is demonstrated by the dramatic  increase in reports of security incidents, the wide availability of  hacking tools, and steady advances in the sophistication and  effectiveness of attack technology.

The failure of the pumps was  traced to excessive traffic on the control system network, possibly  caused by the failure of another control system device.   \u25cf  Officials at the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and  Security discovered a security breach in July 2006. In investigating  this incident, officials were able to review firewall logs for an 8- month period prior to the initial detection of the incident, but were  unable to clearly define the amount of time that perpetrators were  inside its computers, or find any evidence to show that data was lost  as a result.  \u25cf  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed that in January  2003, the Microsoft SQL Server worm known as \u201cSlammer\u201d infected  a private computer network at the idled Davis-Besse nuclear power  plant in Oak Harbor, Ohio, disabling a safety monitoring system for  nearly 5 hours.

Several agencies have been designated as service providers for IT  security awareness training and FISMA reporting.   \u25cf  Federal Desktop Core Configuration: This initiative directs agencies  that have Windows XP deployed and plan to upgrade to Windows  Vista operating systems to adopt the security configurations develop  by NIST, DOD, and DHS. The goal of this initiative is to improve  information security and reduce overall IT operating costs.  \u25cf  SmartBUY: This program, led by GSA, is to support enterprise-level  software management through the aggregate buying of commercial  software governmentwide in an effort to achieve cost savings  through volume discounts. The SmartBUY initiative was expanded  to include commercial off-the-shelf encryption software and to  permit all federal agencies to participate in the program. The  initiative is to also include licenses for information assurance.  \u25cf  Trusted Internet Connections initiative: This is an effort designed  to optimize individual agency network services into a common  solution for the federal government. The initiative is to facilitate the  reduction of external connections, including Internet points of  presence, to a target of fifty.", "In addition to these initiatives, OMB has issued several policy  memorandums over the past two years to help agencies protect  sensitive data. For example, it has sent memorandums to agencies  to reemphasize their responsibilities under law and policy to (1)  appropriately safeguard sensitive and personally identifiable  information, (2) train employees on their responsibilities to protect  sensitive information, and (3) report security incidents. In May 2007,  OMB issued additional detailed guidelines to agencies on  safeguarding against and responding to the breach of personally  identifiable information, including developing and implementing a  risk-based breach notification policy, reviewing and reducing  current holdings of personal information, protecting federal  information accessed remotely, and developing and implementing a  policy outlining the rules of behavior, as well as identifying  consequences and potential corrective actions for failure to follow  these rules.", "Opportunities also exist to enhance policies and practices related to  security control testing and evaluation, FISMA reporting, and the  independent annual evaluations of agency information security  programs required by FISMA.  \u25cf  Clarify requirements for testing and evaluating security controls.", "Periodic testing and evaluation of information security controls is a  critical element for ensuring that controls are properly designed,  operating effectively, and achieving control objectives. FISMA  requires that agency information security programs include the  testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security  policies, procedures, and practices, and that such tests be  performed with a frequency depending on risk, but no less than  annually.", "We previously reported that federal agencies had not adequately  designed and effectively implemented policies for periodically  testing and evaluating information security controls. Agency policies  often did not include important elements for performing effective  testing such as how to determine the frequency, depth, and breadth  of testing according to risk. In addition, the methods and practices  for at six test case agencies were not adequate to ensure that  assessments were consistent, of similar quality, or repeatable. For  example, these agencies did not define the assessment methods to  be used when evaluating security controls, did not test controls as  prescribed, and did not include previously reported remedial actions  or weaknesses in their test plans to ensure that they had been  addressed. In addition, our audits of information security controls  often identify weaknesses that agency or contractor personnel who  tested the controls of the same systems did not identify. Clarifying  or strengthening federal policies and requirements for determining  the frequency, depth, and breadth of security controls according to  risk could help agencies better assess the effectiveness of the  controls protecting the information and systems supporting their  programs, operations, and assets.  \u25cf  Enhance FISMA reporting requirements. Periodic reporting of  performance measures for FISMA requirements and related analyses  provides valuable information on the status and progress of agency  efforts to implement effective security management programs.", "In previous reports, we have recommended that OMB improve  FISMA reporting by clarifying reporting instructions and requesting  IGs to report on the quality of additional performance metrics. OMB  has taken steps to enhance its reporting instructions. For example,  OMB added questions regarding incident detection and assessments  of system inventory. However, the current metrics do not measure  how effectively agencies are performing various activities. Current  performance measures offer limited assurance of the quality of  agency processes that implement key security policies, controls, and  practices. For example, agencies are required to test and evaluate  the effectiveness of the controls over their systems at least once a  year and to report on the number of systems undergoing such tests.  However, there is no measure of the quality of agencies\u2019 test and  evaluation processes. Similarly, OMB\u2019s reporting instructions do not  address the quality of other activities such as risk categorization,  security awareness training, intrusion detection and prevention, or  incident reporting. OMB has recognized the need for assurance of  quality for agency processes. For example, it specifically requested  that the IGs evaluate the certification and accreditation process. The  qualitative assessments of the process allows the IG to rate its  agency\u2019s certification and accreditation process using the terms  \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d \u201cpoor,\u201d or \u201cfailing.\u201d Providing  information on the quality of the processes used to implement key  control activities would further enhance the usefulness of the  annually reported data for management and oversight purposes.", "We also previously reported that OMB\u2019s reporting guidance and  performance measures did not include complete reporting on  certain key FISMA-related activities. For example, FISMA requires  each agency to include policies and procedures in its security  program that ensure compliance with minimally acceptable system  configuration requirements, as determined by the agency. In our  report on patch management, we stated that maintaining up-to-date  patches is key to complying with this requirement. As such, we  recommended that OMB address patch management in its FISMA  reporting instructions. Although OMB addressed patch management  in its 2004 FISMA reporting instructions, it no longer requests this  information. As a result, OMB and the Congress lack information  that could identify governmentwide issues regarding patch  management. This information could prove useful in demonstrating  whether or not agencies are taking appropriate steps for protecting  their systems.  \u25cf  Consider conducting FISMA-mandated annual independent  evaluations in accordance with audit standards or a common  approach and framework. We previously reported that the annual  IG FISMA evaluations lacked a common approach and that the  scope and methodology of the evaluations varied across agencies.  For example:  \u25cf  IGs stated that they were unable to conduct evaluations of their  respective agency\u2019s inventory because the information provided  to them by the agency at that time was insufficient (i.e.  incomplete or unavailable).  \u25cf  IGs reported interviewing officials and reviewing agency  documentation, while others indicated conducting tests of  implementation plans (e.g. security plans).  \u25cf  IGs indicated in the scope and methodology sections of their  reports that their reviews were focused on selected components,  whereas others did not make any reference to the breadth of  their review.  \u25cf  Reports were solely comprised of a summary of relevant  information security audits conducted during the fiscal year,  while others included additional evaluation that addressed  specific FISMA-required elements, such as risk assessments and  remedial actions.  \u25cf  The percentage of systems reviewed was varied. Twenty-two of  24 IGs tested the information security program effectiveness on a  subset of systems; two IGs did not review any systems.  \u25cf  One IG noted that the agency\u2019s inventory was missing certain  web applications and concluded that the agency\u2019s inventory was  only 0-50 percent complete, although the report also noted that,  due to time constraints, the IG had been unable to determine  whether other items were missing.  \u25cf  Two IGs indicated basing a portion of their template submission  solely on information provided to them by the agency, without  conducting further investigation.", "As we previously reported, the lack of a common methodology, or  framework, had culminated in disparities in audit scope,  methodology, and content of the IGs\u2019 annual independent  evaluations. As a result, the collective IG community may be  performing their evaluations without optimal effectiveness and  efficiency. Conducting the evaluations in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards and/or a commonly used  framework or methodology could provide improved effectiveness,  increased efficiency, quality control, and consistency in assessing  whether the agency has an effective information security program.  IGs may be able to use the framework to be more efficient by  focusing evaluative procedures on areas of higher risk and by  following an integrated approach designed to gather evidence  efficiently. Having a documented methodology may also offer  quality control by providing a standardized methodology, which can  help the IG community obtain consistency of application.", "In summary, agencies have reported progress in implementing  control activities, but persistent weaknesses in agency information  security controls threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of federal information and information systems, as  illustrated by the increasing number of reported security incidents.  Opportunities exist to improve information security at federal  agencies. OMB and certain federal agencies have initiated efforts  that are intended to strengthen the protection of federal information  and information systems. Opportunities also exist to enhance  policies and practices related to security control testing and  evaluation and FISMA reporting.  Similarly, a consideration for  strengthening the statutory requirement for the independent annual  evaluations of agency information security programs required by  FISMA could include requiring IGs to conduct the evaluation in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Until such opportunities are seized and fully exploited and the  hundreds of GAO and IG recommendations to mitigate information  security control deficiencies and implement agencywide  information security programs are fully and effectively  implemented, federal information and systems will remain at undue  and unnecessary risk.", "Mr. Chairmen and Members of the Subcommittees, this concludes  my statement.
