Specifically, this report assesses (1) IRS\u2019s overall approach to ensure that innocent spouse cases were being processed in a timely, accurate, and consistent manner; (2) the adequacy of IRS\u2019s procedures to transfer tax liabilities between taxpayers when relief was granted to one of the taxpayers; and (3) IRS\u2019s efforts to evaluate the usefulness of its Innocent Spouse Program Web site to taxpayers.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed Innocent Spouse Program data from IRS\u2019s Innocent Spouse Tracking System (ISTS) and management reports, and we reviewed related policies, procedures, and guidance. We interviewed IRS officials responsible for managing the Innocent Spouse Program as well as officials in IRS\u2019s National Taxpayer Advocate Service Office and Electronic Tax Administration Office and in the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Office of Chief Counsel. We reviewed reports by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) and the taxpayer advocate that addressed innocent spouse issues. We focused on program operations that cover the period March 1999 through December 2001, because this period best reflected the program\u2019s results after the Restructuring Act\u2019s changes and because it covers the period for which performance data were most recently available.

Accordingly, an \u201cinnocent spouse\u201d can be held liable for tax deficiencies assessed after a joint return was filed, even if those liabilities were solely attributable to the actions of the other spouse. However, if certain conditions are met, the innocent spouse may be able to obtain relief from the tax liability. Prior to the Restructuring Act, relief was available to taxpayers but under rather restrictive conditions, such as that certain dollar thresholds for tax underpayments first be met. The Restructuring Act revised the conditions for obtaining innocent spouse relief to make it easier for taxpayers to qualify. The act liberalized the former conditions and added new conditions. Simply stated, the three basic provisions related to innocent spouse relief are as follows:   When the innocent spouse had no knowledge that there was an understatement of tax attributable to erroneous items of the other individual filing the joint return, and considering all facts and circumstances, it would be unfair for IRS to hold the innocent spouse liable for the tax.", "When the innocent spouse otherwise qualifies, he or she may request that the tax deficiency from a jointly filed return be recalculated to include only items allocable to him- or herself.", "When the tax shown on a joint return was not paid with the return, the innocent spouse may obtain \u201cequitable relief\u201d if he or she did not know that the funds intended to pay the tax were not used for that purpose. Equitable relief is also available for understatements of tax for which relief under the above two conditions was not available.", "Each of these three conditions has different eligibility requirements and different types of relief. Appendix III describes in more detail the eligibility requirements for each condition and the factors that IRS is to weigh in deciding whether to grant or deny relief. Relief is generally available to taxpayers for liabilities arising after July 22, 1998, the date that the law was enacted, and for liabilities that arose before that date but remained unpaid as of that date.", "Limited data exist to determine the trend in innocent spouse workload immediately following passage of the Restructuring Act. IRS did not systematically track innocent spouse cases until March 1999, about 8 months after the act was passed. Prior to the Restructuring Act, IRS administered innocent spouse relief as part of its process for examining tax returns and did not keep statistics on the number of cases in which innocent spouse relief was requested or on the disposition of those requests. Nevertheless, according to IRS, because taxpayers were anticipating passage of the Restructuring Act, innocent spouse requests increased from a few cases to about 750 cases in each of the 4 months leading up to the act. During fiscal year 2000, it received, on average, 4,800 cases per month.", "IRS processes innocent spouse cases on the basis of proposed regulations issued in January 2001, which set forth the basic guidelines that its examiners are to use in evaluating taxpayers\u2019 cases to determine whether to grant or deny relief. IRS\u2019s Wage and Investment (W&I) Division is responsible for managing this program. Under procedures adopted in fiscal year 2001, virtually all innocent spouse cases are to be processed by correspondence at IRS\u2019s Centralized Innocent Spouse Operation (Cincinnati processing site) in Covington, Kentucky. Generally, only those cases needing face-to-face contact or that arise in the field are to be handled by field staff, generally tax compliance officers and revenue agents in IRS\u2019s Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE) Division. As discussed later in this report, IRS is phasing in new W&I field staff to work cases needing face-to-face contact with taxpayers.", "Staff at the Cincinnati processing site screen the incoming cases to determine whether they meet the basic eligibility requirements for further processing. These requirements include, among other things, verifying that a joint tax return was filed, that an outstanding tax liability exists, and that the request is for the appropriate tax year. Any request that does not meet the basic requirements is to be judged ineligible for further review and closed through written notification to the taxpayer of the reasons for IRS\u2019s decision. Any case that meets the basic eligibility requirements is to be assigned to an examiner to further review the merits of the taxpayer\u2019s request for relief. IRS is required by law to attempt to contact the other taxpayer who signed the joint tax return, to give him or her an opportunity to participate in the case. IRS generally allows 30 days for the nonrequesting spouse to respond. If a taxpayer files a claim for innocent spouse relief covering more than one tax period or year, IRS evaluates the merits of the claim for each tax year individually to determine whether relief should be granted. Therefore, the claim for each tax year is counted as a separate case. Based on the merits of an individual claim, IRS grants a taxpayer full relief, partial relief, or no relief.", "The examiners evaluate the facts and circumstances of each case and ultimately decide whether full, partial, or no relief should be granted. IRS is required by the Restructuring Act to notify the requesting spouse of its decision on each case and to inform him or her of the right to file an appeal with IRS\u2019s Office of Appeals within 30 days. If the taxpayer does not file an appeal with IRS, or after the appeal is settled, IRS is to send a final determination letter to the requesting spouse and, as required by law, advise the individual of his or her right to appeal IRS\u2019s decision to a federal court within 90 days. IRS\u2019s decision on a case becomes final after the taxpayer exhausts all rights to an IRS appeal or a court review or waives these rights and accepts IRS\u2019s decision. At that time, IRS is required to notify the nonrequesting spouse of the final result.", "To close a case after relief is finally approved, IRS must separate and transfer taxes from the taxpayers\u2019 joint tax account in the amount of the approved relief. IRS procedures require that its staff establish a separate, individual tax account for the taxpayer who was judged responsible for the tax liability and transfer the tax liability to that account. Any joint tax liability that is not part of the relief granted remains a liability of both taxpayers that IRS may collect from either."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To assess IRS\u2019s efforts to ensure that innocent spouse cases were being processed in a timely, accurate, and consistent manner, we reviewed W&I and SB/SE planning documents, ISTS data on the program\u2019s performance, and data from the innocent spouse quality review program, which analyzes samples of closed cases for adherence to procedures and accuracy of decisions. We interviewed IRS\u2019s innocent spouse project manager and staff to obtain information on how the program was managed, and we obtained relevant documentation on the program, including its procedures, policies, and guidance. To further assess the management of the program, we relied on our past reports on managing organizational performance, IRS\u2019s guidance regarding performance management, and other management literature, including the Government Performance and Results Act.

We performed limited accuracy checks on the ISTS database. In September 2001, TIGTA recommended that IRS strengthen its controls over data in the ISTS. IRS subsequently implemented corrective actions to help ensure the accuracy and validity of the ISTS data, including correcting data from prior years. The database that we used reflected these corrections. We did not test the reliability of the other IRS databases used in our analysis\u2014the Examination Case Reporting System and the Work Planning and Control System\u2014that maintain data on staff hours applied to examination programs, including innocent spouse case processing.

We also compared our published guidance on internal control management for federal agencies with IRS\u2019s procedures. We observed the process that IRS had in place at the Cincinnati processing site for transferring tax liabilities from taxpayers\u2019 joint accounts to their individual accounts.

The compilation excluded those cases that addressed only procedural issues such as whether a court had jurisdiction to hear the case. We also obtained information that was complied from IRS\u2019s Office of Appeals database on innocent spouse cases scheduled for trial that were settled by the Office of Appeals or Treasury\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel from fiscal year 1999, when IRS began tracking these data, through May 2001.", "We performed our work with IRS\u2019s W&I Division staff and the National Taxpayer Advocate Service\u2019s office at IRS\u2019s national headquarters in Washington, D.C.

The initiatives contributed, along with a decrease in cases received, to IRS\u2019s reaching decisions on more cases than it received in fiscal year 2001.

IRS officials believed that centralization would facilitate more rapid and consistent processing of cases because staff in the centralized processing site would specialize in innocent spouse cases and follow consistent procedures and processes in resolving them. Although IRS was unable to fully implement the decision to centralize processing in the years immediately following the act\u2019s passage, over time IRS made considerable progress in doing so.", "IRS does not have good data on staff usage before fiscal year 2000, but in fiscal year 2000, staffing totaled 887 full-time equivalents (FTE) with 768 FTEs (about 86 percent) coming from SB/SE field staff and 119 FTEs coming from W&I staff in the centralized processing site. As table 1 shows, however, in fiscal year 2001, IRS increased the FTEs for W&I\u2019s centralized processing and decreased the field staffing. IRS projects that by fiscal year 2003, about 70 percent of the FTEs used in processing innocent spouse cases will be in W&I\u2019s centralized processing site.", "In addition to increasing its centralized staffing levels, IRS has improved the capability of the staff. IRS upgraded some examiner positions from grade level GS-7 to GS-8, owing to concerns about attrition, and trained some examiners to specialize in working complex cases that would previously have been sent to field offices. For instance, some of the Cincinnati examiners have been trained to handle cases involving bankruptcies. By the end of fiscal year 2001, IRS had 157 employees at the Cincinnati processing site, with 56 employees examining cases and 30 employees screening cases to determine whether they met the basic eligibility requirements for relief. The remaining employees were supervisors, case quality reviewers, and clerical staff.", "In general, the staff assigned to process cases in the centralized processing site are at lower grades\u2014predominantly GS-8\u2014than are the SB/SE staff processing innocent spouse cases in the field.

TRRs are to perform a variety of services at IRS field locations throughout the country. By using the W&I Division\u2019s TRRs, the innocent spouse project manager hopes to further reduce reliance on the SB/SE Division\u2019s field staff. Program officials said that their lack of control over SB/SE field staff was one reason why field cases take longer to resolve than cases processed centrally. IRS expects that TRR involvement in the program will be minimal, as the agency expects to process 95 percent of the cases centrally during fiscal year 2003.

The ICP, which was implemented in January 2001 at the Cincinnati processing site, uses a computer program to direct examiners through a series of questions leading to a decision about what, if any, relief is due to the taxpayer. The algorithm was designed to capture all of the factors that must be considered in making these determinations. The ICP also automatically prompts the examiner to create a documented case file so that IRS can be better assured that examiners\u2019 decisions are properly supported. The ICP is intended to increase the accuracy and consistency of determinations, since it is designed to help ensure that examiners consider all pertinent aspects of a taxpayer\u2019s case in accordance with the law. The ICP was expected to increase the speed of case processing, because, among other reasons, examiners would have all of the criteria for decision making available on-line and the structured process for guiding decisions should result in fewer examiner errors.", "IRS is planning future enhancements to the ICP that would make it easier for examiners to access and update taxpayer data.

IRS uses the model to estimate the numbers of staff that it will need in the field and at the Cincinnati processing site to process enough cases to result in a targeted level of cases at the end of the fiscal year. The model helped IRS to gauge the amount of progress that it could make in reducing its inventory of cases, assuming differing mixes in the numbers of staff available in Cincinnati and the field.", "According to the innocent spouse project manager, the model provides a reasonable basis for planning and leads to improved staff allocations, but it is not expected to be precise. The project manager said that the projected case closures that are derived from the model estimates become part of the W&I Division\u2019s business and operating plans for the given fiscal year.", "The model begins with the existing inventory, adds projections of new cases expected to be received during the period in question, and estimates the number of cases that will be in inventory at the end of the period, given assumptions about the number of staff who will be available and their productivity in handling cases. IRS\u2019s estimates of new cases likely to be received are based largely on prior experience and professional judgment. Staff requirements are projected on the basis of the percentage of cases that IRS estimates will be processed centrally versus in the field and on the types, numbers, and productivity of staff at these locations. For example, in fiscal year 2001, IRS estimated that the examiners at the centralized site could process about 14 cases per week, spending about 2.9 hours per case; this estimation was based in part on data from IRS\u2019s Work Planning and Control System and assumed productivity increases. For cases processed in the field, IRS used actual time from IRS\u2019s Examination Case Reporting System that showed that tax compliance officers were processing a case in about 5.6 hours and revenue agents were processing a case in about 13 hours. IRS estimated that the new TRRs would require about the same amount of time to process a case as do tax compliance officers.", "To test the functioning of the model, we analyzed the assumptions in IRS\u2019s model as of November 2001 against recent performance data to confirm whether IRS would be likely to reduce its inventory of cases and reach the inventory level that it had projected for the end of fiscal year 2003. Our analysis showed that examiners at the centralized site had not been as productive as IRS believed. We determined that IRS would have to add the equivalent of 16 FTEs or become about 17 percent more efficient to achieve its projected ending inventory level for fiscal year 2003. Our analysis did not consider the productivity levels of field staff who are projected to close about 5 percent of cases. We recognize that other factors may also affect IRS\u2019s ability to meet its targeted inventory levels, such as unexpected changes in the volume of new cases, the proportion of cases processed centrally versus in the field, and the productivity of field staff.", "IRS revises the projections from its model routinely as new data show changes in the volume of cases being received and in the productivity of staff. Subsequent to our test of the model, IRS revised its inventory projection using lower assumptions about examiners\u2019 productivity. Table 2 shows IRS\u2019s inventory projections for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 as of February 2002.

Staff assigned to the quality review function assess the sampled cases using quality standards developed especially for the review. The standards are structured to evaluate whether examiners have followed all of the required processes for an innocent spouse case as well as whether the decision made by the examiner was correct. Adherence to process requirements is reviewed both to ensure compliance with legally required procedures, such as notifying the nonrequesting spouse and giving the individual an opportunity to participate in the case, and because the adherence to required process steps is expected to lead to better IRS decisions about the requested relief. The accuracy of decisions is reviewed to provide IRS data on the accuracy and consistency of decisions made in the diverse offices handling innocent spouse cases.", "Originally, the quality review staff included SB/SE Division revenue agents at grade levels GS-11 through GS-13.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, however, the quality review results reflected better performance. During that quarter, the quality review staff agreed with 100 percent of the decisions to grant and deny relief made for the sample of cases from the centralized processing site. For all field locations combined, the reviewers agreed with 93 percent of the decisions made. However, owing to the small sample size, the quarterly results may not be indicative of results over a longer period.

The decline in cases received during fiscal year 2001 also contributed to IRS\u2019s ability to reduce its inventory of cases.", "Table 4 shows that for the first year since the Restructuring Act was passed, IRS reached a decision on more cases than it received. IRS decided 61,423 cases in fiscal year 2001, or about 21 percent more than the 50,840 cases it received, reducing some of the backlog from previous years. IRS received about 12 percent fewer cases in fiscal year 2001 than in fiscal year 2000, which contributed to its ability to reach decisions on more cases than it received. Appendix VI shows the disposition of resolved cases for fiscal years 1999 through 2001.", "However, the decline in cases received does not fully account for IRS\u2019s progress in reducing its inventory of undecided cases. The resulting increase in productivity appears to be largely attributable to IRS\u2019s strategy of centralizing case processing in Cincinnati, but it may be partly due to the use of the ICP and to general improvements in how IRS handles innocent spouse cases.", "As table 5 shows, IRS has shifted an increasing portion of cases to the Cincinnati processing site. Because Cincinnati staff reach decisions on cases about four times faster than field office staff, IRS has realized an overall gain in productivity, which rose, on average, from 60 cases per FTE to 82 cases per FTE, or by 37 percent, between fiscal years 2000 and 2001. In fiscal year 2000, field office examiners took, on average, about 11.7 hours to make a determination on a case, compared with about 3.1 hours per case for examiners at the Cincinnati processing site. Similarly, in fiscal year 2001, field office examiners took, on average, about 10.5 hours per case, compared with 2.5 hours per case at the Cincinnati processing site.", "Because IRS expects to shift 95 percent of innocent spouse cases to the Cincinnati processing site, where cases are processed faster, by the end of fiscal year 2003, additional gains in overall productivity are expected. These projected productivity gains, coupled with IRS\u2019s expectation that new case receipts will remain fairly close to the volume received in 2001, result in the significant estimated reduction in total staffing for the Innocent Spouse Program shown in table 1. If this reduction is achieved, IRS will have reduced overall staffing for the Innocent Spouse Program by 75 percent between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2003 and will have redirected hundreds of tax compliance officers and revenue agents to their traditional duties.", "To some extent, IRS also was able to reach decisions on more innocent spouse cases than it received in fiscal year 2001 because the portion of innocent spouse cases it receives that are not eligible for relief has been increasing. As a percentage of cases received, those determined to be ineligible rose from about 13 percent in fiscal year 1999 to 45 percent in fiscal year 2000 and to 56.5 percent in fiscal year 2001. Most requests for innocent spouse relief that are not eligible\u2014for instance, because the taxpayers did not file a joint return in the year for which relief is requested\u2014are identified during screenings at the Cincinnati processing site. Officials estimated that, on average, staff who screen cases at the Cincinnati site need about 30 minutes per case to determine whether a taxpayer\u2019s request meets the basic eligibility requirements. In general, 80 percent or more of the cases found to be ineligible for relief are identified during case screening; the remainder are found to be ineligible during case processing either at the Cincinnati site or by field staff.", "Although, in general, determining whether a case is ineligible does not require a significant amount of IRS time, agency officials are concerned about the portion of cases received that do not meet basic eligibility requirements. As a result, they have made revisions to forms and attempted to better inform tax practitioners of the innocent spouse eligibility requirements. In addition, IRS\u2019s Web site, which is discussed later in this report, includes information on the Innocent Spouse Program that is intended to help taxpayers determine their eligibility. Appendix IV provides more information on ineligible cases.", "The improvements that IRS has realized in handling innocent spouse cases and in reducing its inventory of undecided cases have occurred while the agency has maintained or increased the accuracy of relief decisions. As the data in table 3 illustrate, IRS\u2019s reviewers have concurred with the case decision in a growing proportion of cases over time. Moreover, although this example reflects only the results during the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, the quality review staff agreed 100 percent of the time with the sample of case decisions pulled from the centralized processing site. This was the first quality measurement that reflected use of the ICP system and staffing enhancements at the centralized site.", "IRS was not successful through fiscal year 2001 in reducing the average time to reach a decision on whether relief would be granted or to reach closure on cases, including all required notices, appeals, and transfers of taxpayers\u2019 liabilities when full or partial relief was granted.

IRS views balanced measures as its primary means for assessing organizational performance. The three balanced measures\u2014 customer service, employee satisfaction, and business results\u2014are to be considered when setting objectives, establishing goals, assessing progress and results, and evaluating performance. Business results measures are to reflect both quantity and quality.", "W&I stated in its October 2001 business performance review guidance that one of the keys to meeting future division objectives is the use of balanced measures to achieve target levels of performance at lower levels within the division. The performance measures are to be aligned with the strategic goals that the programs support. Other IRS management guidance such as IRS\u2019s Strategic Planning, Budgeting, and Performance Management Process Manager\u2019s Guide instructs programs that report to operating units, such as divisions, to develop measures, with designated performance targets, for use in evaluating progress toward achieving IRS\u2019s mission and long-term goals. Performance measures and associated target performance levels that are explicitly stated and that conform to IRS\u2019s goals form the basis for communicating desired outcomes to program staff. Further, such measures and targets form the basis for assessing progress, identifying and addressing performance shortfalls, and holding managers and staff accountable for achieving results.", "The W&I strategic plan has only one explicit performance measure for the Innocent Spouse Program, the number of cases closed in a fiscal year, which reflects only the business results quantity component of IRS\u2019s balanced approach to measuring performance. Data for the number of cases closed provides some useful information on the performance of the program. However, this one measure fails to address other dimensions of performance. For example, it does not address timeliness and quality, which relate both to business results and to the customer satisfaction component of IRS\u2019s balanced approach. Striving to achieve a specific number of case closings in a year could come at the expense of higher- quality decisions, which is why IRS\u2019s performance management system stresses the need for balanced performance measures. Although timeliness and quality measures and targets have not been adopted for the Innocent Spouse Program, the W&I strategic plan for fiscal years 2001 to 2003 recognizes that a measure of timeliness is needed and states that IRS is to establish such a measure.", "Although IRS does not have performance measures or targets for timeliness and quality in the Innocent Spouse Program, the agency is gathering data that can be used in developing such measures and targets. Within its ISTS, IRS already flags innocent spouse cases that have remained unusually long in any processing stage. Beginning in fiscal year 2002, for all cases that are processed centrally, IRS will begin recording in ISTS the actual staff time used to close each case. In addition, IRS has developed estimates of the time to process a case under optimal circumstances. Program officials told us that the estimated times are used for benchmarking actual processing times but are not goals. The records of staff time to close each case and initial efforts to define benchmarks for case timeliness should therefore provide data that IRS can analyze in developing an appropriate performance measure, as well as a desired target level, for case-processing timeliness.", "IRS had a performance measure for case quality as well as target levels of acceptable quality, but the agency recently dropped its performance target. IRS collects information on the quality of innocent spouse case determinations that derives from its quality review process, which samples closed cases. In fiscal years 2000 and 2001, IRS\u2019s quality goals for the Innocent Spouse Program were that the reviewers would concur with the examiners\u2019 decisions in 85 and 90 percent, respectively, of the sampled cases. In January 2002, the project manager told us that their goal should be the attainment of each quality standard for all cases and that they would no longer specify a quality goal as a percentage of cases meeting the quality standards. Accordingly, although IRS will continue to measure case quality, it no longer plans to include a specific performance measure and performance target for the quality of innocent spouse cases in its strategic or operating plans.", "In discussing the program\u2019s performance measures and targets, the project manager said that the Innocent Spouse Program is small in comparison with other IRS programs and that consideration needs to be given to how much effort should be expended in developing performance measures and targets. Because data are being collected that could be used in developing timeliness and case quality performance measures and targets, the required effort should not be too great.", "In March 2002, program officials told us that by the end of fiscal year 2003, IRS plans to have collected survey data relating to innocent spouse customer satisfaction that will enable it to develop related performance measures and targets.

The guidance advises agencies to employ a combination of actions such as edit checks for controlling data entry and reconciliation of account totals. For authorization control, the guidance advises agencies to use key source documents with authorizing signatures, batch control sheets, and independent reviews of data before the data are entered into the system. The guidance instructs agencies to design their data entry processes to provide for editing and validating data and for output reports.", "IRS\u2019s procedures for transferring tax liabilities in innocent spouse cases employ a variety of processes to control for accuracy and completeness. For example, IRS requires that the document with the final authorizing signature approving the taxpayer\u2019s request for relief be the key document used to start the transfer process. The procedures require that an employee who was not involved in deciding the case perform edit checks and verify the information on the approval document by comparing it with the taxpayer\u2019s account information. Further, IRS procedures require that a worksheet be prepared to document, verify, review, and reconcile the accuracy of account adjustments before any changes are made to the tax accounts. The worksheet is required to include specific instructions for the data entry personnel to use when making the tax account adjustments, such as the exact dollar amount of tax liability to be transferred from the joint account to a separate, individual account and the specific transaction codes required by IRS\u2019s information systems to enter the changes. Staff are required to include documentation in the case files as evidence that the required tasks were completed. The procedures require that Accounting staff from a separate unit verify, reconcile, and record tax account adjustments in a journal before they are made. After the adjustments are made, Customer Account Service staff are to certify that the adjustments were made in accordance with IRS\u2019s guidelines.", "On the basis of our review of IRS\u2019s procedures and our inspection of the process used at the Cincinnati processing site for transferring tax liabilities when innocent spouse relief was approved, we concluded that the procedures conform with the federal guidance for managing information processing. If IRS staff reconcile, edit, and verify the account information as they are required to do, the adjustments to transfer the tax liabilities should be made correctly. However, we did not independently test a sample of closed cases, and therefore we cannot determine the extent to which IRS staff actually performed the required control activities.

Absent unforeseen significant increases in the innocent spouse caseload, IRS appears to be positioned to make material additional improvements in reducing the inventory of cases at the same time that it redirects hundreds of employees to perform other work. To date, these improvements have not resulted in reduced average times for making case decisions and completing cases. However, improvement in the timeliness of case processing should be realized as inventory levels decrease and work is shifted to IRS\u2019s centralized processing center.", "Although program improvements have been, and should continue to be, realized, IRS lacks a balanced set of measures for the Innocent Spouse Program that would help ensure that future performance does not inappropriately concentrate on one aspect of performance at the expense of others. IRS\u2019s only performance measure for the Innocent Spouse Program focuses on business results\u2014that is, the number of cases closed. Because IRS is collecting information relevant to other dimensions of its performance, such as timeliness and case quality, developing performance measures and target levels for performance should not be burdensome for this relatively small IRS program.", "IRS established its Innocent Spouse Program Web site to help educate taxpayers about eligibility requirements for the program.
