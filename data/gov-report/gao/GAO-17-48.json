DFAST encompasses stress tests required by the Dodd-Frank Act. CCAR comprises a qualitative assessment of firms' capital planning processes and a quantitative assessment of firms' ability to maintain sufficient capital to continue operations under stress. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness and burden of requiring two stress test programs. GAO was asked to review these programs and their effectiveness. This report examines how the stress test programs compare, the CCAR qualitative assessment, and the design of the stress test scenarios and models.", "GAO analyzed Federal Reserve documents including rules, guidance, and internal policies and procedures on DFAST and CCAR implementation and assessed practices against federal internal control standards and other criteria. GAO also interviewed Federal Reserve staff and officials of 19 banking institutions selected based on characteristics such as their size, prior stress test participation, and history of CCAR results."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) has two related supervisory programs that involve stress testing but serve different purposes. Stress tests are hypothetical exercises that assess the potential impact of economic, financial, or other scenarios on the financial performance of a company. Stress tests of banking institutions typically evaluate if the institutions have sufficient capital to remain solvent under stressful economic conditions.", "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) implements statutory stress test requirements, known as the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST) for Federal Reserve-supervised banking institutions with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. DFAST projects how banking institutions' capital levels would fare in hypothetical stressful economic and financial scenarios. It applies to a broad range of banking institutions and consists of supervisory- and company-run stress tests that produce capital adequacy information for firms' internal use and for public disclosure.", "The Federal Reserve also conducts a Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which uses DFAST information to assess the capital adequacy (a quantitative assessment) and capital planning processes (a qualitative assessment) for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. CCAR generally does not require additional stress tests and uses the same data, models, and projections used for DFAST.", "While the primary purpose of DFAST is to produce and disclose comparable information on the financial condition of banking institutions (the stress test results), the Federal Reserve uses CCAR to make supervisory assessments and decisions about the capital adequacy plans (including proposed capital actions such as dividend payments) of large bank holding companies. For example, the Federal Reserve may object to a company's plan if stress test results show the company's post-stress capital ratios (regulatory measures that indicate how much capital is available to cover unexpected losses) falling below required minimum levels or if the Federal Reserve's qualitative assessment deems the firm's capital planning and related processes inadequate. An objection can result in restrictions on a firm's capital distributions. Several of the companies GAO interviewed that are subject to Federal Reserve stress tests identified benefits from the tests (such as overall improvements in risk management and capital planning) and also identified costs (including for staff resources and other expenditures necessary to conduct the tests and meet the Federal Reserve's supervisory expectations).", "GAO found limitations in the Federal Reserve's stress test programs that could hinder their effectiveness.", "Qualitative assessment disclosure and communication. The Federal Reserve uses a framework with multiple levels of review to assess qualitative CCAR submissions that helps ensure consistency, but it has not disclosed information needed to fully understand its assessment approach or the reasons for decisions to object to a company's capital plan. Transparency is a key feature of accountability and such incomplete disclosure may limit understanding of the CCAR assessments and hinder public and market confidence in the program and the extent to which the Federal Reserve can be held accountable for its decisions. Federal internal control standards state the importance of relevant and timely communications with external stakeholders. The Federal Reserve has not regularly updated guidance to firms about supervisory expectations and peer practices related to the qualitative assessment. For example, it has not published observations of leading capital planning practices used in CCAR since 2014. The limited communication can pose challenges to companies that must meet these expectations annually and could hinder the achievement of CCAR goals.", "Scenario design. The Federal Reserve has a framework for designing stress test scenarios but its analysis of some key design decisions has been limited. For example, the Federal Reserve has not conducted analyses to determine whether the single severe scenario it uses for the supervisory stress test is sufficient to accomplish DFAST and CCAR goals. While there are advantages to using one scenario\u2014including simplicity and transparency\u2014many different types of financial crises are possible, and the single selected scenario does not reflect a fuller range of possible outcomes. Without additional analysis, the Federal Reserve cannot be reasonably assured that banks are resilient against a range of future risks. The Federal Reserve also has not explicitly analyzed how to balance the choice of severity\u2014and its influence on the resiliency of the banking system\u2014with any impact on the cost and availability of credit, which could limit its ability to avoid undesired economic effects from scenario design choices.", "Model risk management. Federal Reserve supervisory guidance for banking institutions states that risk from individual models and also from the aggregate system of models should be managed. The Federal Reserve makes supervisory decisions based on the results of its own stress test models, but its management of model risk\u2014the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs\u2014has not focused on its system of models that produce stress test results. To estimate the effect of stress test scenarios on companies' ability to maintain capital, the Federal Reserve has developed individual component models that predict a company's financial performance in the scenarios. The results of these component models are combined with assumed or planned capital actions of companies and form the system of models used by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has an oversight structure for developing and using models in the supervisory stress tests but its own risk-management efforts have not targeted the system of models. For example, it has not conducted sensitivity and uncertainty analyses\u2014important elements in the Federal Reserve's model risk management guidance\u2014of how its modeling decisions affected overall results. Without such a focus, the Federal Reserve's ability to effectively evaluate and manage model risk and uncertainty from the entire system of stress test models will be limited. Understanding and communicating this uncertainty is critical because the outcome of the CCAR assessment can have significant implications for a company, including limiting its capital actions (such as dividend payments and share repurchases)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 15 recommendations to help improve the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's stress test programs, such as improving disclosures and communications to firms, considering the potential consequences of its scenario design choices, and expanding model risk management to include the entire system of models. The Federal Reserve generally agreed with the recommendations and highlighted select ongoing and future efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 2007\u20132009 financial crisis threatened the stability of the U.S.  financial system and revealed weaknesses in the capital adequacy and  risk-management practices of U.S. banking institutions. Concerns from  market participants and observers about whether banking institutions had  sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and limited information on  institutions\u2019 exposures also contributed to undermining public and market  confidence in the stability of the financial system. Identified shortcomings,  such as a lack of firm-wide stress testing, led banking institutions and  their regulators to reassess capital requirements, risk-management  practices, and other aspects of bank regulation and supervision. A stress  test is a hypothetical exercise for assessing the potential impact of  economic, financial, or other scenarios on a company\u2019s financial  performance.", "To help address such concerns and restore market confidence in the  banking system, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (Federal Reserve) and other federal banking regulators conducted a  stress test in 2009 to determine whether the 19 largest U.S. banking  institutions had enough capital to survive a further economic shock and  continue lending activities. The Federal Reserve designed the 2009  stress tests\u2014known as the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program  (SCAP)\u2014as a one-time exercise to identify institutions with insufficient  capital. It required firms found to have capital shortfalls to raise specific  amounts of additional capital from private markets or, if they were unable  to do so, to receive capital investments from the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury).", "The SCAP exercise was followed by the Federal Reserve\u2019s  Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), conducted  annually since 2011. The Federal Reserve designed CCAR to assess the  capital adequacy and internal capital planning processes of large and  complex bank holding companies (all the institutions that participated in  SCAP participated in the initial CCAR cycle). CCAR also uses a capital  stress test as input to quantitative assessments of an institution\u2019s capital  adequacy under stress, after making its planned capital actions (such as  dividend payments and stock repurchases), and emphasizes qualitative  assessments of the institution\u2019s capital planning processes.", "Between SCAP and the first CCAR, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted in 2010.  Among its regulatory reforms, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal  Reserve to conduct an annual stress test (supervisory stress test) of bank  holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more.  The act also requires each of these companies and all other Federal  Reserve-supervised banking institutions with more than $10 billion in total  consolidated assets to conduct their own stress tests (company-run  stress test). In October 2012, the Federal Reserve initially adopted rules  implementing the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST). The Federal  Reserve completed the initial DFAST exercise in 2013\u2014it conducted  supervisory stress tests of the 18 bank holding companies that had  participated in SCAP, and these companies and their state member bank  subsidiaries performed company-run stress tests. The Federal Reserve  rules delayed implementation for other companies, not part of SCAP, but   subject to DFAST until 2014 or later.", "The number of companies participating in CCAR\u2014which only includes  firms with total consolidated assets greater than $50 billion\u2014has grown to  33 bank holding companies for the 2016 CCAR cycle. These institutions\u2019  holdings represent more than 80 percent of the total assets of the U.S.  banking system. Many additional institutions also have been required to  complete stress tests as part of DFAST. As the programs have grown,  some market participants and observers have raised questions about the  programs\u2019 effectiveness and the costs and consequences for institutions  subject to the tests.", "You asked us to review the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR and DFAST  programs.

These requirements identify various  types of regulatory capital including common equity Tier 1 capital,  additional Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, and total capital. According to  Federal Reserve staff, common equity tier 1 capital is considered the  most significant capital that a banking institution can have to support its  operations and absorb unexpected financial losses. It consists primarily of  retained earnings (the profits a bank has earned but has not paid out to  shareholders in the form of dividends or other distributions) and common  stock, with deductions for items such as goodwill and deferred tax assets.

That is, capital ratios declined less under the company-run  tests than under the Federal Reserve\u2019s, indicating that the companies\u2019  results generally were further from breaching minimum capital  requirements and thus less stressful.", "Federal Reserve staff acknowledged that the inclusion of the company- run tests\u2014specifically the test using the company-designed scenario\u2014in  the CCAR quantitative assessment may provide an incentive for  companies to create less severe stress tests that would not generate  losses large enough to breach minimum regulatory capital requirements.  But, the staff did not believe these negative incentives warranted the  elimination of the company-run stress test and added that the Federal  Reserve could mitigate this risk through its evaluation of companies\u2019  stress testing practices\u2014including their scenarios and models\u2014in the  CCAR qualitative assessment. However, stress test modeling and  scenario design involve considerable judgment and companies could  make subtle changes that would not indicate manipulation or necessarily  fail to meet Federal Reserve standards. Federal Reserve staff told us that  the company-designed scenario provided an additional view on risk that  increased the variety of stresses to which companies were subject under  CCAR.", "In addition, Federal Reserve guidance for the largest and most complex  companies indicates that the firms should have more sophisticated  models for their most material portfolios than for portfolios that are less  significant. However, because the company-run tests typically produced  higher post-stress capital ratios, they may not have meaningfully  contributed to the CCAR quantitative assessment. Furthermore, in  discussing why the Federal Reserve does not require disclosure of results  based on company-designed scenarios with Federal Reserve staff, they  explained that with a requirement to disclose such results, firms might  focus on producing positive results rather than using the scenario to  genuinely identify their most salient risks. Using the company-run test  results (from supervisory and company-designed scenarios) in the  quantitative assessment creates similar conflicting incentives for  companies, which could limit the benefits of the tests and the  achievement of Federal Reserve goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CCAR Qualitative Assessments", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Reserve also uses DFAST-related information in its CCAR  qualitative assessments, which we discuss in additional detail later in this  report.

The staff said that the CCAR qualitative assessment is a  primary contributor to overall supervision and a focal point for evaluating  a company\u2019s risk-management and internal controls.

In addition to the Federal Reserve, the Dodd-Frank  Act called for certain financial regulatory agencies, including OCC and  FDIC, to issue rules requiring the financial companies they supervise with  more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets to conduct stress  tests. OCC and FDIC rules apply to certain banks and savings  associations, some of which may have a holding company subject to the  Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test rules. The act required the agencies to  coordinate their stress test rules so that they are consistent and  comparable. In 2012, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC each  adopted substantively similar rules implementing this requirement. For  example, the agencies\u2019 rules have similar reporting time frames, public  disclosure requirements, and stress test methodologies and practices.", "However, OCC has made greater use of supervisory flexibility in  implementing the stress test requirements. Each agency\u2019s rule allows for  the acceleration or extension of time frame requirements, while OCC\u2019s  and FDIC\u2019s rules also include provisions for them to modify any or all of  the stress test requirements. Furthermore, OCC staff stated that the  agency had interpreted the Dodd-Frank Act as not requiring all banking  institutions within a bank holding company to conduct separate stress  tests. But according to information from the Federal Reserve and FDIC,  banking institutions covered by their rules are required to conduct stress  tests regardless of their status within a holding company structure.", "Each of the agencies extended the time frames for a limited number of  firms.  As shown in table 4, the Federal Reserve provided five firms with  extensions of time\u2014ranging from 3 to 12 months\u2014to conduct and report  the results of required company-run stress tests.", "FDIC provided a 1-year extension to two firms for the first stress test  cycle in 2013, as shown in table 5.", "OCC has granted more stress test extensions than FDIC and the Federal  Reserve and is the only agency to have approved exemptions from stress  test requirements. OCC issued 14 1-year extensions\u2014including one firm  that received 3 consecutive extensions\u2014and 2 shorter extensions for  stress test cycles from 2013 to 2016 (see table 6). Three firms were  granted stress test exemptions for one or more of the stress test cycles  from 2013 to 2016 including a firm that had been exempted for three  cycles. The firms OCC exempted were part of a larger banking  organization in which both the parent holding company and affiliated bank  were required to conduct stress tests.", "The reasons cited for granting extensions and exemptions varied among  the regulators. The time extensions issued by the Federal Reserve and  FDIC generally occurred in the initial stress test cycles to allow additional  time for firms to implement effective stress testing systems and compile  necessary data. Most of the Federal Reserve\u2019s extensions were technical  in nature. One firm reduced its total consolidated assets below the $10  billion threshold and represented that it intended to maintain its assets  below the threshold for the foreseeable future. Others involved mergers,  including an institution that had made a business transaction based on  the timing set forth in the Federal Reserve\u2019s original stress test rules,  which were subsequently revised resulting in the institution being subject  to the requirements sooner than expected. Federal Reserve and FDIC  staff stated that they based their determinations for granting extensions  on applicable regulatory provisions and the relevant facts and  circumstances of the particular case. OCC also issued extensions to  provide institutions that had not previously been subject to regulatory  stress test requirements with additional time to construct or enhance their  stress testing frameworks. OCC staff noted that such institutions lacked  the necessary infrastructure to complete a stress test submission at the  time its final rule was implemented.", "OCC granted extensions and exemptions from stress test requirements  for different reasons. For example, according to OCC staff and  documents we reviewed, OCC granted extensions and exemptions based  on the extent of an institution\u2019s activities, its relative size within a large  bank holding company, and if the larger entities in the holding company  structure\u2014such as the lead bank and parent holding company\u2014were  subject to stress test requirements. The bases for the extensions and  exemptions also included OCC\u2019s conclusions about the satisfactory  nature of an institution\u2019s financial condition and capital levels and the  nature of its business activities and strategies.", "Our prior work on financial regulatory reform identified an important  characteristic of consistent financial oversight\u2014that similar institutions  and risks, among other areas, should be subject to consistent regulation,  oversight, and transparency\u2014to help minimize negative competitive  outcomes while harmonizing oversight. Without a consistent approach to  the implementation of the stress test rules, regulators may not be  regulating financial institutions that pose similar risks similarly, which  could contribute to competitive disadvantages between institutions and  inconsistent oversight of risk management. Additionally, financial  institutions often have options for how to operate their business which  affects who will be their regulator.

Several  companies noted costs from integrating or upgrading stress test-related  technology and risk-management systems and the vast amounts of  detailed data needed to complete the stress tests. Many firms pointed to  expenditures for consultants to assist with their stress testing efforts.  Officials from one CCAR firm said that they hire consultants for many  tasks including modeling, documentation, and technical writing; another  firm cited the risk-identification process and model risk management as  two main drivers of consulting expenditures. Some firms also stressed  that competition among companies for qualified staff to perform stress  testing had increased the cost of individuals with quantitative skills and  modeling expertise.

In practice, the Federal  Reserve has increased the unemployment rate in the severely adverse  scenario by 4 percentage points in each year from 2013 to 2015 and by 5  percentage points to reach the 10 percent minimum in the 2016 scenario.  Federal Reserve staff stated that a 3\u20135 percentage point increase and a  10 percent unemployment rate minimum were consistent with postwar  historical recessions and provided a reasonable basis for determining the  overall severity of the severely adverse scenario. In discussing the 2015  severely adverse scenario, which had a peak unemployment rate of 10  percent, staff indicated that a higher or lower unemployment rate\u2014for  example, 9 percent or 12 percent\u2014would be difficult to justify based on  historical precedent. In particular, staff noted that a 12 percent  unemployment rate has never been seen in postwar U.S. history. Also, it  would have required an unprecedented 7 percentage point increase in the  unemployment rate. Similarly, staff noted that a 9 percent unemployment  rate would be relatively low compared to severe U.S. recessions. In other  aspects of scenario design, in contrast, Federal Reserve policy is  cognizant of the possibility that scenarios may produce risks that appear  together in ways that could be outside of historical experience\u2014and  Federal Reserve Staff noted that supervisory scenarios have featured  combinations of risks that have not occurred historically. Federal Reserve  staff also noted that the cumulative severity associated with multiple,  simultaneously stressed scenario variables could exceed historical  postwar severity. However, the Federal Reserve\u2019s scenario design policy  and process are focused on selecting economic conditions that reflect the  severity of postwar U.S. recessions. Without proactively considering  levels of severity outside postwar U.S. historical experience, the Federal  Reserve could miss opportunities to assess and guard against relevant  but unprecedented risks to the banking system. For example, if scenario  severity decisions had been made in the pre-crisis period based solely on  historical conditions that had prevailed prior to 2006, any associated  stress tests would have dramatically underestimated subsequent events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Reserve Has Not Assessed Certain Trade-offs Associated with Scenario Severity", "paragraphs": ["According to Federal Reserve staff and our review of internal documents,  the Federal Reserve has not explicitly analyzed how to balance the  choice of the severity of the severely adverse scenario\u2014and its influence  on the resiliency of the banking system\u2014with any impact on the cost and  availability of credit. The overall severity of a stress scenario will affect  how much capital that participating bank holding companies would need  to hold to avoid an objection from the CCAR quantitative assessment and  make planned capital distributions. Furthermore, a more severe scenario  might induce companies to raise additional capital in the short term\u2014and  potentially pass costs on to borrowers\u2014but increase the resiliency of the  banking system over the long term.", "OMB guidance states that regulatory analysis\u2014a tool regulatory agencies  use to anticipate and evaluate the likely consequences of rules\u2014should  be based on the best available scientific, technical, and economic  information. While the Federal Reserve is not legally required to follow  this guidance, it provides a strong set of analytical practices relevant to  significant supervisory and regulatory exercises such as CCAR\u2014and  scenario design is a key element of CCAR. Research by the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)\u2014an international  standard-setting organization for bank regulation\u2014on the potential  economic impact of capital requirements provides an example of how the  Federal Reserve could use available information to help assess the  appropriate degree of severity in stress tests.

Moreover,  Federal Reserve staff said that the scenarios were designed to match the  severity of historical recessions, which assesses the resilience of the  banking system and would allow companies to function through a severe  recession. However, without more careful assessment of scenario  severity, the Federal Reserve cannot be reasonably assured that the  scenario design process balances any improvements in the resiliency of  the banking system with any impact on the cost and availability of credit.

The CCAR quantitative assessment is based on more than one severe scenario, but the Federal Reserve  designs only one of them. Participating institutions design an additional  severe scenario, which is intended to reflect particular risks that might  differ from the supervisory scenario in substantive ways. The company- designed scenario is implemented with a different capital action  assumption, which limits its comparability to other CCAR stress tests. We  discussed potential incentive problems associated with company-run  CCAR stress tests earlier in the report.", "There are advantages and disadvantages associated with reliance on a  single severe supervisory scenario, as the Federal Reserve does with the  supervisory stress tests. Advantages could include simplicity,  transparency, and resource use\u2014that is, using a single severe  supervisory scenario simplifies communication and limits the resources  required to design the scenarios and execute and analyze the supervisory  stress tests. While it may be appropriate to use a single severe  supervisory scenario, there are also potential disadvantages or risks  associated with making the CCAR quantitative assessment based on a  single severe supervisory scenario. For example, many different types of  financial crises are possible, and the single selected scenario does not  reflect a fuller range of possible outcomes. Similarly, IMF principles for  supervisory stress tests note that future stress periods are uncertain and  could be represented by a range of stress factors, each with a different  likelihood of occurrence. Staff at IMF and Bank for International  Settlements with whom we spoke also identified trade-offs associated  with using one or multiple scenarios. For example, Bank for International  Settlements staff noted that firms might hedge against the primary risks in  a single scenario but not others that also might be relevant. Similarly, IMF  staff said that ideally stress tests would use a large and diverse set of  scenarios but also noted that this would increase cost and complexity.", "Moreover, it is usually necessary to conduct sensitivity analysis to reveal  whether, and to what extent, the results of an analysis are sensitive to  plausible changes in the main assumptions. For the supervisory stress tests and CCAR quantitative assessment, the design and number of  severely adverse scenarios represent key assumptions affecting results.  However, the Federal Reserve has not conducted sensitivity analysis to  determine whether its single severe scenario is sufficient to accomplish  DFAST and CCAR goals. For example, it has not assessed how a range  of severe scenarios may lead to different judgments about the overall  resiliency of the banking system.", "Because it has matched the severity of historical U.S. recessions, Federal  Reserve officials asserted that the severely adverse scenario would  protect against a range of potential crises.

Yet, without assessing the sufficiency of a single severe scenario  in the context of DFAST and CCAR\u2014such as performing sensitivity  analysis involving multiple scenarios\u2014the Federal Reserve is making  CCAR decisions that may not reflect the range of potential crises against  which the banking system would be resilient and the magnitude of the  range of outcomes that might result from different scenarios.

Procyclicality  could, for example, result in firms needing to raise additional capital or  reduce lending during a downturn.", "After the disclosure of 2015 stress test results, Federal Reserve staff  reported to the Board that the supervisory stress tests produced some  procyclical results. Specifically, losses on portfolios of loans to consumers  (such as credit cards or residential mortgages) in the test were procyclical  partly because scenarios had caused the projected losses to shrink as  actual economic conditions improved. Based on analysis conducted after  the scenarios were finalized, Federal Reserve staff said that most of the  decrease in projected losses (compared with the prior year\u2019s stress test)  resulted from improvements in bank balance sheets from the previous  year, although changes to the scenario also contributed to lower  projected losses. Because the scenario contributed to smaller losses as  the economy improved, the scenario could produce larger losses as the  economy deteriorates, lowering post-stress capital ratios and increasing  the amount of capital required to avoid a CCAR objection. Moreover,  because the analysis of the impact of annual scenario changes on losses  occurs only after scenarios have been developed and made public, the  Federal Reserve might learn of procyclical effects too late to take  effective preventive steps\u2014for example by adjusting relevant scenario  variables before scenarios are made final. As a result, Federal Reserve  stress tests could exacerbate future financial stress by increasing  requirements on stress test participants while economic conditions are  deteriorating.", "Such an unintended impact of the supervisory scenario on losses could  emerge because the complexity of the system of models (discussed in  the following section) used by the Federal Reserve makes it difficult to  anticipate the combined effects of changes to 28 scenario variables that  influence the results of multiple supervisory stress test models. Federal  Reserve staff stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s scenario design policy  attempted to avert procyclicality by instituting the 10 percent  unemployment rate minimum, to prevent the unemployment rate from  falling too much in the scenario when the real economy improved and  otherwise allowing the unemployment rate to increase from 3 to 5  percentage points\u2014increasing the unemployment rate more in the  scenario when actual unemployment is low, and raising it less when  actual unemployment is high.

As previously described,  all models reflect some amount of uncertainty and are sensitive to the  assumptions and modeling decisions made during model development.  According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s model risk-management guidance, an  integral element of model development is evaluating model features and  overall functioning to determine whether the model is performing as  intended, including by demonstrating that a model is accurate, robust,  and stable and by assessing potential limitations. The guidance states  that such an evaluation should include assessing the model\u2019s behavior  over a range of input values and evaluating the impact of assumptions\u2014a  type of assessment known as sensitivity analysis. It also notes the  importance of understanding the extent of model uncertainty and  inaccuracy\u2014either quantitatively, such as with the confidence interval  around a statistical estimate, or qualitatively\u2014and accounting for them  appropriately. This type of assessment is known as uncertainty analysis.  The assessments are related as sensitivity analysis tests the effects of  different sources of uncertainty on a model\u2019s output and can help to  identify the greatest sources of uncertainty.", "Model documentation we reviewed included some sensitivity and  uncertainty analyses at the component model level, but we did not find  that any such sensitivity or uncertainty analyses fully considered effects  on the extent of model risk associated with the final post-stress capital  ratios. For example, the analyses did not consider these effects for both  the numerator and denominator of the ratios. As described earlier, a post- stress capital ratio consists of a numerator that reflects the capital held by  the company and a denominator that measures the assets held by a  company (either on a total or risk-weighted basis), both projected for each  quarter of the stress scenario. When considering changes to component  model results (which the Federal Reserve uses as one of their primary  forms of sensitivity analysis), the Federal Reserve identifies the major  inputs that have changed for that model and analyzes the extent to which  changes in the model output can be attributed to each input.", "One way that the Federal Reserve seeks to put the changes in  individual component models in context with each other and with  overall capital ratios is to divide the component model output (for  example, losses or revenues) by the risk-weighted assets of the  company prior to the assets being stressed in the tests. This approach  allows the Federal Reserve to understand the component models\u2019  effects on the numerator of the post-stress capital ratio and to put  individual component model results on a common scale.", "But, some component models also affect the denominator in the post- stress capital ratios. For example, the accrual loan loss models (see  fig. 8) that estimate losses on different portfolios of loans (such as  automobile or commercial loans) also provide an estimate used in  some risk-weighted asset calculations.", "Thus, the Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to sensitivity analysis does not  reflect a full consideration of the effects of a component model\u2019s risk and  uncertainty on that of the post-stress capital ratios.", "Model documentation standards from the Model Oversight Group indicate  that modeling teams should document the empirical performance of a  model to support its validity in projecting stress test losses, including  addressing\u2014such as through sensitivity analysis\u2014how a model\u2019s output  responds to changes in key inputs and parameters. The oversight group  also has issued a guidance memorandum to modeling teams on the types  of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis they are encouraged to conduct  during model development. However, these guidance documents do not  address conducting sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that examine  how modeling decisions affect the overall stress test results. Federal  Reserve staff told us that performing sensitivity and uncertainty analyses  of the system of models was unnecessary because the system was  largely additive\u2014a mathematical feature that ensures that tests on a  component model will fully capture its effects on the system of models\u2014 so that system-wide assessments would be redundant. However, as  discussed already, key interactions exist between component models  such that their joint outcome would not simply be a sum of the component  model outcomes. Federal Reserve staff also explained that performing  sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the system of models\u2014such as  calculating statistical confidence intervals for the post-stress capital  ratios\u2014would be a complex and resource-intensive undertaking, which  may not provide information with a clear use.", "Although the guidance does not address conducting sensitivity and  uncertainty analyses in relation to effects on stress test results, reviewers  from the Model Validation Unit who worked on the 2014 soundness  review of a stress test model used to project asset balances (balances  model) recommended that the modeling team assess the sensitivity of the  post-stress capital ratios to the balances model assumptions. The  balances model is the root model for the entire system of models\u2014it is a  direct or indirect input for almost all other models\u2014and therefore its  design is of particular importance to the accuracy, robustness, and  stability of the supervisory stress test process (see fig. 9). This model  makes assumptions related to market share and portfolio mix for firms  subject to the stress tests.", "As the Model Validation Unit recommended in its review, one way to  assess the appropriateness of the assumptions made in the balances  modeling approach would be to test the effects of alternative assumptions  on the post-stress capital ratios and gauge the potential consequences of  any differences. Federal Reserve staff indicated that the supervisory  modeling team had not tested alternatives to these specific assumptions  because (1) the assumptions implement a policy decision by the Model  Oversight Group, and (2) the assumptions accomplished the policy  decision while remaining consistent with the oversight group principle of  simplicity and transparency. However, basing modeling assumptions on  policy goals does not preclude also assessing their effectiveness in  accomplishing the policy goals or the risk of unintended consequences  through testing the potential effects of alternative assumptions on the  stress test output. As of July 2016, the modeling team had not yet  addressed the recommendation of the validation unit.", "Without assessing risks to the post-stress capital ratios posed by the  Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to modeling, the Federal Reserve limits its  ability to understand, communicate, and manage the risks and reliability  of its supervisory stress test results. For example, the Federal Reserve\u2019s  model risk-management guidance states that a company\u2019s senior  management is responsible for regularly reporting to its board of directors  on significant model risks from individual component models and in the  aggregate. However, Federal Reserve staff are unable to communicate to  the Board of Governors the range and most sources of uncertainty  surrounding the post-stress capital ratio estimates produced by the  system of models because the Federal Reserve has not conducted the  analyses necessary to do so.

It also states that model risk-management policies approved  by the board or its delegates should promote the development of targets  for model accuracy and standards for acceptable levels of discrepancies.", "However, neither the Board of Governors nor high-level management in  Banking Supervision and Regulation have identified model risk tolerances  for component model output or for the overall stress test results. Instead,  Federal Reserve staff said that Model Oversight Group reviews helped to  ensure a consistent approach to model risk. In addition to approving  decisions included in model documentation, the Model Oversight Group  has reviewed options that modeling teams have developed for resolving  identified problems with their models and have presented to the oversight  group. The presentation includes a discussion of the advantages and  disadvantages associated with each option. According to Federal  Reserve documentation, the oversight group will direct the modeling team  to pursue one of the options or continue developing alternatives. Federal  Reserve staff told us that decisions of the Model Oversight Group were  based on the principles they had developed and that they weighed a  modeling team\u2019s options against how well they meet the principles. But it  was not always evident from the documentation what criteria the  oversight group used to make its determination about which option to  pursue. Even if one principle was cited to support a decision, it was not  clear if the option was consistent with other principles, making it difficult to  evaluate the consistency of Model Oversight Group decisions or their  application of predetermined risk tolerances.", "In the absence of explicit direction about risk tolerances, supervisory  modeling teams may make decisions that have consequences for model  risk without evaluating the model risk against set criteria. For instance, it  also was not clear from the documentation we reviewed how much the  Model Oversight Group had learned about the options modeling teams  had considered and rejected before the presentations. In some cases we  reviewed, the modeling teams had fully developed the choices for  resolving model problems and were able to quantitatively compare  differences between the options\u2014which represents a form of sensitivity  analysis and allows for an assessment of the model relative to an explicit  risk tolerance (although it did not appear from the documentation that risk  tolerances were applied in the decision process). In other cases, the  team\u2019s work was at a more preliminary stage and did not include a  quantitative evaluation of the consequences of the options under  consideration.", "Our review of model documentation also suggests that modeling teams  have made model risk tolerance decisions at the individual model level  with no documented reference to the impact of those decisions on other  models or consistency with other modeling decisions. Furthermore,  according to documents we reviewed and discussions with Federal  Reserve staff, the Federal Reserve has not made any efforts to determine  statistical or other thresholds at which each individual model will produce  results within tolerable uncertainty ranges in relation to the post-stress  capital ratio estimates. Instead, some modeling teams appeared to be  implicitly determining what constituted acceptably small variation between  their chosen model\u2019s predictions and the historical data. For example, one  team assessed its model with statistical tests and deemed it reasonable,  providing supporting evidence in charts. There was no discussion of the  criteria the team used to determine their model\u2019s soundness. Based on  the documentation we reviewed, this team did not appear to have made  any calculation of the practical magnitude of the consequences of these  statistical tests. The charts used to show the success of the model show  a 0.1 percentage point difference between actual and predicted values in  the data, in this case default rates of a loan portfolio. The supervisory  modeling team asserted that this was a small difference between  predicted and actual default rates. However, such a difference could have  material consequences for the post-stress capital ratios of companies, as  it represented 12 percent of the total predicted default rate of the  portfolio. Without an articulated risk tolerance, it is not clear whether this  is a large or small difference for the portfolio or the post-stress capital  ratios. As for all component models, this model required the Model  Oversight Group\u2019s approval prior to going into production. However, the  oversight group\u2019s review and approval is not a substitute for an identified  risk tolerance as required by the Federal Reserve\u2019s standards.", "In addition, the model documentation we reviewed indicated that some  supervisory modeling teams tested other individual models in addition to those they reported in the documentation. The undocumented models  generally failed to meet statistical or other tests for determining which  models would be included in the documentation. But this may lead  modeling teams to reject models with attributes that would be desirable at  the systems level and the decisions might not be transparent to the Model  Oversight Group due to lack of documentation.", "According to Federal Reserve staff, the newly formed Supervisory Stress  Test Model Governance Committee has plans to expand communication  to the Board of Governors to provide Governors with more insight into  model development, model risk, and other outstanding concerns about  models. The expanded communication also may allow Governors to  communicate their model risk tolerances with the Federal Reserve staff  performing the supervisory stress tests and CCAR quantitative  assessment. However, Federal Reserve staff also told us that model risk  tolerances cannot be set prior to the completion of the models. But, this is  not consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s model risk-management  guidance, which requires company management to set predetermined  thresholds of acceptability and for senior management to ensure that the  level of model risk is within their tolerance. In the same manner as for  other major areas of risk, tolerances can be articulated in a number of  ways including a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches.

The  Federal Reserve has established an organizational structure for its CCAR  assessments that is guided by core principles and some best practices,  and it continues to annually refine and develop its stress test models.

This report (1) compares the DFAST and CCAR exercises and  discusses company and Federal Reserve views about the exercises\u2019  costs and benefits; (2) examines the CCAR qualitative assessment,  including the extent of communication and disclosure; (3) examines how  the Federal Reserve designs the supervisory scenarios for the stress  tests; and (4) examines the Federal Reserve\u2019s modeling process for the  stress tests.", "To compare DFAST and CCAR, we reviewed Section 165(i) of the Dodd- Frank Act, the Federal Reserve\u2019s final and amended capital plan and  stress test rules, and Federal Reserve policies and procedures about how  it has implemented and used DFAST and CCAR in its supervision of  banking institutions. We analyzed internal guidance documents and  instructions, methodology, and results publications related to DFAST and  CCAR; supervisory letters on stress testing and capital planning; public  statements by Federal Reserve officials; and other Federal Reserve  documentation about the programs. We interviewed staff from the offices  of the Federal Reserve that are responsible for DFAST and CCAR,  including the Federal Reserve\u2019s Division of Banking Supervision and  Regulation, regarding the scope, goals, and utilization of each program.  We analyzed information and documentation on stress test extensions  and exemptions from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC). We also interviewed staff from the Federal Reserve, OCC, and  FDIC about the use of extensions and exemptions.", "To obtain views on the stress tests and their costs and benefits, we  judgmentally selected and interviewed 13 companies that participated in  CCAR in 2015 and 6 companies that were subject only to DFAST. To  select CCAR companies to interview, the team used information on  CCAR firms collected from the Federal Reserve and SNL Financial, a  private provider of data on the financial services industry. We used the 31  bank holding companies that participated in the 2015 CCAR cycle as our  selection pool and selected companies based on their size, industry type,  organization type, prior stress test participation, and history of CCAR  results. To identify and select companies that were subject to DFAST but  not CCAR, we used data from the Federal Reserve and its National  Information Center. To expand the coverage and information from each  interview, we selected bank holding companies subject only to DFAST  that also had a subsidiary depository institution subject to stress test  requirements (including firms subject to OCC or FDIC rules). We grouped  the depository institutions by charter type\u2014(1) state-chartered banks that  were members of the Federal Reserve System, (2) state-chartered banks  that were not members of the Federal Reserve System, and (3)  nationally-chartered banks\u2014and ordered them by total asset size. We  selected institutions with the largest amount of total assets and the  company with the smallest amount from each of the three groups that  also had a holding company subject to DFAST. If we were unable to  schedule interviews with selected companies we chose additional  companies based on the same selection criteria. We also reviewed  Federal Reserve statements on benefits and costs.", "To characterize companies\u2019 views throughout the report, we consistently  defined modifiers (e.g., \u201cnearly all\u201d) to quantify each group of  interviewees\u2019 views as follows: \u201call\u201d represents 100 percent of the group,  \u201cnearly all\u201d represents 80 percent to 99 percent of the group, \u201cmost\u201d  represents 60 percent to 79 percent of the group, \u201cseveral\u201d represents 40  percent to 59 percent of the group, and \u201csome\u201d represents 20 percent to  39 percent of the group. While the percentage of the group of interviews  remains consistent, the number of interviews each modifier represents  differs based on the number of interviews in that grouping: 19 total CCAR  and DFAST firms, 13 CCAR companies, and 6 DFAST-only companies.  Table 8 provides the number of interviews in each modifier for each group  of interviews.", "To examine the process used by the Federal Reserve to conduct the  CCAR qualitative assessment, we reviewed the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress  test and capital plan rules and other publicly available documents  including annual stress test instructions and results, periodically released  guidance on supervisory expectations and other topics, and supervisory  letters regarding stress testing and bank supervision. We also examined  internal policies and procedures, training documents, and other program  documentation related to the CCAR qualitative assessments including  communication with companies and documentation of Board decision  making. The policy and procedure documents included CCAR program  manuals and project plans that described roles and responsibilities of  staff teams and oversight groups and identified the content and timing of  key tasks, among other things. Program documentation we analyzed  included evaluation memorandums from four assessment teams covering  8 companies from CCAR 2014 and 2015. We judgmentally selected  company-specific workpapers based on companies we interviewed and  the involvement of different staff teams from across the Federal Reserve  System. We also reviewed conclusion and recommendation  memorandums used in making object or non-objection determinations. To  examine communication with companies, we reviewed communication  procedures and company-specific feedback provided to companies  including questions and responses provided through the Federal  Reserve\u2019s communication mailbox. We interviewed Federal Reserve staff  about how they conduct the qualitative assessment including their  policies, procedures, and decision-making process as well as their  communication with companies about the assessment and the Federal  Reserve\u2019s supervisory expectations. We also interviewed officials from 13  CCAR companies about their experience with the qualitative assessment  and interaction with the Federal Reserve including the clarity of  supervisory expectations, program guidance, and feedback. We used  criteria from Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  and transparency principles, including directives issued by the Office of  Management and Budget, to evaluate the Federal Reserve\u2019s qualitative  assessment process and communication with companies.", "To examine how the Federal Reserve designs the supervisory scenarios  for the stress tests, we conducted interviews and reviewed public and  nonpublic documentation related to the scenario design process. We  interviewed Federal Reserve officials about the scenario design process,  including key considerations and rationales for scenario design policy  decisions. We interviewed officials from the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements regarding their own research  and experience conducting stress tests. We reviewed public Federal  Reserve documentation, including the Policy Statement which governs  the scenario design process, CCAR instructions, and the CCAR  assessment framework. We analyzed public data from the supervisory  quantitative scenarios from 2013 to 2016. We also reviewed nonpublic  Federal Reserve documents including internal presentations related to  proposed scenarios and CCAR results. To understand relevant standards  for complex analyses and stress testing, we reviewed IMF principles for  supervisory stress tests and Office of Management and Budget standards  for assessing the impact of regulations. Finally, we reviewed Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision analyses of the potential impact of  post-crisis reforms to strengthen bank capital and liquidity regulations and  IMF\u2019s 2015 U.S. Financial Sector Assessment Program.", "To examine the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test modeling  process, we collected and reviewed public and nonpublic Federal  Reserve documentation including DFAST- and CCAR-related  publications, internal guidance and procedures, policy statements, model  documentation, model validation reports, and internal presentations. For  model-specific documentation, we reviewed model documentation and  validation reports from the DFAST/CCAR 2015 stress test cycle (the most  recent available at the time of our examination) for a judgmentally  selected sample of component models. After reviewing publicly-available  model documentation and examples of nonpublic documentation provided  by the Federal Reserve, we requested and analyzed the documentation  and validation reports for four supervisory modeling teams, which we  selected based on our assessment of their likely importance to the  system of models or their potential for presenting analytical challenges.  We interviewed Federal Reserve staff from across the Federal Reserve  System, including staff involved with supervisory stress test model  development and validation, about the process for executing the  supervisory stress tests and the Federal Reserve\u2019s model risk management practices. We assessed the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory  stress test practices using the Federal Reserve\u2019s guidance to bank  holding companies on their stress test model risk management activities.  To provide additional context for the Federal Reserve guidance, we  reviewed publications of the National Research Council, whose members  are drawn from the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy  of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine, on best practices in complex  modeling and model risk management.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2014 to November  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Reviews by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Model Validation Unit and the Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": ["Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal  Reserve) Model Validation Unit review. The December 2014 review  findings included a shortcoming in policies and procedures, insufficient  model testing, insufficient planning and procedures to address the risks  posed by potential key personnel departures, and incomplete structures  and information flows to ensure proper oversight of model risk  management. The review resulted in six recommendations to address the  identified findings.", "Office of Inspector General (OIG) report. The OIG report identified  continuing risks related to model validation and broader governance  practices in four areas.", "Risks related to validation staffing and performance management  existed that may not be mitigated by the implementation of a new  staffing approach. These risks included insufficient performance  feedback to supplemental reviewers, dependence on key personnel,  and inadequate scrutiny of models.", "Risks associated with model changes that occur late in the  supervisory stress testing cycle remained despite Federal Reserve  steps to address these risks.", "The Federal Reserve did not maintain an accurate, complete, and  updated inventory of models as required by the Federal Reserve\u2019s  model risk-management guidance.", "In reviewing a sample of validation reports, limitations encountered by  reviewers during model validation were not always made clearly  identifiable for management in the validation reports submitted to  management.", "To address these risks, the OIG report made eight recommendations to  the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, including to establish  processes for assessing the materiality of late-stage changes to models  that would clarify what changes required independent validation and  would leverage reviewer resources to validate such changes.", "According to Federal Reserve staff and program documents, the Federal  Reserve has been implementing changes to address concerns raised by both reviews. For example, in response to the Model Validation Unit  review, the Federal Reserve officials said created the Supervisory Stress  Test Model Governance Committee was created to coordinate and  oversee its model risk-management efforts. Federal Reserve staff said  that the committee met for the first time in May 2015 and explained that  its agenda largely has been driven by responding to the findings of the  validation unit\u2019s governance review, in particular around model risk. One  of the review\u2019s findings was that incomplete governance structures and  information flows did not ensure proper oversight of model risk  management. The staff noted that the committee was formed to introduce  more structure and discipline to the model governance role, including by  clarifying reporting lines to the Director of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Division  of Banking Supervision and Regulation, who oversees the Model  Oversight Group and the Model Validation Unit.", "Federal Reserve staff said that the new committee provides a formal  venue for discussing differences of opinion and advising the director,  some of which was done informally in the past. The staff also noted that  they have been exploring opportunities to expand communication of  information about model risk with the Board of Governors, including  allowing Governors to communicate their preferences regarding modeling  decisions and levels of risk.", "In its response to the OIG review, the Federal Reserve said that it had  already made improvements to address a number of the  recommendations and was taking actions in response to others.  According to OIG staff, all of the report\u2019s recommendations remained  open as of July 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Lawrance L.
