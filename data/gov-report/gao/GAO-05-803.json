About 60 percent of the fiscal year 2004 USAID and State obligations we identified supported independent media development projects in Europe and Eurasia. However, precise funding levels are difficult to identify due to a lack of agencywide budget codes to track media development obligations, differing definitions of independent media development, and complex funding patterns. State and USAID face challenges in designing performance indicators and accurately measuring and reporting results directly tied to the performance of U.S. independent media efforts. The tools most frequently used by State and USAID as performance indicators--Freedom House's Freedom of the Press survey and the IREX Media Sustainability Index--are useful for determining the status of the media in selected countries but are of limited utility in measuring the specific contributions of U.S.-sponsored programs and activities toward developing independent media in countries when used alone. Several country-specific and programmatic challenges can impede the implementation of media development efforts, including a changing political condition, sustainability of local media outlets, and coordination between donors and providers. Specifically, a country's changing political condition or lack of adequate civic and legal institutions can create challenges for a mission to plan, implement, and measure the results of its efforts. The sustainability of program recipients can also impede the overall success of efforts or specific activities at the country level. In addition, when coordination of activities is unstructured or informal, redundancies and confusion of responsibilities can impact project implementation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S.-sponsored independent media development efforts support the  national security goal of developing sustainable democracies around the  world, while complementing U.S. public diplomacy efforts by encouraging  the development of sustainable media outlets with responsible and  professional reporting standards and editorial practices.

Journalists continue to be censored, tortured, imprisoned, and  murdered for publishing articles or broadcasting information about their  government. Media assistance emerged as a significant aspect of  development work in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly following the end of  the Cold War and the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. Media  development aid has evolved from relatively modest activities with minor  donations of equipment and training tours for journalists to, in some cases,  long-term, multifaceted projects with millions of dollars invested over the  life of the project.", "Independent media development efforts are not clearly defined, but are  commonly understood to include activities such as  training or educating local or indigenous reporters and editors on  subjects such as media ethics, professionalism, accountability,  investigative journalism, media business management and marketing,  strategies for transforming state broadcasters into public service  networks, and legal defense or legal regulatory issues;  developing media or press centers;  developing journalism schools and curriculum;  ensuring the financial sustainability and independence of media outlets,  through loan programs, advertising development, grants for  commodities, and other means;  supplying equipment or helping to build infrastructure needed to ensure  media independence, including technical capacity;  developing professional journalist, publisher, or broadcast associations;  developing networks of independent media, such as sharing  arrangements, which link production, distribution, and management of  material;   supporting the establishment of legal and regulatory frameworks and  advocacy groups that protect freedom of the press;  promoting an understanding of professional media practices and the  role of free and independent media in society; and  engaging diplomatically to advance the development of press freedoms  or media-related institutions, laws, and regulatory frameworks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Number of Agencies and Organizations Implement or Fund a Range of Media Development Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The Department of State and USAID are primarily responsible for funding  and overseeing U.S. media development projects and activities.

In addition, donors frequently use different approaches for  developing independent media. For example, State offers training  opportunities to a select number of individuals in the media sector or offers  small grants to organizations for media development. NED provides small,  short-term grants to media or advocacy organizations in many countries.

According to State officials, independent media development  funding levels for the Middle East are expected to increase in the future  due to an expansion of efforts through the Middle East Partnership  Initiative.

However, USAID officials told us they are currently in the process of  developing systems to better track agencywide obligations data for  individual program components under each strategic objective, including  for independent media development efforts. State Department funding is  also difficult to track because State does not keep systematic records or  budget codes of its obligations at the level of independent media  development activities and posts consider varying activities to embody  independent media development.

For semidemocratic, postconflict, or transitional countries  making progress toward democracy or no longer experiencing conflict,  USAID has identified a variety of activities to support the development of  an independent media.

All nine of the countries we reviewed  faced challenges due to deficiencies in at least one of these areas, which  impacted efforts to train the media, build the capacity of the media outlets,  and improve the freedom of the press within the country. In particular,  these deficiencies have led to such challenges as limited press freedom due  to direct government control over the media industry; changing legal and  regulatory frameworks; limited training opportunities; and lack of skilled  journalists due to widespread problems in professional and educational  systems. Agency officials provided examples of how such deficiencies have  impacted their programs:   Limited press freedom. Prior to the revolution in Kyrgyzstan, the Kyrgyz  government maintained a tight hold on broadcast frequencies,  prevented new stations from obtaining frequencies, and canceled  frequencies of certain independent outlets. Agency officials said that  journalists were afraid to broadcast on certain topics for fear of  harassment or prosecution. In Georgia, most television stations are  owned by oligarchs, many of whom support the new government.  According to embassy officials in Tbilisi, working journalists exercise  self-censorship for fear that reports critical of the government would be  unpopular with their owners.", "Changing legal and regulatory frameworks. Although Ukraine\u2019s new  president stated publicly his support for a free mass media, State  officials said Ukraine\u2019s legal and regulatory environments still need  assistance.  Though legislation has been enacted to improve freedom of  the press and oversight of the media industry, these changes have not  been consistently applied by Ukrainian judges and media outlets.  Therefore, journalists can still be pressured by government officials and  oligarchs to report information in a certain way, and media outlets\u2019 legal  status and license to operate remain in question.", "Limited training opportunities. Since 1993, Mali\u2019s constitution has  made it relatively easy to obtain radio broadcast licenses for FM  frequencies. However, officials noted that that there are currently no in- country professional training institutions for broadcast media. As a  result, individuals have to go outside of Mali to receive training, or  obtain informal training from their peers and colleagues.", "Lack of skilled journalists. In Croatia, most journalists have little  academic or professional training. Agency officials stated that although  independent media is evolving, journalists still report biased news and  information, do not check their facts or sources, do not follow up or  correct their errors, and skew the focus of articles to accomplish  personal agendas.", "According to USAID\u2019s January 2004 media assistance study, USAID has  funded a range of activities designed to further promote legal and  regulatory reforms, though undemocratic structures, politicians, and slow- to-change traditions have made the creation of enabling laws, policies, and  practices difficult or impossible in some cases. Assistance projects and  training efforts have been designed to mitigate legal, regulatory, and  professional deficiencies, though progress of these programs has been  slow. Agency officials from missions in several countries we examined  provided examples of approaches to addressing unregulated media  environments, including the following:    Limited press freedom. In order to limit editorial interference by state  bodies, USAID\u2019s media project in Kyrgyzstan currently supports local  efforts to draft a new broadcasting law, which would include  stipulations for the transformation of state television and radio to a  public broadcasting system. To dilute the editorial influence of oligarchs  who own the vast majority of TV stations in Georgia, USAID\u2019s  implementing partner in Tbilisi introduced a television rating system,  which produced verifiable ratings that made the commercial market far  more attractive to advertisers. The increased interest of advertisers in  the media market has made nonbusiness-based policies more costly for  oligarch owners.", "Changing legal and regulatory frameworks. USAID\u2019s media  development project in Ukraine has established a Media Law Institute  that will provide journalists with an outlet for legal defense and  consultations when faced with political pressure. The center also plans  to train local lawyers and judges on media law reform, and to publish  bulletins about changes in legislation.", "Limited training opportunities.

Specific  examples include the following:   Poor economic environment. An official from the USAID Mission in  Haiti stated that because many independent radio stations are  community owned, the stations cannot increase their operating budgets  or replace expensive pieces of equipment without first increasing the  financial resources available to the entire community. Additionally, the  self-sustainability of private media outlets in Bosnia-Herzegovina  continues to be a major problem due to widespread crime and  corruption and a national unemployment rate of about 40 percent.", "Lack of business management training. According to one local  television station owner in Croatia, a U.S.-sponsored national television  network, designed to link several local station\u2019s news programs, is  struggling to survive because the network did not develop the  advertising revenue and profit-sharing structures necessary to keep it  financially sustainable. USAID acknowledged that this may be the case,  but they viewed the network project as a success because it had served  to provide an alternative, independent news program to the state- controlled TV network during an earlier period of political transition.", "To respond to these programmatic challenges, some USAID officials  offered the following suggestions:    Poor economic environment. The USAID Mission to Bosnia- Herzegovina has focused on encouraging local business development  strategies, and currently financially supports the survival of only a select  number of media outlets. The USAID Mission in Mali told us that  because of the country\u2019s high poverty rate, they conduct workshops for  radio stations in order to provide them with small-business concepts  that can be used to generate additional outside revenues, like the sale of  solar power to provide lighting or the creation of centers to provide the  community with computer services and Internet access.", "Lack of business management training. Since 2002, Georgia\u2019s USAID  media project has worked to promote the sustainability of print and  broadcast media outlets by improving their business management skills  and establishing an independent and credible national system of  television audience measurement. As a result of better information on  the profile of viewers, TV advertising in Georgia increased from $3  million to $7 million in 2004 and is expected to increase to $13 million by  2006.", "Various studies have also offered suggestions for addressing the  sustainability of media outlets. A working paper by the Netherlands  Institute of International Relations on \u201cInternational Media Assistance\u201d  suggested allowing more time during the life of a project to focus on  sustainability. Another report published by USAID, Media Assistance:  Policy and Programmatic Lessons, suggested that in postconflict  societies, only media outlets willing to take concrete and concerted steps  toward economic independence should be given technical or financial  assistance. According to this study, USAID has implemented several  activities that promote the financial independence or sustainability of  media outlets, but these activities have achieved only limited success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Coordination at Some Locations Can Result in Confusion of Responsibilities and Duplication of Efforts", "paragraphs": ["While not as widespread as other programmatic challenges, we found that  four of the nine countries we examined were challenged by coordination  issues, such as an unclear chain of command and limited communication,  which resulted in confusion over the responsibilities of donors and  providers of media development, duplication of efforts, or periods of  program inactivity. For example, the director of a Croatian media  development project worked with three different U.S. donors, with no clear  chain of command established. Thus, the director was unsure to whom he  should report under certain circumstances, resulting in difficulty in  reacting to urgent needs. In another case we reviewed, State and USAID  had unknowingly funded different NGOs that were working independently  to rebuild the same radio stations that had been destroyed during the  recent tsunami in Indonesia, leading to on-the-ground project conflicts.  Officials at the USAID Mission to Indonesia told us this duplication of effort  resulted from their lack of awareness of a grant awarded by State\u2019s DRL  bureau in Washington, D.C., that was similar to the grant USAID awarded.  Poorly maintained roads, combined with poor phone and Internet access,  contributed to communication and coordination challenges faced by the  USAID Mission in Haiti and the community radios it supports; this, in turn  slowed USAID\u2019s training activities, the delivery of equipment, and other  activities. USAID officials said they are planning to install Internet and  phone lines in rural areas to improve the situation.", "One example of effective coordination can be found in Ukraine. Ukraine is  challenged by a complicated network of donors, providers, and recipients  (see fig. 1), multiple ongoing projects, various funding sources, and  agencies funding the same organizations and similar activities. For  example, four separate organizations, including the U.S. Embassy (via the  Media Development Ffund), Internews Network (via a cooperative  agreement via the USAID mission), the International Renaissance  Foundation, and NED (via its annual grant from State), currently provide  U.S.-sponsored funding or programmatic activities to the advocacy and  media monitoring organization Telekritika. However, in Kiev, USAID and  State officials have worked well together to minimize coordination  problems by keeping track of donor awards on a Web site and attending  donor coordination meetings on a monthly basis. According to USAID  officials, the Web site \u201cMarketplace for Donors\u201d is funded jointly by State  (the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, public affairs section) and the International  Renaissance Foundation.", "Media evaluations have made specific suggestions to improve the  coordination of donors, providers, and recipients of independent media  development programming in order to minimize the confusion of  responsibilities and duplication of efforts. An evaluation by the University  of Oxford, \u201cMapping Media Assistance,\u201d suggested donors and providers  coordinate the distribution of their limited resources in a systematic and  logical manner, based on their areas of specialization. The Netherlands  Institute of International Relations working paper on \u201cInternational Media  Assistance,\u201d suggested establishing a strategic coordination mechanism,  like the European Media Agency for the European Union, that could serve  as a clearinghouse and evaluator of all media-related assistance proposals  for the targeted countries.", "To address challenges in coordination, USAID funds regional media  conferences and has conducted a limited number of independent media  program evaluations, so that participants can share lessons learned;  however, these efforts face funding constraints. USAID has funded six  independent media development regional conferences in Europe and  Eurasia and one multiregional conference over the past 8 years.  These  conferences have brought together journalists, media development donors,  providers, and civil society organizations to discuss issues in journalism  that transcend borders. USAID has also designated the Bureau for Policy  and Program Coordination to conduct several assessments of independent  media programs in various countries and identify lessons learned and best  practices. In addition, USAID bureaus and missions have conducted several  different types of studies on independent media efforts, including midterm  assessments, final reports, and program evaluations. According to the  Policy and Program Coordination bureau director, USAID\u2019s independent  media evaluations have created a body of knowledge and lessons learned  on subjects ranging from conflict areas to transitional countries. However,  USAID media officials noted that the discontinuation of funding for  conferences and limited funding levels for evaluations could reduce the  amount of collaboration and sharing of lessons learned officials said is  necessary to enhance media development programming efforts.  Additionally, several media officials indicated that in some instances  insufficient funding for USAID program evaluations has forced media  development providers to fund their own evaluations through their project  budgets, thus reducing funds available for development activities. Although  USAID requires its evaluations to be posted on the Development  Experience Clearinghouse to make them accessible to other posts, one  senior official said it was unclear to what degree the lessons learned from  evaluations are shared or used by missions. For example, one official in  Croatia said that program evaluations are shared only within the region due  to concerns that other countries\u2019 approaches may not be relevant."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of State and the USAID  Administrator for their review and comment.

In particular, we gathered documentation  separately from the International Center for Journalists, Internews, The  Eurasia Foundation, the Asia Foundation, and IREX.
