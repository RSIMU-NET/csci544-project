The agency's Office of the Director (OD) faces considerable management challenges to ensure that during public health crises the agency's nonemergency but important public health work continues apace. In 2002, the agency's OD began taking steps aimed at organizational change. GAO has observed elsewhere that major change management initiatives can take at least 5 to 7 years. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which organizational changes have helped balance OD's oversight of CDC's emergent and ongoing public health responsibilities. Specifically, GAO examined OD's (1) executive management structure, (2) approach to overseeing the agency's work, and (3) approach to setting the agency's priorities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The management team in CDC's top office--OD--is undergoing a structural change designed to provide a new approach to managing the agency's public health work. Through this effort, CDC has taken steps that have merit. For example, OD established a Chief Operating Officer position with clear oversight authority for the agency's operations units, such as financial management and information technology. However, a significant oversight weakness remains: there is no position or combination of positions on OD's management team below the Director's level to oversee the programs and activities of 11 centers that perform the bulk of the agency's public health work. Only CDC's Director has line authority for the centers, and the extraordinary demands on the Director's time associated with public health emergencies and other external events make the practicality of this oversight arrangement uncertain. Another of OD's structural initiatives was to align OD management team positions with broad mission \"themes,\" or goals, that cut across the centers' institutional boundaries. The intent was to foster among the 11 independent centers a more integrated approach to performing the agency's mission. This purpose may be difficult to realize, however, as connections between certain themes and associated OD positions are not sufficiently clear. OD has made improvements in its ability to oversee the agency's response to public health emergencies--including the creation of an emergency preparedness and response office and the development of an emergency communication system--but concerns remain about OD's oversight of nonemergency public health work. OD's efforts to monitor the activities of the centers are not sufficiently systematic. For example, few formal systems are in place to track the status of centers' operations and programmatic activities. Although OD has a process for center officials to elevate important issues of concern, the information flow under this process is largely center-driven, as the subjects discussed are typically raised at the discretion of the center officials. Similarly, OD's efforts to foster coordination among the centers fall short of institutionalizing collaboration as standard agency practice. The planning tools that OD needs to set agency priorities and address human capital challenges are under development. In recent years, OD has operated without an up-to-date agencywide planning strategy with which to set mission priorities and unify the work of CDC's various centers. In June 2003, OD initiated an agencywide strategic planning process. In a separate planning effort initiated in April 2003, CDC began working on a human capital plan for meeting the agency's current and future staffing needs. This effort has been suspended while the strategic planning process gets under way, and no time frames have been established for resuming its development. At the same time, agency attrition and future limits on workforce growth suggest that agency leadership may be needed to ensure that workforce planning occurs expeditiously."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the national focal point for conducting disease prevention and control  efforts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is widely  recognized for its work in investigating disease outbreaks as well as its  health promotion programs.

Today, CDC\u2019s mission is \u201cto promote health and quality of  life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability.\u201d  Establishing and maintaining balance within this broad mission is an  ongoing challenge for agency management. CDC, an agency in the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has the lead federal role  in responding to infectious disease outbreaks, such as severe acute  respiratory syndrome (SARS), monkeypox, and the West Nile virus.

A 1999 study by the HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector  General stated that one of CDC\u2019s centers failed to report the redirection of  some of its funds\u2014a problem that highlighted shortcomings in top  management\u2019s knowledge about center operations. In 2000, we reported  that CDC\u2019s financial management capabilities had not kept pace with the  agency\u2019s expanded mission and increased funding and that financial  management was not a high priority relative to the agency\u2019s other  functions. That same year, after the public health community\u2019s response  to the first outbreak of the West Nile virus, we reported that public health  preparedness could be improved, in part, through better communication  among public health agencies, including CDC. During the 2001 anthrax  incidents, the agency garnered criticism for its slow release of important  information. In 2002, we subsequently reported internal management  control weaknesses with CDC\u2019s oversight of the Select Agent Program,  which is responsible for regulating the transfer of certain biological agents  and toxins\u2014such as anthrax\u2014to appropriate laboratories.", "In the wake of the anthrax incidents and SARS outbreak, CDC has  emerged as a key player in preparing the nation for public health  emergencies. In 2002, the agency\u2019s OD spearheaded a number of initiatives  aimed at organizational change. Such change is necessarily a long-term  undertaking, requiring leadership and commitment. Experience shows that  successful major change management initiatives in large private and  public sector organizations can often take at least 5 to 7 years. This length  of time and the frequent turnover of political leadership in the federal  government have often made it difficult to obtain the sustained and  inspired attention to make needed changes.

Over the years,  CDC\u2019s mission and scope of work have continued to expand in concert  with public health needs. Commensurate with its increased scope of work,  CDC\u2019s budget and staff have grown. In 1946, the agency had a budget of  about $1 million and had over 360 FTEs. In fiscal year 2003, CDC managed  a budget of almost $7 billion and had over 8,800 FTEs.

CDC provides varying levels of support to its partners through  funding, technical assistance, information sharing, and personnel. In fiscal  year 2002, CDC awarded 69 percent of its total budget to partners through  financial assistance, such as cooperative agreements and grants. The  majority of these funds\u2014about 75 percent\u2014were disbursed to state health  departments. The remaining 25 percent of these funds were disbursed to  various other public and private entities.", "CDC\u2019s workforce consists of 170 job occupations including physicians,  statisticians, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, behavioral scientists,  and health communicators. Seventy-eight percent of CDC\u2019s workforce  consists of permanent civil service staff. U.S. Public Health Service  Commissioned Corps employees account for 10 percent of the workforce,  and temporary employees make up the remaining 12 percent. Most of  CDC\u2019s staff are dispersed across over 30 locations in Atlanta, Georgia.  CDC also has more than 2,000 employees at other locations in the United  States. (See fig. 2.)

In addition, it provides  financial and technical assistance for terrorism preparedness to state,  local, and U.S. territorial health departments. In fiscal year 2002, OTPER  disbursed about $1 billion in financial assistance to these partners.", "To improve the agency\u2019s response effectiveness, OTPER developed  management decision and information flow models, which outline who  will be involved and how the emergency will be handled from strategic,  operational, and tactical perspectives. According to the Associate Director  for Terrorism Preparedness and Response, these models were used to  manage the emergencies involving SARS, monkeypox, and potential  terrorist acts associated with the war in Iraq.

According to the Associate Director for  Terrorism Preparedness and Response, the emergency operations center  is operational around the clock and has a small number of dedicated staff.  In times of emergency, subject matter and communication experts from  the centers are temporarily detailed for 3 to 6 months as needed. For  example, during the SARS response, individuals from the National Center  for Infectious Diseases, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and  Health, the Epidemiology Program Office, and the Global Health Office,  among others, staffed the emergency operations center and returned to  normal duties at predetermined intervals to mitigate any major impact on  routine public health work.

In August 2003, OD announced  the establishment of two governing bodies that encourage center  collaboration\u2014the Executive Leadership Team and the Management  Council.

The Management Council, which also meets  biweekly, focuses on crosscutting issues involving agency operations,  such as information technology. The council is chaired by OD\u2019s COO and  is composed of staff office officials and representatives from each of the  centers. In providing recommendations to the Executive Leadership Team  on agency operations issues, such as the development of performance  metrics and the consolidation of the agency\u2019s information technology  infrastructure, the council has the opportunity to foster more consistent  management practices across the agency.", "OD officials acknowledged that along with these efforts to promote  collaboration, additional initiatives are needed to ensure that collaboration  among the centers becomes a standard agency practice.

Moreover, the agency must keep a mission focus when coordinating with  its external partners\u2014largely, state, local, and international public health  agencies. Although CDC relies heavily on these and other external  partners to achieve its mission, a mutual understanding of the agency\u2019s  priorities may be lacking.

Leading organizations use succession planning and management as a tool  that focuses on current and future workforce needs in order to meet their   mission over the long term. Our analysis of CDC\u2019s 2003 personnel data  showed that\u2014similar to the rest of the federal government\u2014about 30  percent of the agency\u2019s workforce is eligible to retire within the next 5  years. We also found that 33 percent of its senior managers and  supervisors will be eligible for retirement within this time frame. Thus,  within several years, the agency could potentially lose a key portion of its  human capital that possesses both managerial and technical expertise.", "In addition, by the end of fiscal year 2005, CDC and other HHS agencies  are expected to achieve a departmentwide 15 percent reduction in  administrative management and support positions. HHS mandated that  this reduction not result in the involuntary separations of employees and  that affected resources be redirected to programmatic public health work.  The implications for CDC are that within a 2-year time frame, CDC must  redirect 573 administrative positions from support activities to frontline  public health program activities. In some cases, this would involve  redirecting administrative staff to program work. However, this will pose a  challenge for CDC, as the agency does not maintain a repository of its  employees\u2019 skills, which is important to ensure appropriate employee  placement. HHS has also directed each of its agencies to assume no  growth in the number of FTEs beginning with the fiscal year 2005 budget  formulation process and to include a 5 percent FTE reduction option in  their budget submissions.", "OD has taken modest steps toward succession planning. For example,  CDC participates in HHS\u2019s program to train and mentor emerging leaders.  CDC\u2019s Director has also emphasized the importance of identifying future  leaders within the agency and has made this issue a standing agenda item  in routine management meetings with center officials. To forecast  workforce needs, in August 2002, the agency produced a report of attrition  for its offices and centers. Currently, CDC\u2019s managers can access the most  recent attrition data by querying a Web-based personnel information  system. However, OD is limited in its ability to conduct targeted  succession planning or promote greater retention, as it does not track  certain key personnel information. For example, although resignations in  calendar year 2002 accounted for a higher percentage of the agency\u2019s  attrition than retirement (30 percent compared with 20 percent), CDC  does not systematically document the reasons for resignations, either  through standard \u201cexit interviews\u201d of employees who leave the agency or  some other means. This lack of documentation limits OD\u2019s ability to  conduct comprehensive workforce planning, which includes strategies for  retaining an organization\u2019s workforce for meeting future needs.", "The considerable succession planning challenges that the agency faces  argue for greater OD leadership over human capital planning. Such  leadership would be consistent with the effective human capital planning  actions of six federal agencies cited in our April 2003 report on this  subject. The report noted, among other things, the importance of  including human capital leaders in key agency decision making and the  establishment and communication of a strategic vision by human capital  leaders.

First, a weakness in oversight of the centers exists, as only the CDC  Director has line authority over them, and it is uncertain whether this  arrangement provides for sufficient top management oversight of the  centers\u2019 programs and activities. In addition, the roles of OD\u2019s two deputy  directors lack the clarity needed for those seeking the appropriate OD  points of contact.", "Second, OD lacks sufficiently systematic information to track agency  operations or the centers\u2019 core public health programs\u2014placing agency  management in a reactive rather than leadership position.
