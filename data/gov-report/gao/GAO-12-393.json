Specifically, the agency continues to face challenges in controlling access to its information resources. For example, it had not always (1) implemented controls for identifying and authenticating users, such as requiring users to set new passwords after a prescribed period of time; (2) appropriately restricted access to certain servers; (3) ensured that sensitive data were encrypted when transmitted; (4) audited and monitored systems to ensure that unauthorized activities would be detected; or (5) ensured management validation of access to restricted areas. In addition, unpatched and outdated software exposed IRS to known vulnerabilities, and the agency had not enforced backup procedures for a key system.", "An underlying reason for these weaknesses is that IRS has not fully implemented a comprehensive information security program. IRS has established a comprehensive framework for such a program, and has made strides to address control deficiencies\u0097such as establishing working groups to identify and remediate specific at-risk control areas; however, it has not fully implemented all key components of its program. For example, IRS\u0092s security testing and monitoring continued to not detect many of the vulnerabilities GAO identified during this audit. IRS also did not promptly correct known vulnerabilities. For example, the agency indicated that 76 of the 105 previously reported weaknesses open at the end of GAO\u0092s prior year audit had not yet been corrected. In addition, IRS did not always validate that its actions to resolve known weaknesses were effectively implemented. Although IRS had a process in place for verifying whether each weakness had been corrected, this process was not always working as intended. Of the 29 weaknesses IRS indicated were corrected, GAO determined that 13 (about 45 percent) had not yet been fully addressed.", "Considered collectively, these deficiencies, both new and unresolved from previous GAO audits, along with a lack of fully effective compensating and mitigating controls, impair IRS's ability to ensure that its financial and taxpayer information is secure from internal threats. This reduces IRS's assurance that its financial statements and other financial information are fairly presented or reliable and that sensitive IRS and taxpayer information is being sufficiently safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure or modification. These deficiencies are the basis of GAO\u0092s determination that IRS had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to information security in fiscal year 2011."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS take 6 actions to fully implement key components of its comprehensive information security program.

Concerns about the risk to these systems are well founded for  a number of reasons, including the increase in reports of security  incidents, the ease of obtaining and using hacking tools, and steady  advances in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has identified multiple sources of  threats, including foreign entities engaged in intelligence gathering and  information warfare, domestic criminals, hackers, virus writers, and  disgruntled employees or contractors working within an organization. In  addition, the U.S. Secret Service and the CERT\u00ae Coordination Center  studied insider threats in the government sector and stated in a January  2008 report that \u201cgovernment sector insiders have the potential to pose a  substantial threat by virtue of their knowledge of, and access to, employer  systems and/or databases.\u201d Insider threats include errors or mistakes  and fraudulent or malevolent acts by insiders.", "Our previous reports, and those by federal inspectors general, describe  persistent information security weaknesses that place federal agencies,  including IRS, at risk of disruption, fraud, or inappropriate disclosure of  sensitive information.

Access controls include those related to user identification and  authentication, authorization, cryptography, audit and monitoring, and  physical security. However, IRS did not fully implement effective controls  in these areas. Without adequate access controls, unauthorized  individuals may be able to log in, access sensitive information, and make  undetected changes or deletions for malicious purposes or personal gain.  In addition, authorized individuals may be able to intentionally or  unintentionally view, add, modify, or delete data to which they should not  have been given access.", "A computer system needs to be able to identify and authenticate each  user so that activities on the system can be linked and traced to a specific  individual. An organization does this by assigning a unique user account  to each user, and in so doing, the system is able to distinguish one user  from another\u2014a process called identification (ID). The system also needs  to establish the validity of a user\u2019s claimed identity by requesting some  kind of information, such as a password, that is known only by the user\u2014 a process known as authentication. The combination of identification and  authentication\u2014such as user account-password combinations\u2014provides  the basis for establishing individual accountability and for controlling  access to the system. The Internal Revenue Manual requires the use of a  strong password for authentication (defined as a minimum of eight  characters, containing at least one numeric or special character, and a  mixture of at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter). The manual  also states that database account passwords are not to be reused within  10 password changes and that the password grace period for a  database\u2014the number of days an individual has to change his or her  password after it expires\u2014should be set to 10.", "IRS had implemented various password controls, but weaknesses  existed. For the Oracle database supporting its authorization system, IRS  enforced strong password policies on active user accounts. However, IRS  did not set appropriate password reuse maximum time or ensure complex  password verification checking for its procurement system. As a result of  these weaknesses, increased risk exists that an individual with malicious  intentions could gain inappropriate access to sensitive IRS applications  and data on these systems, and potentially use the access to attempt  compromises of other IRS systems.", "Authorization is the process of granting or denying access rights and  permissions to a protected resource, such as a network, a system, an  application, a function, or a file.

For example, it has appropriately restricted access to  disaster recovery servers, and has implemented a capability to identify  and correct potential anomalies in mainframe access definitions. Also, it  has removed users with inappropriate access to a mainframe database  supporting a financial system. However, additional authorization controls  were not always functioning as intended, and access authorization  policies were not effectively implemented. For example, systems used to  process tax and financial information did not fully prevent access by  unauthorized users or excessive levels of access for authorized users.  More specifically, IRS has implemented an access authorization control  for a system used to process electronic tax payment information;  however, users had the capability to circumvent this control and gain  access to this system\u2019s server. Insecurely configured software used to  support this system also exposed it to unauthorized users. In addition,  IRS\u2019s compliance checks revealed unauthorized access to another  system.

Also, the data in a shared work area used to support accounting  operations were fully accessible by network administration staff although  they did not need such access. Further, IRS has not taken actions to  appropriately restrict services and user access, and to remove active  application accounts in a timely manner for employees who had  separated or no longer needed access.", "IRS noted additional authorization controls to compensate for or mitigate  known deficiencies; however, these controls were not always  implemented. For example, although IRS cited the use of role-based  access for a major system used to process taxpayer data, this control  was not yet implemented.

A basic  element of cryptography is encryption, which is used to transform plain  text into cipher text using a special value known as a key and a  mathematical process known as an algorithm. According to IRS policy,  the use of insecure protocols should be restricted because their  widespread use can allow passwords and other sensitive data to be  transmitted across its internal network unencrypted.", "IRS continued to expand its use of encryption to protect sensitive data,  but shortcomings remain. IRS took action to encrypt data transfers for its  administrative accounting system. However, as we reported in 2011, the  agency configured a server that transfers tax and financial data between  internal systems to use protocols that allowed unencrypted transmission  of sensitive data. IRS also had not rectified its use of unencrypted  protocols for a sensitive tax-processing application, potentially exposing  user ID and password combinations. By not encrypting sensitive data,  increased risk exists that an unauthorized individual could view and then  use the data to gain unwarranted access to its system or sensitive  information.", "To establish individual accountability, monitor compliance with security  policies, and investigate security violations, it is crucial to determine what,  when, and by whom specific actions have been taken on a system.  Organizations accomplish this by implementing system or security  software that provides an audit trail\u2014a log of system activity\u2014that they  can use to determine the source of a transaction or attempted transaction  and to monitor users\u2019 activities. The way in which organizations configure  system or security software determines the nature and extent of  information that can be provided by the audit trail. To be effective,  organizations should configure their software to collect and maintain audit  trails that are sufficient to track security-relevant events. The Internal  Revenue Manual requires systems to implement operational and  technical control guidance to monitor traffic on host intrusion detection  systems, and also states that IRS should enable and configure audit  logging on all systems to aid in the detection of security violations,  performance problems, and flaws in applications. Additionally, IRS policy  states that security controls in information systems shall be monitored on  an ongoing basis.", "IRS had established several activities designed to support detection of  questionable or unauthorized access to financial applications and data  and to support its response; however, some of these activities were not  fully in place or operating as intended. To assist in its audit and  monitoring activities, IRS established the Enterprise Security Audit Trails  (ESAT) Project Management Office, which is responsible for managing all  enterprise audit initiatives and identifying and overseeing deployment and  transition of various audit trail solutions. The program is currently in its  early stages, but the agency is continually implementing new procedures  building on the program\u2019s initiatives. For fiscal year 2011, the agency had  ESAT-related audit processes in place for four systems\u2014only one of  which was relevant to our financial statement audit efforts. However, the  processes were not yet operating effectively. For example, ESAT had not  delivered system audit reports covering a 4-month period for one financial  application to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer in a timely manner,  and appropriate management officials were not aware of this  shortcoming.", "Other monitoring activities were also not always operating effectively.  Although IRS had enabled audit logging for certain systems, it had not for  others. For example, the agency had enabled and configured audit  logging for UNIX operating systems on 31 servers reviewed. However, it  had not enabled and configured monitoring activity for its authorization  system. IRS officials recognized this shortcoming and indicated that they  are working with cybersecurity staff to resolve this deficiency. Finally, IRS  did not properly enable auditing features on its Oracle databases  supporting three systems we reviewed. As a result of detection and  response capabilities not being fully in place and certain deficiencies in  configurations, IRS\u2019s ability to establish individual accountability, monitor  compliance with security policies, and investigate security violations was  limited.", "Physical security controls are important for protecting computer facilities  and resources from espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. These  controls involve procedures to authorize employees\u2019 access to and control  over unissued keys or other entry devices. At IRS, physical access control  measures, such as physical access cards that are used to permit or deny  access to certain areas of a facility, are vital to safeguarding its facilities,  computing resources, and information from internal and external threats.  The Internal Revenue Manual requires access controls that safeguard  assets against possible theft and malicious actions. IRS policy also  requires completion of appropriate access authorization documentation  prior to issuance of physical access cards, and that such entry devices be  inventoried once every 24 hours of each workday, including signing the  inventory to verify that it has been completed.", "IRS implemented numerous physical security controls at its enterprise  computing centers to safeguard assets against possible theft and  malicious actions. For example, IRS had a dedicated guard force at each  of its computing centers to, among other things, control physical access  to restricted areas and secure entry devices such as physical access  cards. In addition, the 30 individuals we selected for review had  appropriate access to secure computing areas at the computing centers,  and IRS had appropriately restricted access to master keys at the centers  that used them. Further, IRS effectively screened visitors, and at one  computing center, reviewed lists of employees authorized to enter  restricted areas.", "Nevertheless, IRS did not always consistently authorize employees\u2019  access to restricted areas or inventory physical access cards. At each of  the computing centers, IRS had a process in place to authorize  employees\u2019 access to restricted areas. However, one of the centers did  not document this authorization for 7 of 20 employees whose access  authority we reviewed. In addition, although the guard force at each  computing center performed an inventory to account for physical access  cards, they did not consistently implement this control. For example, the  guard forces at two of the three computing centers we visited did not  always sign, thus providing accountability for, the inventory of physical  access cards. In addition, at least one of three guard shifts did not detect  an anomaly in the inventory for 4 of the 5 days we reviewed at one  computing center. Further, several physical security weaknesses  identified during previous audits remain unresolved. These include issues  concerning management validation of access to restricted areas,  proximity cards allowing inappropriate access, and unlocked cabinets  containing network devices. As a result, IRS has reduced assurance that  its computing resources and sensitive information are adequately  protected from unauthorized access. In addition, IRS has cited its  physical security controls as compensating or mitigating controls for other  noted deficiencies; however, because of the weaknesses noted in these  controls, IRS may not be able to rely on physical security as a  compensating control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Other Information Security Controls Introduce Risk", "paragraphs": ["In addition to access controls, other important controls should be in place  to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization\u2019s  information.

Patch management, a component of configuration  management, is an important element in mitigating the risks associated  with software vulnerabilities. When a software vulnerability is discovered,  the software vendor may develop and distribute a patch or work-around to  mitigate the vulnerability. Without the patch, an attacker can exploit a  software vulnerability to read, modify, or delete sensitive information;  disrupt operations; or launch attacks against systems at another  organization. Outdated and unsupported software is more vulnerable to  attack and exploitation because vendors no longer provide updates,  including security updates. Accordingly, the Internal Revenue Manual  states that IRS will manage systems to reduce vulnerabilities by promptly  installing patches. Specifically, it states that security patches should be  applied within 30 days, and hardware and software on network devices  should be promptly maintained and updated in response to identified  vulnerabilities. The manual also states that system administrators should  ensure the version of the operating system being used is one for which  the vendor still offers standardized technical support.", "IRS made progress in updating certain systems. For example, the agency  had provided an effective patch management solution for its Windows  servers. IRS also upgraded its domain name system servers at the three  computing centers.", "However, the agency did not always apply critical patches or ensure that  versions of its operating systems were still supported by the vendor. For  example, for one system we reviewed, the agency had not applied a  security-related patch release within 30 days of its issuance to the UNIX  operating system for 10 of the 14 production servers reviewed; the vendor  issued the patch release in April 2011, but IRS had not yet installed it at  the time of our site visit in June 2011. In addition, IRS had never  installed numerous patch releases for the UNIX operating system  supporting another system we reviewed, although this operating system  has existed since March 2009. The 10 uninstalled security-related patch  releases were considered \u201ccritical\u201d by the vendor. By not installing  security patches in a timely fashion, IRS increases the risk that known  vulnerabilities in its systems may be exploited. The agency also used  outdated software on all three reviewed servers used for remote access.  Further, as we reported in March 2011, IRS was using unsupported  versions of software on most network devices reviewed.outdated and unsupported operating systems increases security  exposure, as the vendor will not be supplying any security patches to the  unsupported operating system.", "Segregation of duties refers to the policies, procedures, and  organizational structures that help ensure that no single individual can  independently control all key aspects of a process or computer-related  operation and thereby gain unauthorized access to assets or records.  Often, organizations achieve segregation of duties by dividing  responsibilities among two or more individuals or organizational groups.  This diminishes the likelihood that errors and wrongful acts will go  undetected, because the activities of one individual or group will serve as  a check on the activities of the other. Conversely, inadequate segregation  of duties increases the risk that erroneous or fraudulent transactions  could be processed, improper program changes implemented, and  computer resources damaged or destroyed. The Internal Revenue  Manual requires that IRS divide and separate duties and responsibilities  of functions among different individuals so that no individual has all  necessary authority and system access to disrupt or corrupt a critical  security process. In addition, IRS policy states that the primary security  role of any database administrator is to administer and maintain database  repositories for proper use by authorized individuals and that database  administrators should not have system administrator access rights.", "IRS implemented appropriate segregation of duties controls. Specifically,  IRS implemented controls to prevent the assignment of incompatible  database and system access privileges that allow for the compromise of  separation-of-duties controls.

To ensure that  mission-critical operations continue, organizations should be able to  detect, mitigate, and recover from service disruptions while preserving  access to vital information. One facet of ensuring that mission-critical  operations can be recovered is establishing an information system  recovery and reconstitution capability so that the information system can  be restored to its original state after a service disruption. Conducting a  business impact analysis is a key step in the contingency planning  process. A business impact analysis is an analysis of information  technology system requirements, processes, and interdependencies used  to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the  event of a significant disruption. Moreover, it correlates the system with  the critical mission/business processes and services provided, and based  on that information, characterizes the consequences of a disruption. In  addition, developing an information system contingency plan is a critical  step in the process of implementing a comprehensive contingency  planning program. Organizations should prepare plans that are clearly  documented, communicated to staff who could be affected, and updated  to reflect current operations. Further, testing contingency plans is  essential in determining whether the plans will function as intended in an  emergency situation. Another key aspect of contingency planning is the  development of a disaster recovery plan. A disaster recovery plan is an  information system-focused plan designed to restore operability of the  target system, application, or computer facility infrastructure at an  alternate site after an emergency. The information system contingency  plan differs from a disaster recovery plan primarily in that the information  system contingency plan procedures are developed for recovery of the  system regardless of site or location. In contrast, a disaster recovery plan  is primarily a site-specific plan.", "The Internal Revenue Manual requires business impact analyses for  systems, and includes steps for completing this process. More  specifically, the business impact analysis should (1) identify business  requirements and the purpose of the application undergoing the business  impact analysis, (2) identify outage tolerances and impacts, and (3)  identify recovery priorities. The manual also requires that IRS develop,  test, and maintain information system contingency plans for all systems,  and review and update these plans. In addition, IRS policy calls for the  development of disaster recovery plans for each information system to  ensure that, after disruption, the system can be restored to its full  operational status. Moreover, the policy notes that the disaster recovery  plan should define the resources, roles, responsibilities, actions, tasks,  and the detailed work steps (keystrokes) required to restore an  information technology system to its full operational status at the current  or alternate facility after a major disruption with long-term effects.

As a result, during a fiscal year 2011  test, IRS was unable to demonstrate continuity of business processes  for a key system used to process taxpayer data. Specifically, although  agency officials noted that the operating system component was able  to be restored, the system was missing 1 week of critical data  essential for business processing because the backup process was  not executed as planned. With the exception of this system, all other  systems reviewed, which had conducted a disaster recovery test,  demonstrated that they were able to be successfully recovered.", "Until the agency develops a disaster recovery plan for its authorization  system to include detailed work steps (keystrokes) required to restore the  system, and effectively implements and enforces its backup procedures  for its system used to process taxpayer data, IRS may be unable to  restore its authorization system to its full operational status after a major  disruption, and its ability to reconstitute key business processes critical to  IRS\u2019s mission may be limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Not Fully Implemented Key Components of Its Information Security Program", "paragraphs": ["A key reason for the information security weaknesses in IRS\u2019s financial  and tax-processing systems is that it has not yet fully implemented critical  components of its comprehensive information security program. FISMA  requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an  information security program that, among other things, includes periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that could  result from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction of information and information systems; policies and procedures that (1) are based on risk assessments, (2)  cost-effectively reduce information security risks to an acceptable  level, (3) ensure that information security is addressed throughout the  life cycle of each system, and (4) ensure compliance with applicable  requirements; plans for providing adequate information security for networks,  facilities, and systems;  security awareness training to inform personnel of information security  risks and of their responsibilities in complying with agency policies  and procedures, as well as training personnel with significant security  responsibilities for information security; periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information  security policies, procedures, and practices, to be performed with a  frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually, and that  includes testing of management, operational, and technical controls  for every system identified in the agency\u2019s required inventory of major  information systems; and a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies in its information security  policies, procedures, or practices.", "IRS has made progress in developing and documenting certain elements  of its information security program. During fiscal year 2011, IRS  management devoted attention and resources to addressing the agency\u2019s  information security controls. For example, IRS formed cross-functional  working groups with knowledge of its internal systems to address  identified areas considered at risk. IRS also acknowledged that  maintaining effective information security controls, at the individual  system or component level in its large internal network, presents  significant challenges. In addition, the agency cited actions taken to  implement additional controls designed to partially compensate for and  mitigate the risks associated with previously identified information security  weaknesses, including weaknesses related to its internal network,  database, and mainframe security; procurement and administrative  accounting applications; and internal control monitoring. However, as we  reported in our fiscal year 2011 financial audit report, these additional  controls were not always operating as intended or were not effective in  compensating for the associated weaknesses.", "To bolster the security of its networks and systems and to address its  information security weaknesses, IRS has provided a comprehensive  framework for its information security program. The agency has initiatives  under way to further enhance its security posture. For example, during  fiscal year 2011, IRS continued to implement a Security Compliance and  Posture Monitoring and Reporting program to measure, monitor, and  report compliance with security controls. As long as these efforts remain  flexible to address changing technology and evolving threats, include our  findings and those of TIGTA in measuring success, and are fully and  effectively implemented, they should improve the agency\u2019s overall  information security posture.", "However, despite establishing a comprehensive framework for its  information security program, IRS has not fully implemented all  components of its program. These include identifying risks; ensuring  consistent and specific policies and procedures; updating all system  security plans; providing security training to all personnel, including  contractors; effectively testing and evaluating policies, procedures, and  controls; and validating corrective actions.", "According to NIST, risk is determined by identifying potential threats to  the organization and vulnerabilities in its systems, determining the  likelihood that a particular threat may exploit vulnerabilities, and  assessing the resulting impact on the organization\u2019s mission, including  the effect on sensitive and critical systems and data. Identifying and  assessing information security risks are essential to determining what  controls are required. Moreover, by increasing awareness of risks, these  assessments can generate support for the policies and controls that are  adopted in order to help ensure that these policies and controls operate  as intended. In conjunction with NIST guidance, IRS requires its risk  assessment process to detail the residual risk assessed, as well as  potential threats, and to recommend corrective actions for reducing or  eliminating the vulnerabilities identified. The Internal Revenue Manual  also requires system risk assessments to be reviewed annually and  updated a minimum of every 3 years or whenever there is a significant  change to the system, the facilities where the system resides, or other  conditions that may affect the security or status of system accreditation.", "IRS had processes in place to identify and assess information security  risks for the five systems that we reviewed. For example, the agency  used a detailed methodology to conduct risk assessments with key steps  that include threat and vulnerability identification, control analysis, impact  analysis, and mitigation recommendations. The risk assessments that we  reviewed included, among other things, risk and severity level  determination, impact analyses, and recommendations to correct or  mitigate threats and vulnerabilities that were identified. Further, IRS also  addressed a previously identified weakness regarding ensuring the  review of risk assessments for its systems on at least an annual basis.", "Although IRS had a risk assessment process in place, it had not fully  implemented the process. For example, IRS\u2019s general ledger system for  tax-related activities was moved from one mainframe environment to  another at a different facility, but the risk assessment was not updated.  We previously recommended that IRS update the assessment, and the  agency was in the process of addressing this issue at the time of our  review. Until IRS fully implements its policies and procedures for risk  assessments, potential risks to its systems and the adequacy of  associated security controls to reduce these risks could be unknown.", "Another key element of an effective information security program is to  develop, document, and implement risk-based policies, procedures, and  technical standards that govern the security of an agency\u2019s computing  environment. If properly developed and implemented, policies and  procedures should help reduce the risk associated with unauthorized  access or disruption of services. Technical security standards can provide  consistent implementation guidance for each computing environment.  Developing, documenting, and implementing security policies are the  primary mechanisms by which management communicates its views and  requirements; these policies also serve as the basis for adopting specific  procedures and technical controls. In addition, agencies need to take the  actions necessary to effectively implement or execute these procedures  and controls. Otherwise, agency systems and information will not receive  the protection that the security policies and controls should provide.", "With only a few exceptions, IRS had developed and documented its  information security policies and procedures. These policies and  procedures generally address multiple information security components,  including risk assessment, security planning, security training, testing and  evaluating security controls, and contingency planning. However, we  noted instances where documentation had not been fully developed or  documented for systems that we reviewed. For example, IRS had not documented a baseline configuration standard for tasks initiated on its documented monitoring procedures that staff used to review audit  logs for a key financial system;  fully documented monitoring procedures for its procurement system,  specifically supervisory review procedures for ensuring access  privileges were appropriate for segregation of duties; or addressed prior recommendations associated with policies and  procedures. These recommendations covered issues such as  securely configuring routers to encrypt network traffic, configuring  switches to defend against attacks that could crash the network,  notifying the Computer Security Incident Response Center of network  changes that could affect its ability to detect unauthorized access, and  ensuring password controls are consistent.", "Without comprehensive and fully documented policies and procedures,  IRS has limited assurance that staff will consistently implement effective  controls over systems and that its information systems will be protected  as intended. For example, we identified shortcomings in controls  associated with the mainframe configuration and system monitoring.", "An objective of system security planning is to improve the protection of  information technology resources. A system security plan provides an  overview of the system\u2019s security requirements and describes the controls  that are in place or planned to meet those requirements. The Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular A-130 requires that agencies  develop system security plans for major applications and general support  systems, and that these plans address policies and procedures for  providing management, operational, and technical controls. In addition,  the Internal Revenue Manual requires that security plans for information  systems be developed, documented, implemented, reviewed annually,  and updated a minimum of every 3 years or whenever there is a  significant change to the system. In addition, these plans should describe  the security controls in place or planned for IRS systems.", "IRS generally had developed, documented, and updated its system  security plans. IRS documented its management, operational, and  technical controls in each of the five security plans that we reviewed.  These plans were also reviewed within the 3-year time period as required  by IRS policy and included information as required by OMB Circular A- 130 for major applications and general support systems. However, in  March 2011, we reported that the system security plan for one application  still reflected controls from the previous environment even though IRS  had moved this application from one mainframe to another. We  recommended that IRS update the application security plan to describe  controls in place in its current mainframe operating environment. IRS had  initiated, but not completed, its efforts to update the plan. Without an  updated system security plan for this major financial application, IRS  cannot ensure that the most appropriate security controls are in place to  protect the critical information this system houses.", "People are one of the weakest links in attempts to secure systems and  networks. Therefore, an important component of an information security  program is providing sufficient training so that users understand system  security risks and their own role in implementing related policies and  controls to mitigate those risks. The Internal Revenue Manual requires that  all personnel performing information technology security duties meet  minimum continuing professional education hours in accordance with their  roles. Individuals performing a security role are required by IRS to have 12,  8, or 4 hours of specialized training per year, depending on their specific  role. IRS policy also requires that all new employees and contractors  receive security awareness training within the first 10 working days.", "IRS had processes in place for providing employees with security  awareness and specialized training. All employees with specific security- related roles and newly hired employees that we reviewed met or  exceeded the required minimum security awareness and specialized  training hours. However, IRS did not always ensure that contractors  received security awareness training. In March 2010, we reported that  contractors had not received security awareness training within the first  10 working days and recommended that IRS address this weakness.", "Nevertheless, IRS indicated that it had not yet implemented this  recommendation. As a result, IRS has reduced assurance that its  contractors are aware of information security risks associated with their  roles and responsibilities.", "Another key element of an information security program is conducting  tests and evaluations of policies, procedures, and controls to determine  whether they are effective and operating as intended. This type of  oversight is a fundamental element because it demonstrates  management\u2019s commitment to the security program, reminds employees  of their roles and responsibilities, and identifies areas of noncompliance  and ineffectiveness. Although tests and evaluations of policies,  procedures, and controls may encourage compliance with security  policies, the full benefits are not achieved unless the results improve the  security program through implementation of compensating or mitigating  controls if needed. Consistent with FISMA, the Internal Revenue Manual  states that annual security assessments will be conducted to determine if  security controls are operating effectively and correctly implemented. In  addition, the manual states that all IRS systems will be verified for  configuration management compliance by using an approved compliance  verification application.", "IRS has processes in place for performing tests and evaluations of  policies, procedures, and controls. As part of its test and evaluations  process, the agency uses NIST Special Publication 800-53A to select  controls that are applicable to each system. To comply with IRS policy, all  selected system controls were tested during the security assessment and  authorization (SA&A) process, which occurs every 3 years or whenever  there is a significant change to the system. Between authorization  assessments, IRS conducts tests of a portion of the system\u2019s controls. A  third of the controls are selected for the first year after authorization,  another third are selected in the second year, and all the controls are then  tested again for the SA&A process in the third year. IRS refers to the  annual testing process between authorization assessments as its  enterprise continuous monitoring (eCM) program.", "Although IRS has these processes in place, they were not always  effective in determining whether policies, procedures, and controls were  effective and operating as intended. Controls for the systems we  reviewed had been recently tested and evaluated; however, some of the  tests IRS performed were limited. For example, the most recent eCM  tests for the administrative accounting system did not include tests of  access controls, and other tests relied heavily on reviews of plans and  policies rather than actual system tests, such as testing the system\u2019s  configuration. In one case, testers concluded that encryption was in place  by reviewing a diagram and interviewing key staff rather than performing  system testing. Although such a methodology complies with NIST  guidance for moderate risk systems, it does not provide comprehensive  testing of controls for key financial and tax-related systems. Further,  vulnerabilities we identified during our review were not known to IRS  despite those systems being in compliance with the agency\u2019s policies on  periodic control reviews and testing. We have previously made  recommendations pertaining to the limited scope of tests, as well as  issues related to IRS not clearly documenting and reviewing test results;  at the time of our review, these recommendations had not been  implemented. As a result, IRS has limited assurance that controls over its  systems are being effectively implemented and maintained.", "IRS also has processes in place to verify configuration management  compliance; however, tools used in implementing these processes have  shortcomings. In addition to tests and evaluations conducted on a yearly  basis, IRS uses automated compliance verification tools to periodically  test compliance with IRS\u2019s security policies for its three major computing  environments\u2014Windows, UNIX, and mainframe. IRS stated that these  tools, among others, are used as an additional control designed to  partially compensate for and mitigate previously identified risks  associated with outdated software and missing patches for databases, as  well as shortcomings in control testing of its mainframe system. However,  the UNIX tool does not test whether appropriate security patches have  been applied, and the mainframe tool only tests compliance with a limited  subset of the agency\u2019s policies. Therefore, the results from these tools do  not provide management with the information necessary to allow it to  arrive at appropriate conclusions about the security status of these  systems. As a result, IRS may not be fully aware of vulnerabilities that  could adversely affect critical applications and data.", "A remedial action plan is a key component of an agency\u2019s information  security program. Such a plan assists agencies in identifying, assessing,  prioritizing, and monitoring progress in correcting security weaknesses  that are found in information systems. In its annual FISMA guidance to  agencies, OMB requires agency remedial action plans, also known as  plans of action and milestones, to include the resources necessary to  correct identified weaknesses. According to the Internal Revenue Manual,  the agency should document weaknesses found during security  assessments, as well as planned, implemented, and evaluated remedial  actions to correct any deficiencies. IRS policy further requires that IRS  track the status of resolution of all weaknesses and verify that each  weakness is corrected before closing it.", "IRS had a process in place to evaluate and track remedial actions and  had developed remedial action plans to address previously reported  weaknesses, but it did not promptly correct known vulnerabilities, and its  process was not always working as intended. For example, the agency  indicated that 76 of the 105 previously reported weaknesses open at the  end of our prior-year audit had not yet been corrected. In addition, it did  not always validate that its actions to resolve known weaknesses were  effectively implemented. More specifically, of the 29 weaknesses IRS  indicated were corrected, we determined that 13 (about 45 percent) had  not yet been fully addressed. For example, IRS stated that it had  implemented a prior recommendation to improve the scope of testing and  evaluating controls, but as noted in this report, limitations on the scope of  testing continue to exist. This indicates that IRS has not implemented a  revised process to verify that remedial actions are fully implemented, as  we previously recommended. To its credit, IRS partially implemented 6 of  these 13 recommendations, but did not implement corrective actions on  all systems where the weaknesses had been identified. We previously  recommended that IRS implement a revised remedial action verification  process to ensure actions are fully implemented, but this weakness still  persists. Without an effective process to verify that remedial actions are  fully implemented, IRS cannot be assured that it has corrected  vulnerabilities and, consequently, may unknowingly expose itself to  additional risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although IRS implemented numerous controls and procedures intended  to protect key financial and tax-processing systems, control weaknesses  continue to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of  financial and sensitive taxpayer information.

Notable among these  efforts was the formation of cross-functional working groups tasked with  the identification and remediation of specific at-risk control areas. In  addition, the agency continued to make limited progress in correcting or  mitigating previously reported weaknesses, implementing controls over  key financial systems, and developing and documenting a framework for  its comprehensive information security program. However, information  security weaknesses existed in access and other information system  controls over IRS\u2019s financial and tax-processing systems. The financial  and taxpayer information on IRS systems will remain particularly  vulnerable to internal threats until the agency (1) addresses weaknesses  pertaining to identification and authentication, authorization, cryptography,  audit and monitoring, physical security, and configuration management,  and (2) fully implements key components of a comprehensive information  security program that ensures risk assessments are conducted in the  current operating environment; policies and procedures are appropriately  specific and effectively implemented; security plans are written to reflect  the current operating environment; processes intended to test, monitor,  and evaluate internal controls are appropriately detecting vulnerabilities;  processes intended to check configuration management are in place; and  backup procedures are working effectively.", "The new and unresolved deficiencies from previous audits, along with a  lack of fully effective compensating and mitigating controls, impair IRS\u2019s  ability to ensure that its financial and taxpayer information is secure from  internal threats, reducing its assurance that its financial statements and  other financial information are fairly presented or reliable and that sensitive  IRS and taxpayer information is being sufficiently safeguarded from  unauthorized disclosure and modification.
