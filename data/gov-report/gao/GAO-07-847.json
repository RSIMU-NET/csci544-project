GAO testified in 2006 that a number of consular posts had long visa interview wait times.

State's data showed that between September 2005 and February 2006, 97 consular posts reported maximum wait times of 30 or more days in at least 1 month, whereas 53 posts reported such waits for the same period 1 year later. However, despite recent improvements, at times during the past year, a number of posts reported long wait times, which could be expected to reoccur during future visa demand surges. In 2007, State announced a goal of providing applicants an interview within 30 days. Although State's data is sufficiently reliable to indicate that wait times continue to be a problem at some posts, GAO identified shortcomings in the way the data is developed that could mask the severity of the problem. State has implemented steps to reduce wait times at several posts including using temporary duty employees to fill staffing gaps at some posts and repositioning some consular positions to better utilize its current workforce. However, these measures are not permanent or sustainable solutions and may not adequately address the increasing demand for visas worldwide. In addition, State has made improvements to several consular facilities and has identified plans for improvements at several other posts with high workload. Some posts have utilized procedures that enable them to process applications more efficiently. However, not all of these procedures are shared among posts in a systematic way and, therefore, not all posts are aware of them. State has not determined how it will keep pace with growth in visa demand over the long-term. State contracted for a study of visa demand, in select countries, over a 15-year period beginning in 2005, which projected that visa demand will increase dramatically at several posts. However, at some posts, demand has already surpassed the study's projected future demand levels. State has not developed a strategy that considers such factors as available resources and the need for maintaining national security in the visa process, along with its goal that visas are processed in a reasonable amount of time. Given dramatic increases in workload expected at many posts, without such a strategy State will be challenged in achieving its current goal for wait times."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To increase the security of the visa process following the 9/11 terrorist  attacks, Congress and the Department of State (State) initiated multiple  changes to visa laws, policies, and procedures; however, these changes  have also increased the amount of time needed to schedule and adjudicate  a nonimmigrant visa (NIV). Concurrently, annual worldwide demand for  visas has increased for 3 years in a row with levels exceeding 8 million visa  applications for 2006. The increase in demand has made it difficult for  some posts to manage workload without causing applicants to wait  considerable time for an interview.

First, when-actually-employed staff  are only allowed to work 1,040 hours per year due to federal regulations.  Second, posts are typically required to cover the housing costs of assigned  temporary staff, which is not always feasible if posts are facing budget  constraints. Third, embassy or consulate officials that were temporarily  assigned to support consular operations indicated that their new duties  negatively affected their ability to perform their regular assignments, as  they were spending time performing consular duties instead of their  typical functions at post. Fourth, although temporary staff have helped to  improve wait times at select posts, current efforts\u2014and some recent  temporary assignments, such as over the past 7 months in India\u2014have  been undertaken during a period of lower applicant volume. It is unknown  whether State will be able to maintain the improved wait times during the  summer of 2007, as the period between May and August is typically when  posts have the largest influx of visa applicants and, in turn, longer waits.

For example, between fiscal years 2003 and  2005, State obligated $26.9 million to fund consular workspace  improvement projects at 101 posts. Although these improvement projects  have been completed, according to the Bureau of Consular Affairs, most  were designed as temporary solutions that may require additional  construction in the future.

Two posts that we reviewed are  already predicting that future increased demand will outstrip visa  processing capacities given existing facilities constraints. For example, in  Seoul, South Korea, post officials report that, despite recent improvements  to the facility, the post will soon have no additional space to accommodate  future applicant growth. Moreover, there is no current viable option to  build a new facility due to continuing land negotiations between the U.S.  and South Korean governments.

In addition,  in Shanghai, China, even though the consular section was moved to an off- site location to process visa applications, the post has indicated that it  already has reached visa-adjudicating capacity because it cannot add any  more interviewing windows in the current space, and construction on a  new consulate will not begin until 2009. According to the Director and  Chief Operating Officer of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations,  the bureau designs and constructs consular facilities with input from  Consular Affairs; therefore, Consular Affairs needs to provide more  defined assessments of future needs at a facility.

The consulting firm identified some  demographic, economic, political, commercial, and other factors that it  believed would affect visa demand over a 15-year period, beginning in  2005, and estimated a likely rate of growth in demand in those select  countries. The study predicted the growth in demand in these countries  would range between 8 percent and 232 percent, with Argentina, Brazil,  China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia all projected to experience  significant growth of more than 90 percent (see fig. 5). State officials  indicated that they used the futures study to assist in determining consular  resource allocations and in the repositioning of consular staff in State\u2019s  review of consular positions in February 2007.

In addition,  State has not taken action to update the study to reflect changes in visa  workload since 2005. More than half of the countries reviewed are already  facing surges in visa demand greater than the levels predicted in the  Consular Affairs Futures Study for fiscal year 2006 and beyond. For  example, Brazil adjudicated more visas in 2006 than the volume of  applications the study projected for Brazil for 2010. In addition, Mexico  adjudicated approximately 126,000 more visas in 2006 than the study  projected.

Although the visa  improvement plan can assist State in improving the visa process, and State  has taken some steps to address wait times at a number of overseas posts,  State has not determined how it will keep pace with continued growth in  visa demand over the long term. For example, the strategies in the plan do  not identify the resources State would need to increase staff or construct  adequate facilities to handle the projected demand increases. Moreover,  State has not proposed plans to significantly reduce the workload of  available officers or the amount of time needed to adjudicate a visa if such  resources are not available. Without a long-term plan to address increasing  demand, State does not have a tool to make decisions that will maximize  efficiency, minimize wait times, and strengthen its ability to support and  sustain its funding needs.", "In order to develop a strategy addressing future visa demand, State may  want to make use of operations research methods and optimization  modeling techniques. These approaches can allow State to develop a long- term plan that takes into account various factors\u2014such as State\u2019s security  standards for visas, its policies and procedures to maximize efficiency and  minimize waits, and available resources. Researchers have developed  statistical techniques to analyze and minimize wait times in a wide variety  of situations, such as when cars queue to cross toll bridges or customers  call service centers. These techniques consider the key variables that  influence wait times, such as the likely demand, the number of people  already waiting, the number of staff that can provide the service required,  the time it takes to process each person, and the cost of each transaction;  consider a range of scenarios; and provide options to minimize wait times,  bearing in mind the relevant factors. The analyses can, for instance,  provide quantitative data on the extent to which wait times could be  reduced if more staff were assigned or the time for each transaction were  decreased.", "For example, State could determine the approximate number of additional  resources it would need in order to meet its stated goal of providing an  appointment to all applicants within 30 days despite increased visa  demand. Such a response would either require State to provide additional  staff through new hires or by using other staffing methods, such as  utilizing civil servants to adjudicate visas overseas. Alternatively, State  could require consular officers to process applicants more efficiently and  quickly. State may require multiple new facilities to support an increase in  the number of Foreign Service officers and allow posts to process more  applicants daily. However, if State were to determine that a significant  increase in resources for staffing and facilities is not feasible, then State  would have to evaluate the efficacy of its 30-day standard for visa  appointments or consider requesting Congress to allow for changes in the  adjudication process, such as allowing additional flexibility in the personal  appearance requirement for visa applicants.

To accomplish our objectives, we  interviewed officials from State\u2019s bureaus of Consular Affairs, Human  Resources, and Overseas Buildings Operations. We also interviewed  officials from the Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Travel and Tourism  Industries. In addition, we observed consular operations and interviewed  U.S. government officials at 11 posts in eight countries\u2014Brazil, China,  Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, India, South Korea, and the United  Kingdom. For our site visits, we selected posts that had either (1) recently  reported wait times of 60 days or more, (2) had previously experienced  long-standing wait time problems, (3) were projected to experience a large  future volume of visa adjudications, or (4) were able to process a large  volume of visas with little or no wait for applicant interviews. During these  visits, we observed visa operations; interviewed consular staff and  embassy management about visa adjudication policies, procedures, and  resources; and reviewed documents and data. In addition, to obtain a  broader view of visa workload, consular staffing and facilities, as well as  other issues affecting visa wait times in consular sections, we selected an  additional 21 posts for a document review based on the same selection  criteria we used for selecting our site visits. Our selection of posts was  not intended to provide a generalizable sample but allowed us to observe  consular operations under a wide range of conditions.", "To determine the amount of time visa applicants were waiting to obtain a  visa interview, we analyzed interview wait times data for applicants  applying for visas for temporary business or tourism purposes, but not for  other types of visas, including student visas. Specifically, the data provided  to us showed the minimum and maximum wait times for visa-issuing posts  for the period January 2006-February 2007. Data were also provided for  the same period that indicated the number of posts that reported  maximum wait times of 30 or more days in at least 1 month and the  number that reported wait times in excess of 30 days for this entire 6- month period. In addition, at various points-in-time, we received  information on the most recently reported wait times for visa-issuing posts  and the date of last entry. To determine the reliability of State\u2019s data on  wait times for applicant interviews, we reviewed the department\u2019s  procedures for capturing these data, interviewed the officials in  Washington who monitor and use these data, and examined data that was  provided to us electronically. In addition, we interviewed the  corresponding officials from our visits to select posts overseas and in  Washington, who input and use the visa waits data. We found that data  was missing throughout the 13-month period because posts were not  reporting each week. Based on our analysis, we determined that the data  were not sufficiently reliable to determine the exact magnitude of the  delays because the exact number of posts with a wait of 30 days or more  at any given time could not be determined. Consular officials who manage  consular sections overseas acknowledged that many posts are not  reporting on a weekly basis. However, we determined that the data are  sufficiently reliable for providing a broad indication of posts that have had  problems with wait times over a period of time and for general trends in  the number of posts that have had problems with wait times over the 13  months we reviewed.", "To determine the actions State has taken to address visa wait times and its  strategy for addressing waits, we analyzed consular policies and  procedures cables and staffing and facilities plans developed by the  department.

State\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services has acknowledged  that visa applicants may be deterred from visiting the United States by  long appointment wait times and that this could have negative  economic consequences and could adversely affect foreign opinions of  our country. The Department of Commerce points out that foreign  visitors bring economic benefits to our country in excess of $100  billion each year. We agree that it is difficult to correlate visa wait  times with specific dollar value losses in travel and tourism revenues.  However, given that wait times for interviews are very high at a  number of posts, we believe that the loss in economic benefits to our  country over time could potentially be significant.", "Our report acknowledges that visa issuances have increased over the  last several years.  2.  We believe our report, as well as past GAO reports, shows that long  waits for visa interviews have been a long-standing problem for the  department. Furthermore, State\u2019s data show that there have been long  waits at some posts during peak and nonpeak periods (see fig. 2) and  that long waits are not solely cyclical in nature. State acknowledges a  number of cyclical factors that affect visa demand and resource  availability, such as staffing gaps and the personnel transfer cycle. We  believe these and other factors can contribute to chronic as well as  cyclical backlogs. In addition, we have modified the draft to  acknowledge the fact that wait times may reoccur cyclically as well as  unexpectedly. However, the report points toward the need for a  strategy for addressing such delays, which State has not developed to  address either cyclical or chronic visa waits.  3.  We agree that increasing consular staff levels may ultimately be  necessary to address increasing visa demand. This is why we  recommended that State develop a strategy to address wait times and  that, in doing so, identify its resource needs. Such actions could  promote consensus by decision makers on funding levels and  expectations for eliminating visa delays.  4.  We agree that State has taken a number of actions to share information  with posts on reducing wait times. However, as noted in the report,  during our fieldwork, we found that there were instances where posts  were not aware of certain practices and procedures implemented by  other posts to help manage workload and assist in improving applicant  wait times. We understand that all practices may not be transferable to  all posts, but we believe that all posts would benefit from knowing the  options that are available for more efficient operations.  5.  Our report discusses State\u2019s efforts to estimate visa demand and gives  ample credit to the 2006 repositioning exercise to shift some consular  staffing to posts with the greatest need. Furthermore, neither the  annual consular package exercise nor the Consular Affairs Future  Study estimated the resources needed to meet long-term future  demand. Our point is that State has not estimated what resources will  be required to keep up with the increase in future demand that State  forecasts. Because these resources could be substantial, we think it is  incumbent on State to develop a long-term strategy now.  6.  We based our statements on the testimony of State\u2019s Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Visa Services before Congress in March 2007, where he  stated, \u201cwe strive to constantly strike the right balance between  protecting America\u2019s borders and preserving America\u2019s welcome to  international visitors.\u201d We acknowledge that in striking this balance  security is the primary concern. Clearly the time it takes to process an  application affects how many applications an officer can process in a  given day. We are not suggesting that State sacrifice security in order  to avoid visa waits, but rather that State develop a plan for how it will  cope with rising demand, taking these various circumstances and  responsibilities into consideration.  7.  We agree that these are important factors and have modified the text  accordingly.  8.  We understand that there are spikes in visa demand for various  reasons, some of which are difficult to predict. However, State is  aware that such spikes in visa demand can occur. We believe that State  needs a strategy to address growing visa demand that includes  consideration of how it will meet unanticipated spikes in demand. The  development of such a plan would allow State to use its visa surge  teams of temporary duty staff to deal with unanticipated spikes, rather  than using them to handle the anticipated increasing demand.  9.  We have modified language in the report. State\u2019s comment reinforces  our belief that it is time for State to develop a strategy for addressing  long-term visa demand. If State determines it needs more staff to  handle projected demand, then it should detail these needs in its  strategy.  10. We based our comment on a cable prepared by the U.S. Embassy in  London. State acknowledges that the 10-fingerprint requirement could  reduce the number of applicants processed. Applicants are not  interviewed until after their fingerprints are taken, so a reduction in  the number of applicants processed would subsequently result in a  reduction of applicants interviewed. We have modified language in the  draft to clarify our point.  11. We have incorporated information on the Visa Office\u2019s Two-Year Plan  into the report.  12. State does not have a plan that outlines how it will cope with growing  visa demand, which is why we recommend that State develop a  strategy that identifies the actions it will take to address increasing  demand. We believe that there may be opportunities to achieve  efficiencies at some posts and that more resources may be needed.  The short-term, temporary measures that State is currently taking to  address visa demand are not adequate to handle the projected visa  demand. We suggest that State take advantage of available analytical  tools in order to identify options for the development of an overall  strategy that will address the projected increase in visa demand  worldwide. A wide range of sophisticated techniques are available to  help manage customer waiting times in many areas of government  operations, such as testing drivers at departments of motor vehicles  and treating patients at public health clinics. Our report does not  recommend that State reduce the processing time at the expense of  security. We agree that State must maintain its security responsibilities  while facilitating legitimate travel to the United States."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, John Brummet, Assistant  Director; Joe Brown; Joe Carney; Martin de Alteriis; Jeff Miller; Mary  Moutsos; and Melissa Pickworth made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
