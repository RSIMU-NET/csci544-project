This report assesses (1) trends in DOD spending on contracted services, (2) DOD's insight into its requirements for contracted services, and (3) how DOD reports on contracted services in its budget requests to Congress. GAO analyzed the most recent data available on DOD service contract spending from fiscal years 2010 through 2014, reviewed programming guidance and budget documents as well as a non-generalizable selection of six program office inputs to the budget and planning process for three military commands that spent the most on services in 2013, and interviewed DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 5 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) consistently obligated more on services than products. These obligations are significant. For example, in 2014 alone, DOD obligated $85 billion on its three largest types of services\u2014knowledge-based, research and development, and facility-related services. This amount was more than double the amount DOD obligated for aircraft, land vehicles and ships, the three largest product categories DOD acquired.", "Program offices within each of the military departments that GAO met with maintained data on current and estimated future spending needs for contracted service requirements, but they did not identify service contract spending needs beyond the next year, as there was no requirement to do so. As a result, DOD leadership's insight into future spending on contracted services is limited. DOD programming policy requires the military departments and defense agencies to develop a program objective memorandum (POM) that identifies and prioritizes requirements and total funding needs for the current budget year and then four additional years into the future. This policy and the military departments' supplemental POM guidance, however, do not address contracted services. The military departments have started efforts to collect data on contract services requirements beyond the budget year but these efforts could result in the collection of disparate data. For example, the Army plans to request data from program offices on all service contracts to be awarded over the next 5 years. In contrast, the Air Force plans to continue to collect data only for service contracts using operations and maintenance funds beyond the budget year. Unless DOD establishes a mechanism to coordinate efforts\u2014a key internal control standard\u2014it risks collecting different data leading to inconsistency across the department.", "DOD's budget exhibits on contract services provide limited visibility to Congress on planned spending, and the primary exhibit for contracted services does not meet statutory reporting requirements. In 2009, Congress required DOD to develop an exhibit to summarize its service contract spending, in part, to improve oversight by DOD and Congress of DOD's contracted services. In its fiscal year 2014 exhibit, however, DOD excluded up to $100 billion\u2014almost two-thirds\u2014of its estimated spending on contracted services, including those for contingency operations and for medical care, on which it was statutorily required to report. Unlike DOD budget exhibits for weapon systems, DOD's other budget exhibits that contain limited information on contracted services do not include data on projected spending beyond the current budget year. Without a roadmap of future service contract spending needs, Congress has limited visibility into an area that constitutes more than half of DOD's annual contract spending."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider amending reporting requirements to include estimated spending on services beyond the budget year.

Contractors perform a wide array of critical functions such as  supporting DOD weapons programs, maintaining defense facilities, or  maintaining equipment. Given the magnitude of spending, effective  management of DOD contracted services is imperative and DOD has set  a goal of improving its management of service contracts through efforts  like the Better Buying Power initiatives. In response to these initiatives,  as well as congressional mandates, DOD has taken several actions since  2010 intended to improve its management of the broad range of services  it acquires. These actions include categorizing service acquisitions by  portfolio groups, such as research and development and knowledge- based services; appointing senior leaders within the military departments  to coordinate the acquisition of these services; and better integrating  contracting and financial management information. Despite these efforts,  our prior work has shown that DOD continues to face several challenges  related to services acquisition, such as having adequate data on the  current state of service acquisitions, which contributed to the inclusion of  DOD contract management to our high-risk list.", "The House Armed Services Committee report 113-446 contained a  provision for us to assess the processes and procedures DOD employs to  acquire services. This report assesses DOD\u2019s processes for developing  requirements and budgeting for contracted services. Specifically, this  report (1) examines trends in DOD spending on contracted services, (2)  assesses the extent to which DOD has insight into the use of contracted  services to fulfill current and future requirements, and (3) assesses how  DOD reports on contracted services in its annual budget request to  Congress.", "To examine trends in DOD spending on contracted services, we analyzed  the five most recent years of Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) data, fiscal years 2010 through 2014, and  grouped this data using DOD-defined categories of services, referred to  as portfolio groups. We also compared DOD spending trends on  products to services over the same 5-year period. To corroborate the  FPDS-NG data, we compared it to DOD financial data on obligations to  contracted services as reported by the DOD Comptroller. We determined  the FPDS-NG data to be sufficiently reliable for examining trends in DOD  spending on contracted services.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has insight into the use of contracted  services to fulfill current and future requirements, we reviewed DOD  Directive 7045.14, \u201cThe Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and  Execution (PPBE) Process\u201d and supplemental guidance issued by the  military departments. To determine how these processes were  implemented by each military department, we selected three military  commands that had among the most obligations on contracted services  during fiscal year 2013 based on data from FPDS-NG. These commands  included the Army Materiel Command, Air Force Materiel Command, and  Naval Sea Systems Command. For each military department and  selected commands, we collected and reviewed the applicable military  department and command-specific guidance governing programming,  including the formulation of the Program Objective Memorandum  (POM)\u2014DOD\u2019s 5-year funding plan for current and future requirements\u2014 to determine the extent to which contracted services were required to be  documented. We also reviewed programming documentation, including  inputs to the POM, and underlying supporting documents provided by  program offices at the three military commands. To select program  offices, we cross-referenced FPDS-NG data with DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013  inventory of contracted services, the most complete year at the time of  our review, to identify those offices that obligated the most to knowledge- based services\u2014the largest group of services DOD acquires annually\u2014 within each of those commands. We selected a total of six program  offices, including at least two from each command, based on such factors  as the amount of obligations on contracted services, the types of services  acquired, and the program office\u2019s location. For each program office, we  reviewed its input to the POM and underlying support. We also identified  how contracted services were documented and reported to determine  what information program offices maintained on estimated future service  contract spending. We selected a small sample of program offices at  each military department because this approach allowed us to obtain  more in-depth information for each office. Given the size of our sample,  our findings cannot be generalizable to all DOD program offices, but the  information gathered provides illustrative examples of the level of  contracted services data available.", "Because each military department uses a different approach to  developing and approving the POM, we interviewed officials within each  military department to collect information on how contracted services are  included in the POM. These officials included the program officials  responsible for planning for the requirement as well as the programming  officials within the command or military department offices responsible for  issuing POM guidance and approving requirements and funding. We also  interviewed military department budgeting officials on how programming  and budget data is collected, stored, and used within each military  department, the extent to which their budget databases include  information on service contracts, and the steps, if any, that DOD plans to  take to improve programming, budgeting, and forecasting of contracted  services. In addition, we reviewed DOD services acquisition policies and  interviewed senior officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)),  including those within Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, and  the senior service managers from each military department concerning  their use of contracted services data to carry out their management and  oversight responsibilities. We also interviewed officials within the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) office on the type of data  the department collects and maintains on future service contract  spending.", "To assess how DOD reports on the procurement of contracted services in  its annual budget request to Congress, we reviewed the statutory  requirements found in section 235, title 10 United States Code, DOD\u2019s  financial management regulation, and selected budget exhibits.  Specifically, we analyzed DOD\u2019s contract services budget exhibit required  by section 235 of title 10, United States Code in its fiscal year 2014  Operation and Maintenance Overview, the most complete year at the  time of our review, to determine compliance with section 235. We also  reviewed selected budget exhibits accompanying the fiscal year 2014 and  2015 President\u2019s budget that could contain contracted service information  based on our review of DOD\u2019s financial management regulation, including  the PB-15, Advisory and Assistance Services, and OP-32, Summary of  Price and Program Changes exhibits.

In  fiscal year 2014, DOD obligated over $156 billion on contracted services,  which constituted more than half of DOD\u2019s total contract spending.  Service contracts directly engage the time and effort of a contractor  whose primary purpose is to perform an identifiable task rather than to  furnish an end item of supply. For example, a service contract can be  used to obtain systems engineering support for a major weapons  program. Fulfillment of these contract requirements, in turn, enables DOD  to provide specific capabilities to meet mission needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Efforts to Improve Management and Oversight of Service Acquisition", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, Congress has required and our past work has recommended  that DOD take several steps to improve, among other things, service  acquisition planning, tracking, and oversight.

USD(AT&L) and the  military departments established an initial management structure for the  review and approval of service acquisitions in 2002. Similarly, in 2003 and  2006, we made a number of recommendations to DOD, including that it  take a more strategic approach to its acquisition and management of  services. In 2006, for example, we recommended, among other things,  that DOD establish a normative position of how and where service acquisition  dollars are currently and will be spent (including volume, type, and  trends); and determine areas of specific risk that are inherent in acquiring services  and that should be managed with greater attention (including those  areas considered sensitive or undesirable in terms of quantity or  performance).", "DOD agreed that a more coordinated, integrated and strategic approach  for acquiring services was needed. In particular, DOD noted that it would  reassess its strategic approach to acquiring services, including examining  the types and kinds of services it acquires and developing an integrated  assessment of how best to acquire such services. Since then,  USD(AT&L) has taken several actions intended to improve its  management of services. For example, in September 2010, USD(AT&L)  issued the first of three Better Buying Power memoranda that included  steps to improve service acquisitions. In the November 2010  memorandum that followed it, USD(AT&L) directed that each military  department establish the position of a Senior Services Manager,  responsible for planning, executing, strategically sourcing, and managing  service contracts for their military departments, and to serve as the  approval authority for service acquisitions valued at less than  $250 million.", "Additionally, in November 2010, the Director of Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy directed the military departments to organize services  spending data into six portfolio groups, later increased to nine, to  enhance its ability to analyze service contract spending. In its April 2013  Better Buying Power initiative memorandum, USD(AT&L) also identified  that by managing service acquisition by portfolio group, the senior  services managers should be able to work with requiring activities to  forecast future services requirements. (see table 1 for examples of  services within each portfolio group).", "In June 2013, we found that USD(AT&L) and military department  leadership had demonstrated a commitment to improving management of  service acquisition, but that it faced challenges in developing goals and  metrics to assess outcomes due to limitations with corroborating data  between its contracting and financial data systems. DOD concurred with  our recommendation in the June 2013 report to identify baseline data on  service acquisitions, in part, by using budget and spending data to gauge  the effects of improvements. In that report, we also found that DOD was  already taking some steps to improve insight into DOD\u2019s contracted  services. For example, USD (AT&L) initiated efforts to link contracting  system data to financial system data through a January 2013  memorandum that directed all DOD components to assign product and  service codes at a contract line item level of detail. According to the  memorandum, capturing product service codes at a contract line item  level of detail in DOD\u2019s contracting systems will minimize data errors in  FPDS-NG and enable linkage of contracting and financial data systems.

This process, which is governed by  DOD Directive 7045.14 and supplemented by military department  guidance, is conducted under four phases (see figure 1).", "The process includes constructing a 5-year funding plan called the Future  Years Defense Program (FYDP). The FYDP provides DOD and Congress  a tool for looking at future funding needs beyond immediate budget  priorities. The FYDP, which is submitted to Congress, is a DOD database  and internal accounting system that contains and summarizes information  on DOD\u2019s forces, resources, and equipment that are part of all DOD  programs approved by the Secretary of Defense. In 1987, Congress  directed the Secretary of Defense to submit the 5-year defense program,  in part, to establish a mechanism to help inform DOD and the Congress  on current and planned resources as decisions are made. The FYDP  reflects decisions made in the DOD PPBE process and represents  estimated appropriation needs for the budget year for which funds are  being requested from Congress and at least the 4 years following it.", "Each phase of the PPBE process is dependent on the preceding phase  and DOD is always working through multiple phases of the PPBE process  for multiple fiscal years at any given time during a calendar year. For  example, at the beginning of calendar year 2015, the planning phase  began with the development of the Defense Planning guidance for the  fiscal year 2018-2022 POM, while DOD was also in the programming and  budgeting phases to develop the fiscal year 2017-2021 POM and 2017  budget submission, which all occurred as DOD was in the execution  phase of the fiscal year 2015 budget (see figure 2).", "The planning phase is the first step of the PPBE process and occurs near  the beginning of each calendar year. In this phase, DOD is to determine  what capabilities are needed in the future. At the end of the planning  phase, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is to issue  the Defense Planning Guidance to DOD components. This guidance  includes major DOD planning objectives and scenarios, strategic factors,  and fiscal limitations. The Defense Planning Guidance is then to be  factored into the development of component POMs. POMs are to be  established by each DOD component for their programs and are 5-year  funding plans for the specific capabilities needed to meet planning  guidance objectives, and are to be submitted to DOD senior leaders for  review.", "The programming phase follows the planning phase and begins in the  April to May time frame. Its purpose includes prioritizing the programs  which best meet the military strategy needs, as documented in the  Defense Planning Guidance. More specifically, it is when the DOD  components, with input from their DOD commands and program offices,  are to determine the requirements needed to provide capabilities for  national security. This information is then to be presented in the POM.  The POM is completed at least two years before the estimated funds will  be spent and documents funding needs for 5 years into the future.

The BES and the POM  submissions are to be used by each DOD component financial  management office and DOD Comptroller to formulate the President\u2019s  budget request. The DOD Comptroller and the OMB review the  submissions to ensure that program funding aligns with current policy and  is justified to Congress. The President\u2019s budget is required to be  submitted to Congress no later than the first Monday of February. In the  President\u2019s budget, contracted services are identified by eight spending  categories, known as object class codes, as shown in table 2.", "Services within these codes may be associated with more than one of  DOD\u2019s portfolio groups.

According to the Navy Senior Services Manager, this limits the  department\u2019s insight into future spending on capabilities that program  offices have determined will be met through long-term service contracts,  such as food services or base operating support. Similarly, the Air Force\u2019s  Senior Services Manager and representatives from its Financial  Management office stated that the current POM and budgeting process  does not provide them adequate insight into the requirements for service  contracts over the remaining years of the FYDP.", "The absence of policy or guidance requiring the military departments to  report on the extent to which contracted services will be used to address  requirements\u2014data that is generally maintained and readily available by  the program offices we reviewed\u2014identified in the POM increases the  risk that key information may not be considered when senior DOD  leadership approves future requirements. Federal internal control  standards require management to use quality information to both mitigate  risks and achieve agency objectives, such as better managing spending  on contracted services. Until DOD takes action to better identify and  forecast contract service requirements, the department is at continued  risk of planning and approving requirements without information on how  services, which constitute the majority of DOD contract spending, will be  used.", "Additionally, by including projected service contract spending in the POM,  DOD would be better positioned to address Congressional requirements  to report on future spending that, to date, it has not been able to do.  Specifically, section 955(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2013 required DOD to, among other things, report on  projected savings associated with civilian and contracted services  workforce from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, relative to the savings in  funding for basic military personnel pay achieved from reductions in  military end strengths over the same period of time. In its 2014 report to  Congress, DOD noted that it could not provide insight into projected  savings for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 because it does not forecast  service contractor requirements beyond the budget year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Departments Have Taken Ad Hoc Steps to Forecast Contracted Services Requirements, but These Efforts Lack Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Each military department has undertaken some initial steps to better  project contract services requirements beyond the budget year but these  efforts could result in the collection of different data. For example:  In 2014, the Secretary of the Navy directed that the Assistant  Secretaries of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition  and for Financial Management and Comptroller develop a means to  integrate contract services into the planning, programming, and  budgeting processes to better manage service contract planning and  execution in response to budgetary pressures. The Secretary of the  Navy expected that by increasing visibility and granularity of  contracted services requirements in the POM, the Navy would be  better positioned to responsibly meet budget constraints. By the 2019  POM, the Navy plans to establish an integrated Navy-wide business  intelligence tool that would enable the department to track the  identification, validation, funding, and spending related to contracted  services requirements through the FYDP in existing information  systems. The Navy\u2019s Senior Service Manager believes that by doing  so, the department will better be able to plan requirements for service  contracts and make informed decisions about opportunities to acquire  services in a more effective manner. The Office of the Chief of Naval  Operations for Undersea Warfare has also taken steps to address the  Secretary of the Navy\u2019s requirement by directing program offices to  include overall estimated spending by service object class code and  list all contracts that fall under those codes for the 2017-2021 POM.", "Army PAE officials stated that they plan to direct Army commands to  identify all requirements and their associated service contracts in the  fiscal year 2018-2022 POM. These officials stated that they plan to  request data from program offices, such as product service code data,  on all service contracts to be awarded over the next 5 years. Army  PAE officials stated this effort is intended to resolve gaps in their  insight into future service contract requirements and to better control  spending on service contracts. Officials stated that this approach was  piloted on a limited basis at one organization within the Army Training  and Doctrine Command. Army PAE officials report that the effort was  successful, capturing estimates for 176 current or future service  contracts, but the accuracy of these estimates cannot be verified until  2019, when spending on these contracts can be tracked. Army  Training and Doctrine Command officials that developed the data  stated that the Army should consider incrementally implementing this  effort Army-wide to develop lessons learned and ensure good data is  collected, in part, because the pilot was narrowly scoped.", "An Air Force financial management official stated that the Air Force  plans to continue its current process. For example, as part of the  POM, program offices provide data that is used by the Air Force  financial management office to develop service contract spending  estimates by object class code. An Air Force financial management  official stated that through its budgeting process, it can estimate  spending for the next fiscal year. Beyond that, however, their budget  systems do not fully identify estimated spending for contract services.  For example, object class code data is collected through the FYDP for  operations and maintenance related funding, but not for services  associated with weapon system development and procurement.", "Additionally, DOD\u2019s January 2016 service acquisition instruction requires  that each military department\u2019s Senior Services Manager develop service  contract forecasting tools that will be used, in part, to aid in budgeting.  The instruction, however, does not specify how far into the future and the  level of detail the tools should provide. Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy officials, who developed the instruction, stated that  additional guidance will need to be developed to assist the Senior  Services Managers.", "The Senior Services Managers, which traditionally have been responsible  for overseeing the execution of higher dollar service contracts, stated they  face several challenges in meeting this new forecasting requirement.  First, they noted they do not have a role in defining, validating, or funding  requirements, nor do they play a role in determining which requirements  should be contracted for or what portion of the budget will be spent on  contracted services, which is the responsibility of commands and program  offices. Further, the Navy and the Air Force senior services managers  noted they do not collect information to forecast future service contract  requirements, while the Army senior services manager collects  information on service contracts that are to be awarded in the next year  with an estimated value of over $10 million. These contracts represented  about 40 percent of the Army\u2019s total spend on new service contracts in  fiscal year 2014. The Senior Services Managers believed that efforts to  include services in DOD\u2019s established POM process could help address  this new forecasting requirement if they were provided with such data.", "While the military departments and USD(AT&L) are attempting to improve  insight into future spending on contracted services, each is taking a  different approach and DOD has not articulated a unified or  comprehensive approach to doing so. Further, in addition to the military  departments\u2019 programming and budgeting offices, a number of other  organizations within DOD are also involved in the process for identifying,  approving, or funding future service contract requirements, including  DOD\u2019s Cost Assessment Program Evaluation Office and Comptroller,  which could benefit from information derived from these efforts. Given  that many of these efforts are in their initials stages, senior DOD officials  explained the department does not have a mechanism, such as a working  group, to coordinate and communicate results from these efforts. Federal  internal control standards require that management communicate the  types and quality of information needed to achieve objectives. Without  clear direction and coordination, however, through a working group or  some other mechanism, DOD increases its risk that the data being  collected will not be consistent, reliable or useful in achieving its  objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Budget Exhibits Submitted to Congress Provide Limited Visibility into Contracted Services Spending", "paragraphs": ["DOD budget exhibits provide limited visibility to Congress on planned  spending for contracted services.

DOD submitted its first exhibit in  February 2011, accompanying its budget request for fiscal year 2012, and  has done so annually since then. These exhibits, however, do not fully  include DOD\u2019s budget request for contracted services, as required by  section 235, title 10, United States Code, because it improperly excluded  projected spending for \u201cmedical contracts,\u201d \u201coverseas contingency  operations,\u201d and \u201cother government purchases.\u201d For example, in fiscal  year 2014, the DOD Comptroller requested approximately $217 billion for  contracted services. Of this, we determined that after appropriately  excluding spending on services such as the nearly $61 billion requested  for research and development, DOD should have reported approximately  $155.7 billion in its contracted services exhibit. The fiscal year 2014  exhibit, however, only reported a total of $55.8 billion for contracted  services and improperly excluded nearly $100 billion in requested  spending for medical care, other government purchases, and overseas  contingency operations appropriations (see figure 7).", "Representatives from DOD\u2019s General Counsel acknowledged that they  could not identify any legal basis for DOD to categorically exclude  spending for these three types of services from the budget exhibit. They  stated that DOD had intended to attain consistency across multiple  contract services reporting requirements. For example, a DOD  Comptroller official stated that they used the same approach to address  the section 235 reporting requirement as was used to respond to service  contracts spending limitation requirements in section 808 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which authorized DOD to  exclude some services, such as overseas contingency operation funding.  In addition, DOD officials explained that they also sought to avoid  inclusion of spending within the medical care services and other federal  purchases categories that they may not consider to be contracted  services. For example, officials stated that they excluded the medical care  object class code in part because it includes payments to insurance  carriers which do not involve contracted services to DOD in the  conventional sense. Nevertheless, this approach has resulted in DOD not  meeting its reporting requirements on services. The DOD Comptroller is  considering including additional contracted services, such as those  funded through overseas contingency operation appropriations, in future  budget exhibits. Until DOD takes action to modify its approach for  complying with Section 235 of title 10, United States Code, it will continue  to underreport estimated spending on services and inhibit congressional  oversight.

As part of the President\u2019s  budget request\u2014which outlines budget year request data by object class  code for each military department appropriation\u2014DOD\u2019s requested  funding for a portion of contracted services are found within two budget  exhibits: PB-15, Advisory and Assistance Services, and OP-32, Summary  of Price and Program Changes. The PB-15 summarizes each military  department\u2019s budget request for advisory and assistance services  associated with the operations and maintenance appropriation for the  current budget year. This exhibit also provides data on what Congress  appropriated and DOD spent for the prior fiscal year for these services.

Similar to the PB-15, this exhibit provides data on the  current budget year and the two preceding fiscal years (see figure 9 for  an excerpt from the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2015 OP-32 exhibit).", "In contrast, the Financial Management Regulation requires up to 28  budget exhibits for the procurement of weapon system programs valued  at $5 million or more, which include estimated costs through the 5-year  period of the FYDP. DOD budget exhibits for weapon systems are not  required, however, to specifically identify contracted services that may be  acquired in support of these weapon systems. For example, the Air  Force\u2019s Exhibit P-3A for modifications to the Minuteman III system, a  land-based intercontinental ballistic missile requested $11.8 million in  procurement funding in fiscal year 2015. In this exhibit, for fiscal year  2015, the program requested $4.1 million under a line item identified as  Program Management Administration.

Congress, however,  has expressed interest in greater oversight of DOD future year spending  on contracted services. Although DOD program offices have information  available through the FYDP for service contracts spending, there is no  requirement to provide such information to Congress.

Improving its ability to strategically manage service  acquisitions, a stated DOD objective, remains imperative as DOD  consistently spends the majority of its contract dollars on services. As we  noted almost a decade ago, critical to being more strategic is knowing  what you are spending today and what you intend to spend in the future.  In that regard, DOD programs have data on not only what they intend to  spend next year on services, but, within reason, how much they anticipate  spending beyond the budget year. Despite the availability of this data,  senior DOD leadership has limited insight on future spending because  DOD and the military departments\u2019 guidance governing the programming  process do not require that it be provided. In other words, data on  planned spending on contracted services do not get shared beyond the  program office. As a result, DOD may be missing an opportunity to make  more strategic decisions and improve the management and oversight of  more than half its contract dollars. As the military departments\u2019 processes  vary, determining how best to collect the data, and what data to collect, is  important. For example, each of the military department\u2019s senior services  managers will be responsible for developing forecasts of future spending  on contracted services and each military department has efforts  underway to collect data on service contract spending, though each effort  appears to be following different paths. Without some mechanism, such  as a working group, to coordinate these efforts, DOD may be at risk of  having inconsistent data that will hinder it from moving forward on an  enterprise-wide basis.", "Information on estimated service contract spending degrades further as  DOD provides it to Congress in its annual budget exhibits. DOD provides  Congress data on service contract spending in several budget exhibits,  but only for the upcoming budget year and no further. Moreover, DOD\u2019s  principal budget exhibit developed to respond to legislative requirements  inappropriately excludes almost two thirds of its spending that is required  to be reported. Until DOD takes action to modify its approach for reporting  contracted services in its budget exhibits to fully comply with reporting  requirements, Congress will not have the statutorily required information  needed to help conduct oversight. Even when corrected, however, DOD\u2019s  exhibits will provide visibility only as far as the current budget year, which  diminishes the Congress\u2019s ability to consider DOD\u2019s future service  contract spending needs. By contrast, DOD weapon system budget  exhibits include not only current spending needs but information on  estimated needs over the next 5 years. Since DOD program offices are  generally able to forecast service contract spending through the future  year defense program, Congress could augment current DOD reporting  requirements to request such information for contracted services over a  5-year period.
