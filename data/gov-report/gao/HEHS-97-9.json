The medical criteria consist of a list of diagnoses organized by body system and a number of levels of medical severity specified for each diagnosis. The schedule assigns a percentage evaluation, commonly referred to as a disability rating, to each level of severity associated with a diagnosis. The disability rating conceptually reflects the average impairment in earning capacity associated with each level of severity. For example, VA presumes that the loss of a foot as a result of military service results in a 40-percent impairment in earning capacity, on average, among veterans with this injury. All veterans who lose a foot as a result of military service, therefore, are entitled to a 40-percent disability rating whether this injury actually reduces their earning capacity by more than 40 percent or not at all.

Extra-schedular awards allow veterans to receive compensation for a rating higher than the one specified in the schedule for their condition. In a case of unemployability, for example, if the criteria in the schedule indicate that a veteran\u2019s condition warrants at least a 60-percent disability rating but VA determines that, on the basis of that veteran\u2019s unusual circumstances, he or she is unable to obtain and sustain gainful employment, VA can raise the compensation for that veteran to the amount provided for a 100-percent rating.", "VA regulations also allow veterans to be compensated for \u201csocial inadaptability\u201d or \u201csocial impairment\u201d to the extent it affects industrial adaptability.

Nor has it been considered when determining the rating that condition should be assigned in the schedule. In 1945, when the framework for the current schedule was developed, the job market was oriented toward physical labor, and physical capacity was expected to have a major influence on earning capacity. At that time, a Disability Policy Board, consisting of doctors and lawyers, set the disability ratings for the conditions contained in the schedule. According to a former Director of VA\u2019s Compensation and Pension Service, VA\u2019s Department of Medicine and Surgery, now the Veterans Health Administration, provided the Board with a medical monograph\u2014a detailed description of etiology and manifestations\u2014for each of the conditions included in the schedule at that time. The Board used these monographs to estimate the relative effects different levels of severity of a condition have on the average veteran\u2019s ability to compete for employment in the job market. It set disability ratings on this basis. Thus, ratings for conditions that limited physical ability, such as the loss of the use of an arm or leg, were expected to greatly impair veterans\u2019 average earning capacity and were given a relatively high rating.", "Since 1945, VA has made many revisions to the schedule. The revisions have included modifications to medical criteria associated with the ratings, changes in the maximum convalescence period allowed before requiring reevaluation of the condition, and addition of more levels of evaluations or ratings. The revisions, however, have not been based on empirical data on the effects certain conditions have on veterans\u2019 earnings.", "According to VA Compensation and Pension officials, the basic procedure used to determine what disability rating to assign to a condition has not changed since 1945. This determination has been and continues to be based on the judgment of individuals with knowledge and expertise in this area. When adjusting ratings for conditions already in the schedule or assigning ratings to new conditions added to the schedule, VA\u2019s goal has been to maintain the internal consistency of the schedule over time. In doing so, VA tries to ensure that new or adjusted ratings are consistent with the ratings of analogous conditions and reasonable relative to all other conditions. As a result, the ratings in the 1945 schedule have been, in effect, the benchmark for all the ratings adjusted and added since then, and VA officials acknowledge that the ratings in the current schedule are consistent with the ratings developed in 1945."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in the Economy and Society Since 1945 Indicate That Ratings May Need Updating", "paragraphs": ["Even if functional capacity accurately approximated disabled veterans\u2019 reduction in earning capacity in 1945, changes have occurred since then that have implications for how accurately those ratings reflect disabled veterans\u2019 reduction in earning capacity today.

There have also been changes in the labor market and social attitudes toward the disabled that may affect disabled veterans\u2019 ability to work.", "Since 1945, medical and technological advances have enabled individuals with some types of disabilities to obtain and sustain employment. Advances in the management of disabilities, like medication to control mental illness or computer-aided prosthetic devices that return some functioning to the physically impaired, have helped reduce the severity of the functional loss caused by both mental and physical disabilities. Electronic communications and assistive technologies, such as synthetic voice systems, standing wheelchairs, and modified automobiles and vans, have given people with certain types of disabilities more independence and potential to work.", "There has also been a shift in the U.S. economy since 1945 from predominantly labor and manufacturing to skill- and service-based jobs. In the 1960s, earning capacity became more related to a worker\u2019s skills and training than to his or her ability to perform physical labor. Advancements in technology, including computers and automated equipment, following World War II and the Korean Conflict reduced the need for physical labor. The goods-producing sector\u2019s share of the economy\u2014mining, construction, and manufacturing\u2014declined from about 44 percent in 1945 to about 21 percent in 1994.

However, new treatments and medications have made it possible for individuals with some mental illnesses to function more fully today. About 20 percent of the veterans on the disability rolls as of September 30, 1995, were receiving compensation for psychiatric and neurological conditions, whereas 80 percent were being compensated for general medical or surgical conditions, or physical disabilities (see table 4).", "In addition, in recent decades there has been a trend toward greater inclusion of and participation by people with disabilities in the mainstream of society. Changes in public attitudes toward people with disabilities have resulted, over the past 2 decades, in public policy requiring the removal of environmental and social barriers that prevent the disabled from fully participating in the workforce as well as in their communities. The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which supports the full participation of people with disabilities in society, fosters the expectation that people with disabilities can work.

One was conducted by a presidential commission in the mid-1950s and a second by VA in the late 1960s. Both concluded, for various reasons, that at least some disability ratings in the schedule did not accurately reflect the average impairment in earning capacity among disabled veterans and needed to be adjusted.", "The President\u2019s Commission on Veterans\u2019 Pensions, commonly called the Bradley Commission, was created in 1955 \u201cto carry out a comprehensive study of the laws and policies pertaining to pension, compensation, and related nonmedical benefits\u201d for veterans. As part of this study, the Commission examined VA\u2019s Schedule for Rating Disabilities. To determine whether the schedule at that time constituted an adequate and equitable basis for compensating disabled veterans, the Commission examined (1) the medical criteria in the schedule and (2) the disability ratings associated with these medical criteria.", "On the basis of the results of a survey designed to obtain the views of medical specialists nationwide, the Commission concluded that the medical criteria in the schedule did not reflect the advances that had been made in medicine since 1945. The Commission also asked 169 physicians whether they believed the ratings fairly represented the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from the various degrees of severity of physical impairment. Forty percent of the 153 physicians who responded believed that the ratings fairly represented average impairment in earning capacity, 40 percent believed the ratings did not, and 20 percent did not respond or gave vague responses. Many of those who believed the schedule\u2019s ratings in general fairly represented average impairment of earning capacity, however, believed that the ratings for the lower disability percentages (usually below 30 percent) did not.", "The Commission\u2019s comparison of the earnings and income of disabled veterans with the earnings and income of nondisabled veterans and others indicated that, with the exception of totally disabled veterans and elderly disabled veterans, there was little difference in combined median annual earned income of these groups. The Commission concluded that the amount of disability compensation seemed to make up for the difference in overall income between the two groups. But this compensation was not based on the average impairment in earnings capacity. The Commission observed that no studies had been conducted to measure the actual impairment in earnings capacity among the disabled, and the standard used to set disability ratings in the schedule was geared to the impairment of the individual who performs manual labor. Thus, because \u201cfunctional physical capacity\u201d has a major effect on a laborer\u2019s ability to work, the Committee concluded that physical impairment has been VA\u2019s predominant standard for setting disability ratings.", "In addition to presenting the results of its study, the Commission pointed out that advances have been made in surgery, prosthetics, medical treatment, and rehabilitation since the schedule was revised in 1945 and that these advances could change the extent to which physical impairment affects earning capacity. The Commission also noted that the job market has shifted from predominantly manual labor jobs to more clerical and service-oriented jobs. Thus, the Commission concluded that the rating schedule tended to be less representative of the average impairment in earning capacity of veterans who performed nonmanual labor jobs.", "The Commission\u2019s overall recommendation with regard to the schedule was that it should be revised thoroughly on the basis of factual data to ensure that it reflects veterans\u2019 average reduction in earning capacity, as required by law. The Commission stated that the basic purpose of the program is economic maintenance and, therefore, it is appropriate to compare periodically the average earnings of the working population and the earnings of disabled veterans, and update the schedule accordingly to help ensure that veterans are adequately compensated for the average reduction in earnings they experience as a result of their service-connected conditions.", "In the late 1960s, VA conducted the ECVARS in response to the Bradley Commission recommendations and recurring criticisms that ratings in the schedule were not accurate. This study was designed to estimate the average loss in earning capacity among disabled veterans by calculating the difference between the earnings of disabled veterans, by condition, and the earnings of nondisabled veterans, controlling for age, education, and region of residence. The ECVARS is the most comprehensive assessment of the validity of the ratings ever done. On the basis of the results, VA concluded that of the approximately 700 diagnostic codes reviewed, the ratings for 330 overestimated veterans\u2019 average loss in earnings due to their conditions, and about 75 underestimated the average loss among veterans. For example, for the disarticulation of an arm (amputation through the joint where the shoulder and arm join), VA estimated a 60-percent rating more closely approximated veterans\u2019 average reduction in earning capacity than the 90-percent rating listed in the schedule. VA also estimated that a 40-percent rating was more representative of veterans\u2019 average reduction in earning capacity for the disarticulation of the thigh (with the loss of extrinsic pelvic girdle muscles) than the 90 percent that was listed in the schedule. Some of the ratings that underestimated veterans\u2019 reduction in earning capacity were assigned to mental conditions. For example, VA estimated that pronounced neurotic symptoms so severe that they would impair a veteran\u2019s ability to obtain or retain employment would result in an 80-percent reduction in earning capacity as opposed to the 70 percent listed in the schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Not Taken Adequate Steps to Help Ensure That Ratings Reflect Loss in Earnings", "paragraphs": ["VA has not systematically reviewed and adjusted the disability ratings in the schedule to reflect the current average impairment in earning capacity.

We recommended that VA update the medical criteria in the schedule and keep them current. In response to these recommendations, VA is in the process of systematically updating the medical criteria in the rating schedule. VA is reviewing each major body system in the schedule to ensure that the medical criteria for each diagnosis are up to date. The objectives of the current update are to make the criteria for assigning the disability ratings clearer, more objective, and accurate.", "To date, VA has revised the medical criteria for 8 of the 16 body systems contained in the schedule. Revisions generally consist of such things as (1) wording changes for clarification or reflection of current medical terminology, (2) addition of alternative criteria, (3) addition of medical conditions not in the schedule, (4) deletion of conditions that through advances in treatment are no longer considered disabling, and (5) reductions in the time period for reevaluating unstable conditions.", "Few revisions involved the disability ratings themselves. Of about 68 diagnostic codes subject to revision in the first 4 body systems VA reviewed, the ratings for 12 were modified in some way. Of these 12 modifications, 3 resulted in obvious reductions in ratings, while none resulted in obvious increases. None of these reductions in ratings, however, will result in lower ratings for veterans currently on the disability rolls.

VA\u2019s goal is to maintain the internal consistency of the schedule over time by trying to ensure that new or adjusted ratings are consistent with the ratings of analogous conditions and reasonable relative to all others. For example, when VA added endometriosis to the schedule, it tried to find a condition already listed in the schedule that was analogous or comparable in terms of the physical impairment. On the basis of the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s medical monograph for this condition, VA determined that the most severe outcome of having endometriosis would be a hysterectomy, which was already in the schedule under another diagnosis and has a disability rating of 50 percent. VA, therefore, set the maximum evaluation for endometriosis at 50 percent.", "VA then set disability ratings for the less severe symptoms associated with endometriosis. In setting the rates for the less severe symptoms, VA Compensation and Pension personnel told us that they used their best judgment or experience, or both, to estimate the amount of time an individual might lose from work as a result of this condition.
