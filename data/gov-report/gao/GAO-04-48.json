Under the current contract, the prime contractor's award fees are now tied to the incremental delivery of specific system capabilities. DOD also modified the contract to prescribe tighter management controls, improve reporting of contractor information, and add formal review processes by DOD management. This increased oversight is intended, in part, to minimize further changes in requirements and improve management of software development, both of which have been particularly problematic. The restructuring also added funding and other resources to the program and extended the scheduled delivery of certain components. At the time of the restructuring, the Air Force believed the modified contract established an executable schedule, a realistic set of requirements, and adequate funding. However, the restructuring did not fully address some long-standing problems identified by the Independent Review Team. As a result, the program continues to be at substantial risk of cost and schedule increases. Key among the problems is the program's history of moving forward without sufficient knowledge to ensure that the product design is stable and meets performance requirements and that adequate resources are available. For example, a year before the restructuring, the program passed its critical design review with only 50 percent of its design drawings completed, compared to 90 percent as recommended by best practices. Consequently, several design modifications were necessary, including 39 to the first of two infrared sensors to reduce excessive noise created by electromagnetic interference--a threat to the host satellite's functionality--delaying delivery of the sensor by 10 months or more. Software development underlies most of the top 10 program risks, according to the contractor and the SBIRS High Program Office. For example, testing of the first infrared sensor revealed several deficiencies in the flight software involving the sensor's ability to maintain earth coverage and track missiles while orbiting the earth. Program officials stated that they are coordinating the delivery of the first sensor with the delivery of the host satellite to mitigate any schedule impacts, but they agreed that these delays put the remaining SBIRS High schedule at risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1980s, the Department of Defense (DOD) has initiated  several long-range ballistic missile detection programs aimed at providing  greater capabilities than the Defense Support Program (DSP), the  currently operating strategic-surveillance and early warning satellite  system.

In addition, the program  has been restructured several times. Most notably, in 1998, the SBIRS High  Program Office had to restructure the program around an Air Force  directive to delay the GEO satellite launches by 2 years in order to fund  other DOD priorities. This contributed to program instability since the  contractor had to stop and restart activities and devise interim solutions  that would not otherwise have been required. In early 2001, there were  growing cost and schedule variances and a related decrease in contractor  management reserve funding. Primary drivers of these problems were  technical issues with the HEO sensors and associated test failures.", "In November 2001, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition)  and the Executive Vice President of Lockheed Martin Space Systems  Company formed the IRT\u2014comprised of various specialists in acquisition,  operations, engineering, and business management from industry and the  federal government\u2014to conduct a comprehensive, independent review of  the SBIRS High program.

Overly optimistic assumptions  and unclear requirements eventually overwhelmed government and  contractor management.

Lockheed Martin met the first effectivity and was awarded 100 percent of  its fee (about $1.4 million).", "The restructured contract also prescribed tighter management controls,  improved reporting of contractor information, and added formal review  processes. For example, the modified contract removed Total Systems  Performance Responsibility (TSPR) from the contractor, transferring  more oversight back to the government because, according to the IRT,  this concept was not properly understood or implemented within the  SBIRS High program. This was evidenced by the numerous instances  where the contractor was asked by program participants to accomplish  work under TSPR guidelines without going through the appropriate  management processes. In addition, since requirements were not  prioritized or well-defined below the Operational Requirements Document  (ORD) level, the contractor\u2019s refinement of requirements was ad hoc,  creating uncertainty on the status of program priorities and impacting cost  and schedule.", "The restructuring also modified the program\u2019s use of DOD\u2019s Earned Value  Management System (EVMS). Specifically, Lockheed Martin and its  subcontractors standardized EVMS procedures in an effort to provide  more accurate and up-to-date reporting on the status of the program. In  addition, an EVMS oversight team was established to focus on process  improvements, and Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors developed a  surveillance plan to review the EVMS data. The contractor is now  monitoring EVMS data more closely through monthly meetings and  reviews of specific cost accounts. Changes to the reporting of EMVS data  also help identify risks more effectively.", "The contractor and SBIRS High Program Office have also increased  oversight and established a more formal risk management process within  the restructuring. For example, the prime contractor placed three vice presidents in charge of the program as program director, deputy for  ground segment development, and deputy for systems integration. In  addition, the Air Force established a program management board  consisting of high-level Air Force officials to prevent uncontrolled changes  in the SBIRS High program.

If procured  together, the estimated cost (including integration and testing) is  $283 million for the third HEO sensor and $238 million for the fourth HEO  sensor. The funding for these sensors has yet to be determined. The  potential acceleration of the acquisition of GEO satellites 3 through 5 is  similarly placing added pressures on the program. Plans to accelerate the  acquisition of these GEO satellites is in response to a recent concern by  the Senate Armed Services Committee that an Air Force decision to delay  the acquisition of satellites 3 through 5 would create a 3-year gap between  the launch of the second and third satellites. As a result, the committee  directed the Air Force to develop a plan to reduce the production gap in  the SBIRS High program from 2 years to 1. The committee also directed  the Air Force to assess the program\u2019s technical, schedule, and cost risks  associated with a 2-year delay, compare the operational risk of a 1-year  delay with a 2-year delay, and describe steps to mitigate the impact of a  1-year production gap.", "In April 2002, a group comprised of DOD subject matter experts reviewed  the SBIRS High requirements and concluded that four operational  requirements will not fully be met by the current design under certain  scenarios.

As a part of  the restructuring, the delivery of this sensor to the host satellite was  delayed from its original date in February 2002 to February 2003. At that  time, program officials were confident of meeting the new delivery date.  However, significant deficiencies were revealed during systems tests in  November 2002 making it apparent that the February 2003 date would not  be met, and delivery was postponed another 2 months. At this writing, the  first HEO sensor has yet to be delivered. In May 2003, the Program  Director reported that the delays were due to a series of design  deficiencies. For example, the design to control the sensor\u2019s  electromagnetic interference (EMI) was inadequate. Specifically,  Lockheed Martin identified 148 offending EMI frequencies that exceeded  the tolerances established by the host satellite. These excessive  frequencies could interfere with the operations of the host satellite and  jeopardize its mission. Thirty-nine design modifications to the HEO sensor  were made, which eliminated 80 percent of these noise conditions.  However, the final EMI test, completed in early July 2003, identified seven  remaining EMI frequencies that were not within tolerance\u2014two of  which appear to be attributable to the HEO sensor. Since the problems  cannot be resolved and there is no expected impact on performance, the  Program Director requested waivers for the offending frequencies to allow  the sensor to be integrated onto the host satellite. According to a program  official, the waivers have been approved and the first HEO sensor is now  expected to be delivered on December 6, 2003, provided no additional  testing is needed.", "The Program Director reported that the HEO 1 design problems were  attributable to weaknesses in earlier program management processes.  Under these processes, the program tried to achieve efficiencies by  cutting back on detailed design analyses and component testing. The  exact costs associated with these weaknesses are unclear. Our  independent estimate\u2014using data from the contractor\u2019s June 2003 cost  performance report\u2014indicates that the development of HEO 1 will  overrun the contract amount at completion by about $25 million to  $54 million, and that additional costs associated with HEO 2 rework would  be between $20 million and $80 million. The Program Office is currently  assessing estimates of total cost impact.", "Since the critical design review in August 2001, the Air Force also  determined that two late design changes to the GEO satellites were  necessary to improve the program\u2019s chances of success. In January 2003,  the Air Force directed the contractor to replace the 80 ampere-hour  battery with a 100 ampere-hour battery to improve the satellites\u2019  operational reliability. Program officials estimate that the new battery will  cost about $15 million, but the June 2003 cost performance report shows  that the contractor is having difficulty assessing and establishing  specifications for the battery, which has resulted in schedule delays and  could result in even greater costs. The second design change to the GEO  satellites is to resolve a power deficiency by modifying the solar cell panel.  The expected cost of this change has not yet been determined.", "In April 2002, 4 months before the restructuring, a report prepared by  subject matter experts determined that while there were no significant  technical barriers to eventually meeting the key requirements for SBIRS  High, technology integration was a high risk owing to insufficient time. In  restructuring the program, the Air Force implemented earlier integration  and testing activities to mitigate this risk. However, we found that these  mitigation measures may not be sufficient to avoid delays.

Additional flight software is being  developed for the HEO sensors and GEO satellites to control the infrared  sensors and optical telescope and to process infrared data onboard the  satellite. Another set of software elements will be used to test and  simulate the performance of the SBIRS High system before it is put into  operation. According to Lockheed Martin officials, the risks associated  with the development of these software elements would be minimal  because the majority of the software would be reused and modified.", "However, the risk associated with software development and reuse in  Increment 1 was underestimated, which led to significant delays and cost  overruns. This problem was not fully addressed by the restructuring and  the time needed to develop the software continues to be underestimated.  For example, in the current phase (Increment 2), delivery of the HEO  flight software has been delayed because software item qualification  testing\u2014which was completed in May 2003 after a 3-month delay\u2014  revealed three deficiencies. One deficiency involved the HEO sensor\u2019s  ability to maintain earth coverage and track missiles while orbiting the  earth. Delivery of the HEO ground software has also been delayed, and  according to a program official, did not meet a revised delivery date of  August 2003 because several ground software issues must still be resolved.  While the problems encountered with the development of the flight and  ground software have only resulted in delays of a few months, the delays  signal weaknesses that could put the program at further risk of cost and  schedule overruns.", "The remaining computer memory margin on the onboard satellites is also  a concern. The SBIRS High program requirements mandate that the  memory margin be at least 50 percent. This is to ensure there is sufficient  remaining memory to accommodate future software code growth.  However, inefficient coding for onboard satellite operations has resulted  in an estimated current memory margin of 35 percent. Since rewriting the  code would be too costly to the program, Lockheed Martin is requesting a  waiver from this requirement to allow the 35-percent margin.", "According to DCMA officials, the HEO software delays are the result of  an overly aggressive software development schedule and a lack of  management\u2019s understanding of the complexity of the software task.

As a result, the  HEO message certification milestone, scheduled for November 2004, will  slip 5 months or more.", "Program officials stated that they are coordinating the delivery of HEO 1  and the host satellite to mitigate any schedule impacts, but they agreed  that these delays put the remaining SBIRS High schedule at risk. For  example, the continuing HEO 1 sensor and software work is now  competing for staff and other resources dedicated to HEO 2 and GEO  tasks. As a result, the HEO 2 sensor and the first GEO satellite are unlikely  to maintain their current development and launch schedules already  revised under the restructuring. Program officials now estimate the HEO 2  sensor delivery will be delayed from February 2004 to June 2004\u2014or as  much as a year later\u2014to implement more in-depth modifications to  correct EMI problems, as recommended by a technical review team.  According to program officials, the development schedule for the first  GEO satellite has sufficient margin\u2014approximately 300 days\u2014to avoid  delays in the first GEO launch. However, delivery and integration of the  GEO flight software\u2014a high-risk effort\u2014did not begin in August 2003 as  scheduled.

However, in compressing original  schedules, the program creates other risks because the time allotted to  test and analyze the software and to train personnel to operate the SBIRS  High ground processing system has been significantly reduced. In addition,  work-around plans to overcome delays, even if feasible, would be difficult  and costly to accomplish. At the same time, valuable on-orbit information  of the HEO sensor\u2019s performance may not be available in a timely manner  for the GEO development efforts. Since HEO and GEO have common  components, including the infrared sensor subsystem, HEO on-orbit data  would improve the knowledge base for GEO development.", "Increased cost is also a risk. Although the contractor forecasts that the  contract will be within cost at completion, significant cost overruns are  likely. In analyzing data from the contractor\u2019s cost performance reports  from February 2003 through June 2003, we found that the cumulative  cost overrun increased by more than 800 percent, from approximately  $3 million to approximately $31.7 million, due to the significant overtime  worked over a number of months. Moreover, as the program works to  accomplish the almost $40 million worth of planned work that is behind  schedule, the negative cumulative cost variance of approximately  $31.7 million will continue to grow. Specifically, we predict that at  contract completion, the program will have a cost overrun ranging from  roughly $80 million to $432 million. DCMA similarly predicts significant  cost overruns\u2014officials reported an estimated overrun ranging from  $34 million to $210 million at completion and gave an overall assessment  of \u201cred\u201d for the SBIRS High earned value management status.", "Finally, as the program works to remedy problems\u2014particularly those  associated with the HEO sensors\u2014management reserves are diminishing.  For fiscal year 2003, reserves have been depleted, and Air Force and  program officials are concerned that fiscal year 2004 reserves are  insufficient to address contingencies. As a result, some planned  development tasks may be delayed to fiscal year 2005.", "The Program Director stated that the program is applying lessons learned  from HEO 1 to the HEO 2 sensor, the first GEO satellite, and other parts of  the program. The knowledge gained from correcting problems on HEO 1  will be necessary if the Air Force decides to procure additional HEO  sensors and accelerate procurement of the third, fourth, and fifth GEO  satellites. The Program Office is also assessing the overall program  impacts from the HEO 1 delay but has yet to complete the analysis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has invested billions of dollars in an effort to develop a system that  will provide greater long-range detection capabilities than DSP, its current  missile tracking system. Yet more than a year after the most recent  restructuring, the SBIRS High program continues to experience problems  that have existed since its inception: cost overruns, schedule delays, and  performance limitations. While the Air Force has taken a number of  actions as recommended by the IRT to improve program oversight, it  has become increasingly evident that the underlying factors that led to  the Nunn-McCurdy breach\u2014particularly the lack of critical knowledge\u2014  continue to cause problems, and additional cost and schedule slips beyond  the revised acquisition program baseline appear inevitable. Without  sufficient knowledge to ensure that the product design is stable and meets  performance requirements and that adequate resources are available,  there is no assurance that technical problems\u2014such as those experienced  with the HEO 1 sensor\u2014will not surface on other major program  components once they go through systems integration and testing.  Moreover, the inability of the Air Force and its contractor to deliver HEO 1  as scheduled has put into question whether the restructuring has provided  the right mechanisms to achieve program objectives. If the Air Force  continues to add new requirements and program content while prolonging  efforts to resolve requirements that cannot be met, the program will  remain at risk of not achieving within schedule its intended purpose\u2014to  provide an early warning and tracking system superior to that of DSP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given the considerable investment yet to come, the Congress and the  Secretary of Defense would benefit from an assessment of whether the  Program Office and contractor are doing everything necessary and  feasible to achieve program objectives and to minimize future cost and  schedule growth and address the underlying factors that are causing these  problems.
