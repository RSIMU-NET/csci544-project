To identify potential cases of evasion, CBP targets suspicious import activity, analyzes trends in import data, and follows up on allegations from external sources. If CBP identifies a potential case of evasion, it can use various techniques to attempt to verify whether evasion is occurring, such as asking importers for further information, auditing the records of importers suspected of evasion, and inspecting shipments arriving at ports of entry. If CBP is able to verify evasion, its options for taking enforcement action include (1) pursuing the collection of evaded duties, (2) imposing civil penalties, (3) conducting seizures, and (4) referring cases for criminal investigation. For example, between fiscal years 2007 to 2011, CBP assessed civil penalties totaling about $208 million against importers evading AD/CV duties.", "Two types of factors affect CBP\u0092s efforts to detect and deter AD/CV duty evasion. First, CBP faces several external challenges in attempting to gather conclusive evidence of evasion and take enforcement action against parties evading duties. These challenges include (1) the inherent difficulty of verifying evasion conducted through clandestine means; (2) limited access to evidence of evasion located in foreign countries; (3) the highly specific and sometimes complex nature of products subject to AD/CV duties; (4) the ease of becoming an importer of record, which evaders can exploit; and (5) the limited circumstances under which CBP can seize goods evading AD/CV duties. Second, gaps in information sharing also affect CBP efforts. Although communication between CBP and the Department of Commerce (Commerce) has improved, CBP lacks information from Commerce that would enable it to better plan its workload and help mitigate the administrative burden it faces in processing AD/CV duties\u0097an effort that diminishes its resources available to address evasion. Additionally, CBP has encouraged the use of larger bond amounts to protect AD/CV duty revenue from the risk of evasion, but CBP has neither a policy nor a mechanism in place for a port requiring a larger bond to share this information with other ports in case an importer withdraws its shipment and attempts to make entry at another port to avoid the higher bond amount.", "While CBP has made some performance management improvements, it does not systematically track or report key outcome information that CBP leadership and Congress could use to assess and improve CBP\u0092s efforts to deter and detect AC/CV duty evasion. First, CBP cannot readily produce key data, such as the number of confirmed cases of evasion, which it could use to better inform and manage its efforts. Second, CBP does not consistently track or report on the outcomes of allegations of evasion it receives from third parties. As GAO reported in March 2011, the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 underscores the importance of ensuring that performance information will be both useful and used in decision making.

Carriers are companies that  transport the goods to the United States. Importers may be companies  that purchase the goods from exporters or simply may be responsible for  facilitating the importation of the goods. The importer of record is  responsible for paying all estimated duties, taxes, and fees on those  products when they are brought into the United States. Importers of  record are also required to obtain a general bond to secure the payment  of their financial obligations.

As we reported in March 2008, the U.S. AD/CV duty  system is retrospective, in that importers initially pay estimated AD/CV  duties at the time of importation, but the final amount of duties, reflecting  the actual amount of dumping or subsidization, is not determined until  later. Commerce is responsible for calculating the appropriate AD/CV  duty rate. CBP is then responsible for collecting the estimated AD/CV  duties when goods enter the United States, and subsequently processing  the final AD/CV duties (called \u201cliquidation\u201d) when instructed by  Commerce.

The written \u201cscope\u201d of each AD/CV duty order  describes the specific type of product that is subject to the duties. The  duty order also lists one or more Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes  associated with the product. There are duty orders in place for some  types of products from several countries. For example, there are currently  AD duty orders on frozen warmwater shrimp from five countries\u2014Brazil,  China, India, Thailand, and Vietnam.

CBP  officials explained that most of their targeting involves identifying entries  filed under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes associated with a given  product that is subject to AD/CV duties and then examining the import  documentation for those entries for anomalies that may suggest evasion  is occurring. Examples of such anomalies in import documents include,  but are not limited to being filed under the same tariff code as a product that is subject to  AD/CV duties but not being declared as subject to such duties, listing a country of origin that is not capable of producing the goods  (or the quantity of the goods) imported\u2014a potential indicator of illegal  transshipment, and  showing a monetary value for the goods imported that appears to be  too low for the quantity or weight of goods imported\u2014a possible sign  of undervaluation.", "Once CBP identifies a potential instance of evasion, it can use a variety of  techniques at different points in the import process to attempt to verify if  evasion is occurring. These include, but are not limited to, the following:  targeting additional shipments made by the importer of record and  conducting further data analysis to look for other anomalies that may  be evidence of evasion; requesting that the importer provide further information, such as  product invoices and other documents that can help CBP understand  the transactions involved in producing and importing a good and  ascertain if evasion occurred; sending referrals to ICE to initiate criminal investigations and gather  evidence of evasion from foreign countries, such as by visiting  production facilities overseas and collecting customs documents from  foreign counterparts; performing cargo exams to inspect shipments arriving at ports of  collecting samples of products potentially brought in through evasion  and conducting laboratory analysis of these samples to attempt to  identify their true country of origin and other technical details that can  help CBP determine if the products should be subject to AD/CV  duties; and auditing importers suspected of evading AD/CV duties by collecting  company records (such as purchase orders, shipping documents, and  payment records) and examining them for discrepancies.", "Figure 3 shows where in the import process CBP typically uses these  techniques.", "In cases where CBP is able to verify evasion, its options for taking  enforcement action to deter evasion include (1) pursuing the collection of  evaded duties, (2) imposing civil penalties, (3) conducting seizures, and  (4) referring cases to ICE for criminal investigation.

From fiscal years 2007 to  2011, CBP assessed 252 civil penalties totaling about $208 million  against 237 importers that evaded AD/CV duties. Over the same period,  CBP also made 33 seizures related to AD/CV duty evasion, with a total  domestic value of nearly $4 million.

As these officials emphasized, proving that  evasion is occurring is a key precondition for taking enforcement action  against importers evading AD/CV duties. However, because AD/CV duty  evasion is inherently deceptive and clandestine in nature, it can be  extremely difficult for CBP to gather conclusive evidence to prove that  evasion is occurring. According to CBP, not only can different methods of  evasion be employed at once\u2014often involving the collusion of several  parties, including the manufacturer, shippers, and importer\u2014 but entities  engaging in evasion are using increasingly complex schemes. In  particular, CBP officials identified the growing use of illegal transshipment  as a key concern, noting that the Internet has made it very easy for  importers to find companies willing to transship goods subject to AD/CV  duties through third countries to mask the goods\u2019 true country of origin.  Because such schemes often involve adding false markings and  packaging designed to mimic legitimate production in other countries, it  can be very difficult for CBP to determine a product\u2019s country of origin  through visual inspection or through reviews of shipping documents.  Undervaluation can be similarly difficult to prove, according to CBP,  especially if the producer and importer collude to create false values.", "In addition to being inherently difficult, verifying evasion of AD/CV duties  can also be very time-consuming. According to CBP, it can easily take  over a year or more to collect the evidence needed to verify a potential  case of evasion. For example, CBP\u2019s ability to target additional shipments  from an importer suspected of evading duties hinges on whether or not  importation is ongoing. However, CBP documentation notes that  shipments of some goods may be seasonal in nature, resulting in months  of inactivity until the next shipment can be targeted. Additionally, in cases  where CBP requests additional information from the importer, the  importer has 30 days in which to respond to the request, but CBP can  extend the deadline in additional 30-day increments if the importer fails to  respond or needs more time to gather the required information. Similarly,  according to CBP, it typically takes up to 30 days to conduct a laboratory  analysis of a product sample, but it can take up to 120 days if, for  instance, new analytical methods need to be developed. CBP officials  stated that their audits of importers suspected of evading AD/CV duties  are also time-consuming in nature, taking nearly 8 months to complete on  average. Given these timelines\u2014 and the fact that CBP may need to use  several such verification techniques to successfully prove a single case of  evasion\u2014the process of proving evasion may become quite lengthy.", "According to CBP and ICE officials, they have limited access to evidence  located in foreign countries that can be vital to proving that evasion has  occurred, particularly in cases of illegal transshipment. These officials  explained that collecting customs documents from foreign counterparts or  gaining access to facilities in a foreign country listed as the country of  origin for a suspicious entry can help them prove that the goods in  question originated elsewhere. For example, ICE officials investigating a  case concerning Chinese honey suspected of being illegally transshipped  through Thailand helped determine that evasion occurred, in part by  visiting the sites in Thailand where the honey was allegedly produced and  determining that the facilities were not honey manufacturing plants (see  fig. 5). Similarly, CBP laboratory scientists explained that their ability to  use chemical analysis to determine whether an importer falsely declared  a good\u2019s country of origin is contingent on gathering reference samples  from as many countries as possible for comparison purposes.", "To collect information located outside of U.S. jurisdiction, CBP and ICE  need to obtain the permission of host nation governments. However, both  CBP and ICE explained that the level of host nation cooperation varies.  According to ICE, even when the United States has bilateral agreements  in place to share customs information, the extent of information shared by  foreign counterparts varies by country. For example, ICE officials stated  that although most of their investigations of evasion involve goods from  China\u2014with which the United States has a customs cooperation  agreement in place\u2014they have never received permission to visit  facilities in China as part of their investigations. Similarly, according to  ICE officials, although the United States has bilateral agreements with  several countries that are thought to be common transshipment points\u2014 such as Indonesia, India, and the Philippines\u2014ICE\u2019s ability to visit these  and other countries during the course of investigations depends on  factors such as each country\u2019s political climate, the nature of its bilateral  relationship with the United States, and the extent to which the host  nation government has ties to the company or industry under  investigation. CBP laboratory scientists have also had mixed results in  gaining access overseas. They noted that the Indonesian government  recently allowed them access to collect samples of shrimp from  Indonesian producers. However, the Malaysian government initially gave  them approval to visit honey and shrimp producers in their country but  ultimately rescinded its approval without explanation. CBP officials also  noted that although the U.S. free trade agreement with Singapore\u2014 another country thought to be a common transshipment point\u2014allows for  cooperation on customs issues, the agreement explicitly excludes matters  related to AD/CV duties.", "According to CBP officials, the highly specific and complex nature of  some products subject to AD/CV duties can make it extremely difficult to  identify evasion. As noted earlier, most of CBP\u2019s targeting for potential  evasion involves examining entries that have the same Harmonized Tariff  Schedule codes as products subject to AD/CV duties in order to look for  any not filed as subject to AD/CV duties. For example, to target potential  evasion of the AD duties on saccharin from China, CBP can examine  entries from China that have the tariff code for saccharin and determine if  any have been filed as not subject to AD/CV duties. However, in some  cases, no unique tariff code exists for the specific products that  Commerce investigated and issued a duty order for; rather, these  products fall under the same tariff code as a broader category of products  that are not subject to AD/CV duties. Consequently, the tariff codes listed  on a given entry may be insufficient for CBP to determine if goods  imported as part of that shipment are subject to AD/CV duties; additional  information may be needed. An example is petroleum wax candles from  China, which are subject to AD duties. Because there is no specific tariff  code for petroleum wax candles\u2014only one for candles\u2014CBP cannot  conclude, absent other evidence, that an entry from China under the tariff  code for candles is petroleum wax candles, as it may be another type of  candle that is not subject to AD duties. Instead, CBP has to turn to other  means of verification to attempt to gather conclusive evidence that the  entry is petroleum wax candles and, therefore, subject to AD duties. For  example, CBP may decide to ask the importer for additional information,  such as product invoices containing further details on the type of candles  imported. CBP may also target additional shipments of candles and  potentially collect a sample for laboratory analysis. However, as  described earlier, each of these steps would take additional time,  lengthening the verification process.", "According to CBP officials, the complex nature of some products covered  by AD/CV duty orders can also make it difficult for CBP personnel to  visually identify the products during cargo exams. For instance, CBP  officials stated that AD/CV duty orders on steel typically cover steel  products with a certain chemical composition\u2014an aspect that cannot be  determined through visual inspection. Another example is the AD/CV duty  order on honey, which applies not only to natural honey and flavored  honey, but also to honey blends that contain more than 50 percent natural  honey by weight\u2014a characteristic that cannot be ascertained by sight  alone. In such cases, CBP personnel can extract a sample from the  shipment and send it for laboratory analysis. However, CBP laboratory  scientists stated that chemical analysis does not always return a definitive  judgment of whether or not a product sample analyzed should fall within  the scope of an AD/CV duty order. For example, chemical analysis of a  honey blend can return inconclusive results if certain additives are  present in the blend. CBP officials stated that CBP cannot take  enforcement action without conclusive proof of evasion.", "Entities engaging in evasion can exploit the ease of becoming an importer  of record, impeding CBP\u2019s ability to target and take deterrent action  against them. As noted earlier, importers of record are responsible for  paying all estimated duties, taxes, and fees on products when they are  brought into the United States. However, importers seeking to evade  AD/CV duties can exploit the ease of becoming an importer of record in  several ways. First, according to CBP officials, companies can easily  adopt new importer names and identification numbers, making it difficult  for CBP to track their importing activity and gather evidence needed to  prove that they are engaging in evasion. CBP officials stated that they  suspect some importers evading AD/CV duties set up new names and  identification numbers in advance to have ready for use in anticipation of  CBP targeting efforts. Second, as our prior work has noted, CBP collects  a minimal amount of information from companies applying to be importers  of record, which evaders can take advantage of to elude CBP efforts to   For instance, companies are not  locate and collect revenues from them.subject to any credit or background checks before being allowed to import  products into the United States. Third, foreign companies and individuals  are allowed to import products into the United States, but CBP can have  difficulty collecting duties and penalties from foreign importers\u2014especially  illegitimate ones\u2014when the importers have no attachable assets in the  United States. For example, as of February 2012, CBP had collected  about $5 million, or about 2 percent, of the approximately $208 million it  assessed in civil penalties between fiscal years 2007 and 2011. CBP  attributed its collection difficulties, in part, to challenges experienced in  collecting from foreign importers of record. CBP officials stated that, due  to this risk of noncollection, a factor they consider when deciding whether  or not to impose a penalty against a confirmed evader is whether or not it  has assets in the United States.", "As we have previously reported, CBP or Congress could heighten the  requirements for becoming an importer of record; however, such action  could lead to unintended consequences.could include mandatory financial or background checks. However,  performing these checks would create a significant new burden on CBP,  which would need to conduct or oversee these financial or background  checks. Additionally, it is possible that, to ensure fairness, the heightened  requirements would be imposed on all importers. Given that the vast  majority of importers comply with customs laws and pay their duty  liabilities, such a broad approach may not be cost-effective and could  potentially restrict trade.", "CBP is able to seize goods imported through evasion under limited  circumstances. CBP officials explained that unlike goods that are illegal to  import, such as those violating import safety or intellectual property laws,  goods imported through evasion are not necessarily illegal to import.  Specifically, according to CBP, although misclassification and  undervaluation are commonly used evasion schemes, U.S. trade law  limits the seizure of shipments that are misclassified or undervalued. By contrast, CBP is permitted to seize shipments brought in through other  forms of evasion, such as through falsifying the country of origin of goods  (illegal transshipment) or failing to declare goods on entry documents  (smuggling).and 2011, at least 28 were related to false country of origin or smuggling.  For instance, CBP officials at one port seized a shipment of plastic bags  following a cargo exam that revealed the shipment\u2019s country of origin had  been falsified. However, as CBP has testified before Congress, entities  engaging in evasion often use false markings and packaging that make it  very difficult to determine country of origin through visual examination  alone, complicating the task of establishing grounds for seizure.  Moreover, as noted earlier, verifying evasion is an inherently difficult and  time-consuming process. CBP officials stated that, by the time CBP is  able to verify an instance of evasion, the associated goods typically have  already entered the United States and cannot be seized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interagency Communication Has Improved and CBP Has Promoted Use of Higher Bonding Requirements to Protect Revenue, but Weaknesses in Information Sharing Remain", "paragraphs": ["Communication between Commerce and CBP has improved since our  2008 report on AD/CV duties, and CBP has encouraged port officials to  use higher bonding requirements to protect AD/CV duty revenue when  they suspect incoming shipments of evasion. However, CBP lacks  information from Commerce that would enable it to better plan its  workload and minimize the burden of the U.S. retrospective system on its  efforts to address evasion. Additionally, CBP has neither a policy nor a  mechanism in place for a port requiring a higher bond to share this  information with other ports in case an importer attempts to \u201cport-shop,\u201d  i.e., chooses to withdraw its shipment and attempts to make entry at  another port in an attempt to avoid the larger bond requirement.", "CBP officials cited the administrative burden of the U.S. retrospective  system as a factor that diminishes the resources they have available for  detecting and deterring evasion of AD/CV duties. Under the U.S.  retrospective system, importers that properly declare their products as  subject to AD/CV duties (i.e., do not evade) pay the estimated amount of  duties when products enter the United States, but the final amount of  duties owed is not determined until later. The documentation for the  entries remains at the ports while CBP awaits liquidation instructions  conveying the final duty rate from Commerce. Commerce\u2019s review to  determine the final duty rate\u2014a process that culminates with the issuance  of liquidation instructions\u2014typically takes up to 18 months to complete  and can take months or years longer if litigation is involved. At one port  we visited, CBP officials stated that they had approximately 20,000  entries awaiting instructions to liquidate for food-related products alone.  At another port, officials showed us the file room where they store entries  awaiting liquidation instructions (see fig. 6). Moreover, each of the  thousands of entries subject to AD/CV duties must be liquidated through  manual data entry, which is resource- and time-intensive and diverts CBP  personnel from their efforts to detect and deter evasion.", "Under U.S. law, CBP has 6 months to liquidate entries from the time that   According to  it receives notice of the lifting of suspension of liquidation.CBP officials, this 6-month deadline can be very difficult to meet,  especially when a large volume of imports needs to be liquidated.order to begin liquidating entries, CBP must first receive liquidation  instructions from Commerce.", "Since our 2008 report, Commerce has taken steps to improve the  transmission of its liquidation instructions to CBP. We found in 2008 that,  about 80 percent of the time, Commerce failed to send liquidation  instructions within its self-imposed deadline of 15 days after the  publication of the Federal Register notice. Furthermore, we reported that  the instructions were sometimes unclear, thereby causing CBP to take  extra time to obtain clarification.  Consequently, we identified untimely  and unclear liquidation instructions from Commerce as an impediment to  CBP\u2019s ability to liquidate entries. In response to our recommendation to  identify opportunities to improve liquidation instructions, Commerce took  steps to improve the transmission of liquidation instructions to CBP. For  instance, Commerce deployed a system for tracking when it sends  liquidation instructions, which according to Commerce, has greatly  improved its timeliness. Documentation from Commerce indicates that, in  the first half of fiscal year 2012, Commerce sent liquidation instructions on  a timely basis more than 90 percent of the time.  In addition, Commerce  and CBP jointly established a mechanism for CBP port personnel to  submit questions directly to Commerce regarding liquidation issues.  According to CBP officials, these steps have improved the ability of port  personnel to ask Commerce to clarify its liquidation instructions.", "GAO-08-391. in May 2011 that, without advance notice from Commerce on upcoming  liquidation instructions, it can be very difficult for CBP to make workforce  planning and staffing decisions. CBP officials at headquarters and at  ports we visited stated that liquidation instructions arrive with little warning  but need to be acted on immediately due to the 6-month deadline for  liquidating entries. They said that this sudden shift in workload diverts key  personnel from efforts to address evasion to focus on manually liquidating  thousands of entries instead. In the absence of advance notice from  Commerce on upcoming liquidation instructions, CBP attempts to roughly  estimate where its workload peaks will occur on the basis of the 18-month  time frame within which Commerce typically completes liquidation  instructions. However, CBP officials stated that no such estimation is  possible in cases involving litigation, which are not subject to time frames.  According to CBP, cases involving litigation are particularly burdensome  because of the considerable length of time it can take to resolve some  cases, during which an extremely large number of entries can accumulate  at the ports\u2014all of which CBP eventually has to attempt to liquidate within  the 6-month deadline. However, Commerce does not currently inform  CBP when a court reaches a decision on a case in litigation\u2014information  that would enable CBP to conduct some workload planning. According to  CBP officials, since CBP is not a party to such cases, it would be helpful if  Commerce provided them with some notification once decisions are  reached. Commerce officials stated that they do not know when courts  will reach decisions on cases in litigation, but said that they could work  with CBP to identify opportunities to share information regarding the  status of litigation.", "In response to a CBP request, Commerce recently provided CBP some  information for the first time to help with workload planning. In June 2011,  Commerce officials provided their counterparts in CBP headquarters with  a list of instructions planned for issuance over the next 6 months. CBP  officials at headquarters acknowledged receiving the list from Commerce,  stating that, although the list did not address their need to know when  courts reach decisions on cases involving litigation, they found it useful  for general workload planning purposes. They noted that they would like  to receive this type of list from Commerce on a quarterly basis to have  more up-to-date information on hand to incorporate into their workload  planning decisions. Commerce officials stated that they would be willing  to work with CBP to develop a schedule for sharing this list on a regular  basis.", "CBP has encouraged the use of higher bonding requirements, called  single transaction bonds (STB), to protect AD/CV duty revenue from the  risk of evasion; however, it has not ensured that a port requiring an STB  shares this information with other ports in case an importer withdraws its  shipment and attempts to make entry at another port to avoid the STB. As  noted earlier, all importers are required to post a security, usually a  general obligation bond, when they import products into the United  States. This bond is an insurance policy protecting the U.S. government  against revenue loss if an importer defaults on its financial obligations as  well as ensuring compliance with the law. However, given CBP\u2019s  concerns that this general bond inadequately protects AD/CV duty  revenue, CBP has encouraged port officials to protect additional revenue  by requiring STBs for individual shipments they suspect of evasion. The  amount of the STB is generally one to three times the total entered value  of the merchandise plus duties, taxes, and fees, depending on the  revenue risk. According to CBP officials, STBs serve as additional  insurance in cases where CBP has not been able to collect enough  evidence before a shipment\u2019s arrival to prove that evasion is occurring,  but where enough suspicion exists about the shipment to warrant  protection of the anticipated AD/CV duty revenue. An importer that is  required to obtain an STB can either choose to post the bond in order to  enter its shipment, or can opt against obtaining the bond and withdraw its  shipment. If an importer decides to post the STB, and CBP later confirms  that AD/CV duties are indeed owed, CBP first tries to collect from the  importer. However, if CBP is unable to collect from the importer, it can  collect significantly more money from the surety (insurance) company that  underwrote the STB than it would typically be able to collect from the  surety on a general bond, given the larger amount of revenue protected  by the STB.", "While CBP has encouraged the use of STBs to protect revenue related to  imports suspected of AD/CV duty evasion, vulnerabilities exist due to  gaps in port-level information sharing. CBP gives each port the discretion  to decide when to require an STB. However, CBP has no policy or  mechanism in place for ports requiring such a bond to share this  information with other ports in case an importer attempts to port-shop,  i.e., chooses to withdraw its shipment and attempts to make entry at  another port in an attempt to avoid the larger bond requirement. Instead,  CBP port officials currently rely on informal e-mail and telephone  communication to notify other port officials of importers potentially  seeking to port-shop. Officials we met with cited specific instances where  this informal approach had been ineffective in notifying other ports of  suspected evasion before the importer could enter the goods at another  port. For example, CBP officials at one port described a case where an  importer that decided against posting an STB at their port was able to  make entry in another port before they were able to e-mail a warning  about that particular importer to other ports. In another case, an importer  succeeded in entering a shipment of furniture in Newark after officials at  the initial port of entry on the West Coast failed to notify other ports that  the importer had decided to withdraw its entry instead of posting an STB.  In both cases, CBP port officials suspected evasion but did not take  additional action in time to warn other ports of entry about the potential for  port-shopping.", "Although CBP is currently formulating policy to guide the use of STBs, the  policy may not fully address the risk of port-shopping. In February 2012,  CBP officials stated that they were in the process of completing a policy  that will further encourage port officials to use STBs and provide them  with guidance on circumstances under which the use of STBs is   Officials stated that the policy will also instruct officials at a  appropriate.port requiring an STB to review any other shipments from the importer in  question before releasing them.

First, CBP cannot readily  produce key data on AD/CV duty evasion, such as the number of  confirmed cases of evasion, which it could use to better inform and  manage its efforts. Second, CBP does not consistently track or report on  the outcomes of allegations of evasion it receives from third parties. As  we have previously reported, internal control is a major part of managing  an organization and should be generally designed to assure that ongoing  monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations.

In another example, CBP did not provide a response to  the fiscal year 2011 performance measure related to the results of  cargo exams because, according to CBP officials, cargo exams are  conducted at the local level and not tracked, creating a dearth of  reportable data. In addition, CBP was unable to track and assess its  efforts over time because its measures were inconsistent from year to  year.", "By contrast, CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2012 action plan includes a new set of  performance metrics with measurable targets consistent from fiscal  years 2012 through 2017.

In June 2011, after finding that CBP could not determine the  total number of STBs used at the ports, the Department of Homeland  Security Inspector General recommended that CBP appoint a  centralized office responsible for reporting STB-related activities and  monitoring results. The Inspector General\u2019s report also  recommended that CBP automate the STB process to provide  enhanced tracking ability. CBP concurred with these  recommendations, stating that it had begun the process of centralizing  STB-related roles and responsibilities and developing a system to  automate the STB process.

Over the past year, CBP  has publicly reported anecdotes of successful efforts to detect and deter  AD/CV duty evasion. For example, in testimony before Congress in May  2011, the Assistant Commissioner for CBP\u2019s Office of International Trade  described five recent cases where CBP and ICE uncovered instances of  evasion and penalized those responsible. Similarly, in a report to  Congress on fiscal year 2010 efforts to enforce AD/CV duties, CBP cited  eight cases that led to enforcement action against parties engaging in  evasion. CBP has also produced publicly available videos illustrating a  successful case where CBP worked with ICE to arrest and convict an  importer who evaded the AD/CV duties on wire hangers.", "CBP collects some statistics on its efforts to detect and deter AD/CV duty  evasion but lacks other key data on these efforts. For example, CBP  provided us with statistics on civil penalties and seizures related to AD/CV  duty evasion. However, CBP lacks data on  the total number of confirmed cases of AD/CV duty evasion;  the total amount of duties assessed and collected for confirmed cases  of evasion; the country of origin, product type, and method of evasion for each  confirmed case of evasion; and the number of confirmed cases of evasion involving a foreign importer  of record.", "CBP attributed this lack of data to the absence of a policy requiring  officials to record confirmed cases of AD/CV duty evasion. CBP officials  explained that although CBP has a database in which instances of  evasion could be recorded, current policy does not require officials to  record such instances. Consequently, CBP cannot conduct a simple data  query to identify all confirmed cases of evasion. Without the ability to  identify cases of evasion, CBP cannot easily access other related data on  AD/CV evasion that could help improve management decisions and  oversight. For example, CBP is currently unable to produce data on the  total amount of duties assessed and collected for confirmed cases of  evasion\u2014figures that would provide CBP leadership and Congress  visibility over some of the results of CBP\u2019s efforts to address evasion.  Similarly, comprehensive data on the country of origin, product type, and  method of evasion for each confirmed case of evasion could potentially  help CBP identify trends and shifts in evasive activity and make  adjustments accordingly.", "CBP also lacks complete data on the country of origin and product type  associated with the 252 civil penalties it imposed for AD/CV duty evasion  between fiscal years 2007 and 2011 (see fig. 7). CBP attributed these  missing data items to CBP personnel not recording them in CBP\u2019s  automated system for tracking penalties. Due to these missing data  items, CBP lacks a complete picture of the countries and commodities  involved in its penalty cases\u2014information it could use to guide and  improve its efforts. For example, CBP could identify which types of  commodities have led to penalties most often and decide whether or not  to focus more resources and detection efforts on those types of  commodities.", "According to CBP officials, CBP addresses all allegations of AD/CV duty  evasion it receives, including e-Allegations received online, but it does not  routinely track or report on the outcomes of these allegations. As a result,  Congress and industry stakeholders lack information about the outcomes  of the allegations, which both parties have cited as a cause of concern.  Data from CBP indicate that it generally assigns allegations to its national  targeting staff for AD/CV duty issues (i.e., the NTAG) within 2 days of  receipt. The NTAG then assesses the validity of the allegation using  targeting and other analytical tools. If the NTAG determines that the  allegation may be valid, it will typically refer the allegation to the  appropriate port or to ICE for further investigation and possible  enforcement action. As of September 2011, CBP had confirmed or  referred nearly one-quarter of the approximately 400 allegations it  received from 2008 to August 2011. About half could not be validated,  and another one-quarter were still under analysis.", "Although CBP has stated that it addresses all allegations of AD/CV duty  evasion it receives, it has reported little information to date on the  outcomes of its efforts to follow up on these allegations. For instance,  CBP\u2019s report to Congress on AD/CV duty enforcement efforts in fiscal  year 2010 mentions that CBP has received hundreds of allegations from  the trade community, but the report includes no information on the  outcomes of those allegations. In January 2011, in response to a  congressional request, CBP produced a spreadsheet of the allegations it  had received since June 2008. CBP officials told us that this spreadsheet  was created upon request and is not something CBP updates or uses for  management or policy purposes. While this document lists certain details,  such as the source of each allegation, and identifies allegations of  evasion that CBP confirmed as valid, it does not include any information  on the associated enforcement outcomes. During the course of our  review, CBP provided us with expanded versions of the spreadsheet in  response to our request for details on the results of the allegations.  However, these expanded versions provide little insight into the results of  the allegations. For instance, the most recent version of the spreadsheet  that we received, from September 2011, documents the enforcement  outcome for only one of the 24 allegations labeled as \u201callegation  confirmed.\u201d CBP was also unable to determine if the allegations referred  to ports and ICE by the NTAG were subsequently confirmed as valid or  resulted in enforcement outcomes.", "CBP\u2019s limited reporting on the outcomes of allegations is due, in part, to  inconsistent, decentralized tracking of such information. CBP officials  stated that once the NTAG has referred an allegation to a port or to ICE  for further action, CBP considers the allegation to be closed and may or  may not follow up to track its outcome. While CBP creates a record within  its Commercial Allegation and Reporting System for each allegation it  receives, there is no requirement for either the NTAG or the entity  receiving the allegation referral to update these records with details on its  enforcement outcomes. Instead, port officials and ICE store information  on enforcement outcomes in other data systems that are not linked to the  Commercial Allegation and Reporting System. CBP officials at  headquarters told us that aggregating data from these various systems to  link allegations with their associated outcomes would be difficult and time- consuming. Additionally, according to ICE, it does not specifically track  cases generated as a result of allegations referred by CBP.   Consequently, since ICE cannot identify which of its cases involve  allegations referred from CBP, it also cannot identify the associated  outcomes.", "An additional cause of CBP\u2019s limited reporting on the outcomes of  allegations is legal restrictions on the types of information it can share.  During our review, we met with representatives of a coalition of domestic  industries affected by AD/CV duty evasion. Some of these  representatives stated that they had submitted allegations of evasion to  CBP and expressed frustration that although they had requested updates  from CBP on the outcomes of the allegations they submitted, CBP had  not provided them with the information requested. CBP officials attributed  this, in part, to the Trade Secrets Act, which they said restricts their ability  to disclose the specific kinds of information requested. Additionally, CBP  officials stated that they cannot disclose information about allegations  involving active ICE investigations. Furthermore, CBP does not report on  the results of its efforts at an aggregate level, which would avoid divulging  restricted information while keeping key stakeholders informed.

While CBP employs a  variety of techniques to detect and deter such evasion, its efforts are  significantly hampered by a number of factors primarily beyond its control.  These include the inherently difficult and time-consuming process of  uncovering evasive activity conducted through clandestine means,  inconsistent access to foreign countries that limits CBP\u2019s ability (as well  as ICE\u2019s) to gather necessary evidence, and the ease with which  importers attempting to evade duties can change names and identification  numbers to elude detection. Nonetheless, some improvements have been  made since we last reported, including better communication between  Commerce and CBP and CBP\u2019s encouragement of the use of higher  bonding requirements to protect additional AD/CV duty revenue in  instances where it suspects evasion. However, CBP lacks information  from Commerce that it needs to better plan its workload and mitigate the  impact of the time- and resource-intensive liquidation process on its  efforts to address evasion. Further, CBP has no policy or mechanism for  port officials to minimize the risk of port-shopping by notifying other ports  about their use of higher bonding requirements.
