According to GSA, tracking system data were unreliable because its regional staff did not always appropriately or accurately record upgrade transactions in the tracking system.", "The Federal Protective Service (FPS)\u2014the physical security and law enforcement arm of GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service\u2014developed a computerized database system to track the status of all building security committee-requested upgrades. The system, which became fully operational in early 1996, was designed to track by region, and by building, upgrades requested, approved, and completed, as well as upgrade cost estimates.", "The tracking system was also intended to serve in part as a forerunner to a larger government-wide database of security upgrades in all federal buildings, as required by Executive Order 12977, dated October 19, 1995. The order created the Interagency Security Committee, which was to be chaired by GSA\u2019s administrator or his designee, comprising representatives from 17 federal agencies and specific individuals. The Committee was established to enhance the quality and effectiveness of security in buildings and facilities occupied by federal employees. to GSA buildings around the country included (1) concrete bollards constructed around building perimeters, (2) security cameras installed and in use both inside and outside of buildings, and (3) metal detectors and x-ray machines installed at building entrances and operated by GSA or contract security personnel.", "However, based on our work and that of the OIG, we do not believe that a reliable determination of the building security upgrade program\u2019s status can be made because of errors in the upgrade tracking system. GSA\u2019s upgrade tracking system contained errors related to the number of upgrades approved and the number completed in 24, or 45 percent, of the buildings we reviewed and in 65, or 54 percent, of the buildings reviewed by the OIG. For example, (1) some upgrades that were shown as approved and completed in the tracking system in fact were not completed, and the requests for the upgrades had been cancelled; and (2) some approved upgrades shown in the system as completed weren\u2019t complete, and in fact the related security equipment was boxed and stored. According to GSA, these errors occurred because GSA personnel didn\u2019t always appropriately or accurately record the status of the upgrades in the tracking system.", "In addition to these errors related to upgrades approved, completed, and cancelled in the tracking system, we have concerns about whether all GSA buildings have been evaluated for security needs. We found that, as of October 1997, the nationwide upgrade tracking system contained little or no evidence that building security evaluations had been done for 754 GSA buildings, 14 of which were level-IV buildings. We judgmentally selected a sample of 26 of the 754 buildings and attempted to determine whether a security evaluation had been done by contacting a representative from each building\u2019s security committee during December 1997 and January 1998. Representatives from 22 of the 26 buildings responded. Of the 22, representatives of 5 buildings told us that a building evaluation wasn\u2019t done, 6 said they weren\u2019t sure whether one was done, and 7 representatives said that the evaluations were done, but the remaining 4 representatives said that evaluations weren\u2019t applicable for their buildings because (1) the lease for the federal agency tenants in the building had been terminated, (2) the building was leased and used only for storage purposes, (3) the building was a maintenance garage with access limited to agency personnel, and (4) the building was no longer in use.", "For the 11 building representatives that said a building evaluation was not done or that they weren\u2019t sure, we asked whether they believed that their buildings\u2019 current levels of security met the DOJ minimum standards. Representatives of four buildings said \u201cyes\u201d; five said they didn\u2019t know; and two said that the standards weren\u2019t applicable to their specific buildings because the agencies were moving out of the buildings. Four of the five that said they didn\u2019t know also said that they weren\u2019t aware of the DOJ minimum security standards.", "Similarly, we found no evidence in GSA\u2019s building files that security evaluations had been done for a number of buildings that had no requests for security upgrades in the tracking system. During the latter part of 1997, we judgmentally selected 50 buildings in two GSA regions that showed no requests for security upgrades in the tracking system, and we found no evaluations on file for 12, or 24 percent, of the buildings. GSA had initially classified 3 of these 12 buildings as level IVs, 8 as level IIIs, and 1 as level II. Ten of the 12 buildings were in one GSA region.", "FPS officials told us that they weren\u2019t sure whether evaluations had been done for all GSA buildings. They said that although they had attempted to obtain evaluations for all buildings, not all BSCs had provided evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Upgrade Obligations Data Unreliable and Not Available by Type", "paragraphs": ["In addition to being unable to reliably determine the program\u2019s operational and implementation status, we also couldn\u2019t reliably determine the actual costs or obligations incurred by GSA for security upgrades because GSA\u2019s accounting system, like its tracking system, contained significant errors. Further, we couldn\u2019t determine the actual costs incurred by type of security upgrade because GSA said that its accounting system was not designed to account for costs by upgrade type. Nevertheless, based on the existing accounting system data, we estimate that from October 1, 1995, through March 31, 1998, GSA obligated roughly $353 million for the building security upgrade program nationally. The source of those funds was the FBF. As you know, the Fund consists primarily of rent that GSA charges federal agencies for space and is administered by GSA. It is the primary means of financing the capital and operating costs associated with GSA-controlled federal space. unneeded upgrade funding allowances that could be shifted to regions in need of funds to complete upgrades. In FPS\u2019 analysis, it identified over $5 million in obligations shown in the accounting system for upgrades in 109 buildings in 10 GSA regions for which there were no corresponding approved upgrades shown in the tracking system. FPS found that (1) $0.9 million of the obligations related to other GSA programs rather than the building security upgrade program; (2) $0.6 million in obligations related to upgrades that in fact had been completed but were shown in the tracking system as cancelled and voided by GSA; (3) $1.2 million in obligations related to upgrades completed in other buildings; and (4) $1.6 million were valid obligations, but the corresponding upgrades had inadvertently not been entered into the tracking system. FPS was uncertain about the remaining discrepancies. FPS found similar problems relating to upgrades recorded in the tracking system for which there were no corresponding obligations recorded in the accounting system. Because of these errors or discrepancies in the obligations data, FPS was unable to complete its efforts to reallocate funds among regions for over 2 months. We discuss these discrepancies in more detail in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems Hindering Program Implementation", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the unreliable nature of the data in the upgrade tracking and accounting systems, several other problems have hindered and slowed GSA\u2019s implementation of the security upgrade program. These included (1) funding source uncertainties; (2) mistakes made to meet deadlines by a downsized staff, as well as a sense of urgency to rapidly complete as many security upgrades as possible; and (3) unreliable upgrade cost estimates. As a result of these problems, GSA was not able to meet several program implementation goals. In addition, GSA lacks information about the benefits of upgrades relative to their costs; has not established specific program effectiveness goals, outcomes, or measures; and doesn\u2019t know whether and to what extent federal office buildings\u2019 vulnerability to acts of terrorism and other forms of violence has been reduced. security, uncertainty continues to exist regarding the source of funds for the building security program. While GSA has projected about $260 million in obligations for fiscal year 1998 and budgeted about $251 million in obligations for fiscal year 1999 on building security, GSA and OMB have not yet reached complete agreement on how best to fund all the future costs of the program. Once GSA and OMB agree on how to fund increased security costs, the increased funding would be contingent on congressional approval in the appropriations process.", "Timetables, staff, and urgency issues: According to GSA officials, GSA wanted to add as much security as possible in federal buildings before the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing\u2014April 19, 1996. The officials said that this sense of urgency, coupled with the program implementation timetables in the DOJ report and limited availability of staff due to downsizing, led to security upgrade decisions being made with the information available, recognizing that planning and implementation adjustments would likely be necessary. They acknowledged that, as a result, some initial efforts suffered and some mistakes were made. GSA and agency staffs at GSA-controlled buildings had about 3.5 months after issuance of the DOJ report to do security assessments and develop upgrade cost estimates for several hundred level-IV buildings, and they had about 7 months to do the same for several thousand lower level buildings.", "According to FPS staff and a member of the DOJ report task force from the U.S. Marshals Service, there was little time available to develop the desired level of implementing guidance and training for FPS staff and the thousands of BSCs. Further, they said that the ratio of GSA-operated buildings to FPS physical security specialists added to the difficulties. For example, in one GSA region, we were told that the region had responsibility for about 1,000 buildings but had only 15 FPS physical security specialists available to assist BSCs with the building risk assessments. Nationwide, a total of about 200 FPS physical security specialists were responsible for assisting in the assessment of over 8,000 GSA-operated buildings.", "GSA had to devise alternative security measures, which sometimes required additional funds.", "Unreliable cost estimates: A number of the initial cost estimates for upgrades recorded in the tracking system proved unreliable. In an effort to determine how much money was available to complete approved upgrades and reallocate funds among its regions, GSA analyzed upgrade cost estimates versus the actual obligations required to complete the upgrades in many of its buildings, and it found that many of the initial cost estimates were unreliable. For example, the estimated costs in the tracking system of completed upgrades for a group of 98 buildings in 11 GSA regions were about $10.4 million, while the actual obligations to complete the upgrades recorded in the accounting system were about $29 million\u2014that is, obligations to complete the upgrades were over $18 million more than the estimated costs of completing the upgrades. According to GSA, the initial cost estimates were made using the general guidance contained in the DOJ report. Although more accurate cost estimates were made as the upgrade implementation progressed, the upgrade tracking system was not designed to readily capture the revised cost estimates. Without more accurate cost estimates, GSA decisionmakers were not in the best position to judge the cost/benefit of various upgrade options or to reliably estimate funds needed to complete approved upgrades.", "The unreliable cost estimates combined with the unreliability of the status and cost data in the upgrade tracking and accounting systems, the funding source uncertainties, the reduced level of staff, and the mistakes made due to program deadlines, as well as the sense of urgency by GSA to complete upgrades as quickly as possible hindered the implementation of the upgrade program. Thus, GSA was unable to fully meet program timetables established in the DOJ report and several upgrade implementation goals it had established internally. Further, because additional security upgrade requests were received in the last half of fiscal year 1997, and additional funds were needed to complete previously approved upgrades, GSA estimated in October 1997 that it would need about $7.8 million in additional funds in fiscal year 1998 to complete the upgrades approved as of September 26, 1997. that agencies (usually those involved in national security issues) in these buildings secure the buildings according to their own requirements. Although the DOJ report did not specify goals for GSA\u2019s completion of the security upgrades, GSA established and subsequently revised internal goals for completing upgrades in all its buildings several times in 1996 and 1997.", "GSA has indicated that it had met the goals established by the DOJ report for evaluating the security needs and estimating the costs of upgrades for all level-IV buildings: In November 1995, GSA told the Senate Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure that, in accordance with the DOJ report\u2019s recommendation and the President\u2019s directive, it had established 429 level-IV building security committees, and it had received over 2,500 upgrade requests from these committees. Also, later that same month, GSA told OMB that $222.6 million would be needed in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 to pay for the upgrades in these 429 buildings.", "However, we believe that GSA did not fully meet either goal specified in the DOJ report because (1) security evaluations were not made for some level-IV buildings until after November 1995 and (2) in October 1997, much later than the DOJ report\u2019s target dates of October 15, 1995, and February 1, 1996, we found indications that not all of GSA\u2019s buildings, including some level-IV buildings, had been evaluated for security needs. In addition, GSA reported to us that, by March 1996, the number of level-IV buildings had increased to over 700. GSA stated that the increase was partly caused by DOJ\u2019s request that GSA reclassify certain buildings containing court-related tenants from lower levels to level IV, and partly by additional level-IV BSCs\u2019 decisions to conduct building evaluations and provide GSA with upgrade requests after November 1995.", "Concerning GSA\u2019s internal goals, GSA initially established a goal to have all security upgrades completed for level-IV buildings by September 30, 1996. When it didn\u2019t meet the September 30, 1996, goal, GSA established a new goal to have upgrades completed in all buildings, including level IVs, by September 30, 1997. This goal was not met either, and now GSA\u2019s goal is September 30, 1998, for completing all upgrades approved as of September 26, 1997. GSA\u2019s tracking system indicated that GSA had completed about 85 percent of the approved upgrades for all buildings as of October 3, 1997, and reached the 90-percent mark by March 31, 1998. completed, or to know whether upgrades reported as completed were actually complete and operating as planned. GSA needs this information to justify expenditures for security upgrades and to make changes in its security program if and when appropriate. For example, Social Security Administration (SSA) officials expressed concern to GSA about certain security upgrades that GSA initially placed in some SSA-occupied buildings. SSA was concerned about both the need for and the costs of purchasing and operating the upgrade equipment. After negotiations, GSA removed some upgrades from some SSA locations.", "Further, security-related evaluations, which GSA security staff were doing prior to the Oklahoma City bombing, were curtailed because these staff were needed to help implement the upgrade program, and at the time of our review, these evaluations hadn\u2019t been resumed. In addition, GSA also hadn\u2019t fully implemented a key recommendation, from an internal \u201clessons learned\u201d study done after the Oklahoma City bombing incident, to evaluate its current risk assessment methodology to ensure that a wider range of risks are addressed, with an increased emphasis on acts of mass violence. The principal conclusion of the October 1995 study was that GSA\u2019s security and law enforcement processes currently in place did not adequately address the threat environment.", "In a related issue, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act) requires every major federal agency to establish its mission, its goals and how they will be achieved, how its performance toward meeting its goals will be measured, and how performance measures will be used to make improvements. In accordance with the Results Act, GSA established its strategic plan, dated September 30, 1997, covering years 1998 through 2002. GSA\u2019s building security program is specifically addressed in the 1997 plan and in its annual performance plan for fiscal year 1999. However, GSA did not identify in its strategic plan security program evaluations it plans to do, and the 1999 annual performance plan did not state its goals and indicators for the security program in terms of outcomes or desired results as is called for by OMB in Circular A-11. Finally, although GSA\u2019s data systems for tracking program status and funding had incorrect data, which hampered implementation, GSA has just recently initiated efforts to ensure security program measurement data would be valid in connection with the security-related performance goal included in its 1999 annual performance plan prepared under the Results Act.", "Without more specific information on security program goals and results, GSA does not know the extent to which the upgrades have improved security or reduced federal office building vulnerability to acts of terrorism or other forms of violence.

We selected these files to provide a cross section of different risk level buildings with either high or low dollar upgrade cost estimates.

During our review, the GSA OIG\u2019s Office of Audits also began a review of the GSA security upgrade program. We maintained contact with the OIG audit staff and coordinated our work.

This fee consists of two components: (1) the basic service charge of 6 cents per square foot that, coupled with other funds from the FBF, is used for control center operations, criminal investigations, protective services activities, and administration of FPS programs; and (2) a building-specific fee that is used along with other funds from the FBF to pay for commercial equivalent items, such as contract security guard services, and security alarm systems\u2019 installation and maintenance. According to GSA, because GSA\u2019s expenditures for security have historically exceeded the amount charged to agencies for security, the FBF has absorbed the excess expenditures. charges billed to tenant agencies by about $540 million. GSA has projected about $260 million in obligations for fiscal year 1998 and has budgeted about $251 million for fiscal year 1999 for building security. GSA projects that its obligations for security will exceed security related revenue by about $228 million in fiscal year 1998 and by about $112 million in fiscal year 1999.", "The DOJ report recommended that GSA consider increasing rents to cover the added costs of upgrading security. GSA is required to obtain OMB approval for the rent it charges federal agencies. GSA and OMB officials said they were not in a position to increase rents in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 to help pay for increased costs of security because agencies need to know their rent costs at least 2 years in advance to provide sufficient time for annual budget development and approval. GSA requested an increase in rents for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 as part of a comprehensive effort to redesign its system for determining rent charges and fees for services such as security.", "As a pilot project, OMB approved part of the requested rent increase\u2014an increase in building-specific fees to recover the cost associated with security operations for new lease agreements made in 1998, and for all leases beginning in fiscal year 1999. OMB also allowed GSA to increase its basic service charge for security from 6 cents to 16 cents per square foot for new lease agreements made in 1998 and 1999.", "According to GSA and OMB officials, OMB did not allow GSA to increase the basic service charges for existing leases for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 because a comprehensive rent reform proposal was under development by GSA. These officials expect to complete this action by the end of fiscal year 1998. Also, they are continuing to discuss how agencies\u2019 rent charges will reflect GSA\u2019s costs for security in fiscal year 2000 and beyond.", "Decisions about funding GSA\u2019s security program are complex and involve tradeoffs among competing needs and funding sources. These decisions are important for both federal agencies and the FBF. There are a number of options for addressing the security funding issue. These include allowing the FBF to continue to fund the excess security costs, decreasing expenditures for security, or increasing revenues by either raising security charges or obtaining additional direct appropriations to cover the shortfall. The option or options selected could affect the government\u2019s investment in the existing inventory of federal buildings as well as GSA\u2019s ability to meet the government\u2019s future space needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Initial Upgrade Decisions Reevaluated, Modified, or Voided", "paragraphs": ["Another problem affecting the implementation of the security upgrade program was the need to reevaluate the initial decisions about building security upgrade needs. According to GSA officials, many of these decisions were changed, or even cancelled and voided, for a number of reasons. Because of these changes, it was more difficult for GSA to order priorities, allocate funds, and set realistic completion schedules and goals; delays and inefficiencies in the program resulted. Also, these changes created challenges for GSA in maintaining the reliability of the tracking system, and in some cases, the system was not updated to reflect the changes.", "Security upgrade decisions often had to be reevaluated, changed, or voided because of several building-unique issues that surfaced after GSA\u2019s initial efforts to identify building security upgrade needs. For example, many GSA-owned and -operated buildings are considered \u201chistoric.\u201d For some of these buildings, issues raised by historical societies about the effects of installing certain security upgrades had to be addressed by GSA. In one region we visited, GSA had to find an alternative method for mounting surveillance cameras for monitoring a building\u2019s outside perimeter because of concerns raised by the historical society about the adverse effects of mounting the cameras on the building. GSA decided to attached the cameras to poles near the building instead of to the building itself. This alternative method for utilizing the cameras to upgrade security required additional design work, time, and cost for GSA.", "There were other instances in which building owners and/or nongovernment tenants in GSA-leased buildings expressed concerns or objections to approved security upgrades, such as the use of magnetometers to screen people entering the building. Some approved and some completed upgrades subsequently had to be cancelled. During our building site visits, both we and the GSA OIG staff found examples of approved, and sometimes completed, upgrades that were voided because of subsequent reevaluations. requested by each building\u2019s BSC. SSA, however, said that the BSCs sometimes requested upgrades without sound security knowledge and the presence and oversight of a GSA physical security specialist. After negotiating with SSA, GSA removed upgrades from some SSA locations and agreed to assess the need for upgrades at other locations.", "In still other instances, security upgrades requested and/or approved required extensive discussion, coordination, and/or approvals from local municipalities prior to completion. Examples of security upgrades involving these situations included perimeter barriers, such as planters and concrete bollards, that were to be placed on sidewalks or curbs owned by cities or other municipalities, or where city-owned parking meters along the streets around the GSA-operated building were to be eliminated.", "Changes to approved security upgrades were also necessitated when one or more federal agency tenants moved out of or into a building, thus changing the security needs of the building. Also, as GSA acquired new space in buildings not previously assessed, the related security needs had to be assessed and addressed. Further, FPS staff also told us that some BSCs that initially did not request security upgrades later reconsidered and requested upgrades for their buildings. We noted in the upgrade tracking system a number of requests for upgrades initiated between April 1 and December 30, 1997. During this period, over 800 new approved requests for upgrades, totaling about $20 million in estimated capital costs and $11 million in estimated annual operating costs, were recorded in the upgrade tracking system.", "The extent to which these upgrade program changes have occurred is reflected by the changes in the number of buildings with approved upgrades, the number of approved upgrades, the number of completed upgrades, and the number of cancelled upgrades as reflected by the upgrade tracking system.

Although GSA regional staff developed more accurate cost estimates as upgrades were completed, the upgrade tracking system was not designed to readily add revised cost estimates to the individual upgrade records. As a result, upgrade cost estimates in the tracking system varied significantly with the actual obligations recorded in the accounting system, thus lessening the tracking system\u2019s effectiveness as a management tool for GSA and BSC program decisionmakers. Without readily available and more accurate cost estimates, BSC and GSA decisionmakers were not in a good position to judge the cost/benefit of various upgrade options nor to determine reliable estimates of funds needed to implement and operate the security upgrades.", "According to GSA, the DOJ report contained general cost estimating guidelines for certain recommended security upgrades for BSC\u2019s and FPS security specialists\u2019 use when estimating the costs of needed building security upgrades. FPS recorded the BSC upgrade requests and associated cost estimates in the upgrade tracking system. GSA regional staff developed more accurate cost estimates after the requests were approved, often after further engineering and design work and consideration of building-specific conditions. Although regional GSA building and contracting staff could have been aware of the revised estimates, FPS did not provide a means for readily including the more accurate cost estimates in the upgrade tracking system. FPS regional staff told us that updated estimates could have been shown in the tracking system by voiding the existing upgrade record and then creating a new upgrade record with the revised cost estimate, but this alternative was not often employed.", "In August 1997, FPS headquarters staff identified in the tracking system 98 buildings for which the estimated cost of the upgrades varied significantly from the actual obligations incurred. They found that the estimated capital costs of these upgrades totaled about $10.4 million compared to $29 million in obligations recorded in the accounting system for these upgrades\u2014a difference of $18.6 million, or 179 percent. low. For example, for seven of these buildings, FPS regional explanations to headquarters indicated that additional costs of $2.3 million were obligated to complete the upgrades because of unexpected problems: for six historic buildings additional costs had to be incurred, including three buildings where closed circuit television cameras had to be mounted on poles rather than attached to the buildings ($1.1 million in additional costs); and for one building, while installing barriers around the building, old fuel oil tanks were discovered and had to be removed ($1.2 million in additional costs).", "Our further analysis of FPS data obtained from the tracking system and accounting system in September 1997 showed that the estimated costs of upgrades approved for 551 buildings in 11 GSA regions varied significantly, both up and down, from the actual costs obligated to complete the upgrades. For 348 buildings, the cost estimate of the upgrades totaled $18.2 million more than the actual costs obligated; for 202 buildings, the estimated costs were $14.3 million less that the actual costs obligated; and for 1 building, the estimated costs equaled the actual costs obligated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Implementation Goals Not Met", "paragraphs": ["The DOJ report called for GSA to complete security assessments and upgrade cost estimates by October 15, 1995, for its high-risk (level-IV) buildings, and by February 1, 1996, for the remaining lower risk buildings (level I - III).

Further, GSA identified as performance indicators the percentage of security countermeasures completed in levels I-III and level-IV buildings. This indicator serves as a measure of the program\u2019s output, but no indicators were identified that would enable measurement of program outcomes, particularly relating to GSA\u2019s second performance goal for the security program. Indicators based on such security incidents as the number of building break-ins, reductions in the number of thefts, and the number of weapons and other prohibited items detected on persons and in packages are some examples that might be considered in setting performance outcome goals and indicators. periodically inspect security at GSA-operated buildings, complete building risk assessments based on established criteria, and recommend security improvements.
