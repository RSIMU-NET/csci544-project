GAO's past work on failed banks found that regulators frequently identified weak management practices that involved the banks in higher-risk activities early on in each crisis, before banks began experiencing declines in capital. However, regulators were not always effective in directing bank management to address underlying problems before bank capital began to decline and it was often too late to avoid failure. For example, examiners did not always press bank management to address problems promptly or issue timely enforcement actions.", "Forward-looking assessments of risk. The crises revealed limitations in key supervisory tools for monitoring and addressing emerging risks. During examinations, examiners did not always incorporate forward-looking information when assigning supervisory ratings based on banks' exposure to risk. For example, ratings did not consistently reflect factors such as poor risk-management practices that while not causing losses in the short term, caused losses in the long term.", "Considering risks from the broader financial system. The 2007\u20132009 financial crisis demonstrated that risks to bank safety and soundness could not be assessed by looking only at the performance and activities of individual banks or groups of banks. Rather, regulators must look across the financial system to identify emerging risks.", "In response to these lessons learned, regulators said they have taken a number of steps intended to improve their ability to identify and respond to emerging risks\u2014including instituting more granular tracking of bank compliance with examination recommendations to address emerging problems in a timely manner; incorporating more forward-looking elements into supervisory tools; and participating in systemic risk-monitoring efforts as members of Financial Stability Oversight Council. GAO and others have begun to review some of these initiatives.", "GAO has incorporated the regulatory lessons learned into a two-part framework for monitoring regulators' efforts to identify and respond to emerging risks to the banking system. First, the framework incorporates quantitative information in the form of financial indicators that can help users of the framework track and analyze emerging risks and qualitative sources of information on emerging risks\u2014such as regulatory reports and industry and academic studies. Second, the framework monitors regulatory responses to emerging risks, such as agency guidance, with the goal of flagging issues for further review when questions arise about the effectiveness of these responses. Users\u2014oversight bodies such as inspectors general\u2014can analyze regulatory actions taken to address emerging risks and gain insights into regulators' ability to take forceful actions to address problematic behavior at banks.

Federal regulators were criticized for not taking prompt and forceful action  to minimize or prevent losses to the insurance funds due to the failures.", "In response, two laws were enacted. First, the Financial Institutions  Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) authorized  the use of taxpayer funds to resolve failed thrifts, replaced the existing  thrift regulator, and moved thrift deposit insurance to FDIC. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991  (FDICIA) made fundamental changes to federal oversight of depository  institutions that included prescribing a series of specific prompt corrective  actions (PCA) to be taken as capital ratios of banks and thrifts declined to  certain levels, mandating annual examinations and audits, and mandating  a risk-based deposit insurance assessment system.", "Pub.

The results also included unprecedented taxpayer-funded  assistance to financial companies to stabilize the financial system. The  financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the existing regulatory framework  for overseeing financial institutions, including banks. In an April 2012  speech, the then Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve) said regulators and supervisors did  not always use their authorities forcefully or effectively. For example,  bank regulators did not do enough to force large financial institutions to  strengthen their internal risk-management systems or to curtail risky  practices.

This report also  describes some recent activities that regulators have taken in response to  the recent financial crisis. Although future banking or financial crises are  unlikely to unfold in the same manner as past crises, understanding  regulatory activity leading up to past crises can provide a useful context  for monitoring regulatory responses to emerging risks. In particular, this  report (1) examines regulatory lessons learned from the 1980s thrift and  commercial bank crises and the 2007-2009 financial crisis, focusing on  the efforts of federal banking regulators to identify and address emerging  risks to the solvency of insured banks before the onset of these crises;  and (2) offers a strategy that we and other oversight bodies, such as  inspectors general (IGs) and the international auditing community  (hereafter, oversight bodies) can use to provide continuous future  oversight of regulatory responses to emerging risks. We prepared this  report under the authority of the Comptroller General to conduct work on  GAO\u2019s initiative to assist Congress with its oversight responsibilities.", "To identify regulatory lessons learned from the crises, we reviewed and  analyzed studies by GAO, IGs of the federal banking regulators, the  federal banking regulators, and academics. We also interviewed the  federal banking regulators\u2014FDIC, OCC and the Federal Reserve. We  analyzed this information to identify common and unique challenges  regulators faced across the crises in identifying emerging risks and  responding to them effectively.", "To incorporate the regulatory lessons learned into a strategy that  oversight bodies and others can use to monitor regulatory responses to  emerging risks, we established a framework for monitoring (1) known  emerging risks to the safety and soundness of the banking system, and  (2) regulatory responses to these risks, including detecting trends in  regulatory responses that might signal a weakening of regulatory  oversight. To develop the first part of our framework\u2014monitoring known  emerging risks to the safety and soundness of the banking system\u2014we  first reviewed frameworks or programs for monitoring domestic and global  financial systems that included banking systems. We identified relevant  frameworks and programs developed by federal banking regulators, other  federal agencies, foreign banking regulators, and international  organizations through our interviews with the regulators and other audit  work as well as prior audit work. We analyzed these frameworks and  programs to identify key areas from where risks to the banking system  could arise and identified three: (1) bank financial condition and  performance, (2) asset markets in which banks have direct or indirect  exposure, (3) and overall economic conditions. We also identified  financial indicators that will assist users of the framework in monitoring  potential risks to the banking industry emerging from the key areas. Some  of our indicators are derived from the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating  System, commonly known as CAMELS\u2014the ratings system that banking  regulators use to, among other things, monitor aggregate trends in overall  soundness of financial institutions and assess their exposure to risks.  Other financial indicators are derived from the monitoring frameworks.  In addition to financial indicators, our framework also relies on publicly  available qualitative information on emerging risks to the banking sector  from banking regulators, and other entities that might have a unique or  varying perspective on emerging risks, such as investors, rating agencies,  trade associations, and academics.", "To develop the second part of our framework, we reviewed prior GAO  work and the domestic monitoring frameworks and conducted interviews  with the banking regulators to identify the range of supervisory actions  that banking regulators have available to them to respond to emerging  issues in banks and the banking system. From our prior work, we also  identified those actions that can be observed and analyzed over time to  monitor for changes in regulatory behavior and that could signal potential  weaknesses in regulatory oversight\u2014such as examinations and  enforcement actions. To supplement this effort, we interviewed a  judgmental sample of financial market specialists with a range of  professional experience in government, academia, and business as well  as in-depth knowledge of the 1980s thrift and commercial bank crises or  the 2007-2009 financial crisis. From the federal banking regulators\u2019  annual reports, we used data on the number and type of enforcement  actions taken against supervised financial institutions to illustrate trends in  enforcement activity. We also used regulatory financial data compiled by  SNL Financial to illustrate trends in bank growth and profitability over  time. We have assessed the reliability of federal banking regulators\u2019  enforcement action data as part of previous studies. We assessed the  reliability of the SNL Financial data by reviewing existing information  about the data and the system that produced them. We determined that  the enforcement action and financial information we used was sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.

Regulators use off-site  systems to monitor the financial condition of an individual bank; groups of  banks with common products, portfolio or risk characteristics; and the  banking system as a whole between on-site examinations. The off-site  monitoring or surveillance activities rely on self-reported information from  banks, filed through quarterly Reports of Condition and Income (Call  Reports) to the banking regulators, supplemented with other market  derived data, and in some cases, more detailed transaction level  reporting on certain products or entities. The monitoring and surveillance  activities help alert regulators to potentially problematic conditions arising  in an individual bank, groups of banks with common products, portfolio or  risks characteristics, and the banking system as a whole. Using these  tools, each of the regulators identifies and flags banks with potential signs  of financial distress and prepares lists or reports of such institutions (e.g.,  watch list, review list, high-risk profile list) requiring further follow up.  These tools also help alert regulators to the need for other actions, such  as a horizontal review of a group of banks, or broader policy guidance.", "To oversee large, complex banks, including bank holding companies,  federal banking regulators conduct on-site supervision by stationing  examiners at specific institutions. This practice allows examiners to  continuously analyze information provided by the financial institution,  such as board meeting minutes, institution risk reports or management  information system reports, and for holding company supervisors\u2019  supervisory reports to be provided to other regulators, among other  things. This type of supervision allows for timely adjustments to the  supervisory strategy of the examiners as conditions change within the  institution. Bank examiners do not conduct an annual point-in-time  examination of the institution. Rather, they conduct ongoing examination  activities that target specific functional areas or business lines at the  institutions based on their examination strategy, the institution\u2019s risk  profile, and the extent of supervisory concern during the supervisory  cycle. Such activities are discussed with bank management throughout  the year and incorporated into the final full-scope examination report  issued at the end of the supervisory cycle.", "With respect to other individual banks, examiners use Call Report data to  remotely assess the financial condition of banks and thrifts and plan the  scope of on-site examinations. As part of on-site examinations,  regulators also closely assess banks\u2019 exposure to risk and assign ratings,  under the CAMELS rating system. The ratings reflect a bank\u2019s condition  in six areas: capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and  sensitivity to market risk. Evaluations of CAMELS components consider  the institution\u2019s size and sophistication, the nature and complexity of its  activities, and its risk profile. Each component is rated on a scale of 1 to  5, with 1 being the best and 5 the worst. The component ratings are then  used to develop a composite rating, also ranging from 1 to 5. Banks with  composite ratings of 1 or 2 are considered to be in satisfactory condition,  while banks with composite ratings of 3, 4, or 5 exhibit varying levels of  safety and soundness concerns. Banks with composite ratings of 4 or 5  are included on FDIC\u2019s problem bank list, which designates banks with  weaknesses that threaten their continued financial viability. The  regulators supplement the CAMELS rating system with other risk  assessment methodologies and frameworks. For example, OCC uses a  Risk Assessment System that characterizes the level of risk, quality of  risk management, or aggregate and direction of risk across eight risk  categories. Also as part of the examination and general supervision  process, regulators may direct a bank to address issues or deficiencies  within specified time frames.", "When regulators determine that a bank\u2019s or thrift\u2019s condition is less than  satisfactory, they may take a variety of supervisory actions, including  informal and formal enforcement actions, to address identified  deficiencies. Regulators have some discretion in deciding which actions  to take, but typically take progressively stricter actions against more  serious weaknesses.", "Informal actions generally are used to address less severe  deficiencies or when the regulator has confidence the bank can and  will make changes. Informal actions include supervisory letters  detailing specific remedial measures for the bank to implement, safety  and soundness plans, resolutions adopted by the bank\u2019s board of  directors at the request of its regulator, individual minimum capital  ratio letters, and memorandums of understanding or agreements  between the regulator and the bank\u2019s board of directors. Informal  actions are not public agreements (regulators do not make them  public through their websites or other channels) and are not  enforceable by sanctions.", "The regulators use formal actions to address more severe  deficiencies. Formal enforcement actions include PCA directives,  safety and soundness orders, cease and desist orders, removal and  prohibition orders, civil money penalties, formal agreements, and  termination of a bank\u2019s deposit insurance. Regulators publicly disclose  formal enforcement actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1980s Thrift and Commercial Banking Crises", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Thrift Crisis", "paragraphs": ["A number of factors contributed to the severe crisis experienced by the  thrift industry in the 1980s. Thrifts were regulated by the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) and insured by FSLIC within a legislative  framework separate from the one that surrounded commercial banks. At  the time, thrifts were largely restricted to making long-term, fixed-rate  home mortgage loans. Because they issued short-term deposits to fund  their long-term mortgage assets, thrifts were exposed to interest rate risk.  When inflation resulted in rising interest rates in the mid-1970s and early  1980s, thrifts were unable to respond, losing many depositors to  competitors such as money market funds because regulations prevented  them from raising the interest they could pay on deposits. Inflation  diminished the value of the long-term, fixed-rate mortgages they held, and  virtually wiped out all the industry\u2019s net worth, driving many institutions  into insolvency.", "Because the assets of FSLIC were inadequate to close all insolvent  thrifts, FHLBB forestalled actual insolvency in the early 1980s by reducing  capital standards and allowing the use of alternative accounting  procedures to increase reported capital levels. At the same time,  Congress deregulated thrifts with measures that included phasing out  deposit interest-rate ceilings, broadening the lending and investment  powers of thrifts, and more than doubling the limit of federal deposit  insurance per thrift account holder. A 1997 FDIC study reviewing the  1980s crises in the thrift and banking industries found that as a result of  these regulatory and legislative actions, the thrift industry grew rapidly,  funded by an influx of deposits\u2014often higher-risk brokered deposits.Loan portfolios at thrifts shifted from home mortgage financing into  commercial real estate (CRE) loans\u2014particularly into higher-risk  acquisition, development, and construction (ADC) loans in areas of the  country experiencing a real estate boom. The profitability of many of  these activities depended heavily on continued inflation in real estate  values. Tax legislation passed in 1981 further stimulated demand for CRE  loans by increasing the rate of return. Our June 1989 report on failed  thrifts found that in many cases, diversification was accompanied by  inadequate internal controls and noncompliance with laws and  regulations; thus, the risk of these activities was further increased.  Consequently, many institutions experienced substantial losses on loans  and investments, a condition that was made worse by an economic  downturn in the later 1980s and by the repeal of the CRE tax incentives in  1986."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercial Bank Crisis", "paragraphs": ["The competitive environment for the banking industry became  increasingly demanding in the 1980s. As with thrifts, the development of  money market funds and the deregulation of deposit interest rates, which  removed the cap on the maximum amount of interest banks and thrifts  were allowed to pay on deposits, spurred a competition to attract  depositors with higher interest rates. This competition resulted in further  squeezing what the banks could earn net of what they had to pay to  acquire the deposits. Further, competition increased in the banking  industry not only from within, but also from thrifts, foreign banks, and  credit markets such as the commercial paper and bond markets.", "The 1997 FDIC study noted that a series of regional and sectoral  recessions had a severe impact on local banks and led to many bank  failures, especially in areas that had been preceded by rapid regional  expansions; that is, boom-and-bust patterns of economic activity. The  magnitude of the banks\u2019 losses was compounded because many banks  active in these areas assumed excessive risks, with the result that they  failed in disproportionate numbers. For example, many banks greatly  increased their exposure to CRE as demand surged during the 1980s,  particularly as deregulation, tax incentives, and other factors created an  environment in which CRE lending became lucrative. To boost profits,  some large banks assumed additional risk by, for example, increasing  their off-balance-sheet activities.", "The 1997 FDIC study identified four major regional and sectoral economic  recessions that were associated with widespread bank failures during the  1980-1994 period. The first recession was related to a downturn in  farmland prices in the early and middle 1980s and led to a number of  failures of banks with heavy concentrations of agricultural loans,  particularly in the Midwest. The second recession occurred in Texas and  other oil producing southwestern states after oil prices began dropping in  1981. While initial bank failures in this region were primarily due to  problems with energy-related loans, substantial losses on CRE and  residential real estate loans were responsible for the rising number of  bank failures in this region in the second half of the decade. The third and  fourth recessions occurred in the northeastern United States and in  California at the end of the 1980s, largely due to a sharp decline in real  estate prices that resulted from an oversupply of CRE and residential real  estate in these areas and led to defaulted real estate loans and bank  failures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "2007-2009 Financial Crisis", "paragraphs": ["In January 2010 testimony, the former FDIC Chairman commented that a  number of the products and practices that led to the 2007-2009 financial  crisis had their roots in mortgage market innovations that began in the  1980s.residential mortgage investments that precipitated the thrift crisis of the  1980s, banks and thrifts began selling a major share of their mortgage  loans for securitization.

Private-label MBS backed by lower-quality  mortgage pools left investors exposed to greater risk of default. The  market share of private-label MBS, which typically pool jumbo and  nonprime mortgages, grew rapidly from 2004 to 2006. During this time,  the market share of the GSEs, which pool eligible prime mortgages,  decreased. Other investment structures such as collateralized debt  obligations (CDO) were also instrumental to creating demand for these  riskier, lower quality loans.  In a basic CDO, a group of loans or debt  securities are pooled and securities are then issued in different tranches  that vary in risk and return depending on how the underlying cash flows  produced by the pooled assets are allocated. If some of the underlying  assets defaulted, the more junior tranches\u2014and thus riskier ones\u2014would  absorb these losses first before the more senior, less-risky tranches.  Purchasers of these CDO securities included insurance companies,  mutual funds, commercial and investment banks, and pension funds.  Many of these CDOs largely consisted of mortgage-backed securities,  including subprime mortgage-backed securities. The growth of the  mortgage-linked derivatives market further allowed investors to take on  exposure to the subprime and Alt-A markets without actually owning the  mortgages or the MBS or CDO on the entities that owned the mortgages.  Through the use of such credit derivatives, investor exposure to losses in  these markets was multiplied and became many times larger than the  exposures generated by the mortgages alone.", "The dramatic decline in the U.S. housing market that began in 2006  precipitated a decline in 2007 in the price of mortgage-related assets,  particularly mortgage assets based on nonprime loans. Some financial  institutions were so exposed that they were threatened with failure, and  some failed because they were unable to raise capital or sell assets to  generate liquidity as the value of their portfolios declined. Other  institutions, ranging from the GSEs to large securities firms, were left  holding \u201ctoxic\u201d mortgages or mortgage-related assets that became  increasingly difficult to value, were illiquid, and potentially had little worth.  Moreover, investors not only stopped buying private-label MBS but also  became reluctant to buy securities backed by other types of assets.  Because of uncertainty about the liquidity and solvency of financial  entities, particularly among large, financially interconnected firms, the  prices banks charged each other for borrowing funds rose dramatically,  and interbank lending conditions deteriorated sharply. The resulting  liquidity and credit shortage made the financing on which businesses and  individuals depend increasingly difficult to obtain. By the late summer of  2008, the ramifications of the financial crisis ranged from the continued  failure of financial institutions to increased losses of individual wealth,  reduced corporate investments, and further tightening of credit that would  exacerbate the emerging global economic slowdown.", "Bank failures associated with the financial crisis were concentrated in  areas where the housing markets experienced strong growth. In response  to the demand for housing stock in the years prior to the crisis, residential  development activity increased. Many banks exhibited rapid growth in  their ADC portfolios, resulting in significant concentrations in ADC and  CRE loans.

Although regulators often  identified these risky practices early on in each crisis, the regulatory  process was not always effective in correcting the underlying problems  before the banks became undercapitalized and failed.", "For example, in our June 1989 report, examiners for 26 failed thrifts cited  management weaknesses as a leading factor in the failures. In virtually all  of these cases, the thrifts shifted their focus from traditional home  mortgage lending to higher-risk activities. Moreover, management at  these thrifts often pursued business decisions and strategies that  increased their risks, such as a heavy reliance on brokered deposits to  fund rapid growth, poor underwriting and credit administration practices,  and concentrations in ADC lending. These management problems  consequently made them more vulnerable to poor regional economic  conditions. We found that thrift management was often unresponsive to  supervisory concerns the examiners raised in these cases and that thrift  management did not always act on problems examiners identified or  implement promised corrective actions. In our April1989 testimony, we  analyzed the supervisory history of an additional 47 thrifts that were near  failing. For more than half, no formal enforcement actions were taken  and many had no history of formal actions. Where enforcement actions  were taken, they were often not effective in correcting problems. Further,  the length of time that elapsed between identification of a need for formal  action and implementation of the action was often unduly lengthy.", "Similarly, in our April 1991 report, examiners of 72 troubled banks  identified similar management weaknesses as the most common reason  for assets and earnings problems, including heavy concentrations in  specific types of assets, industries, or local economies, and excessive  growth combined with poor lending practices or controls. frequently cited asset problems involved problem real estate loans and  the most frequently cited reasons for the asset problems involved lax  underwriting practices. Losses on these problem assets resulted in  earnings problems and eventually capital problems for the banks.

In 26 cases,  the unsafe and unsound practices that caused the capital depletion  remained uncorrected.", "FDIC\u2019s 1997 study noted the ability of regulators to curb excessive risk  taking on the part of healthy banks was limited by the problem of  identifying risky activities before they produced serious losses. The study  found that bank regulators were reasonably successful in curbing risk- taking on the part of officially designated problem banks. However, in  dealing with ostensibly healthy banks, regulators had difficulty restricting  risky behavior while the banks were still solvent and the risky behavior  was widely practiced and profitable. The study found it was challenging  for regulators to distinguish such behavior from acceptable risk/return  trade-offs, innovation, and other appropriate activity, or to modify the  behavior of banks while they were still apparently healthy.", "We concluded in our 1991 report outlining our strategy for reforming the  deposit insurance system in the wake of the thrift and commercial banks  crises that meaningful reform would not succeed without an enforcement  process that was less discretionary than the approach used at the time.", "GAO, Deposit Insurance: A Strategy for Reform, GAO/GGD-91-26 (Washington, D.C.:  Apr. 15, 1991). we proposed that the first tripwire address unsafe activities that indicate  management inadequacies that could lead to further financial problems;  that is, unsafe practices in seemingly healthy institutions. We proposed  that a second tripwire address poor asset quality and earnings, as our  prior work showed that serious asset deterioration and earnings problems  are leading indicators of bank financial problems. Our third and fourth  tripwires addressed capital deterioration.", "Subsequently, Congress established the PCA framework in 1991.The  framework is set forth in sections 38 and 39 of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act, as amended by FDICIA. Section 38 requires regulators  to classify banks into one of five capital categories and take increasingly  severe actions as a bank\u2019s capital deteriorates. Section 39 requires the  banking regulators to prescribe safety and soundness standards related  to noncapital criteria, including operations and management;  compensation; and asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation. Section  39 was intended to allow regulators to take action against seemingly  healthy banks that were engaging in risky practices before losses  occurred. Initially, the standards for asset quality and earnings were to be  quantitative and intended to increase the likelihood that regulators would  address safety and soundness problems before capital deteriorated.  However, later legislative changes gave regulators considerable flexibility  to implement these standards, and regulators determined instead to issue  guidance in 1995 setting out broad standards addressing these areas.  Section 39 allows the regulators to take action for non-problem  institutions in which inadequate practices and policies could result in a  material loss to the institution or in cases where management has not  responded effectively to prior criticisms.", "Despite this new regulatory framework, regulators continued to face  challenges in restricting risky bank behavior in the years leading up to the  2007-2009 financial crisis. As we will discuss later, PCA was not effective  in resolving underlying problems at failed banks and preventing  widespread losses to the deposit insurance fund during the financial  crisis. Our more recent work and that of the federal banking regulator IGs  found that many of the banks that failed during the financial crisis were  susceptible to the same risks that gave rise to the bank failures of the  1980s and 1990s. For example, in our January 2013 report, we found  management weaknesses also contributed to many failures, including  poor underwriting and credit administration practices, rapid growth funded  by brokered deposits, and high concentrations\u2014in particular, high CRE  and ADC concentrations for small and medium-sized banks and high  concentrations of higher risk residential mortgage products at large  banks. With the downturn in the housing market and the onset of the  financial crisis, asset problems manifested. The rising level of  nonperforming loans, particularly ADC loans, was a key factor driving a  decline in capital for many failed banks. As another example, an April  2013 report by the Treasury IG noted that many of the OCC-supervised  banks that failed from 2008 to 2012 evidenced weaknesses with bank  boards of directors or management and high concentrations in CRE  loans. The Federal Reserve IG also found similar factors in its review of  failed banks supervised by the Federal Reserve, in particular, that many  bank failures involved the board and management making strategic  decisions to pursue aggressive growth that increased the bank\u2019s risk  profile and ultimately contributed to the failure. And, in its 2010 report,  the FDIC IG found that risky bank behaviors associated with bank failures  included pursuit of aggressive growth in CRE and ADC loans, excessive  levels of asset concentration with little risk mitigation, and inadequate  loan underwriting.", "We and the federal banking regulator IGs also found that regulators had  identified underlying risks of banks that failed during the 2007-2009  financial crisis well before their failure, but did not always take timely  supervisory action. For example, of the 136 failed banks we reviewed for our 2011 PCA report, we found that most had received an informal or  formal enforcement action before undergoing the PCA process, although  the timeliness of enforcement actions was inconsistent. Specifically,  among 60 banks that failed between January 2008 and June 2009,  approximately 28 percent did not have an initial informal or formal non- PCA enforcement action until 90 days or less before bank failure. Further,  50 percent of these failed banks did not have an enforcement action until  180 days or less prior to failure. After June 2009, these percentages  improved, with approximately 8 percent not having an enforcement action  until 90 days or less before failure, and approximately 22 percent not  having an action until 180 days or less before failure.", "Similarly, a September 2011 report by the Federal Reserve IG analyzing  the failure of 20 state member banks noted that examiners identified key  safety and soundness risks but did not take sufficient supervisory action  in a timely manner to compel the boards and management to mitigate  those risks. In many instances, the IG found the examiners eventually  concluded that a supervisory action was necessary, but that conclusion  came too late to reverse the bank\u2019s deteriorating condition. Further, a  December 2010 report by the FDIC IG found that in many cases,  examiners identified significant risks but did not take timely and effective  action to address those risks until the bank had started to experience  significant financial deterioration in the loan or investment portfolios.", "Staff from one regulator told us that when they have a bank failure, they  always look back at that failure and assess what they could have done  differently in terms of supervision. They found that generally, examiners  had identified the underlying issues that eventually led to the failures but  did not press management hard enough to deal with those issues. These  staff explained that it can be difficult for examiners to make the case to  bank management that they need to ratchet down a profitable line of  business because at the time the examiners see risk building up, the  bank\u2019s performance may not yet have been impacted. These staff also  said that if the agency decides to take an enforcement action when the  bank is still in good financial shape, and the bank refuses to sign it, a  lengthy and resource-intensive legal process could ensue. Staff from  another regulator acknowledged that examiners had often uncovered  problems at the banks long before they failed, yet bank management did  not take action to address their recommendations. These staff noted that  part of the role of the examiner is to be skeptical, and it is difficult to be  skeptical when loans are paying as agreed. These staff recognized that in  the past they have not always been effective in getting bank management  to take action to address potential problems before their effect hits the  balance sheet.", "Banking regulators also received considerable feedback in response to  proposed actions to address emerging risks that resulted in delays. The  regulators issued draft guidance in January 2006 on CRE concentrations  and risk management, based partly on the trends they observed in CRE  concentrations and risks, but the guidance was not finalized until  December 2006. Staff from one regulator told us the guidance was  issued too late to allow for corrective actions to be taken across the  banking system before the crisis ensued. The draft guidance elicited  about 4,400 comments letters from bankers, industry trade groups, state  financial regulatory agencies, appraisers and real estate industry  representatives. The vast majority of the commenters expressed strong  resistance to the proposed guidance, and the staff told us that working  through the comment process resulted in delays to final issuance. In its  September 2011 report summarizing state member bank failures, the  Federal Reserve IG reported that examiners they spoke with perceived  the guidance to be \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d and that examiners mentioned that  many institutions did not quickly adopt the risk management practices  outlined in the guidance prior to the onset of the financial crisis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Past Crises Revealed Limitations in Existing Tools for Monitoring and Addressing Emerging Risks", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PCA Reliance on Capital Triggers Limited Its Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier, in the aftermath of the thrift and commercial bank  crises regulators were criticized for failing to take timely and forceful  action to address the causes of thrift and bank failures and prevent losses  to taxpayers and the deposit insurance fund.

However, the PCA  framework did not prevent widespread losses to the deposit insurance  fund\u2014a key goal of PCA. In June 2011, we reported on the effectiveness  of the PCA framework for addressing financial deterioration of banks  during the financial crisis and concluded that PCA\u2019s reliance on capital  triggers limited its ability to promptly address bank problems.", "Before 2007, PCA was largely untested by a financial crisis that resulted in a large  number of bank failures.

As of June 2015, federal  banking regulators were still considering the pros and cons of modifying  the PCA framework, such as the use of additional noncapital-based  triggers. For instance, FDIC staff noted that non-capital triggers could  strengthen the supervisory process and help banks avoid mistakes  leading to crisis, address GAO and FDIC IG recommendations, and  involve low implementation costs since the infrastructure is already in  place. However, FDIC staff said that the additional hard-wired PCA  triggers, which would likely require interagency rulemaking, could  encourage banks to operate just below a given threshold to avoid  scrutiny, and banks tripping PCA non-capital triggers could be perceived  in the capital markets as being on a path toward regulatory intervention.

In its 1997 study, FDIC analyzed the management component  ratings for the 1,564 banks that failed between 1980 and 1994 (excluding  banks that received FDIC assistance) during the commercial bank  crisis. The results showed that 2 years before failure, in only 6 percent  of the cases was the management rating one full number worse than the  average of the other four components. The FDIC IG noted in a 2010  report that examiners did not always place sufficient emphasis on risk  mitigation when assigning ratings to banks that later failed. The IG  noted that bank management\u2019s lack of responsiveness to examiners\u2019  concerns was not always reflected in assigned CAMELS ratings until  significant financial deterioration occurred. In its 2011 report, the Federal  Reserve IG said its work highlighted the need for supervisors to ensure  that CAMELS composite and component ratings are consistent with  narrative examination comments to clearly convey the need for urgent  action when appropriate.", "Staff from one regulator told us that although the management  component of the CAMELS is stand-alone, in some instances, examiners  found it difficult to rate management low (i.e., 4 or 5) if capital and  earnings were strong, even if they had noted concerns with management  practices. As a result, in some cases, composite CAMELS ratings  remained relatively high (i.e., 1 or 2) until capital and earnings began to  decline. Because capital and earnings tend to be lagging indicators, such  ratings decreases were not reflected in some cases until before the bank  failed. In our 2011 PCA report, we found that most banks that failed  degraded from a CAMELS composite rating of 2 to a 4 in one quarter,  though they generally had at least one component rating of a 3 prior to  failure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bank Supervision Did Not Consider the Impact of Risks from the Broader Financial System on Banks", "paragraphs": ["The financial crisis also highlighted the need for regulators to consider the  impact of risks in the broader financial system on individual banks. Before  the 2007-2009 financial crisis, banking supervision was microprudential;  that is, generally focused on the activities of individual institutions or  groups of insitutions. Staff from two federal banking regulators  underscored that financial stability requires looking beyond the safety and  soundness of individual banks to across the financial system with a  macroprudential approach that focuses on assessing systemic risks.  Staff from one regulator said that the problem with focusing solely on the  activities of individual banks could be seen in the \u201coriginate to distribute\u201d  model that banks used to originate mortgages in the years leading to the  financial crisis. That is, banks were originating mortgages with the intent  to sell them in the secondary market as mortgage-backed securities, and  not keep them in portfolio as held-for-investment. These staff also said  that although the underwriting risk of these mortgages was significant,  they believed that there was little risk to the bank\u2019s capital because the  bank was making fees but was not retaining the credit risk of the  mortgages.", "These staff said they incorrectly assumed that investors were paying  attention to the underwriting risk embedded in the securitized mortgages,  because investors were buying the securities and not putting pressure on  the banks to increase their underwriting standards for the underlying  mortgages. When the real estate bubble burst and homeowners began to  default on their mortgages, these investors suffered heavy losses. As a  result, staff said they learned that financial stability oversight requires a  different perspective and a different, more global approach that considers,  among other things, the interconnectedness of financial institutions and  their activities. In retrospect, staff noted that stronger bank capital  standards\u2014notably those relating to the quality of capital and the amount  of capital required for banks\u2019 trading book assets\u2014and more attention to  the liquidity risks faced by the largest, most interconnected firms would  have made the financial system as a whole more resilient.", "Although the activities of large, interconnected financial institutions often  crossed traditional sector boundaries, banking regulators did not always  have sufficient tools and capabilities to adequately oversee the risks that  these financial institutions pose to themselves and other institutions. In  June 2008 testimony, a former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman noted  that under the current U.S. regulatory structure, challenges can arise in  assessing risk profiles of large, complex financial institutions operating  across financial sectors, particularly given the growth in the use of  sophisticated financial products that can generate risks across various  legal entities. He also said that the financial crisis highlighted the  importance of enterprise wide risk management, particularly that  supervisors need to understand risks across a consolidated entity and  assess the risk management tools being applied across the financial  institutions. For example, the former Federal Reserve Chairman said  that stress tests of the 19 largest bank holding companies, conducted by  federal banking regulators in 2009 as part of the Supervisory Capital  Assessment Program, demonstrated that many of these institutions\u2019  information systems could not provide timely, accurate information about  bank exposures to counterparties or complete information about the  aggregate risks posed by different positions and portfolios.", "Staff from another regulator said that fragmented databases and  otherwise insufficient processes at large banks to identify similar risks  within and across various lines of businesses and legal entities both on  and off the balance sheet resulted in the failure to identify and therefore  measure, monitor, and control exposure to concentrations. Further,  accounting rules in effect at the time permitted special-purpose entities\u2014 legal entities often used by banks to facilitate the securitization of real- estate loans\u2014to remain off the banks\u2019 balance sheets, thus obfuscating  regulators\u2019 ability to fully understand the extent of the banks\u2019 business  activities and risk exposures. Our own work had raised concerns over the  adequacy of supervision of large financial conglomerates. For example,  one of the large entities that OTS oversaw was the insurance  conglomerate American International Group, Inc. (AIG), which was  subject to a government takeover necessitated by financial difficulties the  firm experienced as the result of OTC derivatives activities related to  mortgages. In a March 2007 report, we expressed concerns over the  appropriateness of having OTS oversee diverse global financial  institutions given the size of the agency relative to the institutions for  which it was responsible.", "Staff from one regulator said that another lesson learned was that an  enormous amount of systemic risk had been concentrated in the shadow  banking system before the onset of the 2007-2009 financial crisis in  several nonbank financial firms, such as large investment firms. However,  the regulators did not perceive the buildup of risk and leverage across the  financial system because of a gap in the regulation of the shadow  banking system. Staff said that the increase in system-wide leverage  during the years leading up to the financial crisis distinguished the impact  that real estate problems of the 1980s had on thrifts and commercial  banks from the impact that real estate problems of the 2000s had on the  banking sector and larger financial system. That is, losses from real  estate-related loans, while primary factors in the failures of banks and  thrifts during the 1980s, did not have a systemic impact on the larger  financial system because these institutions had originated the loans and  retained the associated credit risk.", "In contrast, they said that losses from real estate-related loans during the  2007-2009 financial crisis had a systemic impact because the risks  associated with these loans were spread and amplified throughout the  financial system. Contributing to the buildup of risk and leverage across  the financial system was the fact that shadow banking activities were, for  the most part, not subject to consistent and effective regulatory oversight.  The former Federal Reserve Chairman noted that much shadow banking,  including various special-purpose entities and many nonbank mortgage- origination companies, lacked meaningful prudential regulation. In our  January 2009 report, we noted that the role of nonbank lenders in the  recent financial collapse provided an example of a gap in our financial  regulatory system resulting from the activities of institutions that were  generally subject to little or no direct oversight by federal regulators. The  significant participation by these nonbank lenders in the subprime  mortgage market\u2014which targeted products with riskier features to  borrowers with limited or poor credit history\u2014contributed to a dramatic  loosening of underwriting standards leading up to the crisis. Staff from  one regulator noted that, at the large investment firms, broker-dealers  arranged for investors to fund these long-term mortgage assets with  short-term financial instruments, typically with original maturities of less  than nine months, which allowed leverage in the whole financial system to  build to unprecedented levels and distribute risk throughout the system.", "However, some of the top investment banks were subject to voluntary  and limited oversight at the holding company level\u2014the level of the  institution that generally managed its overall risks. holding companies faced serious losses and funding problems during the  crisis, and their instability severely damaged the financial system. The  financial crisis demonstrated that the failure of large interconnected  financial institutions, such as the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings,  Inc. in the fall of 2008, could trigger systemic events through a rise in the  price of risk (that is, the risk-adjusted return on investments) and  deleveraging in the broader financial system.", "The Securities and Exchange Commission terminated its program for overseeing these  large broker-dealer holding companies in September 2008 but continues to oversee these  firms\u2019 registered broker-dealer subsidiaries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Taken Steps Intended to Improve Their Ability to Identify and Respond to Emerging Risks", "paragraphs": ["Federal banking regulators have taken steps to incorporate the lessons  learned from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and improve their ability to  identify and respond to emerging risks.

Second, to improve their ability to respond earlier and more forcefully to  banks\u2019 risky behavior, the three regulators have initiated more granular  tracking of supervisory issues that surface during examinations, referred  to as matters requiring attention (MRA). Third, through their participation  in FSOC and their own surveillance activities, they also have been  monitoring the financial system more broadly for risks that could affect  their regulated institutions.

These risk assessments are based on assumptions  about potential adverse external events, such as changes in real estate or  capital markets prices, or unanticipated deterioration in a borrower\u2019s  repayment capacity. In supervisory guidance for stress testing practices  of large banks issued in May 2012, the regulators noted that the financial  crisis underscored the need for banks to incorporate stress testing into  their risk-management practices and demonstrated that banking  organizations unprepared for particularly adverse events and  circumstances can suffer acute threats to their financial condition and  viability.", "Section 165(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires two types of stress tests on  large banks. Section 165(i)(1) requires the Federal Reserve to conduct  annual stress tests of bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in  total consolidated assets and nonbank financial companies supervised by  the Federal Reserve, while Section 165(i)(2) requires companies with  more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets to conduct annual stress  tests themselves, in addition to requiring companies with $50 billion or  more in total consolidated assets and nonbank financial companies  supervised by the Federal Reserve to conduct their own stress tests  semi-annually. In October 2012, the Federal Reserve issued final rules for  the tests of holding companies with $50 billion or more in total  consolidated assets and also required the companies to conduct and  disclose annual company-run stress tests. Also in October 2012, FDIC,  OCC, and the Federal Reserve issued final rules requiring annual  company-run stress tests for bank holding companies with total  consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion and for national  banks and state member banks, state nonmember banks, state and  federal thrifts and thrift holding companies with $10 billion or more in total  consolidated assets.

Banks in this range also remain subject to the stress  testing guidance contained in prior interagency issuances.

And, FDIC published an  article illustrating approaches to assist community banks with credit stress  testing in an edition of Supervisory Insights.", "The former Federal Reserve Chairman said that one of the most  important aspects of regular stress testing is that it forces banks and their  supervisors to develop the capacity to quickly and accurately assess the  enterprise-wide exposures of their institutions to diverse risks, and to use  that information routinely to help ensure that they maintain adequate  capital and liquidity. risk-management capacity is itself critical for protecting individual banks  and the banking system. Federal Reserve staff also noted that the stress  test is the best way to communicate to bank management that risks have  built up and need attention, because it is data driven.

The new MRA guidance emphasizes effective  communication and prompt identification and correction of deficient  practices (including those that are unsafe and unsound) before they  affect the bank\u2019s condition. The guidance requires that examiners  track the supervisory concerns identified in the MRA. For example, for  concerns that are open, examiners must categorize them as either  new, repeat (if the same or substantially similar concern has  recurred), self-identified (by the bank), past due (when the corrective  action is not implemented in the expected time frame), escalated  (when subsequent to the MRA OCC addressed the uncorrected action  in an enforcement action), or pending validation (when the bank  implemented the corrective action, but insufficient time has passed for  it to demonstrate sustained performance). Examiners may categorize  an MRA as closed if the bank implements and OCC verifies and  validates the corrective action, or if the banks\u2019 practices are no longer  a concern because of a change in the bank\u2019s circumstances.

It is important for oversight bodies such as IGs  and the international auditing community to understand how the banking  system could be vulnerable to such potential threats, so as to be better  prepared to consider whether regulators are alert to and responsive to the  buildup of risks in various markets and the threat of such risks to the  broader banking system.

Emerging risks are vulnerabilities in the banking  system which, given a shock or series of shocks outside the system, can  cause the failure of a systemically important bank or multiple banks.  Examples of vulnerabilities include a credit or asset price bubble, lax loan  underwriting standards, insufficient bank capital or liquidity buffers to  absorb losses or withdrawals, and risk exposure through a maturity  mismatch between assets and liabilities. A triggering event or shock  could be political or economic\u2014such as turmoil in a region, the collapse  of a market\u2014or even result from a natural disaster.

Qualitative sources of publicly available information on  emerging risks include regulatory, market, and academic reports and  studies. For example, OCC semiannually publishes a report identifying  emerging risks to its regulated institutions, and the Federal Reserve and  OCC publish periodic surveys on underwriting practices at their regulated  institutions, which can provide insights into potential emerging risks from  the three key areas. Qualitative monitoring can also help identify financial  innovations and new banking products and services that could pose risks  to the banking system. FSOC and OFR annual reports, which identify  potential systemic risks that can include risks to the banking system, are  another source of information. In addition, market analyses, including  those by trade publications, policy or research organizations, and the  financial press often highlight industry trends, some involving risky bank  behavior.

As a result,  they may be able to identify risk buildups or deteriorating credit trends.  For example, rapid increases in the price of particular kinds of assets and  concentrations relative to historical norms or increases in specific types of  funding sources could indicate high levels of credit or maturity  mismatches. These are all early warning indicators of bank vulnerabilities  or buildup of risk that could lead to failure if not addressed effectively and  in a timely manner.

For example, the former Federal Reserve Chairman noted in a May 2013  speech that the collapse of housing prices and related mortgage losses  during the recent crisis were concentrated in critical parts of the financial  system, and amplified through various financial instruments, resulting in panic that led to asset fire sales and the collapse of the credit markets.Conversely, he said, the bursting of the tech bubble\u2014the rapid decline of  overvalued technology stocks in the equity markets in 2000 through  2001\u2014did not result in systemic risk because the stock investments were  not funded with excessive leverage and maturity mismatch.", "Commodities markets are very broad and they include soft commodities like agricultural  products such as wheat, coffee, and sugar, or hard commodities such as oil, gold, and  rubber.

Should these loans become nonperforming or default, the  banks would have to incur some losses unless they successfully hedged the risk. ability to obtain new credit from banks as any additional debt could put a  strain on their repayment capacity. Similarly, volatility tends to be  negatively correlated with market performance. That is, volatility tends to  decline as the stock market rises and increase as the stock market falls.

Such stress in the nonfinancial sector can  adversely affect banks, as borrowers begin to default on mortgages and  other types of consumer and business credit. As happened in the 2007- 2009 financial crisis, this can create a cycle where housing market  instability becomes self-reinforcing as banks reduce lending and shed  assets to conserve capital, thereby further weakening the financial  positions of households and firms.

These include microprudential tools, which  traditionally have focused on the safety and soundness of individual  financial institutions, and macroprudential tools, which can be used to  address vulnerabilities across the banking system and broader financial  system. Microprudential tools include examinations and capital regulation  for individual institutions; macroprudential policy tools include  underwriting standards and countercyclical capital buffers. Supervisory  tools intended to address emerging risks can also be structural or cyclical.  Structural tools are intended to build resiliency of regulated institutions to  vulnerabilities, while cyclical tools are intended to limit vulnerabilities by  restraining financial institutions from excesses. Capital regulation is an  example of a structural tool because requiring banks to hold more and  higher quality capital improves the ability of regulated financial institutions  to withstand losses and maintain lending after a bubble has burst.  Countercyclical capital buffers, on the other hand, are an example of a  cyclical tool because they are intended to counter excessive credit growth  that can fuel asset bubbles. Supervisory stress tests are tools that include  both structural and cyclical aspects.", "In monitoring regulatory responses to emerging risks, it is important to  identify the full range of tools regulators might employ to address such  risks, the goals of these tools, and their potential tradeoffs. For example,  a 2013 Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff report noted that  microprudential tools have largely been developed and evaluated on the  basis of the safety and soundness of individual institutions, not with  respect to the effects on financial stability of practices that are common to  many institutions, and it will be important to continue to evaluate their  effectiveness in this context. Further, while microprudential and macroprudential policy tools can be complementary, these two  approaches might also conflict with each other. Moreover, as a former  Federal Reserve Board member noted, regulatory tools that aim to  increase the resilience of regulated institutions and limit potential asset  bubbles by restraining the growth of lending by such institutions can be  circumvented when financial activities migrate into less regulated parts of  the financial system such as the shadow banking sector. As such, she  said that credit extension and associated vulnerabilities can increase  outside the heavily regulated banking system. To mitigate the risks that  may emerge as a result, effective and timely coordination among the  banking and other relevant financial regulators is essential. These  analyses could provide information on regulators\u2019 willingness and ability  to take prompt and forceful actions to mitigate problematic behavior at  banks. They could also signal potential procyclical effects of regulation;  that is, when regulation may not adequately discourage overly risky  behavior during economic upswings or may inhibit bank lending during  downturns, as banks may need to meet requirements during times when  it is more difficult to do so.", "A leveraged loan is a loan where the obligor\u2019s post financing leverage as measured by  debt-to-assets, debt-to-equity, cash flow-to-total debt, or other such standards unique to  particular industries significantly exceeds industry norms for leverage.

To illustrate, in our June 2011 report  on PCA, we found that increases in CAMELS composite or component  ratings can serve as warning signals of distress in banks. While most  banks that failed degraded from a CAMELS composite rating of 2 to a 4 in  one quarter, they generally had at least one component rating of a 3 prior  to failure.

Such regulatory lessons learned also may offer potential insights for  Congress, the auditing community, and other \u201cwatchdog\u201d entities in more  proactively assessing federal banking regulators\u2019 efforts to identify and  respond to potential emerging risks to insured banks. This report (1)  examines regulatory lessons learned from the 1980s thrift and  commercial bank crises and the 2007-2009 financial crisis, focusing on  the efforts of federal banking regulators to identify and address emerging  risks to the solvency of insured banks before the onset of these crises;  and (2) offers a strategy that we and other oversight bodies, such as  inspectors general (IGs) and the international auditing community  (hereafter, oversight bodies) can use to provide continuous future  oversight of regulatory responses to emerging risks.", "To identify regulatory lessons learned from the crises we reviewed and  analyzed studies by GAO, federal banking regulator IGs, the federal  banking regulators, and academics. To identify relevant academic  studies, we performed the literature search using the following databases:  ProQuest (which included SSRN, EconLit, and ABI/INFORM Global),  JSTOR, and NBER, using the following keywords or combinations of  them: financial crisis, savings and loan, thrift, lessons learned, regulatory  action, banking, and great recession. We performed these searches for  the period between January 1980 (the commencement of the 1980s thrift  and banking crises) and August 2013 and identified 24 studies. We  reviewed each study to identify those lessons learned that pertained  specifically to regulatory efforts to identify and address emerging risks to  the banking system in the years leading up to the crises. We did not  identify many studies on relevant lessons learned from this search. As  such, we determined to rely largely on our own prior work in the area. We  also interviewed the federal banking regulators\u2014the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC), and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System (Federal Reserve)\u2014and two of their IGs for their perspective on  regulatory lessons learned and regulatory actions taken to address these  lessons learned. We analyzed the information we gathered to identify  common and unique challenges regulators faced across the crises in  identifying emerging risks and responding to them effectively.", "To incorporate the regulatory lessons learned into a strategy that  oversight bodies and others can use to monitor regulatory responses to  emerging risks, we established a framework for monitoring (1) known  emerging risks to the safety and soundness of the banking system, and  (2) regulatory responses to these risks, including detecting trends in  regulatory responses that might signal a weakening of regulatory  oversight. To develop the first part of our framework\u2014monitoring known  emerging risks to the safety and soundness of the banking system\u2014we  first reviewed frameworks or programs for monitoring domestic and global  financial systems that included banking systems. We sought to identify  relevant frameworks developed by federal banking regulators and federal  agencies through our interviews with the regulators and prior audit work.  We identified relevant frameworks developed by the Federal Reserve,  OCC, and the Office of Financial Research (OFR), as well as a banking  profile published quarterly by FDIC. We also sought to identify relevant  frameworks developed by foreign banking regulators and international  organizations that focus on global finance or banking issues. Through our  review, we identified relevant frameworks and monitoring programs  developed by the following entities: the European Central Bank, the  Financial Stability Board, the International Monetary Fund, and the Bank  for International Settlements. We analyzed these domestic and global  frameworks and programs to identify key areas where risks to the banking  system could arise and identified three: bank condition and financial  performance, asset markets in which banks may have direct or indirect  exposure, and overall economic conditions.", "First, potential sources of risk can emerge from within the banking sector,  such as banks\u2019 business models, size, scope of operations, and  organizational complexity, among other things. Other risks that can arise  from bank condition are driven by risk management practices, loan  portfolio composition, and underwriting standards. Second, risk  emanating from banks could spread and spillover to other industry  sectors. Risks to the banking system can originate from other areas of the  financial system, particularly asset markets in which banks participate  either directly or indirectly. Developments in these asset markets such as  rapid asset price growth or decline can have a direct impact on bank  portfolios and their capacity to access funding in a cost-effective way. The  third area we identified through our analysis as a potential area where risk  to banks could stem from was the broader economy, in that economic  conditions generally impact asset markets and the profitability of banks  and bank customers and counterparties. A growing economy with low  unemployment tends to have a more favorable impact on banks and  markets than a recessionary economy with high unemployed workers.", "As part of our framework, we also identified financial indicators that will  assist users of the framework in monitoring potential risks to the banking  industry emerging from the focus areas. For example, a number of our  indicators for bank condition and safety and soundness are derived from  the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, commonly known as  CAMELS. Regulators use this ratings system to, among other things,  assess the soundness of banks on a uniform basis, identify those  institutions requiring special supervisory attention, monitor aggregate  trends in overall soundness of financial institutions, and assess their  exposure to risks. The ratings reflect a bank\u2019s condition in six categories  or CAMELS\u2019 components: capital adequacy, asset quality, management,  earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. For each CAMELS  component other than management, there are a number of financial ratios  that can be calculated based on Reports of Condition and Income (Call  Report) data that assist in the evaluation of how well or poorly a bank is  performing in that category. We selected those ratios that could be  determined quantitatively based on Call Report data. For example, the  management component of the CAMELS does not lend itself to the same  computation as that used for ratios based on capital or earnings. It  requires more qualitative assessment by examiners and therefore it is  more discretionary and more subjective than the other CAMELS  components. Also, all the ratios that pertain to a component need not be  included to show a trend. For example, in asset quality, we may choose  to illustrate loans that are 90 days or more past due rather than showing  also those that are 30 days past due and 60 days past due because the  implications of loans 90 days or more past due are more severe. From  the monitoring frameworks we reviewed, we identified indicators that track  asset price growth in key markets\u2014including the residential and  commercial real estate markets, equity market, Treasury market,  corporate bond market, and the commodities market. In addition, we  include indicators that track leverage and volatility that could impact the  banking system. We also identified indicators that track the overall health  of the broader economy from the monitoring frameworks we reviewed,  such as household income and debt, unemployment, and gross domestic  product. In addition to financial indicators, our framework also  incorporates publicly available qualitative information on emerging risks to  the banking sector from banking regulators, and other entities that might  have a unique or varying perspective on emerging risks, such as  investors, rating agencies, trade associations, and academics. Our  framework does not prescribe specific entities or sources to review,  rather, we recommend incorporating a wide range of available analyses  and perspectives.", "In developing the second part of our framework, we identified the range of  supervisory tools that banking regulators have available to them to  respond to emerging issues in banks and the banking system, including  both microprudential and macroprudential tools. From our prior work, we  identified microprudential tools, which traditionally have focused on the  safety and soundness of individual financial institutions. From the  monitoring frameworks we reviewed, we identified examples of  macroprudential policy tools, which can be used to address risk emerging  across the banking system and broader financial system. We also  identified those supervisory tools that can be observed and analyzed over  time to monitor for changes in regulatory behavior and that could signal  potential weaknesses in regulatory oversight\u2014such as examinations and  enforcement actions. We did this by reviewing our prior work in assessing  regulatory responses to risks as they emerged in the lead up to the 1980s  bank and thrift crises and the 2007-2009 financial crisis. To supplement  this effort, we interviewed a judgmental sample of financial market  specialists for their views on those regulatory activities that could be  effectively monitored to detect meaningful changes in regulatory behavior.  Because the information and type of analysis we were interested in  required the knowledge of both regulatory activities and financial trends,  we interviewed a purposive or non-generalizable sample of seven  financial market specialists on their views of regulatory activities that  could be effectively monitored to detect meaningful changes in regulatory  behavior. To ensure the financial market specialists represented a broad  range of views and professional experience, we recruited participants  from government, academia, and business who had in-depth knowledge  of the 1980s thrift and commercial bank crises or the 2007-2009 financial  crisis as evidenced by holding key leadership positions in government or  industry or having published relevant academic research on the  regulation of financial services. We identified these financial market  specialists through prior GAO studies, academic publications, and from  recommendations by other financial market specialists.", "To illustrate trends in enforcement activity across various economic  cycles, we obtained data on the number and type of enforcement actions  taken against financial institutions supervised by OCC, FDIC, and the  Federal Reserve, published in their annual reports dated 2005 through  2014. We have assessed the reliability of federal banking regulators\u2019  enforcement action data as part of previous studies and found the data to  be reliable for the purposes of our review, which is to illustrate trends in  informal and formal enforcement actions. We also obtained Call Report  data from SNL Financial database on the yields on earnings assets of  financial institutions from 2005 to 2014 for four bank size groups. These  bank size groups include (1) banks with over $50 billion in assets, (2)  banks with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion, (3) banks with  more than $1 billion but less than $10 billion in assets, and (4) banks with  $1 billion or less in assets. We assessed the reliability of the SNL  Financial data by reviewing existing information about the data and the  system that produced them. In addition, we have assessed the reliability  of SNL Financial data as part of previous studies. As such, we found the  data to be reliable for the purposes of our review, which was to illustrate  trends bank profitability over time.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2013 to June 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, A.
