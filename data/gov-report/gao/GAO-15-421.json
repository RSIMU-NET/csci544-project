Once the S&T community has completed its technology development,  additional product development activities, such as technology  demonstration and testing, are often needed before incorporating the  technologies into military weapon systems. Under the management of the  acquisition community, product development further advances technology  received from S&T developers and integrates it into systems that are  ultimately delivered to support the warfighter (see figure 1).", "However, as we have reported in the past, for a variety of reasons DOD  historically has experienced problems in transitioning technologies out of  the S&T environment and into military systems. For example,  technologies may not leave the laboratory because their potential has not  been adequately demonstrated or recognized, acquisition programs may  be unwilling to fund final stages of development, or private industry  chooses to develop the technologies itself.", "DOD has a variety of technology transition programs managed by the  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military departments  that provide mechanisms and funding to facilitate technology transitions.  The programs vary in size, approach, and funding, but most of them are  intended to target fairly mature technologies that are suitable for the final  stages of development and demonstration.

In addition, the projects selected  are to accelerate the fielding of technologies with the purpose of reducing  acquisition or lifecycle costs; addressing technical risks; and improving  test and evaluation outcomes. Furthermore, DOD was directed to develop  a competitive, merit-based program that at a minimum provides for  the use of a broad agency announcement or the use of any other  competitive or merit-based processes for the solicitation of proposals; merit-based selection of the most promising cost-effective proposals  for funding through contracts, cooperative agreements, and other  transactions; a limit on funding for each RIP project not exceeding $3 million; and no project is funded under the program for more than 2 years.", "Within DOD, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics issues overall program guidelines, and representatives  appointed by the military service acquisition executives, Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD/R&E), and the  Director, Office of Small Business Programs have the responsibility for  establishing the RIP processes that support DOD\u2019s goal and meet the  guidelines.

The topics are intended to reflect technology capability  needs and requirements for weapon systems and acquisition programs,  and are one of the criteria used in the selection of projects. The military  departments and defense components have used different approaches to  identify the technology research topics, but over time have moved to a  more common approach. For example, while the Air Force and Navy  have largely relied on their acquisition communities to identify technology  needs, the Army relied primarily on its science and technology community  to identify needs for the first 3 years of the program.

According to RIP officials, the software was  delivered to end users at West Point and future Army leaders are  using this software to improve their tactical command skills.", "Mine Roller Wheel Assembly Improvement: This project improves  effectiveness of the Marine Corps mine roller wheel assembly over  the legacy system which makes it more effective at neutralizing  threats. A mine roller is used to detonate and clear certain classes of  buried, pressure-activated explosive threats. This upgrade is expected  to be less expensive than the cost of the original roller wheel  assembly it is modifying while increasing its effectiveness at a greater  range of speeds. In February 2015 the Marine Corps established an  acquisition program known as the Wheelbank Suspension Upgrade  Program to purchase the upgraded mine roller wheel assembly and is  now working toward a production decision expected in the third  quarter of fiscal year 2015.", "In contrast, we found several different reasons projects did not transition.  DOD officials told us it may take a year or more to transition a project  because project completion may not easily line up with user timelines or  the DOD budget cycle. A little more than half had successfully  demonstrated the technology as planned, but had no user commitment.  According to RIP project managers, some of the projects provided value  to DOD and may yet transition in the future. One of the Navy projects, for  example, which provides a technology to filter out interference in certain  military radios, has an interested transition partner, but has not yet  transitioned due to funding constraints. Officials reported they were  unable to secure funding in the fiscal year 2015 and 2016 budgets, but  have submitted another request for fiscal year 2017. DOD officials also  said that several projects failed to transition due to changing user  priorities and requirements, such as the phase-out of ongoing missions in  Iraq and Afghanistan. Further, according to DOD officials, other projects  demonstrated a proof of concept or provided data to develop  requirements, but were not planned to transition into a program of record.  For example, one Army project delivered a prototype field kitchen that  demonstrated potential capabilities, and the results will be used to inform  future requirements for a program of record planned in 2019.", "Other RIP projects that did not transition needed further technology  development or additional testing\u2014such as software that needed security  accreditation\u2014before they could be integrated into a DOD program. For  example, a Navy-funded project for a torpedo array nose assembly,  designed to improve the array\u2019s performance in shallow water, needs  additional testing to complete the array qualification effort. If successful,  this array nose assembly is expected to provide a second source at a  lower cost than the current array.", "On the other hand, officials told us some of the projects did not meet user  requirements or did not demonstrate that their technology was better than  existing technology. For example, a SOCOM-funded project to develop  an upgraded antenna that could operate in the presence of jamming did  not meet a performance standard. Also, an Air Force project to test  capabilities of a spectral flare showed the flare did not meet all of the  requirements and did not offer significant improvement in performance  compared to the current flare. Officials said that although projects may  appear unsuccessful, in some cases they provided valuable information  that could improve future decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mature Technology, User Commitment, and Program Support Contribute to Successful Transition; However, DOD Has Not Taken Steps to Evaluate This", "paragraphs": ["In our past work on DOD technology transition activities, we found that  several factors are important to successful transition, including the  selection of projects that have sufficiently mature technologies and early  endorsement from intended military users. In addition, once projects are  selected, they require effective management processes to support  technology transition. RIP officials and project managers that we  interviewed also noted that these factors can contribute to successful  transition. In general, however, at the DOD level there has not been an  effort to understand the extent to which these factors may be contributing  to differences in transition and to communicate lessons learned from  military departments or defense components with a higher percentage of  transition success.

According to an OSD-level RIP official, the Navy and the Air Force have  more robust processes to support transition than the other components.  For example, the Navy and the Air Force provide additional internal  guidance for RIP participants that describe the roles and responsibilities  of participants. These departments also require project reviews every 6  months until project completion and stress the importance of lessons  learned for RIP project managers. For example, the Air Force Life Cycle  Management Center\u2019s guidance states that analysis of RIP outcomes at  the conclusion of each project cycle can identify lessons learned from  processes, successes, challenges, and recommendations that can help  build the program knowledge base and establish best practices in  program implementation and stakeholder relations.", "The Navy\u2019s guidance describes the importance of quality control,  consistent management, and continuous improvement to help avoid  demonstrating a technology that has nowhere to transition. The Navy also  uses project execution plans that describe transition plans, codify  transition partner agreements, and describe criteria to evaluate seminal  transition events. In addition, the Office of Naval Research\u2019s risk  management team can provide support for small businesses to stay on  track in fulfilling RIP contracts, including making sure companies can  ramp up production if their projects are transitioned. We have previously  reported that this office has a well-established technology transition focus  which may contribute to project success. Because of this, the Navy may  be better aware of the benefits and obstacles associated with a  substantial portion of their S&T portfolio. This knowledge can better  inform investment decisions made by Navy leadership."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "RIP Does Not Track Final Transition Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["While the program has established metrics to determine whether projects  have a funding commitment from users and are therefore likely to  transition, it does not track the degree to which completed projects have  actually transitioned. RIP officials view transition success broadly, as a  technology which is inserted into an acquisition program of record,  incorporated into a weapon system manufacturing process, adopted for  use by a depot or logistics center, or available for purchase on the  General Services Administration federal supply schedule or in the  commercial market. However, RIP does not formally track projects  beyond completion and whether they are inserted into acquisition  programs or used for other purposes, which limits DOD\u2019s ability to know  the final transition outcomes and whether any benefits were achieved. As  we have found in the past, tracking and measuring technology transition  and the impact of those transitions, such as cost savings or deployment  of a technology into a weapon system, provides key feedback that can  inform the management of programs such as RIP. We previously  recommended the Secretary of Defense require all technology transition  programs in the department to track and measure project outcomes\u2014  DOD  including long term benefits for acquisition programs or users.generally agreed with our recommendations but we found no evidence  that DOD has taken any action yet; this recommendation would also  apply to RIP, as it is a technology transition program. In addition, DOD  has not established an overall transition goal for RIP, so it is not clear  what is expected in terms of success. Federal government internal control  standards require that effective and efficient control activities be  established which include performance measures and indicators to  compare against program goals and objectives.DOD annually provides a report to Congress on the number and  description of projects that are funded through RIP, the department is not  required to provide information on transition results. Without this  information, Congress lacks insight about the program\u2019s performance  which is important for conducting program oversight.", "In our discussions with DOD RIP officials, they estimated that about 50  percent or more of the RIP projects will transition when completed,  although they said it is too early to accurately assess the overall  effectiveness of the program. Some officials indicated that there are not  enough projects completed and it could take two or more years after a  project is completed before it is successfully transitioned and used. In  addition, projects awarded in RIP\u2019s first acquisition cycle may not  accurately reflect program performance for the following years, in part  because there were implementation challenges associated with starting a  new program. Therefore, more data that captures final project outcomes  and long-term program experience is required to accurately assess  performance. In our prior review of DOD technology transition programs  that provide structured mechanisms and funding to facilitate technology  transition, we found that programs reported rates of technology transition  ranging from about 55 to 85 percent. percent is at the lower end of this range, as is experience to date with the  transition of completed projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["GAO-13-286. report program results to Congress, as this is not currently required.  Consequently, without an overall transition performance target and better  measure of outcomes, it is unclear whether RIP has been successful at  transitioning innovative technologies and is worth continuing.

DOD components are capitalizing on these  success factors to varying degrees. The Air Force and Navy, in particular,  incorporate them in RIP projects and, as a result, appear to be realizing  significantly higher transition rates for their projects, even in the program\u2019s  early years.

The department stated that  establishing a transition goal will impede the program\u2019s objective of  encouraging innovative technologies in defense programs. In addition, the  department raised the concern that, since only a limited number of  projects are complete, it is too soon to accurately assess the overall  success of RIP and therefore, establishing a goal is not in the best  interest of the program. Further, DOD said that in line with the Secretary\u2019s  release of the Defense Innovation Initiative in November 2014\u2014a  department initiative to pursue innovative ways to sustain and advance  military superiority\u2014it needs to maintain flexibility in RIP to address risky  technical requirements that may not be mature enough to transition to  acquisition programs, but may present opportunities for prototyping,  experimentation, or innovative test and evaluation. However, the  department said it would continue to measure and assess program  transition results annually.", "We continue to believe that it is important for DOD to establish specific  transition performance targets for RIP and assess the extent to which the  program is successfully transitioning technologies to support acquisition  programs. While we agree that flexibility may be necessary at times in  RIP to address risky technologies that may not be mature enough for  acquisition programs, the purpose of the program is to target innovative  technologies that have the potential to support acquisition programs in the  near term. We believe that there are many other technology development  programs and activities within the department\u2019s science and technology  enterprise with broader objectives than RIP and more closely align with  the goal of the Defense Innovation Initiative. Furthermore, as we pointed  out in this report, DOD has historically experienced problems in  transitioning technologies out of its science and technology enterprise  and into acquisition programs, and RIP was established as one  mechanism aimed at facilitating transition. Establishing a goal will not  impede, but instead help focus efforts on meeting this objective. We  recognize it is early in the program and that transition goals may need to  be adjusted as the program matures.", "The department agreed on the need to identify and apply factors that  contribute to the likelihood of technology transition success more  consistently across the program.

For these projects, we interviewed RIP project officials and  collected and analyzed documents outlining processes and procedures  used to manage the projects and promote transition opportunities. In  these interviews, we discussed whether projects successfully transitioned  and factors that may have helped or hindered project execution and/or  successful transition to defense acquisition programs or other military  users. We also reviewed prior GAO studies on DOD technology transition  and best practices for transition to identify what practices may facilitate  technology transition.
