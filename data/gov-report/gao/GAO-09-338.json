Consequently, for the sixth year, GAO has not been able to assess MDA's actual costs against a baseline of either total costs or unit costs. MDA planned to establish such baselines in 2008 in response to past GAO recommendations, but has delayed this until 2009. GAO was able to assess the cost performance on individual contracts, and project an overrun at completion of between $2 billion and $3 billion. However, because in some cases the budgeted costs at completion--the basis for our projection--has changed significantly over time as adjustments were made, this projection does not capture as cost growth the difference between the original and current budgeted costs at completion. In one case, these costs increased by approximately five times its original value. Performance and Testing: While MDA completed several key tests that demonstrated enhanced performance of the BMDS, all elements of the system had test delays and shortfalls. Overall, testing achieved less than planned. For example, none of the six Director's test knowledge points established by MDA for 2008 were achieved. Poor performing target missiles have been a persistent problem. Testing shortfalls have slowed the validation of models and simulations, which are needed to assess the system's overall performance. Consequently, the performance of the BMDS as a whole can not yet be determined. Schedule: Although fewer tests have been conducted than planned, the production and fielding of assets has proceeded closer to schedule. Except for no ground-based interceptors being delivered, all other radars, standard missiles, and software were delivered as planned. However, some deliveries, such as enhanced Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicles, will now precede test results. In most cases, MDA has also reduced the bases it planned to use to declare when capabilities are operational in the field. Thus, fielding decisions are being made with a reduced understanding of system effectiveness. Transparency, Accountability, and Oversight: Improvement in this area has been limited. The Missile Defense Executive Board (MDEB) has acted with increased authority in providing oversight of MDA and the BMDS. However, transparency and accountability into MDA's work is limited by the management fluidity afforded through the lack of cost baselines, an unstable test baseline, continued use of development funds to produce assets for fielding, and renewed potential for transferring work from one predefined block to another. A better balance must still be struck between the information Congress and the Department of Defense need to conduct oversight of the BMDS and the flexibility MDA needs to manage across the portfolio of assets that collectively constitute the system's capability. At this point, the balance does not provide sufficient information for effective oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has spent almost $56 billion since its  initiation in 2002 on developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense  System (BMDS) and is on course to spend about $50 billion more over the  next 5 years.

From its inception in 2002 through 2007, MDA  developed BMDS capability in biennial increments, ultimately delivering  two blocks\u2014Block 2004 and Block 2006. These 2-year blocks each built on  preceding blocks and enhanced the development and capability of the  BMDS. However, in response to recommendations from GAO, in  December 2007 MDA announced a new block structure that was intended  to improve the program\u2019s transparency, accountability, and oversight. The  new blocks are not based on biennial time periods, but instead focus on  fielding capabilities that address particular threats. Because the new block  structure is not aligned to regular time periods, multiple blocks are  underway concurrently.

Each capability designation in the delivery schedule  represents upgraded capacity to support the overall function of BMDS in  its mission as well as the level of MDA confidence in the system\u2019s  performance. The designations are defined as follows:    Early Capability Delivery signifies readiness for contingency use. At  this point, MDA has determined that the capability can be utilized by  the BMDS.

Similarly, MDA has not established unit costs for  selected assets, such as GBIs. Consequently, for the sixth year, we have  been unable to assess MDA\u2019s overall progress on total or unit cost. While  MDA plans to establish some total cost baselines in 2009, most efforts will  not be captured in a baseline. MDA also plans to establish unit costs,  another improvement, but is considering a narrower definition of unit cost  than is used by other weapon system programs.

Full cost baselines for Block 2.0 are anticipated to be  available in the spring of 2009, but only portions of Block 3.0 and none of  Block 4.0 and 5.0 costs will be baselined at this time.

MDA has not determined when other blocks will be  baselined. If other blocks were to be baselined before 2013, the percentage  of funding baselined would be increased.

The  agency has also established thresholds for reporting cost growth.  However, the approach MDA is taking, while an improvement, provides a  much less comprehensive assessment of unit cost compared to the  traditional acquisition costs that are typically reported for major defense  acquisition programs. Normally, unit costs are reported in two ways: (1)  program acquisition unit cost, which is the total cost for the development  and procurement of, and system-specific military construction for, the  acquisition program divided by the number of fully configured end items  to be produced, or (2) average procurement unit cost, which is the total of all funds programmed to be available for obligation for procurement  divided by the number of end items to be procured.   ed.", "MDA\u2019s development of the BMDS outside of DOD\u2019s normal acquisition process makes it difficult to compare the actual unit co st of a delivered  asset with its planned unit cost.

Thus, while the flyaway cost baseline will provide  visibility into changes in recurring manufacturing costs, it will not provide  a basis for comparison with the costs of other DOD programs.

They further explained that within the  block structure, there are many cases where MDA procures and delivers a  weapon system for more than one block and, in some cases, the same  configuration in more than one block. For example, THAAD deliveries are  included in Blocks 2.0 and 5.0. Agency officials cite this as a key difference  between MDA and other defense programs. For MDA, most of the  development costs are assigned to the first block where a capability is  delivered and very little of the development cost is assigned to subsequent  blocks. MDA officials further stated that if the agency were to use the  standard unit cost methodology, it would show very dissimilar unit costs  between the first and subsequent block deliveries and the difference could  not be explained by learning curves and manufacturing efficiencies. MDA  officials also told us that they chose unit flyaway cost for unit cost  reporting because flyaway cost provides a better measure of what the  individual system components cost to procure. However, MDA is not  precluded from also determining and reporting unit costs by taking the  entire cost of the asset being developed without regard to the capability or  block for which it is originally developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Frequent Realignments Indicate That Full Scope Is Not Yet Determined", "paragraphs": ["Without a firm cost commitment or baseline in place for the full scope of  the BMDS, in some cases the work currently under contract changes  frequently.

These overruns occurred in 11 of 14 MDA contracts we reviewed, with the  STSS contract accounting for more than 50 percent of the total. Based on  cost performance during the fiscal year and using formulas accepted  within the cost community, we estimate that at completion the cumulative  overrun in the contractors\u2019 budgeted costs could be from about $2.0 billion  to $3.0 billion. Our projections are based on the current budgeted costs at  completion for each contract we assessed, which represents the total  current planned value of the contract. However, the budgeted costs at  completion, in some cases, have grown significantly over time. For  example, the ABL contractor reported budgeted costs at completion  totaling about $724 million in 1997, but as depicted in table 5, that cost has  since grown to about $3.6 billion. Our assessment only reveals the overrun  or underrun since the latest adjustment to the budget at completion. It  does not capture, as cost growth, the difference between the original and  current budgeted costs at completion. As a result, comparing the  underruns or overruns for MDA programs in table 5 with cost growth on  major defense acquisition programs is not appropriate because those  major defense acquisition programs have established their full scope of  work as well as developed total cost baselines, while these have not been  developed for MDA programs.

The box overheated during testing which required a  thorough test of the unit. Upon successful completion of this testing, it  was determined it did not require a replacement. In addition, the program  had a failure in the main spacecraft computer for which the program office  initially recommended the removal of the entire computer from the  spacecraft. However, after extensive research and testing, the program  manager determined that the event with the spacecraft was an unverifiable  failure with a low probability of occurrence and low mission impact and  decided not to remove the computer from the spacecraft to resolve the  issue.

ABL\u2019s fiscal  year cost overruns of $10.6 million were mainly related to late deliveries of  key laser system components and the acquisition or refurbishment of the  Beam Control/Fire Control system components. For example, a major  component of the laser system required redesign and fabrication, delaying  planned delivery and installation onto the aircraft. Also, multiple Beam  Control/Fire Control hardware components either were not refurbished to  specification or failed initial testing, delaying delivery and integration  testing.

For example, the GMD program did not emplace the three  GBIs it expected to in fiscal year 2008 or conduct either of its two planned  flight tests as scheduled during the fiscal year. As a result, it employed less  labor than originally intended. Drivers for the MKV Task Order 7 contract\u2019s  fiscal year cost underruns include a restructuring of the effort and  decisions to use one rather than several approaches for coordinated  attack, and using less manpower than originally planned in its  procurement and software efforts. Lastly, the Aegis BMD contract for 27  SM-3 Block 1A missiles underran its fiscal year 2008 budget by  approximately $3 million due in part to spending less than planned for  engineering efforts with the missile\u2019s third stage component as well as  adjustments made in program management, labor efficiencies, and  material transfers in the missile\u2019s fourth stage component."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "While Some Tests Succeeded, Others Were Deferred; Overall System Performance Cannot Yet Be Assessed", "paragraphs": ["Although several tests showed progress in individual elements and some  system-level capabilities, all BMDS elements experienced test delays and  shortfalls, in part due to problems with the availability and performance of  target missiles.

The C2BMC element  extended development for its next software release, 6.4, by more than a  year because of delays in system-level BMDS testing and challenges in  developing the network server for version 6.2, as well as unplanned work  to incorporate effects from earth rotation in the 6.4 C2BMC planning  architecture. C2BMC added earth rotation effects to address a requirement  that Spiral 6.2 and later releases have the ability to model the true extent  of ranges for long-range threats. Finally, C2BMC is still developing its  capability to generate a single track from multiple sensors through a new  resource management function, the Global Engagement Manager. For  example, the development team for this function had to modify the design  of this function\u2019s new track processing that experienced an unacceptable  level of delays when processing data.", "In fiscal year 2008, the GMD program was unable to conduct either of its  two planned intercept attempts\u2014FTG-04 and FTG-05. MDA first delayed  and then later canceled the FTG-04 test in May 2008 due to a problem with  a telemetry component in the interceptor\u2019s Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle  (EKV) needed to gather test data. MDA also delayed FTG-05 from fiscal  year 2008 and conducted it in December 2008. Over the past two years  MDA had expected to conduct seven GMD interceptor flight tests by the  end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. However, MDA was only able to  conduct two, as shown in figure 3.", "The cancellation of FTG-04 raised concerns within the test community and  members of Congress. FTG-04 was at first delayed and then canceled.  MDA replaced it with a test to assess sensor capability\u2014FTX-03. The  sensor test allowed GMD to verify fire control software and integration  with multiple sensors. The DOT&E was not consulted on the decision to  cancel FTG-04 and expressed concern that the elimination of any intercept  test reduced the opportunity to gather data that might have increased  confidence in the models and simulations. In the conference report  accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2008, conferees expressed concern about the loss of the FTG-04 flight test  and requested that we review the circumstances and the effects on the  BMDS. Details of our review of the FTG-04 flight test cancellation appear  in appendix III.", "Because GMD conducted FTG-05 in December 2008, there are only two  full sets of GMD intercept data to date available for analysis which limits  the ability to verify and validate the models and simulations. Additionally,  FTG-04 and the subsequent test\u2014FTG-05\u2014were planned to present  different stresses to the kill vehicle which would provide critical data  needed to further verify the fielded configuration of the kill vehicle. The  cancellation and subsequent restructuring of the first test caused a delay  in FTG-05 from the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 until December 2008.  In the FTG-05 test, the interceptor hit its intended target. However, MDA  judged the target as a failure because it failed to release its  countermeasures as planned. Consequently, all primary test objectives  were not achieved.", "Looking forward to the next GMD intercept flight test\u2014FTG-06 in at least  the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009\u2014MDA is accepting a higher level of  risk than it previously expected in conducting this first test of the CE-II  EKV because it will contain several objectives that had planned to be  previously tested, but have not been. MDA had set up an approach to test  one new major component change at a time. For example, MDA had  planned to test the CE-I EKV first against simple targets, then the CE-I  against a complex target, and once that had been proven MDA planned to  test the CE-II EKV against a complex target. However, MDA was not able  to test the CE-I EKV against a complex target due to a target failure. Due  to testing problems, GMD has only been able to assess the CE-I EKV with a  target without countermeasures. As a result, the FTG-06 flight test will be  the first GMD test assessing both a CE-II EKV and a complex target scene.  Adding to the risk, this will be only the second test using a newly  developed FTF LV-2 target.", "During fiscal year 2008, the KEI program experienced problems during  testing that required it to rework components which, in turn, caused a  delay to subsequent testing. More importantly, due to technical issues  experienced by the program over the past two years, the first booster  flight test\u2014a key decision point for the program\u2014has been delayed by  nearly a year and is not scheduled to occur until at least the fourth quarter  of fiscal year 2009. Technical difficulties delayed the MKV program\u2019s fiscal  year 2008 hover test until fiscal year 2009. This hover test will allow the  program to integrate and test key components of the system in a  repeatable ground-based free flight environment as their technologies  reach maturity. Although originally planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal  year 2008, the test was successfully conducted in December 2008. The  STSS program encountered problems during testing that forced the  program to delay the launch of its demonstration satellites from April 2008  to at least the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The program continued to  experience technical difficulties with its space vehicles. For example,  during testing, the program experienced problems with its main spacecraft  computer as well as an overheating flight communications box. After  extensive testing, the program determined that these components were  acceptable for flight.", "Similarly, in fiscal year 2008, the Sensors element also experienced flight  test delays as well as difficulties in achieving planned objectives due to  target performance, but met some primary objectives. The element  successfully participated in other tests during the fiscal year which  demonstrated the ability for the sensors to acquire and track a target. One  test event, FTX-03, provided the first opportunity for four key sensors\u2014 Sea-based X-band radar, AN/TPY-2, Upgraded Early Warning Radar, and an  Aegis BMD radar\u2014to operate in a more operationally realistic test  scenario. This test demonstrated the capability for the sensors to  correlate target information in order to conduct an intercept test.  However, the target failed to release its countermeasures as planned. This  failure precluded sensors from assessing capability against a dynamic  lethal target scene with countermeasures. As a result, the sensors could  not collect all of the expected data, which delayed the element\u2019s ability to  develop algorithms needed for the discrimination capability. These  objectives will need to be addressed in future testing. The BMDS  Operational Test Agency has had ongoing concerns regarding the  formatting, tracking, and accounting of messages from GMD sensors.  The timely reception of messages from sensors to weapon systems is key  to support decisions and achieve effective intercepts. Since 2000 the BMDS  Operational Test Agency has reported these concerns to MDA about poor  data collection and management practices involving sensors affecting its  assessment of tests. These data management problems prevented the  analysis of message data, according to BMDS Operational Test Agency  officials. In response, the contractor proposed a message monitoring  system among communications nodes. Consequently, MDA recommended  that this issue be closed out, but the BMDS Operational Test Agency still  considers the matter to be open because GMD has not funded the  monitoring system.", "THAAD planned to conduct three intercept attempts, but due to a target  failure, it was only able to conduct two. The program could not complete  its final flight test of the fiscal year because the target experienced an  anomaly during flight. The test was planned to be a BMDS-level event and  was designated as a developmental test/operational test mission utilizing  multiple BMDS elements and operationally realistic criteria. The program  also expected to demonstrate that it could launch more than one THAAD  interceptor during the engagement. Program officials rescheduled this test  for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. In addition, THAAD\u2019s radar data  collection test, RDC-2, was planned for 2008 but was deleted due to target  availability and funding. As a result, program officials told us that these  test objectives will be covered in the future with hardware-in-the-loop  simulations and other radar events. The program successfully completed  its first two planned tests for the fiscal year. In October 2007, THAAD  successfully demonstrated an intercept of a target outside the earth\u2019s  atmosphere. This was the first time THAAD had successfully conducted an  intercept outside of the atmosphere since 1999.

Although target anomalies and failures have affected many of the missile  defense elements, THAAD and GMD have been most affected. In 2006, the  THAAD program was unable to achieve its first intercept attempt (FTT-04)  because the target did not function properly. In 2007, two THAAD radar  characterization tests (RDC-1c and RDC-1d) were unsuccessful due to  target anomalies. These tests flew targets with characteristics needed for  radar observation in support of advanced discrimination algorithm  development. However, target problems prevented an opportunity for the  radar to exercise all of the planned algorithms, causing a loss of expected  data. In addition to target failure issues, the THAAD program deferred  some flight tests because targets were not available, which cost the  program about $201 million. GMD also experienced similar long-term  effects on its flight test schedule when it was unable to achieve primary  test objectives in a 2007 intercept attempt (FTG-03) due to a target failure.", "MDA\u2019s existing targets are becoming less capable of meeting requirements  for near-term flight tests.

MDA embarked on this major development without  estimating the cost to develop the family of target missiles. MDA  proceeded to develop and even to produce some FTF targets without a  sound business case and, consequently, their acquisition has not gone as  planned. The funds required for the FTF were spent sooner than  expected and were insufficient for the development. Getting the FTF  target\u2019s components through the qualification process, however, was more  difficult and costly than the program expected. For example, MDA  originally planned to launch the first FTF target\u2014a 72-inch LV-2\u2014in a 2008  STSS flight test, but the test was rescheduled due to delays in satellite  integration and target affordability and availability. While many of the  target missile\u2019s components are found on existing systems, their form, fit,  function, and the environment they fly in have been changed for the 72- inch LV-2 target. Consequently, many critical components initially failed  shock and vibration testing and other qualification tests and had to be  redesigned. The process was recently scheduled to be complete in early  October 2008 but, after several delays, was not finished until December  2008. Despite this, MDA expects the target to be complete and ready for its  first launch in a third quarter fiscal year 2009 Aegis BMD flight test (FTM- 15).", "We recently reported that the FTF has been delayed, costs have increased  and exceeded $1 billion, and the program\u2019s scope has been reduced.  Work on all but one of the FTF target variants, the 72-inch LV-2, was  canceled in June 2008, including plans for development and production of  the second type of FTF target, the 52-inch, originally scheduled to launch  in 2009. With guidance from the Missile Defense Executive Board, MDA is  currently conducting a comprehensive review of the targets program to  determine the best acquisition strategy for future BMDS targets. It is  expected to be completed in mid-2009. Whether or not MDA decides to  restart the acquisition of the 52-inch targets, or other FTF variants, and the  nature of those targets depends on the results of this review.", "Currently, MDA has narrowed its FTF development efforts, focusing on a  single vehicle, the 72-inch LV-2 ground-launched target. The first launch  was supposed to determine the viability of the FTF concept and the  feasibility of discontinuing the use of existing targets. However, rather  than first conducting a separate developmental test to confirm the target\u2019s  capability, MDA has chosen a much riskier approach. The first launch of  the new LV-2 target will be in an Aegis BMD intercept test. Aegis BMD  originally planned to use this new target in a fiscal year 2008 flight test;  however, because the target was not ready, the test is delayed until at least  the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.", "Repeated target problems and test cancellations have also affected the  development of capabilities needed to discriminate the real target from  countermeasures. Without opportunities to test the functionality of the  software, there now is a system-level shortfall in BMDS progress toward  developing a target discrimination capability against more sophisticated  countermeasures in the midcourse phase of flight. In order to improve the  effectiveness of the BMDS against evolving threats, MDA elements are  developing advanced discrimination software in their component\u2019s  sensors.

Flight tests are, however, an essential tool used to both  validate performance of the BMDS and to anchor the models and  simulations to ensure that they accurately reflect real performance.  Computer models of individual elements replicate how those elements  function. These models are then combined into various configurations that  simulate the BMDS engagement of enemy ballistic missiles.", "To ensure confidence in the accuracy of modeling and simulation in  representing BMDS capability, the program goes through a process called  accreditation. Element models are validated individually using flight and  other test data and accredited for their intended use. MDA intends to  group these models into system-level representations according to user  needs. One such grouping is the annual performance assessment, a  system-level end-to-end simulation that assesses the performance of the  current BMDS configuration. The performance assessment integrates  element-specific models into a coherent representation of the BMDS.

Though Performance Assessment 2007 was a  success in establishing a capability for integrated modeling and simulation  in a short time frame, it was unsuitable to assess system-level performance  due to low confidence from a lack of accreditation. Consequently, acting  on a joint recommendation between MDA and the Operational Test  Agency, MDA officials canceled their 2008 performance assessment efforts  in April 2008 because of developmental risks associated with modeling  and simulations, focusing instead on testing and models for Performance  Assessment 2009.

MDA guidance emphasizes that one of the primary  objectives of the MDA ground and flight test program is to anchor BMDS  models and simulations.

Therefore, MDA has not yet triggered the requirement for an  operational test and evaluation prior to fielding. However, MDA\u2019s  concurrent approach to developing and fielding assets has led to testing  problems and concerns about the performance of some fielded assets.  After two flight test failures in 2005, MDA undertook a Mission Readiness  Task Force to establish confidence in GMD\u2019s ability to reliably hit its  target, establish credibility in setting and meeting test event dates, build  increasing levels of operationally realistic test procedures and scenarios,  raise confidence in successful outcomes of flight missions, and conduct  the next flight test as soon as practical within acceptable risk bounds.

For example, for certain engagement scenarios, the ground-based  interceptor will launch based on information provided by an entirely  separate element such as an Aegis cruiser or destroyer.

Consequently, these shortfalls in knowledge led MDA to reduce the  basis for declaring capability goals. Performance Assessment 2007\u2014 identified by MDA as a key source to assess capabilities during fiscal year  2008\u2014achieved only limited accreditation. This less-than-full  accreditation indicated that MDA could not rely on the assessment\u2019s  results to gauge end-to-end BMDS performance. Subsequently, MDA  officials decided to cancel Performance Assessment 2008 because they  needed time to address problems and prepare for Performance  Assessment 2009.", "While MDA officials declared these capabilities during fiscal year 2008,  they did so after mostly reducing the basis for the declarations. They  reverted back in several cases to older ground and flight tests, though  MDA in a few cases added some newer flight and ground tests as well. For  example, MDA declared early Block 1.0 capability for three engagement  sequence groups in fiscal year 2008 without the planned results from  Performance Assessment 2007. In all cases, though MDA had intended to  use the final results from comprehensive performance assessments, after  revising the basis for declaring capability goals it eliminated them entirely.  Specifically, MDA dropped some sources of data it expected to use, such  as the canceled Performance Assessment 2008, and shifted from flight and  ground tests planned to occur in fiscal year 2008 to older flight and ground  tests. For example, in Block 2.0 MDA declared full capability during fiscal  year 2008 for one engagement sequence group, Aegis BMDS engage on its  shipboard radar, even though Performance Assessment 2008 had been  canceled. MDA instead based its decision on integrated and distributed  ground tests (GTI-02 and GTD-02) conducted in calendar year 2007 as well  as prior flight tests during fiscal years 2006 through 2008.

However, as MDA  encountered test delays and technical challenges, it had to defer full  capability declaration for these engagement sequence groups until the end  of fiscal year 2009. For Block 2.0, MDA also deferred declaring full  capability for one of the two planned full capability declarations for fiscal  year 2008. This declaration is contingent upon the review of a ground test  that has been rescheduled to the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 and a  flight test rescheduled to the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Appendix IV provides  a detailed layout for the reduced basis of capability declarations for fiscal  years 2008 and 2009.", "Since MDA was only able to declare a few of the capabilities it planned for  fiscal year 2008, the schedule for fiscal year 2009 and subsequent years  will be compressed if the agency plans to maintain the schedule it has set  for its blocks. For example, MDA may need to declare three times as many  capabilities than originally planned for fiscal year 2009 in order to meet  the 2009 capability declaration schedule. In addition, if the schedule  cannot be maintained, MDA will likely have to make further adjustments  to mitigate additional delays in BMDS capabilities.", "Increased reliance on integrated ground testing will provide less  knowledge than a complete analysis of capabilities from a performance  assessment. Integrated ground testing involves less robust conditions than  distributed ground testing, which involves operational systems in the field.  The MDA master fielding plan indicates that the agency originally intended  to take a more comprehensive approach upon which to base capability  declarations. Reliance on an upcoming Performance Assessment 2009  quick look for Block 1.0 completion is a particular concern because the  knowledge it provides may be limited with respect to testing, according to  BMDS Operational Test Agency officials.

Under its prior block  structure, MDA deferred work from one block to another; but it did not  track the cost of the deferred work so that it could be attributed to the  block that it benefited. Because MDA did not track the cost of the deferred  work, the agency was unable to adjust the cost of its blocks to accurately  capture the cost of each.

For example, a comparison of actual versus planned  costs at the system or asset level is not yet possible, nor is an assessment  of the performance of the fielded system as a whole. Beginning in 2007,  MDA began efforts to improve visibility into its actual performance,  beginning with the new way of defining blocks, coupled with DOD\u2019s  creation of the MDEB.

The intent of our recommendation is to  increase visibility into transfers of work between blocks regardless of the  amount of the increase or the baseline status of the blocks. The trigger for  reporting the variances selected by DOD will not necessarily provide that  visibility. Given that only between 2 and 26 percent of BMDS block and  capability development costs from fiscal year 2010 to 2013 will be  baselined initially, visibility into transfers into blocks that are not yet  baselined may not occur. Further, an increase may not be reported in the  baselined block from which work is transferred because the transfer  would actually yield a decrease in the cost of the baselined block. An  increase would also not be reported in the receiving block if that block is  not baselined or if the transfer did not increase costs above the threshold.  MDA may need to consider a different approach to reporting that captures  meaningful transfers of work into and out of blocks regardless of whether  any of the blocks are baselined.

However, partly due to differences in how MDA describes test  objectives, it is unclear whether all planned FTG-04 test objectives will be  accomplished in follow-on tests. The loss of a primary objective, an  intercept of a complex target scene, will slow MDA\u2019s efforts to build  confidence in the EKV\u2019s ability to consistently achieve intercepts, unless  an additional intercept is scheduled. In August 2008, MDA informed  Congress that it planned to conduct a new intercept test called FTG-X in  fiscal year 2009. However, in January 2009 MDA stated that the FTG-X  intercept test was never formally approved and is no longer planned.", "In addition, some test objectives related to modeling and simulations have  been redefined so it is unclear whether they will be fully tested. Models  and simulations are critical to understanding and assessing the  performance of the BMDS because flight tests are limited by their cost,  complexity, and range safety constraints. Modeling and simulation is  therefore the primary way to fully assess the overall performance of the  BMDS and its various components. According to DOT&E, cancellation of  FTG-04 reduced interceptor and EKV data available for modeling, leaving  only two intercepts (FTG-3a and FTG-05) that have provided complete sets  of information. In October 2008, MDA stated that modification of FTG-04  into a sensor test eliminated a second opportunity to anchor the models of  EKV-fielded software. Test objectives in MDA planning documents  describe modeling and simulation objectives at a high level. However, it is  difficult to determine whether modeling and simulation objectives are  addressed in the near term because the objectives are defined differently  for each test. For example, the FTX-03 and FTG-05 objectives do not  distinguish between primary and secondary objectives while the FTG-04  does. One objective that seems to be absent in the FTG-05 and FTX-03 is to  collect data to support validation and anchoring of system-level (vs.  element-level) simulations, MDA stated that the exclusion from the test  objectives was inadvertent and it will be addressed by the tests.", "BMDS Operational Test Agency objectives related to the GBI engagement  were not met, although the test agency officials indicate the majority of  their non-intercept sensor related objectives for FTG-04 were met in the  FTX-03 test. However, BMDS Operational Test Agency officials state that  some of their intercept objectives may be addressed through a  combination of previous intercept test, FTG-03a, and recently conducted  FTG-05. Finally, several warfighter objectives for FTG-04, related to  tactics, techniques, and procedures, will be met through the ground tests  instead because, according to the warfighter representative at the BMDS  Operational Test Agency, flight tests do not offer the best opportunity to  assess this kind of objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cancellation Eliminates One of Few Opportunities to Demonstrate GMD Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["The cancellation has increased the strain on the ensuing test program.  GMD\u2019s current plans call for two intercept attempts in fiscal year 2009\u2014 FTG-05, which was conducted in December 2008, and FTG-06\u2014and one  booster verification test. This is an ambitious schedule as GMD has been  able to conduct only one intercept flight test per year\u2014FTG-02 in  September 2006, FTG-03a in September 2007 and FTG-05 in December  2008. MDA had planned to conduct five intercept tests with varying  stresses to assess the EKV capability between February 2007 and  December 2008. Flight test failures and test plan revisions caused MDA to  only carry out two intercept tests in that period\u2014FTG-03a and FTG-05\u2014  both of which resulted in an intercept.", "In addition, the number of future flight tests planned has been reduced.  MDA has not funded or scheduled an intercept replacement for FTG-04. In  January 2008 MDA decided to merge two intercept tests\u2014FTG-06 and  FTG-07\u2014into one single intercept attempt. This merger removes another  opportunity to gather end-game EKV performance data needed to assess  capability. In January 2008 MDA also decided to accelerate a two-stage  verification non-intercept test required to assess the European component.", "The cancellation of FTG-04 removed one chance to obtain end-game  performance data needed to develop GMD models and to assess the  capability of the CE-I EKV. The repetition of intercept-related objectives is  important to build confidence in the intercept capability. These models are  the primary way to fully assess the overall system performance, since  flight tests are limited by their cost, complexity and range safety concerns.  MDA planned to test the CE-I EKV against a dynamic target scene with  countermeasures in both FTG-04 and FTG-05. FTG-04 was canceled and an  FTG-05 target anomaly affected this objective. According to MDA, no more  CE-I EKV flight tests have been approved, although it is considering  whether to conduct an intercept test using a CE-I EKV in the future. GMD  developed some mitigations to various developmental issues, but realistic  flight testing is needed to anchor the models and to determine the  effectiveness of these mitigations.", "The test cancellation and target problems have reduced the knowledge  that MDA expected to use for its upcoming end-to-end performance  assessment. Performance assessments are annual system-level  assessments to test, evaluate, and characterize the operational capability  of the BMDS as of the end of the calendar year. Currently, MDA has only  completed one\u2014Performance Assessment 2007. Furthermore, acting on a  joint recommendation between MDA and the Operational Test Agency,  MDA officials canceled their 2008 performance assessment efforts in April  2008 because of developmental risks associated with modeling and  simulations. Instead, MDA is focusing on testing and models for  Performance Assessment 2009. However, the planned performance  information available for Performance Assessment 2009 will be reduced.  The FTG-04 cancellation reduced one set of data that was expected to be  available. In addition, both FTX-03 and FTG-05 will be used to anchor data  for Performance Assessment 2009, but target anomalies in each test  precluded the completion of all planned test objectives. Neither target  presented the complexity needed for advanced algorithm development.", "Manufacturing and emplacement continue unabated by reductions and  delays in tests. Twenty-four CE-I GBIs have been fielded and the new CE-II  GBIs are now being fielded without important knowledge about the  systems capabilities expected to be gained through tests. The first CE-II  GBI emplacement occurred prior to any flight testing of this configuration.  The first flight test is FTG-06 currently scheduled to occur no earlier than  the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. According to MDA, these CE-II GBIs  will not be declared operational until after the successful completion of  FTG-06. FTG-04 was also identified as a key source of data supporting a  number of capabilities declarations.

The GMD program has reduced its  plans to assess operational performance of the fielded configuration  between February 2007 and December 2008 from five to two intercept  tests, leaving gaps in knowledge about the repeatability of the  performance of fielded assets. In addition, the opportunity to obtain  additional intercept data vital to the anchoring of models and simulations  has been lost, unless the FTG-X flight test is conducted, adding to an  existing concern expressed by DOT&E.
