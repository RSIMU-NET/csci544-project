To protect Medicare from improper DMEPOS payments, CMS relies on three Program Safeguard Contractors (PSC), and four contractors that process Medicare claims, to conduct critical program integrity activities. GAO was requested to examine CMS's and CMS's contractors' activities to prevent and minimize improper payments for DMEPOS, and describe CMS's oversight of PSC program integrity activities. To do this, GAO analyzed DMEPOS claims data by supplier and item to identify atypical, or large, increases in billing; reviewed CMS documents; and conducted interviews with CMS and contractor officials. GAO focused its work on contractors' automated prepayment controls and described related claims analysis functions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To prevent and minimize improper DMEPOS payments, CMS's contractors conduct program integrity activities, which include performing medical reviews of certain claims before they are paid to determine whether the items meet criteria for Medicare coverage. As part of their efforts, CMS's contractors responsible for medical review use automated prepayment controls to deny claims that should not be paid or identify claims that should be reviewed. However, GAO found three shortfalls in these automated prepayment controls that make the Medicare program vulnerable to improper payments. (1) Contractors responsible for medical review did not have automated prepayment controls in place to identify questionable claims that are part of an atypically rapid increase in billing. (2) In some instances, these contractors did not have automated prepayment controls in place to identify claims for items unlikely to be prescribed in the course of routine quality medical care. CMS has recently begun an initiative to add controls of this kind for some DMEPOS items. (3) CMS does not require these contractors to share information on the most effective automated prepayment controls of the other contractors or consider adopting them. For example, Medicare might have saved almost $71 million in less than 2 years if one effective automated prepayment control designed to prevent Medicare from paying for more than one home-use hospital bed per month for a beneficiary, which was used by one of these contractors, had been used by the others. CMS oversees the PSCs' program integrity activities by providing written manuals and contracts to guide their work. As part of its oversight, CMS is implementing an annual contractor performance evaluation process, based on three evaluation tools, to assess each PSC's performance. CMS officials said that the agency will use the results of these evaluations to determine two things: whether to renew a PSC's contract, and whether a PSC may earn award fees--a monetary reward for good performance--in addition to the regular payments it receives under its contract."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the most recent estimate from the Centers for Medicare &  According to the most recent estimate from the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), from April 1, 2005, through March 31, 2006,  Medicaid Services (CMS), from April 1, 2005, through March 31, 2006,  Medicare made about $700 million in improper payments for durable  Medicare made about $700 million in improper payments for durable  medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS).

At  the beginning of our review, three DMERCs and a PSC performed these  functions and after March 1, 2006, three PSCs performed them. We  included automated prepayment controls because they are generally the  contractors\u2019 first line of defense for avoiding payment of improper claims,  and we included benefit integrity activities because they allow contractors  to enlist federal law enforcement agencies to act against suppliers who  have defrauded Medicare. We did not evaluate other aspects of medical  review, which can include analysis or examination of claims after  payment, but we discuss these functions in relation to automated  prepayment controls and benefit integrity activities. To review the  adequacy of automated prepayment controls, we analyzed national  Medicare DMEPOS claims data on atypical billing trends\u2014particularly  large increases in billing\u2014by supplier and by item for the first quarter of  2003 through the first quarter of 2005.

Medical review edits specifically allow a PSC to  check that an item on a claim appears medically necessary for the  beneficiary under Medicare\u2019s coverage criteria.

For example, a medical review edit could be  established to automatically deny any claim submitted for specific items  for a beneficiary if it had been determined that the beneficiary\u2019s Medicare  number was used repeatedly on claims from different suppliers for  DMEPOS items that the beneficiary did not need. Alternatively, medical  review edits can flag claims for manual medical review before payment,  which requires that a PSC reviewer examine data on the claim, along with  any related supporting documentation.

First, DMERCs and the Region A PSC generally did  not have medical review edits in place to identify claims associated with  atypical billing patterns. Such billing patterns involve rapid or dramatic  increases in the billed amounts of claims. Atypical billing patterns can  involve legitimate claims, when, for example, CMS expands the coverage  rules for an item or service. However, atypical billing patterns have often  been associated with improper claims and payments. Atypical billing  patterns can appear with claims (1) submitted by a particular supplier,   (2) covering a particular DMEPOS item, (3) based on referrals from the  same prescribing physician, (4) submitted on behalf of a particular  beneficiary, or (5) associated with atypical billing that is clustered in a  particular geographic area. The DMERC and PSC officials we interviewed  told us that they did not use medical review edits that would routinely flag  claims that had reached predesignated thresholds\u2014such as ones that  would signal an unusually large increase in payment to a supplier. One  contractor indicated that, depending on the threshold set, introducing  these types of edits could allow too many claims to be flagged for medical  review.", "In the absence of threshold edits to avoid paying improper claims  associated with atypical billing patterns, the DMERCs paid claims that  represented large increases over historical billing amounts submitted. For  example, we found that from the first quarter of 2003 through the first  quarter of 2005, 225 suppliers increased their billing to Medicare by  $500,000 and 50 percent from at least one 3-month period to the next. At  least 38 of the 225 suppliers were under criminal investigation during 2004.  In November 2004, the U.S. government won a default civil judgment of  $366 million against 16 of these suppliers. These suppliers had billed for  services not rendered and committed other offenses, and they had been  paid almost $40 million from January 2003 through September 2004. As of  December 2006, DOJ had collected about $738,000 from suppliers involved  in the case. HHS OIG investigators in Miami told us that it was not  uncommon for fraudulent suppliers to close up their businesses at the first  sign of an investigation or to quickly move their Medicare payments out of  their accounts in ways that are difficult to track. By the time law  enforcement can act against fraudulent suppliers, much of the money  gained from Medicare has disappeared and cannot be recouped.", "We found that contractors paid claims that were medically improbable  because they did not have edits to flag them. Such claims represent items  unlikely to be prescribed, or unlikely to be prescribed in the quantity  billed, for a beneficiary as part of routine quality care. In conjunction with  the SADMERC, we identified three instances where medically improbable  claims were routinely being paid by Medicare for more than a year. For  example, if a Medicare beneficiary has a foot amputated, that person  would usually need a prosthetic foot for that limb. As a result, the  beneficiary should not also need a brace for a limb that no longer exists.  From October 2002 through March 2005, Medicare paid over $2 million for  beneficiaries\u2019 braces after the program had paid for prosthetics within the  last year for the same beneficiaries\u2019 legs, feet or ankles. (See table 2 for  two other examples.) A SADMERC official told us that the contractors  could develop edits for medically improbable circumstances that could  avoid improper payments.", "In recognition of the value of edits to detect medically improbable claims,  CMS has begun a process to have its contractors implement such edits. In  January 2007, the agency plans to introduce 19 edits for DMEPOS items,  albeit not for the items described in table 2. These 19 edits will deny  claims for DMEPOS items if a medically improbable quantity of the item is  listed on the claim for a single beneficiary in one day. The agency plans to  introduce additional edits for more DMEPOS items and other services  later in 2007.", "Finally, CMS does not require its contractors to share information on their  edits with contractors in other regions or adopt edits that have been  effective in other contractors\u2019 regions. CMS requires each of its  contractors to develop and maintain its own edits. Contractors are free to  adopt or eliminate edits at their discretion based on such factors as the  effectiveness of an edit in reducing improper payments, the added cost of  implementing and maintaining an edit, and the presence or absence of  other, more costly, improper payments. CMS officials we spoke with told  us that CMS expects contractors to add edits at their own discretion,  based on their resources. CMS maintains a database through which  contractors provide information to the agency on the effectiveness of their  edits. At present, contractors do not have access to other contractors\u2019  information in the database.", "Our analysis found that if contractors were to adopt edits that have been  effective in other contractors\u2019 regions, they could likely reduce their  improper payments. For example, in 2005, the DMERC in Region C had an  edit in place to restrict payment for the same or similar types of home-use  hospital beds to one item per month per beneficiary, by automatically  denying any additional claims submitted for these items. Our analysis  identified a potential savings within Region C of $50.7 million from  January 1, 2003, through June 30, 2005. Based on the claims submitted  over this time period in the other three regions, we found that this edit  could have generated an additional savings of up to $70.6 million if it had  been implemented in the other three regions. Overall, our analysis of a  sample of seven edits\u2014selected from a list of automated edits that was  provided in response to our request and included edits estimated to be the  most effective by the contractors that developed them\u2014found that each  contractor had edits that could have denied up to an additional   $74.1 million in claims from January 2003 through June 2005, had all seven  edits been used by each contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PSC Case Referrals to Law Enforcement Are a Key Aspect of Benefit Integrity Activities", "paragraphs": ["Under their benefit integrity responsibilities, PSCs are expected to identify  and investigate cases of suspected fraud within their regions and refer  these cases to law enforcement for further investigation and prosecution.

Law enforcement officials we interviewed did  not cite a single cause for the delays in contractor referrals.

Currently, the PSCs and DME MACs are not required to exchange  information about their successful automated prepayment controls that  could be effective in other regions. While PSCs have the flexibility to  implement prepayment controls that they consider to be the most effective  for their region, knowing about effective controls in other regions could  provide useful information when developing their own. CMS\u2019s recent  initiative to add automated prepayment controls that would deny certain  medically improbable claims is a positive step towards reducing improper  DMEPOS payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Administrator of CMS take two actions:    Require the PSCs to develop thresholds for unexplained increases in  billing\u2014and use them to develop automated prepayment controls as one  component of their manual medical review strategies.", "Require the DME MACs, DMERC, and PSCs to exchange information on  their automated prepayment controls, and have each of these contractors  consider whether the automated prepayment controls developed by the  others could reduce their incidence of improper payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["CMS provided comments on a draft of this report, agreed with both of our  recommendations, and stated that it has begun efforts to address them.  Specifically, CMS agreed with our recommendation to require PSCs to  develop thresholds for unexplained increases in billing and use them in  developing their automated prepayment controls. CMS responded that it  would build upon existing PSC processes for identifying billing increases  and would work to improve contractors\u2019 automated prepayment controls.  CMS also discussed a related initiative it has begun to automatically deny  or automatically suspend payment for services billed in excess of  medically probable amounts. CMS stated that this initiative will address  some of the issues that we raised in our report. We consider this initiative  to be one important aspect of preventing improper payments for DMEPOS.", "CMS also agreed with our recommendation to require the DME MACs,  DMERC, and PSCs to exchange information on their automated  prepayment controls and to have each of these contractors consider  whether the controls developed by the others could reduce their incidence  of improper payments. CMS responded that these contractors\u2019 Joint  Operating Agreements (JOA) provide a means through which information  can be shared among them, and stated that it believes the contractors are  currently coordinating their automated prepayment control processes.  CMS also said it would review the JOAs to ensure that information-sharing  requirements are clear and are being followed by the contractors. This  would be a good first step towards ensuring that information sharing  occurs and that the contractors are considering the prepayment controls  of other contractors when developing their own prepayment controls.", "CMS\u2019s comments appear in appendix III.", "We provided DOJ with a draft of this report for its review.

We  reviewed the automated prepayment controls\u2014called edits\u2014that  contractors introduce into their payment systems to deny claims or flag  them for medical review, and contractors\u2019 benefit integrity activities. We  included edits because they are generally the contractors\u2019 first line of  defense for avoiding payment of improper claims. We did not evaluate  other aspects of medical review, which can include analysis or  examination of claims after payment, but we discuss these functions in  relation to automated prepayment controls and benefit integrity activities.  We also included benefit integrity efforts\u2014such as referring potential  cases to law enforcement\u2014because these efforts allow contractors to  enlist federal law enforcement agencies to act against suppliers who have  defrauded Medicare. As part of our work, we reviewed related GAO  reports and CMS\u2019s Medicare Program Integrity Manual (PIM), which  establishes CMS\u2019s guidelines for contractors\u2019 program integrity activities.  We also conducted interviews with CMS officials responsible for  safeguarding Medicare, as well as contractor officials responsible for  program integrity activities in three of the four DMEPOS regions\u2014  Regions A, C, and D. These contractor officials included staff at the  outgoing Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carriers (DMERC) for  Regions C and D, and the incoming Program Safeguard Contractors (PSC)  for Regions A, C, and D. We interviewed staff at the incoming Durable  Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractor (DME MAC) for  Region A, which had the only DME MAC contract within our selected  regions that had been implemented at the time of our interviews. We also  interviewed contractor staff at the Statistical Analysis Durable Medical  Equipment Regional Carrier (SADMERC)\u2014a contractor which is  responsible for performing statistical analyses on national and regional  DMEPOS billing data to identify potential fraud.", "In order to specifically review edits, we analyzed national Medicare  DMEPOS claims data on atypical billing trends for suppliers and items for  the first quarter of 2003 through the first quarter of 2005 generated by  SADMERC. We performed further analyses on individual Medicare  DMEPOS claims data from the first quarter of 2003 through the second  quarter of 2005 from five states\u2014California, Florida, Illinois, New York,  and Texas. We also obtained data from the National Supplier  Clearinghouse (NSC)\u2014a contractor which is responsible for enrolling  suppliers in Medicare and revoking the billing privileges of suppliers who  do not comply with program guidelines. We used the NSC data to obtain  information on the geographic location of the suppliers\u2019 companies, such  as by zip code and state, and to inform us as to whether the Medicare  billing privileges of certain suppliers were considered by the NSC to be  active, inactive, or revoked, as of October 3, 2005. In addition, we used  other analyses performed by SADMERC on national DMEPOS claims data  to simulate how many dollars might have been saved for periods of time  from 2002 through 2005 by adding certain edits into the payment system to  identify potential improper payments. We assessed the reliability of the  data sets used for these analyses by reviewing documentation related to  each data set, and we determined that each was sufficiently reliable to  address the issues in this report.", "In order to specifically describe contractors\u2019 benefit integrity efforts, we  interviewed law enforcement officials on both the national and local levels  who are responsible for investigating and prosecuting such cases, and for  coordinating their efforts with the CMS contractors. The officials we  interviewed included those from Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG), who receive suspected  fraud cases from Medicare contractors and may opt to investigate the  cases further; the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which may opt to  assist in the investigation of Medicare fraud cases or open an independent  investigation on cases for which the HHS OIG has decided not to open an  investigation; and U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices, which are responsible for the  prosecution of Medicare fraud cases. In addition to interviewing  headquarters officials from these organizations, we also interviewed local  law enforcement officials from these agencies in Los Angeles, California;  Miami, Florida; and New York City, New York.", "To describe CMS\u2019s oversight of its PSCs\u2019 program integrity efforts, we  reviewed the PIM, and the PSCs\u2019 statements of work, which describe the  terms of the PSC contracts.
