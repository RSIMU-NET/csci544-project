However, businesses still must file an offering statement that includes an offering circular and financial statements with SEC, and SEC staff review filings for consistency with applicable rules and accounting standards. In addition, Regulation A does not exempt offerings from states\u0092 registration requirements, which are also intended to protect investors. Concerned about the decline in the number of public offerings, the JOBS Act requires SEC to amend Regulation A (or to adopt a new regulation) to raise the threshold for use of that registration exemption from $5 million to $50 million, and requires GAO to study the impact of state securities laws on Regulation A offerings. This report examines (1) trends in Regulation A filings, (2) how states register Regulation A filings, and, (3) factors affecting the number of Regulation A filings and how the number of filings may change in the future. GAO analyzed SEC data related to financial regulatory filings, reviewed published research, and interviewed academics, SEC staff, state securities regulators, and small businesses.

In particular, offerings filed since 1997 decreased from 116 in 1997 to 19 in 2011. Similarly, the number of qualified offerings dropped from 57 in 1998 to 1 in 2011. Securities attorneys GAO interviewed suggested that the decrease in filings after 1997 could be attributed to a number of factors, including the increased attractiveness of Regulation D. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 preempted state registration requirements for other categories of securities including certain Regulation D offerings, which are also exempt from SEC registration. In contrast, Regulation A offerings are generally subject to state securities laws and must go through a federal filing and review process. In recent years, businesses have used Regulation D and registered public offerings to a greater extent than Regulation A.", "States\u0092 methods for registering and reviewing securities vary. One method used by states is \u0093registration by qualification,\u0094 which is similar to registering securities with SEC, as issuers are required to submit certain documents to the responsible state securities agency for review and approval. All states conduct disclosure reviews of the Regulation A offerings, meaning that they ensure that all material information is disclosed in the offering. According to the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) officials, most states additionally conduct a merit review\u0097an analysis of the fairness of the offering to investors\u0097although some states use stricter standards in their merit reviews than others. NASAA officials have encouraged states to take steps to streamline their requirements and make them more uniform, including adopting a standard form for registering securities. NASAA plans to work with states to determine what changes in their registration methods will be needed in light of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act).", "Multiple factors appear to have influenced the use of Regulation A and views vary on whether raising the offering threshold will increase its use. The factors included the type of investors businesses sought to attract, the process of filing the offering with SEC, state securities laws, and the cost-effectiveness of Regulation A relative to other SEC exemptions. For example, identifying and addressing individual state\u0092s securities registration requirements can be both costly and time-consuming for small businesses, according to research, an organization that advocates for small businesses, and securities attorneys that GAO interviewed. Additionally, another SEC exemption is viewed by securities attorneys that GAO met with as more cost-effective for small businesses. For example, through certain Regulation D filings small businesses can raise equity capital without registering securities in individual states, as long as other requirements are met. State securities administrators, a small business advocate, and securities attorneys with whom GAO met had mixed views on whether the higher maximum offering amount ($50 million) under the JOBS Act would lead to increased use of Regulation A. For example, some thought that the higher threshold could encourage greater use of Regulation A, while others told us that many of the factors that have deterred its use in the past likely will continue to make other options more attractive."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Small businesses rely on capital to start and expand their businesses.

For example, where an offering provides that a  certain level of securities must be sold before proceeds are released to  an issuer, the state requires the issuer to place all proceeds from  investors in that state in an escrow account with a depository in that state  until the level is reached.

For example, 44 states allow businesses to use a standard form  (called the SCOR form) to register their security offering. The SCOR form  was adopted by NASAA in 1996 and is designed to simplify and reduce  the costs to businesses of registering their securities. SCOR offers a  simplified question-and-answer registration format and becomes the main  disclosure document for securities offerings at the state level. Businesses  that are exempt from federal registration under Regulation A can use the  SCOR form in those states that accept it.", "As another means of streamlining the state registration process, some  states participate in coordinated review programs\u2014also known as  regional reviews. A regional review expedites multistate registration,  thereby potentially saving issuers time and money. Regional reviews are  available in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southwestern,  Southeastern, and Western regions.

In  particular, the increased ceiling amount could encourage smaller  community banks as well as those businesses that do not want to limit  themselves to accredited investors or investors in a single state to pursue  a Regulation A filing. Officials from organizations that work to develop  capital intensive businesses agreed that in order for small businesses to  use the Regulation A exemption, the process to register in multiple states  needed to be more streamlined and entail minimal cost and greater  efficiency.

Other  stakeholders noted that the process of filing a Regulation A offering is  considered in the industry to be a \u201cmini-registration.\u201d Stakeholders also  noted that because the process of receiving and addressing comments  from SEC could entail multiple rounds that involved attorneys and  accountants, it could be costly to the small businesses involved. Two of  the Regulation A issuers with whom we met stated that SEC required  them to address comments related to their financial statements, and that  such comments required the issuers to work with their accountants to  clarify accounting-related information, which was costly. According to  SEC, its process of qualifying Regulation A offerings is designed to  protect investors. SEC staff stated that in some cases the businesses that  were seeking exemption through Regulation A did not fully address SEC\u2019s  comments and requests for clarification, which resulted in additional  comment letters as well as informal communication.", "Identifying and addressing the securities registration requirements of  individual states is both costly and time-consuming for small businesses,  according to research, an advocate for small businesses, and securities  attorneys with whom we met. For example, one academic who has  researched and written extensively about blue sky laws believes that they  impose significant costs on small businesses and impair capital  formation. According to this researcher, the costs to issuers of  addressing blue sky laws have been a significant factor in the historic  underuse of Regulation A by small businesses. An advocate for small  businesses as well as securities attorneys with whom we met agreed with  this assessment. An organization that advocates for small businesses  noted that small businesses have limited resources; thus, the legal  expenses associated with researching and complying with state securities  laws can be a significant burden. Securities attorneys who have  experience in assisting small businesses with obtaining the Regulation A  exemption noted that their legal fees were relatively high due to the need  to research individual state\u2019s blue sky laws. For example, one attorney  who works with start-up technology firms stated that his fees associated  with Regulation A were high because of the need to research state laws,  prepare offering documents for individual states, and address comments  both from SEC and some states.", "Some states\u2019 securities registration requirements deterred small  businesses from registering in those states. For example, a  representative of one of the Regulation A issuers with whom we met  stated that the issuer was deterred from registering in a specific state  because of the state\u2019s requirement for issuers to have a consistent record  of earnings for the preceding three fiscal years. He stated that because  the business was relatively new and had not yet become profitable\u2014 particularly during the recent financial crisis\u2014it could not meet this  requirement. According to the securities administrator for this state, the  state\u2019s securities laws are intended to help ensure fair, just, and equitable  offerings for investors, but other means exist to meet the state\u2019s  requirements. As another example, one issuer opted to withdraw its  application from a state that provided extensive comments on the  business\u2019s offering. According to an official from this state\u2019s securities  administrator, small businesses withdraw from the process of registering  with the state, likely to avoid having to address the state\u2019s comments.", "Merit review states are viewed by some stakeholders as presenting  greater challenges for small businesses that want to register Regulation A  securities. As previously discussed, states assess the fairness of  offerings in merit reviews and require businesses to address their  comments before securities can be registered. For example, we met with  securities attorneys who had experience obtaining Regulation A  exemptions for small businesses. Some of the attorneys stated that they  advised their clients to avoid registering in merit states. The legal counsel  for one recent Regulation A issuer noted that after researching merit  review states and contacting the securities administrator for one of these  states, it became evident that the review processes in such states would  be time-consuming and burdensome to address. The counsel advised,  and the issuer agreed, to avoid attempting to register in any merit states.  As noted earlier, according to NASAA officials, most states perform merit  reviews. Issuers with whom we met stated that they registered in 3 to 11  states.", "Another SEC exemption\u2014Rule 506 of Regulation D\u2014historically has  been preferable to Regulation A because of its time and cost benefits and  lack of offering ceiling, according to an organization that advocates on  behalf of small businesses and securities attorneys with experience in  working with small businesses to raise equity capital. For example, one  small business advocate stated that a small business has little reason to  use Regulation A, particularly if it can use Rule 506 of Regulation D,  which preempts blue sky laws. That is, a business that uses Rule 506 of  Regulation D can raise equity capital without having to register the  security in individual states, saving the business both time and money.  Securities attorneys with whom we met agreed that Rule 506 of  Regulation D is a preferable method of raising capital for small  businesses because it is more cost-effective. As an example, one  attorney noted that technology firms have been more inclined to use Rule  506 of Regulation D over Regulation A because the legal costs were  lower, and such offerings could be made more quickly. For the technology  industry, there are risks associated with time; thus, these firms want to  obtain capital quickly. SEC staff stated that for Regulation D, businesses  are required to notify SEC of the offerings, and that SEC does not  generally provide comments on the notifications. Securities attorneys,  staff from the offices of some state securities administrators, and other  stakeholders with whom we met noted that Regulation D in general is  preferable to Regulation A because the process of filing the required  information with SEC is quicker and less burdensome.", "According to stakeholders whom we interviewed, Rule 506 of Regulation  D also has been viewed as preferable to Regulation A because it did not  have a maximum offer ceiling. Staff from some of the state securities  administrator\u2019s offices with whom we met stated that use of Regulation  A\u2019s had been low because the maximum offering amount was too small,  and Regulation A was not as cost-effective as other financing  mechanisms. Some securities attorneys with whom we met similarly  described the Regulation A ceiling as too low, and stated that Rule 506 of  Regulation D was very attractive in comparison. Securities attorneys also  noted that the legal costs associated with Regulation A offerings were  greater than those associated with Regulation D offerings. In addition, we  previously reported that one of the reasons given for the limited use of  Regulation A was that it was rare for an issuer to attract an underwriter for  an offering under $5 million.securities attorneys with whom we met agreed that offerings of $5 million  or less were viewed unfavorably by underwriters because they were too  small in size to be profitable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Views on Future Growth of Regulation A Filings Were Mixed", "paragraphs": ["The number of small business that seek exemption through Regulation A  may increase as a result of the JOBS Act\u2019s requirement for SEC to  increase the maximum offering amount to $50 million, according to staff  from some state securities administrators\u2019 offices, a small business  advocate, and securities attorneys whom we interviewed. A small  business advocate with whom we met stated the higher ceiling increase  could attract those businesses for which the $5 million ceiling was too  low. Moreover, this advocate noted that some small businesses may want  to enter the securities market but are not yet prepared to register an  offering with SEC; thus, Regulation A would be a good way for them to  enter the market. The higher ceiling also could increase underwriters\u2019  interest in Regulation A, according to some stakeholders we interviewed.  While investment banks are not interested in $5 million offerings, they are  more likely to be interested in offerings that are closer to $50 million,  according to some stakeholders.", "Under the JOBS Act, future Regulation A offerings generally remain  subject to state blue sky laws, which may deter future use by small  businesses. As previously discussed, addressing and complying with  securities registration requirements of states can be costly and time- consuming, according to several stakeholders with whom we met. Recent  Regulation A issuers, a small businesses advocate, and securities  attorneys we interviewed stated that researching individual state laws and  registering with multiple states significantly increased the legal and  accounting costs associated with Regulation A offerings. As a result, even  with the increased attractiveness of the $50 million ceiling, blue sky  requirements may still dampen small business\u2019 interest in Regulation A.  However, some stakeholders also noted that with the increased ceiling, a  Regulation A offering\u2019s transaction costs (attorney fees and accounting  costs) will represent a smaller proportion of the overall offering costs.", "In addition, Rule 506 of Regulation D may continue to be preferable to  Regulation A, according to securities attorneys, staff from some of the  state securities administrator\u2019s offices, and another stakeholder whom we  interviewed. Most notably, businesses that use Rule 506 of Regulation D  do not to have to have the offering qualified by SEC or register in  individual states, and can raise unlimited amounts of capital. Furthermore,  the JOBS Act contains provisions that will allow issuers to make general  solicitations and advertise offerings made under Rule 506 exclusively to  accredited investors, which may further add to the appeal of Regulation D  offerings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SEC and NASAA for their review and  comment. Both provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.  NASAA also provided written comments, which are reprinted  in appendix I.  In its letter, NASAA concurred with our finding that multiple  factors have affected use of Regulation A, and suggested that the primary  reason for its limited use is the \u201cmini-public offering\u201d process that  businesses must complete.  Stakeholders with whom we met did not  consistently cite any single factor as the primary reason for the limited  use of Regulation A.  As noted in the report, NASAA stated that it will be  working to develop model state registration requirements for the larger  Regulation A offerings allowed under the JOBS Act, and NASAA  suggested that further changes to federal securities laws, particularly  Regulation A, should be withheld until states implement a new system to  address the JOBS Act's changes.
