Specifically, according to the department\u2019s investment  review board charters, the Executive Investment Board was to establish  key criteria for these boards to use in identifying (1) which IT projects best  support HUD\u2019s strategic goals and provide value to the department and  (2) which projects were underperforming and should be considered for  termination. However, because the Executive Investment Board has not  met or conducted any business, such criteria were not established.", "As a result, instead of making funding recommendations based on criteria  representing enterprise-wide goals for the fiscal year 2014 budget cycle,  the Customer Care Committee, for example, recommended a set of IT  projects to the Deputy Secretary for funding. According to officials from  the Office of the CIO, the recommended projects were based on  considerations such as the priorities of individual board members or  programmatic concerns. The officials from the Office of the CIO  considered this approach to be appropriate because, in their view, it helps  to ensure that the concerns and goals of each member of the Customer  Care Committee are considered during decision making. Regarding  criteria for identifying underperforming projects, the officials stated that  the department\u2019s investment boards rarely terminate IT projects because  they provide needed services that must continue until a replacement  project can be found and implemented.", "Further, HUD\u2019s active investment boards are not fully adhering to the  operating procedures outlined in their charters concerning meeting  frequency and documentation requirements. For example, according to  their charters, two of the boards\u2014the Customer Care Committee and  Investment Review Subcommittee\u2014are expected to hold monthly  meetings and document and distribute the results of the meetings to  stakeholders. However, the Customer Care Committee had documented  meeting minutes for just 3 months in fiscal year 2014, and the Investment  Review Subcommittee had not documented any of its meetings during  this time period. In addressing this matter, officials from the Office of the  CIO told us that the investment boards meet as needed to fulfill their  responsibilities.", "Moreover, HUD has not yet developed all of the policies that support its IT  management framework. Specifically, the Office of the CIO\u2019s framework  identifies 11 key policies that the office was to develop to influence and  determine actions and decisions in IT management areas such as  acquisitions, capital planning, and project planning. To date, the Office of  the CIO has developed 8 such policies, including those previously  described and policies for IT governance and enterprise architecture.  However, 3 of the planned policies\u2014for performance, privacy, and risk  management\u2014have not yet been developed, and HUD has not set a time  frame for doing so.

However, without a timeline supporting this approach or a date by which  the 3 outstanding policies will be completed, the department lacks  assurance that it will take timely action to implement the additional  policies needed to fully establish the IT management framework.", "Additionally, the department\u2019s IT management framework has not been  updated to reflect significant changes to HUD\u2019s project planning and  management practices and OMB requirements for conducting reviews of  projects. Officials from the Office of the CIO stated that the framework  had not been updated because the department\u2019s investment  management practices have evolved every year and a definitive set of  practices had not been identified.

Documenting and implementing the process is a basic step toward  achieving mature IT project selection. Elements of such a process include  key practices, such as those discussed in the IT investment management  framework and cost estimation guidance developed by GAO\u2014practices  for identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing IT proposals for funding.  Specifically, with respect to proposal evaluation, agencies should define how data (including cost estimates) are to be developed, verified, and  validated, including detailed information to explain the basis for the  cost estimate and how the estimated funding will be spent; criteria for how proposed projects are to be analyzed in terms of  benefits, cost, schedule, and project risk; and a scoring mechanism that compares proposed projects to one another  in terms of investment size (cost), project longevity (schedule),  technical difficulty, project risk, and cost-benefit analysis, in order to  help the boards analyze and prioritize projects based on their  strengths and weaknesses.", "Further, final selection decisions should be made by senior decision  makers and should be documented and supported by the evaluation  actions described above. In addition, another key practice involves  predefining a method for reselecting ongoing projects for continued  funding, including establishing predetermined criteria for analyzing  ongoing operations and maintenance projects.", "As recommended by the guidance GAO developed, HUD has established  practices for identifying new IT proposals. The Office of the CIO has  taken steps to identify new IT proposals by developing standardized  templates for proposed IT projects. Among other things, the templates  address how proposed projects will meet business needs by requiring  information about strategic and agency priority goals to be addressed by  projects and descriptions of specific business needs or requirements that  projects are intended to support.", "However, the department has not yet fully addressed key practices for  evaluating and prioritizing IT proposals. With regard to IT proposal  evaluation, the department has not documented how data supporting  proposed projects are to be developed, verified, and validated.  Specifically, the office has not established detailed requirements or  standardized guidance for how sponsors of proposed projects are to  develop key elements of proposals. For example, the office has not yet  defined how project cost estimates should be created or evaluated,  including what detailed information is required to explain the basis for the  estimate and how the estimated funding will be spent. In addition, the  office has not developed procedures for verifying and validating the data  in proposals or required project sponsors to provide supporting  documentation that the Office of the CIO could use to verify or validate  the data submitted. During fiscal years 2014 and 2015, for example, the  office did not validate whether cost information submitted was based on  any standardized cost estimation practices. In addition, in evaluating IT  proposals, the investment management division does not require  deficiencies in IT proposals to be addressed before proposals can be  recommended for funding and has not implemented procedures to track  whether deficiencies were addressed and whether scores were improved  as a result.", "Further, while the Office of the CIO has established and used criteria to  analyze proposed projects in terms of benefits, the criteria do not address  how cost, schedule, or project risk are to be analyzed. The office  established criteria for scoring proposals that are used by staff within the  office and subject matter experts to score and prioritize proposals for  selection and inclusion in the department\u2019s IT budget each year.  According to the criteria, to receive a high score in the mission benefits  category, IT proposals should identify one or more benefits of the project  that directly link to HUD\u2019s mission and clearly define a consistent method  by which benefits are measured. However, while the Office of the CIO  requires that schedule milestones for contracts be provided, it has not  established requirements for the reporting of planned schedules or criteria  for analyzing project schedules. Further, regarding risk, although  business cases are to report how projects will reduce certain department  risks, the Office of the CIO has not established criteria for evaluating  proposals based on project risk, including whether all relevant project  risks have been identified or adequate plans for mitigating risk have been  developed.", "Although the Office of the CIO developed and is using a scoring  mechanism, it does not allow the department to compare projects to one  another in terms of investment size (cost), schedule, technical difficulty,  project risk, or cost-benefit analysis in order to consider relative strengths  and weaknesses when prioritizing projects. For example, in analyzing  reported mission benefits in business case proposals, the investment  management division scores an IT proposal based on whether it has  identified mission benefits. Similarly, with regard to risk, the Office of the  CIO does not incorporate analyses of project risk into its scoring. The IT  management division scores a proposal based on whether it identifies  technical risks the department faces that the project intends to reduce  and whether there is a clear description of a strategy or plan for how such  risk may be reduced. However, proposals that went beyond that  requirement to identify specific project-related risks and plans for  mitigating them could receive the same score as proposals that did not  identify any project-related risks. Thus, proposed projects are not  compared in terms of their relative benefits, risks, or potential return on  investment. Further, scores are not lowered if proposals are incomplete;  that is, scores are based only on the data that were reported, and any  items left incomplete are not factored into the scoring. As a result, a  partially complete proposal could potentially be given a similar or an even  higher score than a proposal that included all of the requested  information.", "Moreover, the extent to which IT proposals selected by senior decision  makers are supported by key evaluation practices is unclear, and the  decisions are not consistently documented. In particular, officials from the  Office of the CIO stated that senior executives on the boards make final  decisions about which projects to fund based on qualitative factors that  are not standardized. Board members are not provided with additional  information such as analyses comparing the relative costs, time frames,  benefits, or risks of projects being considered. Further, the Office of the  CIO documents board members\u2019 agreement on a final list of projects to  be funded, but does not document the rationale used, including  explanations for why projects with lower priority scores may have been  funded, why any other exceptions to the initial funding priority were made,  or whether supporting analysis was used by the various boards to reach a  final decision, as called for by GAO\u2019s investment management  framework.", "Finally, the Office of the CIO has not yet established a predefined method  for reselecting ongoing projects for continued funding or defined criteria  for analyzing projects that are in the operations and maintenance phase.  While the office collects different data in business cases for projects in  operations and maintenance, it ranks and scores such projects along with  newly proposed projects. Projects are prioritized based upon their total  scores\u2014without considering whether projects are new or ongoing.  Consequently, a poorly performing project that had a detailed business  case proposal meeting established criteria could receive a high score and  be ranked high on the list of priorities. Moreover, because the office has  not established a reselection method that includes predetermined criteria  for analyzing ongoing projects for continued funding, decisions to reselect  projects are not consistently based on key practices such as analysis of  progress or project outcomes or assessments of the potential risk or  return of continuing to invest in a project.

Officials  from the Office of Strategic Planning and Management stated that new  guidance for cost estimation is under development and that more robust  practices will be used to create cost estimates for the fiscal year 2016  budget process. The officials attributed weaknesses in the selection  process to, among other things, efforts to minimize the burden on those requesting funding, which  result in limiting requirements for submitting detailed information to  support project proposals;  lack of an established priority for developing life-cycle cost estimates  for projects (until recently); changes in senior leadership, departmental priorities, and  approaches; lack of departmental oversight of the decision-making process by  senior executives; and reliance on qualitative, judgmental data and inadequate consideration  of key quantitative measures, such as return on investment.", "Until HUD documents a complete selection process that incorporates key  practices for identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing investments, the  department is at risk that its selection practices will lack the  standardization, transparency, and consistency needed to ensure  effective decision making. In addition, key stakeholders may not have  common understanding of the practices or qualitative factors considered  in decision making, and executives may miss opportunities to consider  the relative risks and returns and strengths and weaknesses of proposed  investments.

Effective investment oversight and evaluation involves,  among other things, documenting the process for oversight, including  predefined criteria and checkpoints for reviewing the progress ongoing  projects have made in meeting cost, schedule, risk, and benefit  expectations; comparing actual performance against estimates; and  identifying areas where future decision making can be improved.  Specifically, key practices call for predefined thresholds for project  performance designed to increase oversight of underperforming projects.  In addition, once the project has transitioned from the development phase  to the operations and maintenance phase, organizations should conduct  post-implementation reviews to compare actual investment results with  decision makers\u2019 expectations for cost, schedule, performance, and  mission improvement outcomes. The lessons learned from these reviews  can be used to modify future investment management decision making.", "Since 2011, the Office of the CIO has established elements of a process  for managing individual projects after they are selected. Specifically,  revisions made in 2014 to the office\u2019s project planning and management  framework require project managers to develop management plans that  are intended to outline, among other things, performance expectations for  projects once they are selected and initiated. The office has also  assigned specific investment oversight responsibilities to two of the  department\u2019s investment boards\u2014the Technical Review Subcommittee  and the Investment Review Subcommittee. Finally, once projects are  completed, the project planning and management framework requires the  Office of the CIO to conduct post-implementation reviews no later than 1  year after systems are implemented to evaluate results of completed  projects.", "Nonetheless, the office has not yet institutionalized all of the established  practices, and in some cases, has not established key practices. For  example, to fulfill its oversight responsibilities, the Technical Review  Subcommittee is supposed to  collect certain cost, schedule, benefit, and risk data for each IT project  at specific life-cycle checkpoints established by the project planning  and management framework; conduct reviews at each checkpoint designed to ensure that IT  projects are planned, budgeted, and scheduled in alignment with  HUD\u2019s strategic goals and approach to technology management; and provide support to other boards, such as technical and architecture  analysis, in monitoring and analyzing investment performance.", "As required, the Technical Review Subcommittee collects data on each IT  project\u2019s cost, schedule, benefits, and risk at established life-cycle  checkpoints and conducts reviews at each checkpoint. During the  reviews, the subcommittee analyzes projects\u2019 compliance with project  documentation requirements and technical and architectural standards.", "However, the subcommittee is not yet positioned to fully execute its  oversight responsibilities due to certain limitations. First, the project  planning and management artifacts and data required for these reviews  have recently been revised and the related project management practices  have not yet been institutionalized. Officials in the Office of the CIO stated  that efforts to institutionalize the new process and strengthen the  subcommittee\u2019s oversight function for all investments are under way, but  the office has not yet established expected time frames for when these  efforts will be completed. Moreover, efforts by the Office of the CIO to  improve project oversight practices may continue to be constrained by  project management deficiencies we identified in our 2013 report,  including practices designed to provide data that could be used for  investment oversight.", "Second, the subcommittee has not consistently used data collected about  projects to monitor progress against the expectations established. In  August 2014, officials from the Office of the CIO stated that the  subcommittee had begun conducting assessments for cost and schedule;  however, they could not produce the results of any of these assessments  or provide any evidence that such reviews had actually assessed  performance against expected benefits or risks. Moreover, the Office of  the CIO\u2019s documented policies and procedures requiring reviews by the  subcommittee do not establish cost-, schedule-, or performance-based  thresholds that would automatically trigger remedial action or referrals to  other investment boards. Officials from the office acknowledged that  practices for monitoring progress had not yet matured and that the  performance data currently collected and maintained at the project level  needed improvement. Moreover, because of this immaturity, current  efforts to monitor progress are limited. Further, without such thresholds,  project oversight may not be consistent or troubled projects may not  receive additional oversight by the investment boards.", "Officials from the Office of the CIO also acknowledged that the office has  not yet established and documented a well-defined process for  investment oversight and attributed weaknesses in oversight to, among  other things, limitations in its ability to develop reliable cost, schedule, and  benefit estimates to use for monitoring progress and evaluating  performance. Until HUD addresses gaps in its processes for monitoring  progress of projects and documents policies and procedures to sustain  and consistently implement oversight practices, it cannot ensure that its  management of IT will achieve desired results.", "As another investment oversight mechanism, the Investment Review  Subcommittee is responsible, under its charter, for monitoring investment  and portfolio performance and taking action to (1) terminate investments  consistently experiencing variances in cost or performance or (2) bring  them back within acceptable cost or performance limits. However, to date,  the Investment Review Subcommittee has not fulfilled these  responsibilities. Officials from the Office of the CIO acknowledged that the  subcommittee has not performed these functions and said that they are  reviewing the roles and responsibilities of the subcommittee to determine  whether changes are needed. The officials also stated that, as part of  early actions to define an oversight process, the Office of the CIO is  working to implement more mature practices and developing an  investment-level view of performance, including a strategy for identifying  performance expectations. Specifically, the officials provided plans to  develop an enterprise-wide portfolio performance management process,  which includes implementing a new portfolio management tool with  portfolio and project management functionality planned to be operational  by February 2015.", "Officials from the Office of the CIO attributed weaknesses in oversight to,  among other things, lack of a consistent, enterprise-wide way to collect  and compare actual cost, benefit, schedule, or risk to estimates. Without  progress reviews that compare investments against estimated cost,  estimated schedule time frames, and expected benefits using predefined  thresholds, HUD will not have insight into whether the projects are  meeting mission needs during their development or after they are  completed.", "Finally, the Office of the CIO has not consistently conducted post- implementation reviews to evaluate results of projects after they are  completed. Although the office\u2019s project planning and management  process calls for such reviews no later than 1 year after system  implementation, the office had not scheduled or conducted any such  reviews until recently. In August 2014, officials from the Office of the CIO  reported that the Technical Review Subcommittee had begun undertaking  post-implementation reviews of its approximately 200 operational  systems. They explained that, after conducting several initial reviews, the  subcommittee determined that the data in system documentation  available to the office were insufficient to support these reviews. As a  result, the Chief Technology Officer collected additional data needed to  support post-implementation reviews of all 200 operational systems.  According to officials from the Office of the CIO, the reviews are  scheduled to be completed by the end of November 2014.", "When explaining why post-implementation reviews had not been  conducted until recently, officials in the Office of the CIO said that, among  other reasons, relatively few IT projects had been completed.  Nonetheless, while many of HUD\u2019s recent modernization projects remain  under way and have not reached a point at which post-implementation  reviews would be appropriate, establishing effective practices to collect  and maintain the data needed to support such reviews remains important.  The Office of the CIO will not be positioned to conduct effective post- implementation reviews until it identifies the data needed for such reviews  and requires that it be collected consistently for all projects. Officials from  the Office of the CIO acknowledged that the office experienced  deficiencies in capturing and communicating lessons learned and  translating them into revised decision-making processes.

Specifically, neither the list of deactivated  systems nor the fiscal year 2014 expenditure plan provided the basis  for savings reported, links to supporting documentation for those  calculations, or clear information about when the savings were  achieved. In addition, although certain reported savings could be  traced to OMB requirements for reporting on specific governance  activities and others could be presumed to have been generated from  the investment selection process funding specific projects, it was  unclear whether other savings resulted from specific governance  decisions because HUD did not provide meeting minutes or other  documentation of governance decisions authorizing or recognizing the  savings or efficiencies.", "Regarding the lack of data validation, officials from the Office of the CIO  told us that they accept data as reported because they lack the resources  needed to validate the data submitted. With regard to the lack of  adequate supporting documentation, CIO officials acknowledged that not  all governance decisions result in savings or efficiencies and that clearly  linking cost savings and efficiencies to specific governance decisions is a  challenge. However, the Deputy CIO recognized that Office of the CIO  officials could do a better job of documenting specific decisions made by  investment review boards in meeting minutes.", "Additionally, the quality of the information reported about actions to  deactivate legacy systems was questionable for the following reasons:", "Data were not complete or accurate: HUD reported that it had  deactivated 19 systems. However, the agency\u2019s reported cost savings  associated with deactivated systems were not complete. For example,  savings for 10 of the systems were either listed as \u201cunknown,\u201d or  information about estimated or actual savings associated with  deactivated systems was missing.
