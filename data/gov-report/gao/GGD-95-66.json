In the past fiscal year, we recommended a number of ways to help IRS achieve that end.", "Sole Proprietorships. Sole proprietorships, which accounted for about 13 percent of individual taxpayers, were responsible for about $39 billion, or 40 percent, of the taxable income earned by individuals but not reported for tax purposes according to the 1988 Tax Compliance Measurement Program\u2014IRS\u2019 most recent. Yet, IRS\u2019 enforcement strategy does not provide a detailed operating plan for dealing with such noncompliance. Moreover, IRS does not expect to develop the information systems needed to identify causes of the noncompliance and better target resources until the turn of the century. In the interim, we have recommended ways for IRS to better use existing data to improve sole proprietor compliance (GAO/GGD-94-175, Aug. 2, 1994). (See p. 40.)", "Large Corporations. Annually, about two-thirds of all additional tax assessments recommended as a result of IRS audits are attributable to the nation\u2019s 1,700 largest corporations. Although audits of these large corporations consume about 20 percent of IRS\u2019 examination resources, IRS neither measures actual collections from these audits nor the compliance rates of these corporations. We found that IRS revenue agents and appeals officers face conflicting incentives, which contribute to the large gap between taxes recommended and taxes collected after appeals. We also noted opportunities for improvement through changes in the way IRS allocates resources, trains revenue agents, and controls the coordination among IRS functions to prevent recurring tax disputes. We recommended a number of steps to help IRS meet its mission of collecting the proper amount of tax at the least cost. IRS should (1) centralize control over resources devoted to large corporate audits; (2) increase revenue agents\u2019 knowledge of the specific industries they audit; (3) begin measuring and tracking collection rates as a common measure across the agency; (4) analyze recurring tax disputes and propose legislative changes for minimizing such recurrence; and (5) test ways to measure compliance (GAO/GGD-94-70, Sept. 1, 1994). (See p. 44.)", "Independent contractors. Independent contractors are commonly viewed as self-employed workers who provide services, such as legal or accounting advice. They are responsible for their own taxes, benefits, and income and job security. IRS has found that self-employed workers such as independent contractors have consistently underreported income. Information reporting, tax withholding, and worker classification rules need reform. Because of IRS\u2019 and other groups\u2019 concerns about independent contractor compliance, many of their reform proposals have included two provisions that we have generally supported in the past. First, the $50 penalty for not filing an information return reporting payments to independent contractors would increase significantly. Second, the $50 penalty would apply (instead of this new larger penalty) if the payer (employer) reported at least 97 percent, as required, of all aggregated payments to independent contractors for that year. We still favor these provisions and encourage Congress to consider other options we have suggested for improving information reporting (GAO/T-GGD-94-194, Aug. 4, 1994). (See p. 42.)", "Tax Gap. We analyzed the composition of the gross income tax gap as well as what has been done, is being done, and could be done to reduce the tax gap. We also updated information related to our past recommendations for reducing the tax gap. IRS estimates showed that of the $127 billion gross income tax gap in 1992, $94 billion was attributable to individuals and $33 billion to corporations. The largest part arose from unreported individual income\u2014$63 billion. Overall, IRS estimated that taxpayers voluntarily paid 82 percent of their income tax liabilities. IRS\u2019 goal is to reach 90 percent by 2000. One way Congress could help is to give IRS more compliance tools. Simplifying the definition of independent contractor and requiring withholding on payments made to independent contractors could help IRS improve compliance. Congress also could require information reporting on payments made to corporations, especially those operating as independent contractors. Congress could allow IRS to reinvest productivity gains from Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) projects but may want assurance before doing so that IRS will use the funds for compliance (GAO/GGD-94-123, May 11, 1994).

The dollar amount of currently not collectible (CNC) accounts increased faster than the collection of delinquent taxes between 1987 and 1992. Several factors, such as inadequate records, an antiquated and ineffective collection process, and ineffective staff allocation processes, have hindered IRS\u2019 collection efforts.", "Collection of Overdue Taxes. IRS is undermining its ability to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in overdue taxes because of shortcomings in its processes for determining which accounts are collectible and which are not. We recommended that IRS (1) establish guidelines for determining taxpayers\u2019 ability to pay to include, for example, requiring minimum payments for taxpayers with income exceeding specified levels; (2) strengthen oversight of the ability-to-pay determination process; and (3) modify criteria for reactivating cases previously classified as not collectible (GAO/GGD-94-2, Oct. 8, 1993).

We recommended several ways to modernize IRS\u2019 operations.", "Tax Systems Modernization. In 1993, the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government, House Committee on Appropriations, concluded that TSM was at risk and that its successful completion required immediate action to make key decisions and establish an essential technical management infrastructure. Thus, IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1994 appropriation included a requirement that IRS report on three key issues\u2014a business plan, a program management approach, and a systems architect\u2019s office. IRS supplied the required reports in September 1993. We concluded that IRS did not establish the essential infrastructure the Subcommittee sought. We recommended that IRS complete action on two fronts by (1) defining its business requirements in detail and (2) filling gaps in its technical and management standards (GAO/T-AIMD/GGD-94-104, Mar. 2, 1994). (See p. 53.)", "Human Resource Implications of Change. IRS is planning major organizational and operational changes to take advantage of new technology to be provided through TSM. Because those changes will have a major effect on IRS\u2019 workforce, we recommended that IRS (1) assess existing workforce knowledge, skills, and abilities; (2) identify specific staffing requirements for modernization projects that will have a significant effect on human resources; and (3) develop detailed retraining and redeployment plans to deal with gaps between staffing requirements and existing workforce knowledge, skills, and abilities (GAO/GGD-94-159, July 8, 1994). (See p. 54.)", "Electronic Filing Fraud. Electronic filing fraud is a problem whose true dimensions are unknown. Although the number of fraudulent electronic returns is relatively small, the rate of growth is high, and it is uncertain how much fraud might be going undetected. We made recommendations to improve IRS\u2019 controls over electronic filing fraud in several reports over the years. These recommendations included (1) changes to the electronic filing system that would help keep fraudulent returns from being filed, (2) better detection of fraudulent returns that have been filed, and (3) improved screening and monitoring of persons and firms authorized to transmit returns electronically to IRS (GAO/T-GGD-94-89, Feb. 10, 1994, and GAO/T-AIMD-GGD-94-183, July 19, 1994).

At the same time, it often adopts tax incentives and preferences to promote certain social policy goals. Hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue are forgone because of incentives and preferences. Forgone revenues from these tax expenditures are expected to increase faster than the economy will grow.", "Tax Expenditures. Tax expenditures, or revenues forgone through preferential provisions in the tax code\u2014for example, deductions, exemptions, and credits\u2014can be a useful part of federal policy, but these expenditures should be scrutinized more closely and more often to ensure that, when used, they are the most effective means to an end. We assessed the growth of federal revenues forgone through income tax expenditures and presented three options for reviewing and controlling their growth: (1) strengthening and extending tax expenditure controls used by congressional tax-writing committees, (2) integrating tax expenditures further into the budget process, and (3) reviewing tax expenditures jointly with related federal outlay programs (GAO/GGD/AIMD-94-122, June 3, 1994). (See p. 66.)", "Research Tax Credit. In 1981, Congress enacted the research and experimentation tax credit to encourage businesses to do research. Congress believed that increased research was necessary to enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. economy. We did three reports on the tax credit that were used in congressional deliberations about modifying the original act. In our 1994 report we estimated that the pharmaceutical industry earned $1.24 billion of research and experimentation tax credits between 1981 and 1990. The industry\u2019s credits, as a share of the credits earned by all industries, increased from 4 percent in 1981 to 12 percent in 1990. The pharmaceutical industry credits were earned primarily by large companies. The biotechnology sector of the industry, consisting primarily of smaller companies, benefited very little from the credit. The research and experimentation tax credit was difficult for IRS to administer. IRS examiners reported that they had difficulty distinguishing research for product innovation, which qualified for the credit, from research for product development, which did not qualify. Examiners who audited four large pharmaceutical companies said that the technical nature of the issues made the audits difficult. (GAO/GGD-94-139, May 13, 1994).

Over the past few years, we, IRS, and others have cited delayed, inaccurate, incomplete, and confusing responses to taxpayer letters as chronic IRS problems. Although IRS has made progress in correcting its correspondence problems by adopting quality and timeliness standards and by expanding quality reviews of outgoing mail, some problems persist. We recommended that IRS take several actions, including (1) clarifying notices, letters, and publications to better inform taxpayers of those situations that can be handled by a telephone call; (2) clarifying procedures for responding to taxpayer requests to ensure that taxpayers\u2019 questions do not go unanswered; (3) using correspondence mail-out dates instead of the date a response was initiated as a timeliness indicator and adopting goals for providing taxpayers with final responses; and (4) reassessing the purpose of interim letters and then providing the service centers with clear guidelines for accomplishing those purposes (GAO/GGD-94-118, June 1, 1994). (See p. 61.)", "One-Stop Service. We reviewed IRS\u2019 efforts to implement one-stop service to respond to taxpayer questions and complaints. IRS defines one-stop service as the resolution of issues during the taxpayer\u2019s initial contact with IRS or as a result of that contact. Both taxpayers and IRS will benefit if IRS is able to reach its one-stop service goals. We found that IRS has problems measuring the instances counted as one-stop service. To improve this measurement problem, we recommended that IRS develop better measures of one-stop service that do not include instances where taxpayers will likely need to contact IRS again about the same matter. The measures developed should be designed in such a way that they enable IRS to (1) gauge its progress toward providing one-stop service by 1998, (2) identify and correct problems that might impede IRS\u2019 progress, and (3) compare delivery of one-stop service among various IRS taxpayer services\u2014such as forms distribution, walk-in sites, and telephone inquiries (GAO/GGD-94-131, Aug. 29, 1994).

We examined IRS\u2019 financial statements for fiscal year 1993. Our audit revealed that the agency is hampered by serious, pervasive financial management problems, including the inability of antiquated systems to generate reliable financial information needed to manage IRS operations. We found, for example, over $90 billion of unrecorded taxpayer transactions that had not been posted to taxpayer accounts and at least $149 million written off because of unexplained differences between IRS\u2019 and the Treasury\u2019s records for IRS\u2019 cash accounts. We were unable to express an opinion on the reliability of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 1993 Principal Financial Statements.

Some of these determinations allowed taxpayers who reported incomes of more than $70,000 to pay nothing towards their tax debts when installment payments may have been more appropriate.", "We found accounts that may not have been collectible at the time they were classified as CNC but, at the time of our review, had collection potential that was not being realized because collection action remained suspended. Some accounts had not been reactivated because of IRS\u2019 policy of not reevaluating collection potential during the first 65 weeks after an account is classified as CNC\u2014referred to as the reactivation hold period.", "Other accounts had not been reactivated because IRS tracks only one taxpayer when monitoring a joint CNC account and had therefore not been aware of the potential of collecting from the other taxpayer.

We believe that increased collections may be achieved from delinquent tax accounts that IRS has deemed \u201ccurrently not collectible.\u201d Questionable work and faulty monitoring systems have resulted in some taxpayers, who earned more than $70,000, paying nothing toward their tax debts. IRS\u2019 uneven staffing and antiquated collection process also have a negative impact. With staffing imbalances, the extent of collection action may vary depending on where a taxpayer lives. Thus, the amount of revenues collected per staff year varies considerably among IRS districts. More fundamental changes are needed in the collection process, with more emphasis on earlier telephone contact, tailoring actions to the taxpayer\u2019s situation, and evaluating collection staff performance.", "We found that the 1993 tax filing season, while generally successful, was clouded by a few problems. About 2 million fewer returns were filed in 1993 than 1992. The main reason fewer returns were filed appeared to be because of revised 1992 withholding tables, which resulted in more taxpayers owing taxes at the end of the year. Also, electronic filing fraud grew in 1993. In the first 8 months of 1993, IRS identified 100 percent more fraudulent electronically-filed tax returns than in 1992. One reason may be IRS\u2019 improved detection; however, no one knows how much fraud is going undetected. Also, taxpayers continued to have problems telephoning IRS.

For example, its recent decision to streamline the processing of offers involving tax debts of less than $10,000 should help reduce administrative costs. At the same time, however, IRS needs to be cautious about over reliance on in-house information sources to substantiate taxpayers\u2019 asset claims. In addition, IRS is required by law to obtain a legal opinion on all offers with tax liabilities of $500 or more\u2014a process that increases administrative costs. IRS has proposed raising the review threshold to $50,000. Because the legal complexity of offers is not always directly related to the amount of the tax liability, we believe a better option would be to give IRS discretionary authority to decide when offers need legal review. IRS also relies on time-consuming, manual methods to monitor accepted offers to ensure that taxpayers comply with the conditions of the offer. Automating the monitoring process could improve its efficiency.", "Although we had no data to indicate that IRS\u2019 increased compromising of tax debts might adversely affect voluntary compliance, we believe IRS needs to be mindful of the effect that settling for less than the full tax liability might have on taxpayers who pay their taxes in full.
