The Board currently oversees a staff of almost 3,200 and a  worldwide network of leased communication satellite services and 38  owned or leased transmission stations. The Board oversees the broadcast  of almost 2,000 hours of original (not rebroadcasts) broadcast material  each week. The Board estimates that the Voice of America\u2019s broadcasts  alone reach a worldwide listening audience of 91 million people each week.  Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasts reach an estimated 16 million  listeners each week. Radio Free Asia and Radio/TV Marti have difficulty  obtaining reliable audience estimates due to the closed nature of target  broadcast countries. These audiences are reached through a variety of  means, including direct radio and television broadcasts from U.S.-owned or  -leased transmitters, local rebroadcasters (known as affiliates) who carry  U.S. international broadcasting content on their stations, and the Internet.", "The U.S. international broadcasting budget for fiscal year 2000 is about  $420 million. The Board, the Voice of America, Radio/TV Marti, and  Worldnet are federal entities and receive funding directly from Congress.  Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia operate as  independent, nonprofit corporations and are funded by grants from the  Board.", "The Board\u2019s current organizational structure is illustrated in figure 1. While  this figure shows a reporting relationship from the Voice of America,  Worldnet, and Radio/TV Marti to the Director of the International  Broadcasting Bureau, these broadcast entities have a direct reporting  relationship with the Board regarding all programming issues. The Acting  Director of the International Broadcasting Bureau told us that his  organization provides consolidated technical and support services to client  broadcasters; however, programming decisions are handled by the  respective broadcast entities and the Board.", "As noted earlier, the central focus of U.S. international broadcasting is on  reaching audiences that are underserved by their local media. According to  Freedom House\u2019s year 2000 survey of press freedom, most countries rated  as \u201cnot free\u201d are located in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia (see app. I for a  reproduction of Freedom House\u2019s current world map of press freedom).  While all five broadcast entities share the core mandate of reaching  underserved populations, a key distinction among the entities is that the  Voice of America and Worldnet broadcast to a global audience, while Radio  Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Radio/TV Marti serve as  \u201csurrogate\u201d broadcasters in their respective regions and substitute for local  media in countries where a free and open press is deemed not to exist or  has not been fully established.", "In addition to adhering to a global mission for U.S. broadcasting, each  broadcast entity has its own broadcast mission. As described in public  documents and by Board officials, the Voice of America provides accurate  and credible international, regional, and country-specific news to a global  audience, with a particular emphasis on supplying information relating to  the United States. However, in Africa where the Voice of America serves a  surrogate role, greater emphasis is given to news of local interest. The  Voice of America meets its mandate to broadcast the U.S. position on  various foreign policy matters by including the views of U.S. officials in its  regular programs and through daily editorials that are identified as  representing the views of the U.S. government. It also broadcasts a number  of public affairs programs which focus on discussions of U.S. policy by  policymakers and experts. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty focuses on  providing regional and local news to emerging democracies in Central  Europe and the former Soviet Union, and to Iran and Iraq. Radio Free Asia  and Radio/TV Marti concentrate on providing news of local interest to  audiences in Asia and Cuba, respectively, who generally do not have access  to a free and open press.

Based on the results of analysis that the Board conducted, the Board  concluded that privatization was not a feasible option due to the lack of  tangible business assets (such as transmission facilities or broadcast  frequencies) of interest to commercial buyers. The Foreign Relations  Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 (sec. 503 of App. G of P.

Prior to this consolidation, Radio Free Europe/Radio  Liberty controlled a network of six transmission stations located in  Germany, Portugal, and Spain. The two stations in Portugal were closed  as a result of the consolidation. International Broadcasting Bureau  officials estimate that the consolidation of engineering and technical  operations initially resulted in more than $32 million in annual recurring  savings and that current annual savings have grown to more than $50  million.", "A digital sound recording and editing platform was installed in  connection with the move to Prague. This technology, under appropriate  circumstances, allows one individual to produce a radio broadcast that  previously would have required the services of an announcer, a  producer, and a sound technician using the analog recording and editing  technology that had been used in Munich.

We raised a similar issue in our 1996  report reviewing potential budget reduction options.", "Board officials explained that a comprehensive language service review  was not completed until January 2000 because the Board lacked adequate  audience research on the number and type of listeners for such a review.  Starting in 1997, the Board increased the budget devoted to audience  research and in 1999 tasked the International Broadcasting Bureau\u2019s Office  of Strategic Planning with developing a comprehensive set of program and  performance data to be used as the basis for the comprehensive review of  language services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Evaluation Process Used to Make Resource Allocation Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Board members assigned priority and impact (audience) ratings to each  language service as a basis for reallocating resources.

For the  impact ratings, the Board focused on audience size and composition as key  performance measures. The Board also evaluated other data, such as the  language service\u2019s program quality, operating budget, broadcast hours,  signal strength, and affiliate stations, to identify approaches for increasing  listening rates in selected countries. Audience data were based on research  conducted by the International Broadcasting Bureau\u2019s Office of Audience  Research and the InterMedia Survey Institute, which provided data on both  audience size and elite listening rates.

The Board intends to use this information to  strategically reallocate approximately $4.5 million in language service  funds from emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to several  African countries and selected countries in other regions. The review  resulted in 21 language service reduction recommendations, 15  recommended service enhancements, and a call for the further review of  seven low-performing and five duplicate language services.", "Language services rated as higher priority were concentrated in countries  with a large potential listening audience; low press, political, and economic  freedom; and high strategic interest to the United States. Higher and lower  impact scores were determined on the basis of percentage weekly listening  rates for both mass and elite audiences.

Nonetheless, the Board said in a written evaluation of  this year\u2019s language service review that it is essential that the Board revisit  the respective roles of the broadcasting services in light of evolving foreign  policy and geopolitical and budget realities in the new century.

Voice of  America resources overlap with those deployed by Radio Free  Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia in their respective regions. For  example, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has a combined total of about  700 bureau staff and freelance journalists covering its broadcast area. The  Voice of America has a combined staff of about 150 in the same region. In  addition to the issue of overlap, broadcasting officials noted that  news-gathering resources are not shared across broadcast entities. For  example, one Voice of America language Division Director noted that news  feeds from Voice of America overseas bureaus are not shared with Radio  Free Asia and that Radio Free Asia news feeds are not shared with the  Voice of America. The Division Director said \u201cThey do their work, and we  do ours.\u201d A Radio/TV Marti employee noted that neither the Voice of  America nor Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty share relevant news items of  interest to Radio/TV Marti listeners. As an example, news from Russia is  not directly available to the station, because Radio/TV Marti does not have  overseas bureaus or freelance journalists.", "We reported on a similar issue in our 1996 report on budget reduction  options for the U.S. Information Agency. In our report, we noted areas  where elimination of existing overlap could yield management  improvements and cost reductions.

For example, a Radio/TV Marti official told us that a lack of  resources has prevented the station from sending journalists to domestic  locations outside of the Miami area and overseas to report on news stories  of interest to the Cuban people. A Radio Free Asia language Director noted  that her service has only $500 a month to pay for reports from freelance  journalists that cost $50 to $100 per report.

The Board\u2019s fiscal  year 2001 Results Act performance plan is deficient because of missing or  imprecise performance goals and indicators and a lack of key  implementation strategies and related resource requirements.

A key component of such a system is Results Act planning. Under the  Results Act, executive agencies are required to prepare 5-year strategic  plans that set the general direction for their efforts. Agencies then develop  annual performance plans that establish the connections between long-term strategic goals outlined in the strategic plan and the day-to-day  activities of program managers and staff. Finally, the act requires that each  agency produce an annual performance report on the extent to which it is  meeting its annual performance goals and the actions needed to achieve or  modify those goals that have not been met.

First, the performance plan lists encouraging the development  of a free and independent media as a strategic objective. This reflects one  of the objectives embodied in the 1994 Broadcasting Act that calls for the  training and technical support for independent indigenous media through  government agencies or private U.S. entities. The second strategic  objective lacking supporting performance goals and indicators relates to  the Board\u2019s need for comprehensive and up-to-date audience research data.  Again, the 1994 Broadcasting Act stipulates that U.S. international  broadcasting efforts should be based on reliable audience research data.  The Board recognizes that its performance plan has some limitations and  has formed a Results Act indicators review team to address them.", "Table 3 provides an overview of the Board\u2019s fiscal year 2001 performance  plan that was included with the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2001 budget submission  to Congress. This performance plan supports the Board\u2019s stated mission of  using U.S. international broadcasting to encourage the development and  growth of democratic values in support of the diplomatic, humanitarian,  and economic goals of the United States. The array of programs and  accurate information that U.S. international broadcasting strives to provide  foreign audiences worldwide are intended to help people understand  democratic ideals, civil governance, free market economics and trade, and  respect for the rule of law. Within this context, while a number of  performance goals and indicators are used to assess the extent to which  U.S. international broadcasting is achieving its mission, Board officials told  us that audience size is the most important performance goal and  indicator. Table 3 shows the strategic objectives and the performance  goals and indicators contained in the Board\u2019s fiscal year 2001 performance  plan.", "Of the performance goals and indicators shown in table 3, Board officials  have identified audience size as the most important performance goal and  indicator for assessing to what extent U.S. international broadcasting is  achieving its mission. Audience size provides an indicator of how many  people around the world are tuning in to information intended to help them  understand democratic ideals, civil governance, and the rule of law.  However, the Board uses only global audience size estimates by broadcast  entity to set performance goals and track performance. For example, the  fiscal year 2001 performance plan lists the Voice of America\u2019s current  listening audience at 91 million and sets a performance target of 92 million  for fiscal year 2001. A January 1999 memo provided instructions on  preparing submissions to the fiscal year 2001 performance plan; it invited  units to suggest potential program enhancements and provide a memo  describing the impact these enhancements would have on such  performance measures as audience size. The instructions also called for a  description of how the actual impact of such program enhancements would  be measured. However, this guidance did not discuss the systematic  establishment of specific audience targets by language service or the  method for monitoring such targets to provide meaningful performance  data (such as the number of language services achieving target  performance levels each year) for inclusion in the Board\u2019s annual  performance plan.", "The Board acknowledges in its performance plan that changes in estimated  global listening audiences from year to year do not necessarily indicate a  \u201cgenuine\u201d increase in listeners because better survey techniques may  simply have identified additional listeners not included in earlier estimates.  In addition, the International Broadcasting Bureau\u2019s Office of Research  reported that the Voice of America\u2019s global estimate should be taken only  as a rough indication of the number of listeners, with a potentially wide  margin of error. The report further noted that \u201cmost of Voice of America\u2019s  audience is heavily concentrated in a small number of countries; as a result,  exclusive reliance on the global estimate as a measure of effectiveness may  obscure important changes that occur from year to year at the regional or  country level.\u201d Radio Free Asia officials have pointed out that Radio Free  Asia is relatively new and has no effective means to advertise its services in  the closed target countries. Further, these officials said that it is very  difficult to obtain reliable audience size estimates. Thus, the officials  believed that audience size would not be an adequate measure of Radio  Free Asia\u2019s performance at this time.", "A second problem with this key performance indicator is that the  performance plan makes no distinction between mass versus elite (that is,  government and other influential decisionmakers) audiences and only  references mass listening audiences in its strategic objectives and  performance goals. The distinction between these two basic audiences has  major implications for the Board with regard to setting strategic objectives  and performance goals, establishing and refining broadcast strategies, and  allocating resources in the most effective manner possible. A senior Voice  of America official told us that the agency\u2019s biggest challenge is analyzing  its programming language by language and determining what matches the  needs of the various audiences the Voice of America is trying to reach. The  target audience can also change over time. For example, the Voice of  America\u2019s audience in Africa has typically been made up of an elite group of  40- to 50-year-old males in political or civil service leadership positions.", "Now, one official told us, the African language services need to attract  more of a mass audience in order to reach future leaders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Implementation Strategies and Resource Requirements Obscure the Board\u2019s Planned Actions", "paragraphs": ["According to the Results Act, agency performance plans should describe  the operational processes, skills, technology, and other resources an  agency will need to achieve its performance goals.

We found that the Board\u2019s fiscal year 2001 plan  does not discuss such strategies or resource requirements for its ongoing  initiatives. For example, the plan does not include a discussion of the  Board\u2019s Internet deployment plan. This is a concern, given the complex  issues the Board faces as it attempts to integrate the Internet with the more  traditional radio and television distribution efforts of five discrete  broadcast entities in an era of rapid political and technological changes and  shifting consumer demands and preferences.", "The lack of a discussion of the role and significance of the International  Broadcasting Bureau\u2019s deployment of digital production technology for the  Voice of America is another concern.

Actual funding has been extended over a longer period of  time, and a definitive end-point for the project remains to be established.  The Board\u2019s performance plan does not highlight the importance of this  project to the Voice of America\u2019s effectiveness, the specific strategies being  followed to ensure successful implementation, the impact budget shortfalls  will have on its completion, and the projected cost savings (in terms of  long-term staffing needs, for example) to be derived from full  implementation of the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Reviews not Standard Across Broadcast Entities", "paragraphs": ["The usefulness of annual program reviews of individual language services  is hampered by (1) a lack of consistency in how program quality scores\u2014a  key component of the program review process\u2014are developed across  broadcast entities and (2) the lack of audience size and composition  targets, which would help focus language service planning efforts. The  International Broadcasting Bureau conducts program reviews for the Voice  of America and Radio/TV Marti, while Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  and Radio Free Asia conduct their own reviews. Program reviews evaluate  a number of factors, including audience size, signal strength, affiliates  management, and program content and presentation. The latter factor is  referred to as \u201cprogram quality.\u201d Program reviews culminate with a written  report with recommendations for improving operations in one or more of  the previously listed areas.", "Board officials acknowledge that there is variability in how program  reviews are conducted across broadcast entities. Specifically, they noted  that a consistent approach to evaluating program quality remains to be  established. Program quality refers to content and presentation issues such  as program balance and objectivity, program pacing, use of musical bridges  between program segments, and the quality of the announcer\u2019s voice. One  key methodological difference that exists today is that some broadcast  entities use external experts and in-country listening panels in assessing  program quality, and others do not. For example, the International  Broadcasting Bureau relies on internal personnel to develop program  quality assessments. Voice of America language program directors  generally noted that these assessments were not that rigorous and would  benefit from input from outside experts, such as journalists and academic  specialists. In contrast, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty does utilize  external experts and in-country listening panels in its program quality  review process. Funding permitting, Board officials noted that they  eventually intend to move all program reviews toward a uniform process  and methodology that incorporates the views of external experts and in-country listening panels in assessing program quality.", "Finally, we noted that program reviews center on discussions of program  operations and a general desire to improve language service performance  without the benefit of focussing on specific performance targets such as  audience size and composition.

It has  implemented the steps necessary to reduce Radio Free Europe/Radio  Liberty\u2019s budget to below the $75 million ceiling established by Congress.  The Board established a language service review process that is designed  to realign budget resources strategically on an annual basis. Finally, the  Board has developed a strategic planning and performance management  system that consists of Results Act planning, the annual language service  review, and the program reviews of individual language services. This  system is intended to help ensure that U.S. international broadcasting  resources are used in the most effective manner possible.", "Despite the Board\u2019s overall progress and its continuing efforts to further  refine its strategic planning and performance management system, the  broadcast entities could benefit from the closer integration of international  broadcast missions and strategic objectives and more clearly defined  performance goals and indicators as called for by the Results Act. For  example, the Board\u2019s global audience goal, in particular, is less useful as a  key indicator of broadcast effectiveness than summary data on the success  of language services in achieving individual audience size and composition  targets. Further, the performance plan lacks an implementation strategy  and related resource requirements for the Board\u2019s key initiatives.", "Addressing these strategic planning issues could help ensure that resources  are managed more effectively with more clearly defined results.", "The Board\u2019s current plans for its next language services review do not  include a plan to analyze the deployment of field news-gathering resources  among the broadcast entities. Such an analysis could potentially identify  areas of unnecessary overlap, which would allow them to redirect  resources to areas needing more news coverage. A lack of adequate news  coverage ultimately diminishes the quality of U.S. broadcast efforts and  potentially affects the size and nature of the listening audience, a key  performance indicator.", "Finally, annual program reviews conducted for individual language services  do not employ a consistent approach to assessing program quality and do  not focus on specific audience size and composition targets. A standard  review approach, which incorporates both outside experts and in-country  listening panels, would increase the overall value of program quality  assessments and allow meaningful comparisons among individual language  services and among broadcast entities. Improved program quality  measures would also benefit the annual language service review process  and the Board\u2019s Results Act planning, each of which incorporate program  quality as a performance measure. Establishing specific audience targets  for each language service would enable program review teams to develop  action plans listing the specific steps and resources needed to achieve any  audience share and composition goals established at the Results Act level.  These action plans and related resource discussions could be incorporated  in both Results Act planning and the annual language service review  process which is the Board\u2019s primary vehicle for assessing the distribution  of broadcasting resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen the Board\u2019s management oversight and provide greater  assurance that international broadcasting funds are being effectively  expended, we recommend that the Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of  Governors include in the Board\u2019s performance plan a clearer indication of how its  broadcast missions, strategic objectives, performance goals, and  performance indicators relate to each other; and establish audience and  other goals, as appropriate, at the individual language service level; include implementation strategies and related resource requirements in  its performance plan; analyze overseas news-gathering networks across its broadcast entities  to determine if resources could be more effectively deployed; and institute a standardized approach to conducting program quality  assessments and require that program reviews produce a detailed action  plan that responds to specific audience size and composition targets  established at the Results Act and annual language service review level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Broadcasting Board of Governors provided written comments on a  draft of this report. The Board stated that the report is fair and accurate,  and the Board concurred with our recommendations. The Board said that  some actions currently underway will serve to partially implement the  recommendations and that it will implement additional actions in the  future. For example, the Board has launched a review of its existing  performance plan that will include drawing clearer linkages between  broadcast missions, strategic objectives, and performance goals. The  Board also intends to establish audience and other goals, as appropriate, at  the individual language service level. The Board agreed with our  recommendation that it analyze its overseas news-gathering network next  year. However, the Board said that an analysis of its overseas news-gathering resources would be more useful as a stand-alone analysis  rather than as part of the annual language service review as we  recommended. We recognize the need for such flexibility and modified our  recommendation accordingly.", "The Board expressed concern that the information we provided on U.S.  international broadcasting and the British Broadcasting Corporation was  unfair and presented a misleading picture of two very different  organizations (see app. IV). The Board noted that U.S. international  broadcasting has been charged with a far more complex mission, which  includes conveying the views of the U.S. government and functioning as a  surrogate broadcaster in areas where gaining access to target audiences is  difficult. The Board added that caution was needed when comparing total  operating costs, listening audience size, the number of language services,  and the implied cost per listener, due to the significant differences between  the two organizations. To address the Board\u2019s concerns, we modified the  introduction to appendix IV. We also adjusted U.S. budget data to remove  television production and transmission costs which are not included in the  British Broadcasting Corporation budget figure. However, we believe that  providing information on the world\u2019s top two international broadcasters is  useful and serves to illustrate both the similarities and differences in how  these two organizations conduct their business. Further, discussions with  U.S. broadcast staff and our review of internal documents indicate that the  Board considers the British Broadcasting Corporation to be a key  competitor and closely tracks its activities in selected broadcast markets  around the world.", "The comments provided by the Board are reprinted in appendix VI. The  Board also provided technical comments in attachment B, which we have  incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Marc B.

As shown in figure 4, Freedom House\u2019s most recent survey  shows that the most severely underserved audiences are concentrated in  Africa, the Middle East, and Asia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. International Broadcasting Transmission Modes and Operations", "paragraphs": ["U.S. international broadcasting operates within the context of a complex  and evolving transmission environment. Each of the key broadcast  methods the United States uses is described in the following section and in  more detail in an August 1999 International Broadcasting Bureau study.", "This transmission mode utilizes the reflective properties of  the ionosphere to carry an analog radio signal to listeners typically up to  4,200 miles away or even farther under some circumstances. In many  situations the quality of shortwave transmissions can be comparable to that  of AM/FM broadcasts. However, over long distances, where shortwave is so  valuable, transmission quality can vary considerably. Despite its  drawbacks, shortwave remains the primary transmission medium (and  sometimes the only option) for international broadcasters seeking to reach  target populations where press freedom is completely or largely restricted.  One problem with shortwave broadcasts is that countries, such as China,  Vietnam, and Cuba, attempt to block U.S. broadcast signals. To counteract  these jamming activities, international broadcasters use very powerful  transmitters, operating from multiple locations, on multiple frequencies.  This increases the costs of shortwave broadcasting relative to most other  transmission mediums but it still remains an economical medium for  reaching large areas. Shortwave broadcasting is currently carried on a  network of 22 U.S.-owned and 16 leased transmission facilities. However,  U.S.-owned transmitters in the Philippines and Thailand currently cannot  be used for Radio Free Asia broadcasts because of host government  prohibitions.", "The future of shortwave radio could be significantly affected by the  development of digital shortwave, which offers several advantages over the  current analog form of shortwave transmission. Digital shortwave is  capable of producing AM quality audio, which does not degrade over long  distances. Digital shortwave receivers (which are not yet commercially  available) can be programmed to lock on to a station name as opposed to a  specific broadcasting frequency. This development could have major  implications for countries such as China and Cuba, which actively jam  current shortwave transmissions. Under a digital system, it may be possible  to scramble frequencies to frustrate jammers while not affecting listeners,  whose preset stations would be available at a touch of a button. However,  the International Broadcasting Bureau noted that it is unclear whether  these potential anti-jamming features will be available in mass-market  products.", "Transnational AM (medium-wave) broadcasts - U.S.-owned or -leased transmission facilities, AM broadcasts can reach  target audiences up to 900 miles away or even farther under some  circumstances. One advantage of AM broadcasting is the enormous  number of listeners with AM/FM receivers. As is the case with shortwave  transmissions, one drawback of medium-wave transmissions is that they  can be jammed by hostile governments.", "AM/FM Radio Affiliates -- Radio affiliates are local AM/FM or television  stations that rebroadcast U.S.-produced program content. Some affiliates  are paid to carry this content, and others are not. FM signals provide the  highest sound quality, but they are limited to a line-of-sight broadcast range  typically of about 25 to 75 miles depending on the height of the transmitting  antenna and other local conditions. The Board currently has more than  1,300 radio affiliates, with the largest concentration of affiliates in Central  Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Latin America. For example, the  Board has 516 radio affiliates in Latin America. In contrast, it has only 54  radio affiliates in Africa.", "Paid leases and licenses are another form of  local rebroadcasting. A lease is an agreement with a local station or  network for a specific allocation of airtime for a specific cost. The Board  currently has 24 AM/FM leases worldwide. Licenses are granted by a  national authority to broadcasters for the use of a dedicated AM or FM  frequency to broadcast locally using their own equipment. However, in  most cases, national regulations require that the license be issued in the  name of a local entity. According to a 1999 International Broadcasting  Bureau document on transmission strategies, the Voice of America has  traditionally placed its emphasis on building its network of AM/FM  affiliates, while other international broadcasters, such as Radio Free  Europe/Radio Liberty, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Radio  France International, have invested substantially in local leases and  licenses.", "Television via Local Affiliates - is broadcast through local cable and land-based broadcast affiliates.  According to Board officials, television has become the predominant media  choice for viewers in several key areas, including Russia and China. The  Board reports that it has almost 500 television cable/terrestrial affiliates  concentrated in the former Soviet Union and Latin America.", "Television content for U.S. international broadcasting has traditionally  been provided by the Worldnet Television and Film Service, which is the  official television broadcast arm of the U.S. government. According to the  Board, it has transferred the public diplomacy portion of Worldnet to the  State Department under the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act  of 1998. (P.L. 105-277). The Board has submitted a reprogramming request  to Congress to transfer Worldnet\u2019s remaining resources (totaling  $20.5 million in fiscal year 2000 funding) to Voice of America TV.", "Satellite Radio and Television -  This medium relies on direct satellite  transmission to relatively expensive analog or digital receivers or private  satellite dishes. While not appropriate for reaching mass audiences, this  option does offer the opportunity to reach \u201celite\u201d listeners who are the key  decisionmakers U.S. international broadcasters would like to reach in  target countries.", "Internet Webcasting and E-mail Delivery \u2013 The Internet offers the first  truly interactive medium for delivering text, audio, and video streams to  users\u2019 personal computers. The use of e-mail also provides broadcasters  with the ability to send text messages to subscriber lists with the contents  of U.S. audio broadcasts. U.S. broadcast entities have also established a  presence on the Internet, and the Voice of America, Radio Free  Europe/Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia have initiated e-mail subscriber  programs. Again, the Internet is currently not poised to deliver information  to mass audiences around the globe; however, it represents another key  delivery option for reaching elite listeners.

As a  result, the United States does not broadcast to fully democratic nations  such as Canada, the United Kingdom, or Germany. In contrast, the BBC\u2019s  mission is much broader and includes reaching listeners in markets  around the world, including media-rich countries such as the United  States.", "The organization of U.S. international broadcasting has evolved along  the lines of \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201csurrogate\u201d broadcast entities.

In contrast, the World Service is not  subject to sunset. In the case of U.S. international broadcasting, an  original sunset provision in the 1994 International Broadcasting Act  generally required the Board to cease funding Radio Free Asia after  September 30, 1998. The act was amended in 1999 to provide for explicit  sunset of funding for Radio Free Asia after September 30, 2009.  Congress has also specified conditions under which Radio Free  Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasting should be phased out in a particular  country. Radio TV/Marti is required to be terminated upon transmittal by  the President to appropriate congressional Committees of a  determination that a democratically elected government is in power in  Cuba.

We agree that U.S. international broadcasters and the BBC World  Service have different roles. However, the fact that U.S. international  broadcasters have multiple and more complex missions does not  obviate the value of examining the BBC\u2019s operations relative to U.S.  international broadcasting. The Board acknowledges the value of  tracking and evaluating the activities of competitors by maintaining an  on-line database to capture this information. The database includes  country-by-country audience data that shows how U.S. international  broadcasters are doing relative to other major international  broadcasters, with a particular focus on the BBC. The Board\u2019s database  also summarizes this information into seven regional groups to help  identify broader performance trends. For example, with regard to the  35 countries in Africa targeted by the Voice of America and the BBC,  the Board\u2019s database shows that the BBC has a higher audience share  than the Voice of America in 25 countries, the Voice of America has a  higher audience share in 8 countries, and the two organizations are tied  for listeners in two countries.  2. The number of language services shown in table 5 in appendix IV is  footnoted to indicate that 24 of the U.S. language services are duplicate  language services run by the Voice of America and surrogate  broadcasters. We revised the applicable table note to point out that  many of the Board\u2019s language services have been mandated by  Congress.  3. We revised the table to show a total funding figure of $367 million for  U.S. international broadcasting. This figure was calculated by  deducting $53 million in television production and transmission costs  from a total U.S. funding figure of $420 million for fiscal year 2000. We  made this change to reflect that the BBC funding figure does not  include television costs. 4. We agree that simply dividing the number of total listeners by total  broadcast costs does not provide meaningful comparative information  in the absence of a more detailed understanding of why costs differ  between the two organizations. Explanatory factors might include the  relative costs of reaching different target audiences, different mixes of  broadcast technology, and the relative efficiency and effectiveness of  each organization. We revised the introduction to table 5 to emphasize  that our table is designed to provide summary data on U.S. and BBC  broadcast operations.
