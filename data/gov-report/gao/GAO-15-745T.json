The four studies GAO reviewed estimated that if crude oil export restrictions were removed, U.S. crude oil prices would increase by about $2 to $8 per barrel\u2014bringing them closer to international prices. Prices for some U.S. crude oils have been lower than international prices\u2014for example, one benchmark U.S. crude oil averaged $52 per barrel from January through May 2015, while a comparable international crude oil averaged $57. In addition, one study found that, when assuming low future crude oil prices overall, removing export restrictions would have no measurable effect on U.S. crude oil prices.", "Consumer fuel prices. The four studies suggested that U.S. prices for gasoline, diesel, and other consumer fuels follow international prices. If domestic crude oil exports caused international crude oil prices to decrease, consumer fuel prices could decrease as well. Estimates of the consumer fuel price implications in the four studies GAO reviewed ranged from a decrease of 1.5 to 13 cents per gallon. In addition, one study found that, when assuming low future crude oil prices, removing export restrictions would have no measurable effect on consumer fuel prices.", "Some stakeholders cautioned that estimates of the price implications of removing export restrictions are subject to several uncertainties, such as the extent of U.S. crude oil production increases, and how readily U.S. refiners are able to absorb such increases. Some stakeholders further told GAO that there could be important regional differences in the price implications of removing export restrictions.", "The studies GAO reviewed and the stakeholders it interviewed generally suggested that removing crude oil export restrictions may also have the following implications:", "Crude oil production .

After decades of generally falling  U.S. crude oil production, technological advances in the extraction of  crude oil from shale formations have contributed to increases in U.S.  production. Crude oil production increased by about 74 percent from 2008  through 2014 to reach over 8 million barrels per day in 2014, and  production increases in 2012, 2013, and 2014 were the largest annual  increases since the beginning of U.S. commercial crude oil production in  1859, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). More  recently, however, crude oil prices have declined by 40 percent, from  about $100 per barrel in the summer of 2014, to about $60 in May 2015.

We conducted the work on which  this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

In particular, the Energy Policy and  Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) led the Department of Commerce\u2019s  Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to promulgate regulations that  require crude oil exporters to obtain a license.that BIS will issue licenses for the following crude oil exports: exports from Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet, exports to Canada for consumption or use therein, exports in connection with refining or exchange of SPR crude oil, exports of certain California crude oil up to twenty-five thousand  barrels per day, exports consistent with certain international energy supply exports consistent with findings made by the President under certain exports of foreign origin crude oil that has not been commingled with  crude oil of U.S. origin.", "Other than for these exceptions, BIS considers export license applications  for exchanges involving crude oil on a case-by-case basis, and BIS can  approve them if it determines that the proposed export is consistent with  the national interest and purposes of EPCA. In addition to BIS\u2019s export  controls, other statutes control the export of domestically produced crude  oil, depending on where it was produced and how it is transported. In  these cases, BIS can approve exports only if the President makes the  necessary findings under applicable laws. Some of the authorized  exceptions, outlined above, are the result of such presidential findings.", "As we previously found, recent increases in U.S. crude oil production  have lowered the cost of some domestic crude oils. For example, prices  for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil\u2014a domestic crude oil used  as a benchmark for pricing\u2014were historically about the same price as  Brent, an international benchmark crude oil from the North Sea between   However, from 2011 through  Great Britain and the European continent.2014, the price of WTI averaged $12 per barrel lower than Brent (see fig.  1). In 2014, prices for these benchmark crude oils narrowed as global oil  prices declined, and WTI averaged $52 from January through May 2015,  while Brent averaged $57. The development of U.S. crude oil production  has created some challenges for crude oil transportation infrastructure  because some production has been in areas with limited linkages to  refining centers. According to EIA, these infrastructure constraints have  contributed to discounted prices for some domestic crude oils.", "Much of the crude oil currently produced in the United States has  characteristics that differ from historic domestic production. Crude oil is  generally classified according to two parameters: density and sulfur  content. Less dense crude oils are known as \u201clight,\u201d and denser crude oils  are known as \u201cheavy.\u201d Crude oils with relatively low sulfur content are  known as \u201csweet,\u201d and crude oils with higher sulfur content are known as  \u201csour.\u201d As shown in figure 2, according to EIA, most domestic crude oil  produced over the last 5 years has tended to be light oil. Specifically,  according to EIA estimates, about all of the 1.8 million barrels per day  increase in production from 2011 to 2013 consisted of lighter sweet crude  oils.", "Light crude oil differs from the crude oil that many U.S. refineries are  designed to process. Refineries are configured to produce transportation  fuels and other products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene)  from specific types of crude oil. Refineries use a distillation process that  separates crude oil into different fractions, or interim products, based on  their boiling points, which can then be further processed into final  products. Many refineries in the United States are configured to refine  heavier crude oils and have therefore been able to take advantage of  historically lower prices of heavier crude oils. For example, in 2013, the  average density of crude oil used at domestic refineries was 30.8, while  nearly all of the increase in production in recent years has been lighter  crude oil with a density of 35 or above.", "According to EIA, additional production of light crude oil over the past  several years has been absorbed into the market through several  mechanisms, but the capacity of these mechanisms to absorb further  increases in light crude oil production may be limited in the future for the  following reasons:", "Reduced imports of similar grade crude oils: According to EIA,  additional production of light oil in the past several years has primarily  been absorbed by reducing imports of similar grade crude oils. Light  crude oil imports fell from 1.7 million barrels per day in 2011 to 1  million barrels per day in 2013. As a result, there may be dwindling  amounts of light crude oil imports that can be reduced in the future,  according to EIA.  Increased crude oil exports: Crude oil exports have increased  recently, from less than thirty thousand barrels per day in 2008 to 396  thousand barrels per day in June 2014. Continued increases in crude  oil exports will depend, in part, on the extent of any relaxation of  current export restrictions, according to EIA.  Increased use of light crude oils at domestic refineries: Domestic  refineries have increased the average gravity of crude oils that they  refine. The average American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity of  crude oil used in U.S. refineries increased from 30.2 degrees in 2008  to 30.8 degrees in 2013, according to EIA. Continued shifts to use  additional lighter crude oils at domestic refineries can be enabled by  investments to relieve constraints associated with refining lighter  crude oils at refineries that were optimized to refine heavier crude oils,  according to EIA.  Increased use of domestic refineries: In recent years, domestic  refineries have been run more intensively, allowing the use of more  domestic crude oils. Utilization\u2014a measure of how intensively  refineries are used that is calculated by dividing total crude oil and  other inputs used at refineries by the amount refineries can process  under usual operating conditions\u2014increased from 86 percent in 2011  to 88 percent in 2013.

As  discussed earlier, increasing domestic crude oil production has resulted in  lower prices of some domestic crude oils compared with international  benchmark crude oils. Three of the studies we reviewed also concluded  that, absent changes in crude oil export restrictions, the expected growth  in crude oil production may not be fully absorbed by domestic refineries or  through exports (where allowed), contributing to even wider differences in  prices between some domestic and international crude oils.

First, it would depend on the extent to which  domestic versus international crude oil prices determine the domestic  price of consumer fuels. A 2014 research study examining the  relationship between domestic crude oil and gasoline prices concluded  that low domestic crude oil prices in the Midwest during 2011 did not  result in lower gasoline prices in that region. This research supports the  assumption made in the four studies we reviewed that to some extent  higher prices of some domestic crude oils as a result of removing crude  oil export restrictions would not be passed on to consumer fuel prices.

Most  stakeholders we interviewed echoed this statement. This is consistent  with what we found in a September 2012 report.we found that crude oil development may pose certain inherent  environmental and public health risks. However, the extent of the risk  is unknown, in part, because the severity of adverse effects depends  on various location- and process-specific factors, including the  location of future shale oil and gas development and the rate at which  it occurs. It also depends on geology, climate, business practices, and  regulatory and enforcement activities. The stakeholders who raised  concerns about the effect of removing the restrictions on crude oil  exports on the environment identified risks including those related to  the quality and quantity of surface and groundwater sources;  increases in greenhouse gas and other air emissions, and increases  in the risk of spills from crude oil transportation.", "The economy.
