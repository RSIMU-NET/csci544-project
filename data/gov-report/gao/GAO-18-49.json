GAO was asked to examine issues related to contingent faculty.", "This report examines (1) what is known about the makeup and utilization of the postsecondary instructional workforce; (2) the roles different types of faculty fill at selected institutions and the factors administrators consider when determining faculty makeup; (3) what is known about how economic circumstances compare across different faculty types; and (4) what contingent faculty members report as advantages and disadvantages of their work.", "GAO analyzed data from nationally representative sources and from public institutions in three states\u2014Georgia, North Dakota, and Ohio. GAO selected these states based primarily on data availability. GAO interviewed administrators from 9 postsecondary institutions in these states and one large for-profit institution. GAO selected institutions based on factors such as institution size and percent of contingent faculty. GAO also conducted 21 discussion groups with contingent faculty.", "The Department of Education did not have comments on this report.

In addition, data from three selected states show that contingent faculty teach about 45 to 54 percent of all courses at 4-year public institutions, and higher proportions at 2-year public institutions. In terms of job stability, some full-time contingent positions with annual or longer contracts may be relatively stable while part-time positions with short-term contracts may be among the least stable, though it is unknown whether faculty in these positions have other employment. In contrast, tenure-track positions are often viewed as having a high degree of job security that is somewhat unique to postsecondary education.", "Administrators GAO interviewed at selected postsecondary institutions said full-time contingent faculty generally carry heavy teaching loads, and some also take on additional responsibilities, such as conducting research or advising students. However, administrators stated that part-time contingent faculty generally focus solely on teaching. As shown in the figure below, administrators also described factors they consider in determining their institution's faculty makeup.", "GAO examined recent data from North Dakota and Ohio public institutions and found that, among faculty who primarily teach\u2014which excludes individuals such as administrators or researchers\u2014part-time and full-time contingent faculty were paid about 75 percent and 40 percent less per course, respectively, compared to full-time tenure-track faculty. This comparison includes earnings for all of their responsibilities, including teaching and any other duties. However, when estimating faculty earnings for teaching duties only, pay disparities decreased to about 60 percent and 10 percent less per course for these contingent faculty, respectively. In addition, state and national data also showed that relatively few part-time contingent faculty received work-provided health or retirement benefits.", "In discussion groups with GAO, contingent faculty cited advantages such as the flexibility to balance professional and personal responsibilities, skill development, or working with students, and described disadvantages that included uncertainty due to short-term contracts, untimely contract renewals, and pay\u2014including a lack of compensation for some of their work. Other concerns they cited included limited career advancement opportunities, not having a voice in institutional decision-making, and not having certain types of institutional support."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Contingent faculty\u2014those employed outside of the tenure track, such as  full-time non-tenure-track professors and lecturers, part-time instructors  and adjuncts, and graduate student instructors\u2014are part of the broader  contingent workforce. In 2015, we reported that contingent workers\u2014 those in temporary, contract, or other non-standard employment  arrangements\u2014earn less, are less likely to have work-provided benefits  such as retirement plans or health insurance, and are more likely to  experience job instability than standard workers.", "In terms of the postsecondary instructional workforce, as a subset of the  overall workforce, tenured or tenure-track faculty may be considered  standard workers. Tenure affords faculty academic freedom\u2014the ability  to express thoughts or ideas without repercussion\u2014and economic  security by providing certain job protections, including employment that  cannot be terminated except under limited circumstances, such as for  adequate cause, financial exigencies of an institution, or closure of an  academic program. Unlike other standard employment arrangements  that may vary in terms of job security, tenured faculty are often viewed as  having essentially permanent job security because of the job protections  tenure provides. The tenure guarantee is an employment model that is  somewhat unique to academia, though other professions, such as K-12  teachers, may have similar arrangements.", "For the purposes of this work, we refer to contingent faculty as any full- or  part-time, non-tenure-track faculty. In contrast to tenure-track faculty, and  much like contingent workers in the overall workforce, contingent faculty  generally have contract employment arrangements that expire at the end  of a set term\u2014whether it be a semester, a school year, or a multi-year  term. In addition, contingent faculty may not have the same job  protections as tenured or tenure-track faculty. The employment situations  of faculty who fall under the umbrella of \u201ccontingent\u201d also may vary  considerably. For example, while some contingent faculty may have  contracts that are renewable on a continuous basis, others may resemble  contingent workers more broadly and be in precarious employment  situations with no guarantee for future work.", "We were asked to examine issues related to contingent faculty. This  report examines (1) what is known about the makeup and utilization of the  postsecondary instructional workforce; (2) what roles different types of  faculty fill at selected institutions and what factors administrators consider  when determining their faculty makeup; (3) what is known about how  economic circumstances compare across different faculty types; and (4)  what contingent faculty members report as advantages and  disadvantages of their work.", "To address the first question, we analyzed national and state data to  determine faculty makeup and utilization. Our primary source of national  data was the Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Integrated  Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which we analyzed in 4- year intervals from 1995 to 2011 and separately for 2015. Additional  sources of national data were the Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) March  2016 Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) and survey data for 2012-13 collected by the  American Academy of Arts & Sciences (AAAS). See table 12 in appendix  I for a comprehensive list of the data sources we analyzed. We also  obtained and analyzed comprehensive faculty and course data for public  postsecondary institutions from three states\u2014Georgia, North Dakota, and  Ohio. We chose these states primarily based on the availability of these  data and also considered the state\u2019s location and the number of  institutions in the state to reflect some variation by region and size. For  the purposes of this study, we limited our analyses to instructional faculty  in order to focus on the population that is most responsible for educating  students.", "To address the second question, we interviewed administrators at  selected institutions in Georgia, North Dakota, and Ohio to obtain  information on the roles different types of faculty fill and factors  institutions consider in determining their faculty makeup. In each state, we  interviewed administrators at one 4-year public institution, one 4-year  private institution, and one 2-year public institution. We selected the  specific institutions for our interviews based on factors such as the size of  the institution, percent of contingent faculty, and whether the institution is  located in an urban, suburban, or rural area. In addition, we met with  administrators of one large online-based for-profit institution. In total, we  interviewed administrators from 10 institutions. The findings from our  discussions with administrators are not generalizable.", "To compare the economic circumstances of different types of faculty\u2014 including various earnings analyses, access to retirement and health  benefits, and satisfaction with job security and opportunities for  advancement\u2014we analyzed nationally representative data from the 2016  CPS ASEC and from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) in  science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), health, and social  sciences fields for 2013, which is conducted by the National Science  Foundation\u2019s (NSF) National Center for Science and Engineering  Statistics (NCSES). We also analyzed state data.", "To obtain contingent faculty members\u2019 views on the advantages and  disadvantages of their work, we conducted discussion groups with  different types of contingent faculty, the majority of which (19 out of 21)  took place at the same selected institutions where we interviewed  administrators. At each institution, we met with full- and part-time  contingent faculty and graduate student instructors, where applicable.  Administrators at the institutions solicited participants for these interviews  on our behalf. We also conducted two additional discussion groups with  part-time contingent faculty who work at multiple institutions. We did not  systematically review the specific policies these institutions have with  respect to contingent faculty. In addition, the views of faculty at  institutions in states with greater levels of unionization or with larger  metropolitan areas may differ from those in our study. Factors such as  larger pools of faculty labor, greater ability to commute between schools,  and collective bargaining dynamics could affect work experiences. The  findings from our discussions with faculty are not generalizable.

Postsecondary institutions vary in terms of their funding, the length and  type of programs offered, and instructional mission, among other  characteristics. Public institutions, which include state universities and  community colleges, are traditionally supported by federal, state, and  local funds, in addition to revenue from tuition and fees. Private, not-for- profit schools are owned and operated by independent or religious  organizations, and their net earnings do not benefit any shareholder or  individual. Tuition and fees as well as other revenue sources primarily  support these schools. For-profit institutions are privately owned and  earnings can benefit shareholders or individuals. Two-year institutions  often provide career-oriented programs at the certificate and associate\u2019s  degree levels. Four-year institutions tend to have a broad range of  instructional programs at the undergraduate level leading to bachelor\u2019s  degrees. Many 4-year institutions also offer master\u2019s or doctorate level  programs, and some 4-year institutions have a research focus.", "The landscape of postsecondary institutions has changed over the past  20 years, particularly with respect to for-profit institutions. The number of  public institutions remained relatively constant and the number of private  institutions declined slightly; however, the number of for-profit institutions  more than tripled between 1995 and 2011 before declining slightly to  2015 levels (see fig. 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How National Data Count Faculty", "paragraphs": ["IPEDS and CPS both provide data on postsecondary faculty.", "IPEDS data can provide information on positions filled by different types  of faculty across postsecondary education or by types of institutions (see  sidebar for how we categorize institutions using IPEDS data).

Because  IPEDS counts positions, any faculty who teach at more than one  institution are counted multiple times\u2014for each position they fill.", "CPS counts the number of actual workers in a given occupation and, in  terms of faculty, provides data on how many individuals are employed as  postsecondary teachers in colleges and universities nationwide.

In addition to  full- and part-time contingent faculty, some graduate assistants may also  teach courses. During the same period, the number of graduate teaching  assistant positions grew by 63.8 percent.", "Some of the increase in the percentage of contingent faculty positions is  due to the growth of the for-profit sector and growth among 2-year  institutions, which as a whole rely primarily on contingent faculty. For  example, the number of positions nationwide across for-profit institutions  in 2011 was almost 9 times as many as in 1995. However, the shift  towards contingent faculty positions was clear even among only 4-year  public and private institutions (see fig. 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contingent Faculty Fill about 70 Percent of Instructional Positions Nationwide, Though This Varies Greatly by Institution and Many of These Positions Have Some Job Stability", "paragraphs": ["Contingent faculty currently fill most instructional positions nationwide,  though these numbers cannot be compared to historical data. According  to 2015 IPEDS data, contingent faculty fill 69.5 percent of the 1,444,774  postsecondary instructional positions across all institutions nationwide,  including about 61.4 percent of instructional positions at 4-year  institutions, 83.5 percent at 2-year institutions, and 99.7 percent at for- profit institutions (see fig. 3). As noted previously, aggregated IPEDS  data count faculty who teach at multiple institutions multiple times;  therefore, there are likely more contingent faculty positions than there are  contingent faculty workers. Although it is unknown how many faculty hold  jobs at multiple institutions, this is likely to be more prevalent among  faculty filling part-time positions. To illustrate, according to CPS data\u2014 which counts individuals\u2014an estimated 31.7 percent (+/- 4.1) of  individuals employed as postsecondary teachers in colleges and  universities worked part-time in 2015. In contrast, according to IPEDS  data, part-time faculty held about 50.0 percent of instructional positions.", "Though the majority of instructional faculty positions across institutions  are contingent, employment stability among these positions may vary  widely. Many of these contingent positions may have some job stability,  depending on contract specifics. For example, about a quarter of  contingent positions across all institutions have full-time, annual, multi- year, or potentially pseudo-tenure contracts (see fig. 3). Some of these  positions may expire at the end of a set term or have no option for  renewal\u2014potentially requiring a new application process\u2014while others  may be relatively long-term with continuously repeating contracts. For  example, officials at one North Dakota institution we visited described  their non-tenure-track positions as \u201ctenure light\u201d because full-time faculty  receive 1-year contracts for their first 4 years and then, after a successful  promotion review, receive continuous 3-year contracts that can be  terminated only for adequate cause, such as gross professional  misconduct. In contrast to these more stable contingent positions, more  than half of the contingent positions across all institutions nationwide are  part-time and have less-than-annual contracts or lack faculty status\u2014 which we define as being among the least stable (see fig. 3). For some  of the faculty filling these positions, this employment may be their sole  source of income. Similar to contingent workers in the broader labor  force, as we reported previously, these faculty may face volatility and  uncertainty in their economic circumstances. Other faculty in these  positions may have employment or sources of income outside of  teaching. For example, some part-time instructors are employed full-time  in their fields and teach on the side as subject-matter experts or to stay  connected with their local university community.", "Examples of Part-Time Faculty Situations from Faculty Discussion Groups at  Selected Institutions  Two part-time faculty members at an institution in Ohio said they had jobs outside of  teaching and said they teach on the side because they love it, rather than relying on  it for subsistence.", "One part-time faculty member at an institution in Georgia said that she was retired,  but teaches courses to keep a foot in the education world while also enjoying free  time in retirement.", "One younger part-time faculty member at an institution in North Dakota stated that  she teaches on a semester-to-semester contract and that this was her primary  employment.", "While it is unknown how many faculty rely on their instructional positions  as their primary employment, nationally representative data from the  Current Population Survey (CPS) and Survey of Doctorate Recipients  (SDR) provide some limited information that suggests many part-time  faculty prefer working part-time. The CPS data show that an estimated  46.2 percent (+/- 6.3) of part-time faculty reported wanting to work part- time, while only 10.0 percent (+/- 5.1) reported working part-time because  they could only find a part-time job or because of seasonal or temporary  fluctuations in the availability of employment. Similarly, SDR data on  doctorate-holding instructional faculty in STEM (science, technology,  engineering, and math), health, and social sciences fields show that most  part-time contingent faculty report wanting to work part-time, though  among those who reported wanting a full-time job, most reported not  being able to find one (see table 2).", "According to IPEDS data, different types of postsecondary institutions rely  more heavily on different segments of the instructional workforce. As  shown in figure 4, many 4-year institutions employ tenure-track, full-time  contingent, and part-time contingent positions\u2014though the balance  varies. Far fewer 2-year institutions and very few for-profit institutions  have tenure-track positions. Part-time and short-term positions are  substantially more prevalent at these institutions.

For example, some full-time contingent faculty  may perform service, conduct research, advise students, serve as  department chairs, or manage student recruitment efforts for their  programs. Many other full-time contingent faculty serve as instructors or  lecturers whose sole responsibility is to teach. For example,  administrators from one institution explained that they employ  professional instructors who teach four courses per semester and have  no service or research responsibilities.

In other cases, part-time  contingent faculty teach general education courses, such as Introduction  to English Composition, which most students are required to take. In  addition, while some part-time contingent faculty may have full-time jobs  outside of academia, others may be working toward long-term careers as  tenure-track professors, according to administrators.

Administrators have the option not to renew contracts of contingent  faculty if they experience a decrease in their funding, whereas  institutions commit to retain tenure-track faculty until they retire. In  addition, administrators from several public institutions noted that, as  a result of decreased state funding, they have become more reliant on  tuition to meet their budget needs. They told us that hiring contingent  faculty to focus on teaching rather than research allows the institution  to offer more classes and serve additional students, which in turn,  generates more tuition revenue.", "Compensation costs: Administrators stated that, in general, they  cannot employ tenure-track faculty for all courses because they can  be more expensive to employ than contingent faculty. In addition to  the long-term commitment associated with tenure, other costs may  include spending to support research conducted by tenure-track  faculty (e.g., investment in specialized labs or equipment).", "Legal or grant program requirements: Some administrators said that  legal or grant program requirements affect their decisions regarding  the utilization of contingent faculty. For example, administrators from  several institutions told us that they had reduced teaching loads for  part-time faculty because the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act (PPACA) requires certain employers to provide health insurance  for employees working 30 hours or more per week.

For example, administrators from one 2-year institution noted that  enrollment generally increases when the economy is weak and  decreases when the economy is strong. These administrators also  said that their enrollment fluctuates greatly with changes in the  economy and that, in their experience, prospective students are more  likely to choose 4-year institutions rather than 2-year institutions when  the economy is strong. In addition, when offering a course,  administrators said part-time faculty may teach that course during a  trial period while administrators decide whether to offer the course  long term.", "Location and market demand: Some administrators stated that they  offer contingent faculty positions in response to market conditions. For  example, administrators from institutions located in small towns or  rural areas said they rely on local professionals to teach certain  courses on a part-time basis, in part, because of challenges finding  qualified faculty and having fewer students enrolled at remote sites.  Some administrators also said contingent faculty positions offer  certain advantages that help them recruit high quality instructors. For  example, administrators from one university noted that their institution  offers stable, full-time employment to recent graduates looking to gain  experience before applying for tenure-track positions at other  institutions.", "Specialized experience: Contingent faculty may bring professional  expertise to certain courses. For example, administrators from several  institutions stated that their programs for health professionals rely on  contingent faculty working in their field to teach clinical courses so that  students may gain experience at an established medical practice.  Administrators said that hiring practitioners from local industry as part- time instructors is an effective way to support specialized courses that  have a limited number of sections. Administrators from one institution  also noted that practitioners may have the qualifications needed to  meet accreditation requirements for certain programs and  departments (e.g., professional and technical programs).", "Balancing priorities: Administrators said that utilizing a combination of  tenure-track and contingent faculty helps their institutions fulfill both  teaching and research missions and accommodate the hiring needs of  different programs and departments. For example, administrators  from one institution noted that the additional revenue from increased  course offerings\u2014staffed by part-time contingent faculty\u2014allows them  to invest more money in research programs for tenure-track faculty.  Administrators from two institutions explained that hiring part-time  contingent faculty in a given department allows them to reallocate  resources as needed, for example, to hire full-time contingent or  tenure-track positions in another department. In addition, while  contingent faculty may help fulfill accreditation requirements for  certain programs, administrators from several institutions also stated  that their accrediting bodies require a balance of contingent and  tenure-track faculty, or alternatively, full-time and part-time contingent  faculty.

Across  4-year public institutions in all 3 states, tenure-track faculty taught close to  75 percent or more of these courses.", "We also accounted for cross-listed courses and multiple lab sections to  more accurately capture faculty workloads. Some courses in the Georgia  and North Dakota data were cross-listed in multiple departments with  different course acronyms for each department. For example, the course  \u201cIntro Robotics Research\u201d taught by a single faculty member at one  institution was listed three times under different department acronyms,  with several students enrolled under each listing. Course sections listed  multiple times due to being cross-listed would artificially inflate counts of  courses taught, as these cross-listings actually represent only one course  section. To avoid inappropriately counting them as separate courses, we  counted cross-listed courses by using their course numbers (and also  their course name in North Dakota) without the course acronyms  attached. Thus, when we aggregated counts of courses by faculty- institution pair, term, and course type, these cross-listed courses were  counted as one course and numbers of students and student credit hours  were aggregated in association with the course. Due to inconsistencies in  how lab sections were organized in the data, we aggregated labs by their  course number (within a faculty-institution pair and term). For example,  some lab sections were listed as 4-credit courses that appeared to have  the lecture and lab components combined in a single listing, while others  had a 3-credit lecture course listed and multiple sections of a 1-credit lab.  To be as consistent across states as possible and to minimize the  potential bias of inflating the percentage of courses taught and deflating  the earnings per course of one faculty type relative to another, we  combined lab sections into a single course count. To do so, we identified  the lab sections within a particular course number, instructor, institution,  and term and then flagged the first lab section for counting. Thus, similar  to the cross-listed courses, when we aggregated counts of courses by  faculty-institution pair, term, and course type, these lab sections were  counted as one course and enrollment numbers aggregated in  association with the course.", "For outlier faculty who taught especially large numbers of course  sections, we counted their courses taught at the course number level  (e.g., Biology 101) instead of the course section level (e.g., section 1 of  Biology 101). After compiling the data and producing preliminary counts  of course sections taught, some faculty in all three states emerged as  outliers\u2014teaching large numbers of course sections in a given term, in  some cases, more than 50, for example. Though the data do not provide  exact reasons for the large numbers of course sections taught, these  outliers may have a number of possible explanations that could vary by  state and institution. Among other effects, these outlier observations  could artificially inflate the percentage of courses taught and deflate the  earnings per course of one faculty type relative to another. To mitigate  these effects, we counted courses taught for these outlier faculty at the  course number level\u2014where they are clearly distinct\u2014instead of the  course section level\u2014where it is less clear why there are multiple  sections. For example, Biology 101 is clearly a different course than  Biology 201 or Chemistry 101 (regardless of section number), whereas  section A of Biology 101 could actually be combined with section B and  they are just listed separately for other reasons. We did not set a  maximum number of courses that an individual could teach (i.e.,  individual faculty could still be listed as teaching large numbers of courses  if they were associated with large counts at the course number level). We  counted course numbers for outlier faculty because their large numbers of  course sections listed suggested the possibility of a data anomaly; for all  others (non-outlier faculty), we counted course sections. We set our  outlier threshold as 15 course sections taught over the academic year  based on an examination of the range of course sections taught by faculty  in the three states\u2019 data and conversations with administrators during our  site visits. According to preliminary counts of course sections taught after  excluding atypical courses, more than 95 percent of faculty in each state  taught 15 course sections or fewer over the entire academic year. In  addition, during our site visits, the largest number of course sections  taught per term that administrators identified was 6, which could  reasonably result in 15 course sections over the year (6 in fall term, 6 in  spring term, and 3 in summer term\u2014half the amount due to the  condensed format)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Faculty Makeup and Utilization", "paragraphs": ["To analyze faculty makeup and utilization by institution, we merged  information about institutional characteristics from IPEDS onto our state  datasets.

As a first step in this  process, we aggregated counts of courses, students, and student credit  hours for each faculty-institution pair by term and type of course. As a  result, each faculty-institution pair had count variables that listed, for  example, how many courses and students they taught in fall term at the  undergraduate upper level. The Georgia and Ohio data listed courses  multiple times if multiple faculty share the instructional responsibility. To  ensure course sections were not double-counted, we counted them in  fractional terms based on how many instructors were listed; for example,  if a course section was listed twice\u2014with two faculty members having  equal responsibility for the course\u2014we counted each faculty member as  teaching half of that course. We also used this fractional count to pro-rate  or assign responsibility for students and student credit hours.
