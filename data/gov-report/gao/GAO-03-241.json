However, the implementation of the COD process is behind schedule, and its ultimate success hinges on FSA's completing critical work, including addressing serious postimplementation operational problems, and having thousands of postsecondary schools implement the common record. Further, there are important elements to managing any information technology investment that FSA has not yet completed: Determining whether expected benefits are being achieved. FSA has only some of the metrics, baseline data, and tracking processes necessary to determine whether it is achieving all expected benefits. Tracking lessons learned. FSA has relied on an ad hoc approach for gathering and disseminating lessons learned related to schools' implementation of the common record. To address this issue, FSA plans to include lessons learned as part of an update to its school testing guide. However, this does not replace the need for an ongoing mechanism to capture and disseminate lessons learned, without which schools may encounter problems that could have been avoided or mitigated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, the Department of Education has spent millions of  dollars to modernize and integrate its disparate financial aid systems in an  effort to improve the administration of its programs and provide more  information and greater service to its customers\u2014students, parents,  schools, and lenders. However, as we reported last year, the department\u2019s  efforts had achieved limited success. In January 1993, for example, the  department awarded a 5-year, $39 million contract for the development  and maintenance of the National Student Loan Data System, which was to  provide information on systems across programmatic boundaries, yet it  often lacks the most recent information from other financial aid systems.", "To address such systems problems and other long-standing management  weaknesses, in 1998, as you know, the Congress created the federal  government\u2019s first performance-based organization, currently called the  Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA). Under the performance-based  organization concept, FSA is a discrete organizational unit within the  Department of Education, led by its own Chief Operating Officer. FSA  focuses on managing the operation of the student financial assistance  programs, while the Department of Education focuses on policy-making  functions.", "FSA subsequently adopted a systems integration approach that uses  middleware and Extensible Markup Language (XML) technologies. In  November 2001, we reported that in selecting middleware, FSA adopted a  viable, industry-accepted mechanism for addressing its long-standing  systems integration problems. We also reported that FSA\u2019s first use of  middleware and XML as part of a process for delivering Direct Loan and  Pell Grant aid to students was expected in early 2002. This process, called  the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) process, was expected  to use a new system, also called COD, and be supported by a new  information technology (IT) infrastructure and various existing systems.", "In the summer of 2002, we initiated a follow-up review to our November  2001 report. Our objective was to assess FSA\u2019s progress in implementing  the COD process. In doing this work, we reviewed applicable FSA and  Accenture (the prime contractor) documentation, including FSA\u2019s  modernization blueprint, the COD business case, the COD system\u2019s  requirements, the COD and Enterprise Application Integration  implementation timelines, Accenture project status briefings, and test  guides and results. In addition, we reviewed reports by an independent  verification and validation contractor. We also interviewed applicable  officials from FSA IT and program offices and Accenture.", "We performed our work at FSA headquarters in Washington, D.C.,  between August and November 2002, in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Education\u2019s FSA manages and administers student  financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the Higher  Education Act of 1965, as amended. These postsecondary programs  include the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (often called the  Direct Loan program), the Federal Family Education Loan Program (often  called the Guaranteed Loan program), the Federal Pell Grant Program, and  campus-based programs. Annually, these programs together provide  about $50 billion in student aid to approximately 8 million students and  their families.", "During the past three decades, the Department of Education has created  many disparate information systems to support these various student  financial aid programs. In many cases, these systems\u2014run on multiple  operating platforms using different network protocols and maintained  and operated by a host of different contractors\u2014were unable to easily  exchange the timely, accurate, and useful data needed to ensure the  proper management and oversight of the various student financial aid  programs. For example, as we reported in 1997, neither the National  Student Loan Data System nor other systems were designed for efficient  access to reliable student financial aid information, since many systems  were incompatible and lacked data standards and common identifiers. In  addition, because FSA used three separate systems to originate and/or  disburse title IV funds, access to student and school data was fragmented  and unreliable. As a result, FSA found it increasingly difficult to quickly  access data to support day-to-day operational and management decisions,  and schools could not easily access data to obtain a clear picture of the  title IV student aid that had been disbursed.", "In September 1999, FSA issued its initial modernization blueprint, which  was subsequently updated in July 2000, to transform the title IV student  financial aid systems using technology. COD is one of four school service  business processes in FSA\u2019s blueprint and is intended to implement a  simplified process for the operation of the Direct Loan and Pell Grant  programs. According to FSA\u2019s modernization blueprint, the common  origination and disbursement process is composed of seven steps  involving students, the Department of Education, and schools: (1) obtain  applicant data, (2) determine eligibility, (3) determine award, (4) notify the  Department of Education of the intent to disburse, (5) obtain funds from  Education, (6) disburse funds to student, and (7) close out. A common  process to support origination and disbursement is considered critical to  FSA\u2019s goal of achieving an enterprisewide solution that provides real-time  data to students, schools, and financial partners via Web portals.", "To implement COD, FSA is using middleware and XML technologies.  Specifically, middleware is being used to integrate FSA systems that  support the COD process. Traditionally, systems integration would  require building separate point-to-point interfaces between every two  applications. Although this approach can be effective, it creates several  problems, such as (1) every connection between two applications requires  custom programming; (2) a lot of connections have to be developed when  there are multiple data sources; and (3) whenever the logic or data in one  application changes, the accompanying interface often also needs to be  altered. Middleware represents an alternative means to the traditional  approach, and it can provide a quicker and more robust solution to  systems integration. In essence, middleware separates the business  application from the technical details of interapplication communications.  Thus, middleware can simplify and reduce the number of interfaces for  multiple systems because it can handle differences in data formats and  record layouts.", "As part of the COD process, XML is being used to consolidate multiple  legacy record formats previously used by schools to submit data on the  Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs. By using an XML-based common  record, schools can transmit one file with all of the student\u2019s data instead  of submitting separate legacy records with redundant student and school  information.", "Appendix I provides a high-level depiction of the systems and technologies  supporting the COD process as of November 2002. As depicted, the COD  system can translate or convert legacy records by using middleware. In  addition, middleware has been built into several existing systems so that  they can establish connectivity and exchange data with the COD system  through a common IT infrastructure. This IT infrastructure, called the  Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) bus, is also implemented using  middleware to route data between systems in a correct format. In addition,  as part of the COD process, some schools have begun submitting Pell  Grant and Direct Loan data using the XML-based common record.", "FSA hired Accenture as its \u201cmodernization partner\u201d to help carry out its  modernization blueprint, including the implementation of the COD  process. Accenture is the prime contractor providing leadership of  critical planning activities that are essential to the success of FSA\u2019s  modernization. Regarding the COD system part of FSA\u2019s modernization,  FSA also hired an independent verification and validation contractor to  review the initial release of this system, which was completed earlier this  year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress in Implementing the COD Process, but Critical Work Remains, and Benefits and Lessons Learned Are Not Being Tracked", "paragraphs": ["FSA has made progress in implementing the new COD process.

For  example, the basic COD system was to be completed by mid-October 2002;  however, only about three-quarters of the COD basic system requirements  had been implemented as of October 23, 2002. In addition, FSA is not  tracking whether it is achieving certain benefits because it is still in the  process of defining applicable metrics to measure progress. Without such  tracking processes, FSA lacks critical information about whether it is  achieving expected benefits. Finally, FSA lacks assurance that it has  captured and disseminated important lessons learned related to schools\u2019  implementation of the common record because it believes that its current  ad hoc process is adequate.

The following are  significant elements of the COD process that have been implemented:    Deployment of the EAI bus. As a prerequisite to implementing COD, in late  October 2001, FSA deployed its middleware solution in an EAI \u201cbus\u201d\u2014an  IT infrastructure that uses middleware to access data from disparate  systems, transform the data formats as necessary, and route the data to  the appropriate requesting systems, thus enabling data exchange among disparate systems. The EAI bus provides the set of technical capabilities  necessary to integrate FSA\u2019s disparate systems.", "Initial implementation of basic COD system (release 1.x). On April 29,  2002, FSA went live with version 1.0 of the basic COD system. As of mid- November 2002, FSA had released an additional five sub-versions of the  COD system (e.g., version 1.1). The COD system replaces the Direct Loan  Origination System and the Recipient Financial Management System, and  it currently processes files for all schools participating in the Pell Grant  and Direct Loan programs. According to FSA, in the first 6 months of its  operation, the COD system processed just under 16 million transactions,  representing Pell Grant and Direct Loan awards totaling almost $10 billion  to over 5 million recipients.", "Implementation of middleware in selected systems. As of mid-November  2002, FSA had built middleware into seven systems so that these systems  can interact with the COD system through the EAI bus. These systems  include (1) the Central Processing System, which determines students\u2019  eligibility and award levels, and (2) the National Student Loan Data  System, which contains loan- and grant-level information and is used by  schools to screen student aid applicants to identify ineligible borrowers.", "Development and implementation of the common record. Using XML,  FSA developed and began implementing a common record that schools  can use to submit student financial aid data to the COD system. The  common record, designed with assistance from members of the National  Council of Higher Education Loan Programs and the Postsecondary  Electronic Standards Council, consolidates multiple legacy file formats  previously used by the Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs.", "Although FSA has made progress in implementing the COD process,  critical work remains to be completed. First, FSA is behind schedule in  implementing the basic COD system. Although FSA had planned to  complete the basic COD system by mid-October 2002, only about three- quarters of the COD basic system requirements had been implemented as  of October 23, 2002. For example, as of early November 2002, one of the  basic business functions that remains to be implemented is to enable FSA  to make automated adjustments in batches to school current funding  levels. FSA now estimates that most of the remaining functionality will be  completed by the end of September 2003. According to FSA IT and  program officials, the implementation of the basic COD functionality was  delayed to allow adequate time for testing to ensure the quality of the  system.", "Second, as of November 19, 2002, Accenture reported several operational  problems that needed to be addressed. For example, in some cases, the  COD system was incorrectly processing school batch data that contained  multiple change records for an individual student. According to COD and  contractor officials, the causes of operational problems included unclear  requirements and software design defects. An independent verification  and validation contractor also found problems with the requirements and  design aspects of release 1.0. The COD Contracting Officer\u2019s  Representative characterized these operational problems as very serious  and stated that they could impede operations and the delivery of future  COD releases. This same official noted that FSA and Accenture are  currently undertaking efforts to address these problems. For example,  FSA has established production teams composed of agency and contractor  staff to address problems in specific areas. In addition, FSA has  established a continuous improvement process to more rigorously manage  its relationship with Accenture.", "Third, fewer postsecondary schools than planned have implemented the  common record. FSA had estimated that 50 schools (out of about 5,500)  would implement the common record in fiscal year 2002. However, as of  November 26, 2002, only 22 schools had implemented and tested the  common record with FSA. FSA COD officials attributed the fewer-than- expected number of schools using the common record to schools and  vendors not being ready to implement it. FSA expects that the number of  schools using the common record will be considerably higher during the  next award year (2003\u20132004) because, by April 2003, it plans to implement  and test the common record with EDExpress, a software application FSA  distributes free of charge to about 3,000 schools for use in submitting data.  In addition, FSA expects that all schools will be using the common record  format by March 2004, in time for the 2004\u20132005 award year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FSA Is Not Completely Tracking Actual COD Benefits or Lessons Learned Related to Schools\u2019 Implementation of the Common Record", "paragraphs": ["In its COD business case, FSA outlined five expected benefits: (1) reduced  cost, (2) increased customer satisfaction, (3) increased employee  satisfaction, (4) increased financial integrity, and (5) the integration and  modernization of legacy systems. An important aspect of implementing an  IT investment cited by the Office of Management and Budget and our IT  investment management guide is evaluating the results of the investment  by determining whether such expected benefits are being achieved.  However, as illustrated in table 1, at this time FSA has only some of the  data necessary to determine whether it is achieving all expected benefits.  In particular, for the increased customer satisfaction and financial  integrity benefits, FSA (1) has not fully defined the performance metrics to  be used, (2) does not have all baseline data, and/or (3) is not fully tracking  whether the benefits are being achieved. In these cases, FSA COD officials  stated that they were in the process of developing relevant metrics, which  would be tracked to measure the project\u2019s performance against expected  benefits. However, until FSA develops these data and begins tracking  actual benefits and comparing them with expected benefits, it will lack  vital data with which to demonstrate actual investment results.", "FSA IT officials also stated that they plan to have a contractor conduct a  postimplementation review of the COD basic system in fiscal year 2003,  which is expected to look at the achievement of expected benefits. While  this is an important initiative that could provide FSA with valuable  information, it does not take the place of a continuing and systematic  process of tracking actual benefits.", "According to our IT investment management guide, another critical  activity is establishing a process for developing and capturing lessons  learned in a written product or knowledge base and disseminating them to  decision-makers. Lessons-learned mechanisms serve to communicate  acquired knowledge more effectively and to ensure that beneficial  information is factored into planning, work processes, and activities.  Lessons learned can be based on positive experiences that save money or  on negative experiences that result in undesirable outcomes.", "FSA has recognized the importance of generating lessons learned in  certain areas. For example, it has implemented a process for developing  lessons related to managing the relationship between the agency and its  prime contractor. However, FSA lacks such a process for capturing or  disseminating lessons related to school migration to the common record.  FSA COD officials stated that lessons learned pertaining to school  migration to the common record are addressed through periodic  discussions during biweekly conference calls with schools undergoing  testing with FSA and during portions of various FSA-sponsored  conferences. FSA COD officials stated that they believed this process for  capturing and disseminating lessons learned was adequate.", "However, by relying on such an ad hoc process, FSA lacks assurance that  it has captured and disseminated all key lessons learned related to  schools\u2019 implementation of the common record and could overlook  important improvements that could be made. In addition, schools that do  not attend the conferences may not receive and benefit from the lessons  identified in the initial phase of implementation. As a result, schools may  encounter problems that could have been avoided or mitigated had they  known of other schools\u2019 experiences. This could hamper FSA\u2019s ability to  facilitate the transition of schools to the new common record and thus the  agency\u2019s ability to fully implement the new COD process and achieve the  expected benefits.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, FSA stated that it plans to provide  lessons learned as part of a planned update to its school testing guide.", "While this is a positive step, it does not replace the need for mechanisms  to continuously capture and disseminate acquired knowledge as schools  implement the common record.", "Table 2 includes examples of lessons learned provided by FSA at our  request that were drawn from schools\u2019 initial implementation of the  common record for the 2002\u20132003 award year.
