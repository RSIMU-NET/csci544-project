The Clean Air Act requires all wastewater facilities that use threshold quantities of chlorine gas to prepare and implement risk management plans to prevent accidental releases and reduce the severity of any releases. In this study, GAO was asked to provide information on (1) the range of costs large wastewater treatment facilities incurred in preparing vulnerability assessments and risk management plans, and (2) the costs large wastewater treatment facilities incurred in converting from chlorine gas to alternative disinfection processes. To answer these questions, GAO conducted structured telephone interviews with a number of facilities surveyed for the 2006 report. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agreed with the report and provided several technical changes and clarifications."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Among the large wastewater facilities GAO examined, the costs reported to prepare vulnerability assessments ranged from $1,000 to $175,000, while costs to prepare risk management plans ranged from less than $1,000 to over $31,000. Whether the documents were prepared in-house or contracted to third parties such as engineering firms was a factor in cost differences. Despite higher costs, some facilities preferred to use contractors due to their expertise and independence. According to one wastewater security official, these attributes can give contractor findings and recommendations greater credibility with utility governing boards that determine spending priorities. One facility that used a contractor to complete a vulnerability assessment in 2002 did so because, at the time, vulnerability assessment software and training were not widely available. Since that time, EPA has increased funding for the development and dissemination of risk assessment software and related training. Overall, cost estimates for vulnerability assessments and risk management plans did not relate to facility size, as measured by millions of gallons of wastewater treated per day. For the large wastewater facilities GAO examined, reports of actual and projected capital costs to convert from chlorine gas to alternative disinfection methods range from about $650,000 to just over $13 million. Most facilities converted, or planned to convert, to delivered sodium hypochlorite (essentially a concentrated form of household bleach shipped in bulk to the facility). Managers of these facilities told GAO they considered other options, but chose delivered sodium hypochlorite because its capital conversion costs were lower than those associated with other alternatives, such as generating sodium hypochlorite on-site or using ultraviolet light. Overall, the primary factors associated with facilities' conversion costs included the type of alternative disinfection method chosen and the size of the facility. Other cost factors facility managers cited included (1) whether existing buildings and related infrastructure could be used in the conversion, (2) labor and building supply costs, which varied considerably among locations, (3) the cost of sodium hypochlorite relative to chlorine gas, and (4) the extent to which training, labor, and regulatory compliance costs were reduced for utilities that no longer had to rely on chlorine gas."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Wastewater facilities in the United States provide essential services to  residential, commercial, and industrial users by collecting and treating  wastewater and discharging treated effluent into receiving waters. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited sewage disposal and  water treatment as important contributors to the control of infectious  diseases, which it considers 1 of the 10 greatest achievements in public  health of the 20th century. Wastewater disinfection, a key component of  the wastewater treatment process, reduces the risk that disease will be  transmitted through wastewater effluents. Historically, chlorination has  been the most commonly used method of wastewater disinfection because  it destroys a variety of pathogens and microorganisms.", "Since the events of September 11, 2001, the security of the nation\u2019s water  infrastructure against terrorist threats has received greater attention,  including the potential for terrorist attacks at wastewater facilities that  store large amounts of chlorine gas. If released, chlorine gas may threaten  utility employees and the public near the affected facilities. The gas can be  deadly if inhaled and, at lower doses, can burn the eyes and skin and  inflame the lungs. In a 2004 report, the White House Homeland Security  Council determined that a terrorist attack on an urban chemical facility  that resulted in the rupture of a chlorine gas rail car could kill up to 17,500  individuals and hospitalize as many as 100,000.", "While federal law does not require wastewater systems to take security  measures to protect specifically against a terrorist attack, it does require  certain wastewater facilities to take security precautions that could  mitigate the consequences of such an attack. For example, the Clean Air  Act requires wastewater facilities that use threshold quantities of certain  hazardous substances, such as chlorine gas, to prepare and implement a  risk management plan designed to prevent accidental releases of regulated  substances and reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.", "As we reported in March 2006, many of the nation\u2019s large wastewater  facilities have improved security since September 11, 2001. For instance, a  substantial number of facilities reported improving security fences,  increasing security lighting, and implementing improved employee and  visitor identification systems, among other security enhancements. In  addition, though not required, many large wastewater facilities reported  that they conducted vulnerability assessments to identify risks to key  process components such as the use, storage, and handling of chlorine  gas. Finally, many facilities reported that they recently stopped or plan to  stop using chlorine gas in favor of alternate disinfection methods.  Commonly used alternatives include sodium hypochlorite, essentially a  concentrated form of household bleach, and ultraviolet light, which breaks  down disease-causing microorganisms.", "For wastewater facility managers, the costs of preparing vulnerability  assessments and risk management plans and converting to alternate  disinfection methods must compete for available resources with other  infrastructure needs. For instance, in 2003, in its most recent Clean Water  Needs Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that,  nationwide, wastewater systems faced $181.2 billion in costs to upgrade  treatment systems and sewer lines, reduce the incidences of combined  sewer overflows, which result in the discharge of untreated wastewater  into receiving waters, and meet other pollution control requirements.  Major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., and Cincinnati, Ohio, are  facing costs between $1 billion and $2 billion to implement necessary  capital improvements.", "This report provides information on (1) the range of costs large  wastewater treatment facilities incurred in preparing vulnerability  assessments and risk management plans, and (2) the costs large  wastewater treatment facilities incurred in converting from chlorine gas to  alternative disinfection processes.", "To identify the costs of preparing vulnerability assessments and risk  management plans, we conducted structured telephone interviews with a  select sample of large wastewater facilities identified as having completed  these assessments in our March 2006 report. Our March report identified  106 large facilities that prepared vulnerability assessments or had one  underway and 85 facilities that were required to prepare risk management  plans because they currently used chlorine gas as a disinfectant. From this  universe, we chose a nonprobability sample of facilities based largely on  geographic representation and size.", "To identify the costs incurred by wastewater treatment facilities in  converting from gaseous chlorine to alternative disinfection processes, we  conducted structured telephone interviews with most of the 38 large  facilities identified in the March report as having converted recently from  chlorine gas or indicating that they planned to do so. We also conducted  site visits with some of the facilities. Where available, we gathered  documentation, such as capital plans, from these facilities in order to  document conversion costs. We supplemented the cost information we  gathered at individual wastewater facilities with information obtained at  EPA, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and nongovernmental  organizations. Reported costs for preparing vulnerability assessments, risk  management plans, and conversion from gaseous chlorine include both  actual and estimated costs. For estimated costs, we asked facility  managers to explain how they arrived at these estimates. Reported costs  were not adjusted for inflation. We determined that reported cost data  were sufficiently reliable to provide useful information about the costs for  preparing vulnerability assessments, risk management plans, and  conversion from gaseous chlorine and the factors that affect these costs.  We conducted our work between August 2006 and March 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. A  more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology is included in  appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A majority of the nation\u2019s wastewater is treated by publicly owned  treatment works that serve a variety of customers, including private  homes, businesses, hospitals, and industry. These publicly owned  treatment works are regulated by the Clean Water Act. Wastewater  treatment includes a collection system (the underground network of  sewers) and a treatment facility. Wastewater enters the treatment facility  through the collection system, where it undergoes an initial stage called  primary treatment, during which screens remove coarse solids, and grit  chambers and sedimentation tanks allow solids to gradually sink. Next,  wastewater enters secondary treatment, where bacteria consume most of  the organic matter in the wastewater. After these processes, wastewater is  disinfected to eliminate remaining pathogens and other harmful  microorganisms.", "Wastewater facilities typically use both chemical and physical disinfection  methods, including the following:    Chlorine gas. Injecting chlorine gas into a waste stream has been the  traditional method of disinfecting wastewater. Chlorine gas is a  powerful oxidizing agent, is relatively inexpensive, and can be stored  for an extended period of time as a liquefied gas under high pressure.  Also, the residual chlorine that remains in the wastewater effluent can  prolong disinfection after initial treatment. However, chlorine gas is  extremely volatile and hazardous, and it requires specific precautions  for its safe transport, storage, and use. Because it is stored and  transported as a liquefied gas under pressure, if accidentally released,  chlorine gas can quickly turn into a potentially lethal gas. EPA requires,  among other things, that any facility storing at least 2,500 pounds of  chlorine gas prepare a risk management plan that lays out accident  prevention and emergency response activities. At certain  concentrations, the residual chlorine that remains in wastewater  effluent is toxic to aquatic life, so wastewater facilities that use  chlorine compounds may also need to dechlorinate the treatment  stream before discharging it to receiving waters. Chlorine can also  oxidize certain types of organic matter in wastewater, creating  hazardous chemical byproducts, such as trihalomethanes. Our March  2006 report found that many large wastewater facilities have  discontinued, or are planning to discontinue using chlorine gas as a  disinfectant in favor of alternative disinfection methods such as sodium  hypochlorite delivered in bulk to the facility. Of the 206 large  wastewater facilities responding to our survey, only 85 facilities  indicated they currently use chlorine gas, and 20 of these facilities plan  to switch from the gas to another disinfectant.", "Sodium hypochlorite. Injecting sodium hypochlorite\u2014essentially a  concentrated form of household bleach\u2014into a waste stream is  another chlorination method of disinfecting wastewater. Sodium  hypochlorite is safer than chlorine gas because, if spilled, it remains  liquid and can be contained and recovered. For this reason, it is not  subject to EPA\u2019s risk management planning requirements. However,  sodium hypochlorite is more expensive than chlorine gas, and it  degrades quickly if it is exposed to sunlight or is not kept at proper  temperatures. For this reason, properly storing delivered sodium  hypochlorite in the concentration necessary to disinfect wastewater  may require an on-site building with environmental controls. Sodium  hypochlorite can also be generated on-site at a wastewater facility  using an \u201celectrochlorination system\u201d that produces sodium  hypochlorite through an electrical reaction with high-purity salt and  softened water. Facilities choosing this method of disinfection reduce  chemical costs, but face increased electrical costs from the generation  equipment. Because it is a chlorine compound, wastewater facilities  using sodium hypochlorite must also be concerned with residual  chlorine and hazardous chemical byproducts, such as trihalomethanes.", "Ultraviolet light. This disinfection method uses ultraviolet lamps to  break down disease-causing microorganisms in wastewater.  Wastewater passes through an open channel with lamps submerged  below the water level. The lamps transfer electromagnetic energy to an  organism\u2019s genetic material destroying the ability of its cells to  reproduce. Because ultraviolet light is a physical process rather than a  chemical disinfectant, it eliminates the need to generate, handle,  transport, or store hazardous and corrosive chemicals. In addition,  there are no harmful residual effects to humans or aquatic life.  However, ultraviolet light disinfection may not be effective given the  turbidity of some wastewater streams. Wastewater facilities using  ultraviolet instead of chlorine gas or delivered sodium hypochlorite for  disinfection will face additional costs to maintain lamps and increased  electrical costs.", "Ozone. This disinfection method feeds ozone generated on-site from  oxygen exposed to a high-voltage current into a contact chamber  containing wastewater. According to EPA, ozone is very effective at  destroying viruses and bacteria, but it is the least used disinfection  method in the United States largely because of its high capital and  maintenance costs compared to available alternatives.", "According to EPA, vulnerability assessments help water systems evaluate  susceptibility to potential threats such as vandalism or terrorism and  identify corrective actions that can reduce or mitigate the risk of serious  consequences. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness  and Response Act of 2002 (the Bioterrorism Act) required drinking water  utilities serving populations greater than 3,300 to complete vulnerability  assessments by June 2004. Wastewater facilities are not required by law to  complete vulnerability assessments. Congress has considered bills that  would have encouraged or required wastewater treatment plants to assess  vulnerabilities, but no such requirement has become law.", "In our March 2006 report on wastewater facility security efforts, we found  that many large wastewater facilities have either completed a vulnerability  assessment or had one underway. Of the 206 large wastewater facilities  that responded to our survey, 106 facilities\u2014or 51 percent\u2014reported that  they had completed a vulnerability assessment or were currently  conducting one. Several other facilities indicated they had conducted or  planned to conduct other types of security assessments. Facilities cited  several reasons for completing a vulnerability assessment or some other  type of security assessment, but most\u2014roughly 77 percent\u2014reported  doing so on their own initiative. Many facilities indicated they were  combined systems\u2014facilities that manage both drinking water and  wastewater treatment. As such, 37 percent of facilities reported that they  did some type of security assessment in conjunction with the required  assessment for their drinking water facility.", "The Clean Air Act requires wastewater facilities that use or store more  than 2,500 pounds of chlorine gas to submit to EPA a risk management  plan that lays out accident prevention and emergency response activities.", "Under this act, EPA requires that about 15,000 facilities\u2014including  chemical, water, energy, and other sector facilities\u2014that produce, use, or  store more than threshold amounts of chemicals posing the greatest risk  to human health and the environment take a number of steps to prevent  and prepare for an accidental chemical release. EPA regulations  implementing the Clean Air Act require that the owners and operators of  chemical facilities include a facility hazard assessment, an accident  prevention program, and an emergency response program as part of their  risk management plans. The regulations required that a summary of each  facility\u2019s risk management plan be submitted to EPA by June 21, 1999. The  plans are to be revised and resubmitted to EPA at least every 5 years, and  EPA is to review them and require revisions, if necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs of Preparing Vulnerability Assessments and Risk Management Plans among Large Wastewater Facilities Vary Widely", "paragraphs": ["Although accurate information on the costs of vulnerability assessments  and risk management plans is limited, available estimates suggest that  their costs vary considerably.

In general, larger facilities spend more  converting to alternative disinfection methods. For example, because  larger facilities process a greater flow of wastewater, converting to  delivered sodium hypochlorite would require a larger sodium hypochlorite  storage building or buildings relative to a smaller facility.

For instance,  the availability of usable buildings on facility grounds will determine  whether a facility needs to construct, expand, or update a building to  properly house sodium hypochlorite and its associated metering  equipment. In addition, the distance between the storage building and  treatment tanks will determine the amount of piping needed to deliver  stored sodium hypochlorite to the treatment tanks. An example comes  from the Hampton Roads Sanitation District which provides wastewater  treatment to approximately 1.6 million people in 17 cities and counties in  southeast Virginia, including the cities of Newport News, Norfolk, Suffolk,  Virginia Beach, and Williamsburg.

The Nansemond  plant conversion cost an estimated $1.65 million, while the slightly larger  Chesapeake-Elizabeth plant conversion cost about $1.2 million. Costs  were higher at the Nansemond plant because a building needed to be  constructed for sodium hypochlorite storage, while the Chesapeake- Elizabeth plant had an existing building that only needed to be upgraded  to properly store the chemical.", "Federal discharge permit requirements related to individual treatment  facilities can also influence conversion costs. Certain wastewater facilities  may be allowed higher chlorine residuals in treated effluent because they  discharge into less sensitive waters. Often, these facilities do not have to  dechlorinate wastewater, saving the facility the cost of dechlorination  chemicals, equipment, and storage. For example, the Philadelphia-area  Southeast and Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plants, which treat 90 and  190 million gallons per day, respectively, need only to chlorinate water  prior to discharging into the Delaware River. Both plants were converted  to delivered sodium hypochlorite\u2014the Southeast plant in 2006 at an  estimated cost of $1.9 million and the Northeast plant in 2003 at an  estimated cost of $2.6 million. In contrast, the Baltimore-area Back River  Wastewater Treatment Plant, which treats 150 million gallons per day and  discharges into the ecologically sensitive Chesapeake Bay, must chlorinate  and dechlorinate its wastewater before discharge. This facility converted  to delivered sodium hypochlorite in 2004 at a reported cost of $3.3 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Temporary Conversions", "paragraphs": ["Finally, some facilities have reduced conversion costs in the short term  through temporary conversions. For example, the Metropolitan Sewer  District of Greater Cincinnati decided to convert its Mill Creek Wastewater  Treatment Plant, which treats 120 million gallons per day, from chlorine  gas to sodium hypochlorite disinfection soon after September 11, 2001.  According to the plant manager, by mid-October 2001, the facility had  begun disinfecting with sodium hypochlorite by hooking up a rented  sodium hypochlorite trailer to its disinfection system at a cost of $25,000.  By May 2002, the facility had completed an interim conversion to sodium  hypochlorite by purchasing and installing two 8,000 gallon outdoor storage  tanks for sodium hypochlorite at a cost of $60,000. According to the plant  manager, this interim disinfection system is still in use today, though the  plant intends to permanently convert to delivered sodium hypochlorite in  2008 or 2009 at an estimated cost of $3 million. The plant manager said the  permanent conversion would include an unloading station for sodium  hypochlorite deliveries and a new storage building for the chemical and  related instrumentation. The plant manager said the new storage building  was needed to reduce the decay of stored sodium hypochlorite. The plant  manager added that the storage building and additional piping would  improve plant safety because it would allow for central storage and  delivery of sodium hypochlorite. Currently, sodium hypochlorite deliveries  are made at several plant locations for odor control which, according to  the plant manager, increase the odds the chemical may be mishandled and  accidentally mixed with other reactant chemicals used at the plant, such  as ammonia.", "Similarly, the Eastern Water Reclamation Facility, which treats 16 million  gallons per day and provides service to Orange County, Florida, converted  from chlorine gas to sodium hypochlorite disinfection at a cost of $60,000  in November 2001 through the addition of outdoor storage tanks and  related pumps. According to the plant manager, the facility may consider  additional changes in the future, such as permanent sodium hypochlorite  storage or on-site generation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Changes in Annual Costs Vary Widely, with Some Facilities Reporting Savings", "paragraphs": ["Changes in annual costs related to disinfection treatment conversions  were hard to measure due to lack of data. Many facilities we interviewed  were unable to provide complete information on annual costs related to  disinfection before and after converting from chlorine gas. Available data  show that annual chemical costs related to disinfection increased for  facilities that converted to delivered sodium hypochlorite, because sodium  hypochlorite costs more than chlorine gas. Available data also show that  electrical costs related to disinfection increased for facilities that  converted to on-site generation of sodium hypochlorite or ultraviolet light  treatment, however these facilities also saw large reductions in chemical  costs. Available data also show that increases in annual costs related to  disinfection were offset somewhat by savings in training and regulatory  requirements, as several facilities that converted reported a reduced need  for staff time devoted to complying with the EPA risk management  planning that was required when the plant used chlorine gas.", "A few facilities were even able to report or project annual savings due to  the disinfection conversion. For example, the wastewater treatment  manager of the Columbia Boulevard Treatment Plant, which treats 143  million gallons per day and provides wastewater service to Portland,  Oregon, estimated that annual costs related to disinfection fell by over  $100,000 after the plant completed a 2005 conversion from chlorine gas to  delivered sodium hypochlorite disinfection. According to the wastewater  treatment manager, increases in disinfection chemical costs for the plant  were more than offset by reductions in electrical, labor, and training costs.  Electrical power costs fell because the plant no longer had to power  chlorine gas evaporators, which heat and help convert the pressurized  liquid into gas before it is injected into the waste stream. In contrast,  sodium hypochlorite is fed into the waste stream via less energy-intensive  pumps. Labor and training costs also fell because the plant no longer had  to meet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA)  Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard,  and risk management and emergency response planning costs associated  with the use of chlorine gas were eliminated.", "In another example, the South Central Regional Wastewater Treatment  and Disposal Plant, which treats 18 million gallons per day for customers  in the cities of Delray Beach and Boynton Beach, Florida, predicts that it  too will achieve annual savings once it converts from chlorine gas to  sodium hypochlorite generated on-site, which it anticipates completing in  September 2007. According to the Executive Director of the South Central  Regional Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Board, potential disruptions  of sodium hypochlorite delivery during hurricane seasons motivated them  to begin generating their disinfection chemicals on-site. The plant\u2019s most  recent fiscal year operating and maintenance budget for disinfection is  estimated to be roughly $307,000 for chlorine gas and associated costs  including equipment and maintenance, labor, and risk management  planning. Postconversion annual operating and maintenance costs for  disinfection are estimated to fall to $205,000 in the 2008 calendar year,  primarily due to the suspension of chlorine gas purchases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to EPA for review and comment.

From these two groups, we identified 47 facilities that  reported that they had prepared vulnerability assessments and currently  use chlorine. Of this universe, we chose a nonprobability sample of 25  facilities to assure geographic dispersion and adequate variation in size,  since these factors were likely to influence their costs.
