For example, DOD uses readiness measures that vary 10 percentage points or more to determine readiness ratings and often does not report the precise measurements outside DOD. DOD included more information in its Quarterly Readiness Reports to the Congress. But quality issues remain--in that the reports do not specifically describe readiness problems, their effects on readiness, or remedial actions to correct problems. Nor do the reports contain information about funding programmed to address specific remedial actions. Although current law does not specifically require this information, Congress could use it for its oversight role. DOD complied with most, though not all, of the legislative readiness reporting requirements enacted by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 1998-2002. For example, DOD (1) is now listing the individual units that have reported low readiness and reporting on the readiness of prepositioned equipment, as required by the fiscal year 1998 Act; (2) is reporting on 11 of 19 readiness indicators that commanders identified as important and that Congress required to be added to the quarterly reports in the fiscal year 1998 Act, but is not reporting on the other 8 readiness indicators; and (3) has not yet implemented a new comprehensive readiness reporting system as required in the fiscal year 1999 Act. As a result, Congress is not receiving all the information mandated by law. DOD issued a directive in June 2002 to establish a new comprehensive readiness reporting system that DOD officials said they plan to use to comply with the reporting requirements specified by Congress. The new system is intended to implement many of the recommendations included in a congressionally directed independent study for establishing such a system. However, the extent to which the new system will actually address the current system's shortcomings is unknown, because the new system is currently only a concept, and full capability is not scheduled until 2007. As of January 2003, DOD had not developed an implementation plan containing measurable performance goals, identification of resources, performance indicators, and an evaluation plan to assess progress in developing the new reporting system. Without such a plan, neither DOD nor the Congress will be able to fully assess whether the new system's development is on schedule and achieving desired results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) readiness assessment system was  designed to assess the ability of units and joint forces to fight and meet the  demands of the national security strategy.

Unit-level  readiness is assessed with the Global Status of Resources and Training  System (GSORTS), which is an automated system that assesses the extent  to which military units possess the required resources and training to  undertake their wartime missions. To address joint readiness, the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff established the Joint Monthly  Readiness Review (now called the Joint Quarterly Readiness Review or  JQRR), that compiles readiness assessments from the combatant  commands, the combat support agencies, and the military services. The  Joint Staff and the services use these assessments to brief DOD\u2019s  leadership on the Senior Readiness Oversight Council\u2014an executive-level  forum for monitoring emerging readiness issues at the strategic level. The  briefings to the council are intended to present a view of readiness at the  aggregate force level. From these briefings to the council, DOD prepares a  legislatively mandated quarterly readiness report to Congress. Figure 1  provides an overview of DOD\u2019s readiness assessment process.", "We have issued several reports containing recommendations for  improving readiness reporting. In 1994, we recommended DOD develop a  more comprehensive readiness system to include 26 specific readiness  indicators. In 1998, we reported on shortcomings in DOD\u2019s readiness  assessment system. At that time, we stated GSORTS\u2019 limitations included  lack of precision in measurements, late reporting, subjective input, and  lack of standardization. Secondly, we reported that while the Quarterly  Readiness Reports to the Congress accurately reflected briefs to the  Senior Readiness Oversight Council, they lacked specific details on  deficiencies and remedial actions and thus did not meet the requirements  of 10 U.S.C. 482 (b). DOD concurred with our recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense take steps to better fulfill the legislative reporting  requirements under 10 U.S.C. 482 by providing (1) supporting data on key  readiness deficiencies and (2) specific information on planned remedial  actions. Finally, we reported that deficiencies identified as a result of the  Joint Monthly Readiness Reviews remained open because the solutions  require funding over the long term. In 2002, we issued a classified report  on DOD\u2019s process for tracking the status of deficiencies identified in the  Joint Monthly Readiness Reviews. We made recommendations to improve  DOD\u2019s deficiency status reporting system and for DOD to develop funding  estimates for correcting critical readiness deficiencies.

As of September 2002, the data are reported to a  central site, and there is one database of record. Also in 1998, U.S. Army  GSORTS review procedures delayed submission of Army data, and all the  services\u2019 data entry was manual. As of September 2002, Army reporting  procedures require reporting consistent with GSORTS\u2019 requirements, and  all the services have automated data entry, which reduces errors. In 1998,  combat units only reported on readiness for wartime missions. As of  September 2002, combat units report on assigned mission readiness in  addition to wartime mission readiness.", "Conversely, DOD has not resolved some issues we raised in 1998. For  example, readiness ratings are still reported in broad bands and actual  percentages of required resources are not externally reported. These  issues remain because the manual specifying readiness reporting rules has  not changed in these areas. The manual\u2019s definition of readiness levels for  personnel has not changed since our 1998 report\u2014it still defines readiness  levels in bands of 10 percentage points or more and does not require  external reporting of actual percentages. For example, the highest  personnel rating can range from 90 percent to 100 percent, and there is no  requirement to report the actual percentage outside of DOD. We have also  reported that GSORTS does not always reflect training and equipment  deficiencies. For example, we reported in April and June 2002 that  readiness data do not reflect the effect of training range restrictions on  unit readiness. We have also reported that GSORTS does not include  whether a unit\u2019s chemical/biological equipment is usable.", "In commenting on our analysis, the OUSD P&R office responsible for  readiness reporting stated that it recognized the imprecision of the current  measurements.

However, some information was  eliminated from the quarterly reports. For example, the law requires  results of joint readiness reviews to be reported to Congress. DOD  included these results until the July-September 2001 Quarterly Readiness  Report to the Congress. Since that report, four quarterly reports have been  issued without the joint force assessments. Defense officials responsible  for readiness reporting said that the joint readiness reviews were not  included because the scenarios were based on the former national security  strategy of two major wars.

The reports did not specifically describe the  nature of each readiness problem or discuss the effects of each on unit  readiness. Also, the reports included only broad statements of remedial  actions that lacked details on timelines, objectives, or funding  requirements. For example, one report said that the Air Force continued to  experience shortages in critical job skills that affected the service\u2019s ability  to train. The report did not refer the reader to data in annexes showing  training readiness ratings; it did not state which skills were short, which  training was not accomplished, or whether this shortage had or was  expected to affect units\u2019 readiness ratings. Further, the report did not  explain the remedial actions taken or planned to reverse the skill shortage,  how long it would take to solve this problem, or what funding was  programmed to implement remedial actions.

Although the report provides the quantity of the backlog, it does not  explain the effect the backlog had on readiness. Specifically, the report did  not explain whether units\u2019 readiness were affected because maintenance  was not accomplished when needed. In addition, DOD is required to report  on training commitments and deployments. The Expanded Quarterly  Readiness Report to Congress Implementation Plan dated February 1998  stated that \u201ceither an excessive or a reduced level of commitment could be  an indicator of potential readiness problems.\u201d However, OUSD P&R did  not define what kind of \u201creadiness problems\u201d this data may indicate would  occur as a result of \u201cexcessive or reduced\u201d levels of training and  deployments, such as degraded equipment or training.

Specifically, we recommend that DOD\u2019s reports explain  (in the unclassified section) the most critical readiness issues that are of  greatest concern to the department and the services. For each issue, we  recommend that DOD\u2019s reports include    an analysis of the readiness deficiencies, including a clear explanation of  how the issue affects units\u2019 readiness;    a statement of the specific remedial actions planned or implemented; and    clear statements of the funding programmed to implement each remedial  action.", "To be able to assess progress in developing the new readiness system, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the OUSD P&R to develop  an implementation plan that identifies    performance goals that are objective, quantifiable, and measurable;  the cost and personnel resources needed to achieve the goals, including an  identification of the new system\u2019s development and implementation costs  in the President\u2019s Budget beginning in fiscal year 2005 and Future Years  Defense Plan;    performance indicators to measure outcomes;    an evaluation plan to compare program results with established goals; and    milestones to guide development to the planned 2007 full capability date.", "To assist Congress in its oversight role, we recommend that the Secretary  of Defense give annual updates to the Congress on the new readiness  reporting system\u2019s development to include    performance measures,    progress toward milestones,    comparison of progress with established goals, and  remedial actions, if needed, to maintain the implementation schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Response", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, which are reprinted in  appendix II, the Department of Defense did not agree with our  recommendations.", "In response to our recommendation that DOD improve the quality of  information contained in its quarterly readiness reports, DOD said that the  Quarterly Readiness Report to the Congress is one of the most  comprehensive and detailed reports submitted to the Congress that  discusses serious readiness issues and ways in which these issues are  being addressed. DOD further stated that the department presents  briefings on specific readiness issues to the Congress and that spending  more time and resources expanding the existing written report would be  counterproductive.", "We recognize that the Quarterly Readiness Reports to the Congress  contain voluminous data. However, as discussed in this report, we found  that the quarterly reports\u2019 annexes are large and mostly consist of charts  or other data that are not adequately explained and are not related to  units\u2019 readiness. In some cases, criteria have not been established to  enable the reader to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable  levels of the data reported. As a result, the reader cannot assess the  significance of the data because it is not at all clear whether the data  reported indicate a problem or the extent of the problem. Considering that  the quarterly reports contain inadequately explained data and that much of  the information is not \u201cuser friendly,\u201d we continue to believe the quality of  information in the quarterly reports can be improved. In fact, we reviewed  all the quarterly reports provided to Congress since 1998 and found that  through the January-June 2001 report the reports did include an  unclassified summary of readiness issues for each service addressing four  topics\u2014personnel, equipment, training, and enablers (critical units or  capabilities, such as specialized aircraft, essential to support operations).  However, the reports did not include supporting data or a discussion of  remedial actions. Since that time, these summaries have been eliminated  from the quarterly reports. For example, the unclassified narrative of the  last two reports available at the time we performed our work\u2014January- March 2002 and April-June 2002\u2014were less than two pages long and  neither discussed readiness issues nor ways in which these issues are  being addressed. One report discussed the new readiness reporting  system, and the other discussed a review of seven environmental laws.  Given that DOD has highlighted key issues in the past, we believe that  improving the quarterly reports would be beneficial if DOD were to focus  on the most critical readiness issues that are of greatest concern to the  services and includes supporting data and a discussion of remedial  actions. Therefore, we have modified our recommendation that DOD  improve the quality of readiness reporting to focus on readiness issues  deemed to be critical by the Secretary and the military services and to  provide more detailed data and analyses of those issues and the remedial  actions planned for each one.", "DOD did not agree with our recommendations that it (1) develop an  implementation plan with, among other things, performance goals that are  objective, quantifiable, and measurable and (2) provide annual updates to  the Congress on the new readiness reporting system\u2019s development. DOD  said that it had undertaken an initiative to develop better tools for  assessing readiness and that it intended to apprise Congress on its efforts  to develop tools for readiness assessment. DOD further stated that the  effort to improve readiness reporting is in its infancy, but that it has  established milestones, cost estimates, functional responsibilities, and  expected outcomes. DOD believes that further planning and a prescriptive  annual update to the Congress is unnecessary.", "We agree that the new readiness reporting system may have the potential  to improve readiness reporting. However, as discussed in this report, the  directive establishing the new system contains very broad, high-level  statements of overall functional responsibilities and outcomes, but no  details on how these will be accomplished. Further, DOD has established  two milestones\u2014initial capability in 2004 and full capability in 2007. DOD  does not have a road map explaining the steps needed to achieve full  capability by 2007, which is seven years after Congress mandated a new  system be in place. In addition, as discussed earlier in this report, DOD has  experienced delays in implementing much smaller readiness  improvements. While DOD has undertaken an initiative to develop better  tools for assessing readiness and intends to routinely and fully apprise the  Congress on its development efforts, tools are the mechanics for  evaluating readiness data. As such, tools are not the same thing as the  comprehensive readiness reporting system mandated by Congress that  DOD has said will include new metrics and will evaluate entities within  DOD that currently do not report readiness. Considering that Congress  expressed concern about DOD\u2019s lack of progress in developing a  comprehensive system, that developing and implementing DOD\u2019s planned  new system is scheduled to take 4 more years, and that delays have been  experienced in earlier efforts to make small improvements in readiness  reporting, we continue to believe that it is important for DOD to develop  an implementation plan to gauge progress in developing and implementing  the new readiness reporting system and to provide annual updates to the  Congress. Such a plan would be consistent with DOD\u2019s approach to other  major initiatives such as transforming training. We have therefore retained  these two recommendations.", "DOD also provided technical corrections and we have modified the report  where appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Ranking Minority Member,  Subcommittee on Readiness, House Committee on Armed Services; the  Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Readiness and  Management Support, Senate Committee on Armed Services; other  interested congressional committees; Secretary of Defense; and the  Director, Office of Management and Budget.

Specifically, we met with  officials of the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness (OUSD P&R) responsible for readiness reporting, the Joint  Staff, and the military services to discuss their individual progress in each  of these areas. To assess progress regarding unit level readiness reporting,  we reviewed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff manual governing  this system and the related service implementing instructions to determine  if these documents had changed since our 1998 report or if the manual and  service instructions continued to allow reporting in the same manner as  reflected in our earlier report. Through a comparison of the current and  prior documents, discussions with pertinent officials, and our analysis, we  determined whether the readiness reporting issues we raised in 1998 had  been resolved. We also reviewed the content of quarterly reports to assess  their quality and usefulness, and assess whether the problems we reported  in 1998 had been rectified. We discussed our analysis with OUSD P&R  officials and provided them with our analyses in order that they could fully  consider and comment on our methodology and conclusions. We did not  assess the accuracy of reported readiness data.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has complied with legislative  reporting requirements enacted since our prior report, we compared a  complete listing of these requirements to DOD\u2019s readiness reporting. First,  we identified the legislatively mandated readiness reporting requirements  enacted since our 1998 report. To accomplish this, we reviewed the  National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 1998-2002 to list the  one-time and recurring reporting requirements related to military  readiness. We also requested congressional staff and OUSD P&R to review  the list, and officials from both offices agreed it was accurate. We did not  develop a total count of the number of reporting requirements because the  acts included a series of sections and subsections that could be totaled in  various ways. Once we obtained concurrence that this listing was  complete and accurate, we compared this list to current readiness  reporting to make an overall judgment on the extent of compliance.", "To assess how DOD plans to improve readiness reporting, we reviewed the  June 2002 DOD directive establishing a new readiness reporting system  and a progress update briefing on the new system. We also obtained  readiness briefings from each of the services, OUSD P&R, and Joint Staff  officials. We performed several electronic searches of the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense (Readiness) electronic Web site to determine the  status of readiness reporting. To assess how smoothly other readiness  improvements progressed, we reviewed DOD audit reports. We discussed  our findings with OUSD P&R officials and worked proactively with them  in conducting our analyses. Specifically, we provided them drafts of our  analyses for their comments and corrections.", "We conducted our review from June 2002 through January 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
