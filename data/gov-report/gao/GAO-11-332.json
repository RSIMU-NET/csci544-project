The majority of the program's total cost growth is due to added quantities. Development cost growth and schedule delays resulted from beginning development before determining how to achieve requirements within program constraints, with miscommunication between the program office and prime contractor about systems engineering tasks and with late staffing by both the program office and the contractor.

Its major improvements include  upgraded engines, redesigned gearboxes, composite rotor blades and rotor  system improvements, fly-by-wire flight controls, a fully integrated glass  cockpit, improved cargo handling and capacity, and survivability and force  protection enhancements. It is expected to be able to transport external  loads totaling 27,000 pounds over a range of 110 nautical miles under high- hot conditions without refueling and to fulfill land- and sea-based heavy- lift requirements.", "Sikorsky was awarded a sole-source contract to develop the CH-53K  helicopter because, according to the program office, as the developer of  the CH-53E, it is the only known qualified source with the ability to design,  develop, and produce the required CH-53 variant. The program entered the  system development and demonstration phase of the acquisition process  in December 2005 and a $3 billion development contract was awarded to  Sikorsky in April 2006. Beginning in 2006, the program experienced  schedule delays that resulted in cost increases to the development  contract. As a result of the schedule delays and cost growth, in 2009 the  program office reported a cost and schedule deviation to its original cost  and acquisition program baselines to OSD. However, these increases were  not significant enough to incur what is commonly referred to as a Nunn- McCurdy breach.", "In July 2010, the CH-53K program completed what it deemed a successful  critical design review (CDR), signaling that it had a stable design and  could begin building developmental test aircraft.

In addition, the program received permission to  defer three performance capabilities and relax two technical metrics  associated with operating and support costs\u2014which we believe are sound  acquisition decisions\u2014and will deliver the initial capability to the  warfighter in 2018, almost 3 years later than originally planned.

The  Marine Corps now plans to buy a total of 200 CH-53K helicopters for an  estimated $25.5 billion, a 36 percent increase over its original estimates.  The majority of this increase is due to added quantities. The program\u2019s  schedule delays have increased the development cost estimate by over  $1.7 billion, or more than 39 percent.

The Marine Corps has assessed the required quantity of  aircraft and determined that the requirement for 200 aircraft remains valid  despite the proposed manpower decrease. Primarily as a result of the  aircraft quantity increase, the program\u2019s procurement cost estimate has  also increased by over $5 billion, or 35 percent, from nearly $14.4 billion to  over $19.4 billion.

The CH-53K program originally scheduled its preliminary  design review for June 2007, a year and a half after the program began  development, and later delayed it to September 2008, nearly 3 years after  development start. We have reported that performing systems engineering  reviews\u2014including a system requirements review, system functional  review, and preliminary design review\u2014before a program is initiated and a  business case is set is critical to ensuring that a program\u2019s requirements  are defined and feasible and that the design can meet those requirements  within cost, schedule, and other system constraints.", "Problems with systems engineering began immediately within the program  because the program and Sikorsky disagreed on what systems engineering  tasks needed to be accomplished. As a result, the bulk of the program\u2019s  systems engineering problems related to derived requirements. According  to an OSD official, the contractor did not account for total design  workload, technical reviews, and development efforts. For example, the  program experienced problems defining software specifications for its  Avionics Management System. While Marine Corps officials commented  that requirements are often difficult to define early in the engineering  process and changes are expected during design maturation, they noted  that in this case the use of a firm fixed-price contract with the  subcontractor made it difficult to facilitate changes. As a result,  completing this task took longer than the program had estimated and the  program\u2019s CDR was delayed. In another example, the program has a  requirement that the CH-53K be transportable by C-5 aircraft. As with the  CH-53E, because of its size, the CH-53K\u2019s rotor and main gearbox will be  removed from the aircraft\u2019s body in order to fit within the height  requirements of a C-5. The program office interpreted this as requiring that  each CH-53K be shipped in its entirety on a single C-5 aircraft, including  the removed rotor and gearbox. However, the contractor interpreted the  requirement differently and proposed shipping all rotors and main  gearboxes in another C-5 separate from the CH-53K body. Program  officials did not accept this interpretation of the requirement and required  the contractor to propose a solution in which each CH-53K aircraft would  be shipped and arrive in its entirety in a single C-5 aircraft. Marine Corps  officials commented that even though this requirement was interpreted  differently, it was identified early in the systems engineering process and  addressed.", "The program office and contractor underestimated the time it would take  to hire its workforce, and delays in awarding subcontracts made it difficult  for the program to complete design tasks and maintain its schedule.  According to an OSD official, while the program officially began  development in December 2005, the development contract was not  awarded until 4 months later\u2014in April 2006\u2014delaying development start.  According to program officials, budget-driven hiring restrictions for  government personnel, which included ceilings on the number of  government personnel who could be assigned to the program management  office, affected the program\u2019s ability to hire its workforce at the time the  program was initiated. Similarly, program officials told us that the  contractor underestimated the amount of time required to locate, recruit,  train, and assign qualified personnel to the program. The contractor was  also late in awarding contracts to its major subcontractors. To mitigate the  risk of production cost growth, the contractor established long-term  production agreements with its subcontractors. According to program  officials, in these agreements subcontractors committed in advance to  pricing arrangements for the production of parts and spares. While the  contractor used this strategy to reduce program risk, it resulted in a delay  and the major subcontracts were awarded later than needed to maintain  the program\u2019s initially planned schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CH-53K Program Has Deferred Performance Capabilities and Relaxed Technical Metrics Associated with Operating and Support Costs", "paragraphs": ["In 2010, the CH-53K program received approval from the Joint  Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) to defer three performance  capabilities that make up a portion of the Net-Ready key performance  parameter, and from the Marine Corps to relax two maintenance-based  technical performance metrics\u2014both of which we believe are sound  acquisition decisions. The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) decision to  defer three performance capabilities was based on consultation among  JROC, Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps, Chief of Naval Operations staff,  and the program office in 2008, which prompted the CH-53K program  office to review the program\u2019s requirements and identify potential areas in  which to decrease costs. As part of that review, the program office  identified several areas where costs could be deferred without decreasing  capability, including three communications-related performance  capabilities\u2014Link-16, Variable Message Format, and Mode V software\u2014 that constituted part of the Net-Ready key performance parameter.  Program officials estimated that this will result in over $100 million in cost  deferral. Program officials explained that these software capabilities were  not removed from the program\u2019s road map, but rather have been deferred  until after IOC. Originally, the program\u2019s Operational Requirements  Document called for all three capabilities to be fully integrated in fiscal  year 2015. However, one of the capabilities must now be fully integrated  no later than 6 months after IOC, which is currently scheduled to occur in  2018, and the other two capabilities must be fully integrated within 2 years  of IOC. Program officials stated that deferment of these capabilities will  not affect aircraft interoperability.", "Two technical performance metrics were changed because, according to  program officials, meeting the original maintenance-based technical  performance requirements for Mean Time To Repair and Mean Corrective  Maintenance Time for Operational Mission Failures was not cost  effective. For example, the CH-53K\u2019s rotor blades are designed to have a  two-piece design featuring a removable tip. However, the curing time to  adhere the blade tip to the blade was driving up the time it would take to  remove and replace the blade tip. The contractor proposed meeting the  original requirement by moving to a one-piece blade; however, this would  increase the program\u2019s operating and support costs by approximately $99  per flight hour and increase the logistical footprint of the helicopter. As a  result, the program sought and received approval to relax the performance  metric associated with replacing the blade tip instead of investing the  financial resources necessary to obtain the original metrics or moving to a  one-piece blade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delayed Delivery of the CH-53K Requires Longer Reliance on Costly and Less Reliable Legacy Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["Because of a nearly 3-year delay in initial delivery of the CH-53K, program  officials estimated that it will cost approximately $927 million more to  continue to maintain the CH-53E legacy system. Initial delivery of the CH- 53K to the warfighter is currently scheduled for 2018, a delay of almost 3  years that will require the Marine Corps to rely on legacy aircraft that are  less reliable, more costly to operate and maintain, and less capable of  performing the same mission. This delay, coupled with an increased  demand for the CH-53E in foreign theaters, led the Marine Corps to pull all  available assets from retirement for either reentry into service or to be  used for spare parts. Continued reliance on the CH-53E will be costly, as it  is one of the most expensive helicopters to maintain in the Marine Corps\u2019s  fleet. For example, the drive train of the CH-53E costs approximately  $3,000 per flight hour to maintain. In contrast, the program estimates that  the drive train for the CH-53K\u2014its largest dynamic system\u2014will cost only  $1,000 per flight hour to maintain. In addition, the CH-53K is expected to  have improved reliability and maintainability over the CH-53E legacy  system. For example, the CH-53K\u2019s engine has 60 percent fewer parts than  that of the CH-53E, which the program office believes will result in a more  reliable engine that is easier and less costly to maintain. In addition, the  CH-53K incorporates an aluminum gearbox casing, which will decrease  the need for replacement resulting from corrosion.", "Delayed delivery of the CH-53K will also affect the ability of the Marine  Corps to carry out future missions that cannot be performed by the CH- 53E. For example, the CH-53E can carry 15,000 pounds internally  compared to 30,000 pounds for the CH-53K. While the CH-53K is expected  to carry up to 27,000 pounds externally for 110 nautical miles at 91.5\u00b0F at  an altitude of 3,000 feet\u2014a Navy operational requirement for high-hot  conditions\u2014the CH-53E can only carry just over 8,000 pounds under the  same conditions. The increased lift capability of the CH-53K during these  conditions may enable it to carry the current and incoming inventory of  up-armored vehicles, which are much heavier than their less-armored  predecessors. For example, the up-armoring of wheeled military vehicles,  such as the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle, and the  introduction of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle have resulted in a military  inventory with weights that are beyond the weight limits of the CH-53E.  According to program officials, without the addition of the CH-53K, the  Marine Corps will soon no longer be able to carry and deliver the military\u2019s  new inventory of wheeled vehicles in high-hot conditions. Figure 1  compares the capabilities and characteristics of the CH-53E and CH-53K.", "The combination of the increase in the quantity of heavy-lift helicopters  required to support Marine troop levels and the delayed delivery of the  CH-53K to the warfighter has created a requirement gap for heavy-lift  helicopters of nearly 50 helicopters (nearly 25 percent) over the next 7  years and represents an operational risk to the warfighter. However, the  Marine Corps stated that it is accepting significant risk with the heavy-lift  shortfall and will continue to operate under this gap until the CH-53K  becomes available.

The  program addressed its early staffing issues by increasing staffing levels  beginning in January 2009 and maintained those levels through completion  of CDR. In addition, the program delayed technical reviews until it was  prepared to move forward, thereby becoming more of an event-driven  rather than a schedule-driven program. An event-driven approach enables  developers to be reasonably certain that their products are more likely to  meet established cost, schedule, and performance baselines.

While  some concurrency may be beneficial to efficiently transition from  development to production, there is also risk in concurrency. Any changes  in design and manufacturing that require modifications to delivered  aircraft or to tooling and manufacturing processes would result in  increased costs and delays in getting capabilities to the warfighter.

In 2009, reflecting the early difficulties  experienced in development, the CH-53K program revised its cost and  schedule estimates. This revised schedule would have reduced the  program\u2019s level of concurrency. For example, while the original program  schedule called for developmental testing to be ongoing during the  production of all three lots of LRIP, the schedule resulting from the 2009  adjustments called for developmental testing to be ongoing during the first  two lots of LRIP. However, the program had concerns that this schedule\u2019s  allowance of approximately 2 years between final delivery of  developmental test aircraft and the beginning of LRIP would create a  production gap that could be costly. As a result, the program office was  considering accelerating procurement funds in an effort to begin  production 1 year earlier than planned and minimize breaks in production.

The new schedule results in later delivery of developmental test  aircraft and delays some testing. As a result, according to program  officials, the production gap issue has been addressed. Another result,  though, is that the program\u2019s new schedule maintains a level of  concurrency similar to that of the original schedule. Program officials have  conceded that concurrency exists within their program, but state that this  concurrency will reduce the operational risk of further delaying IOC.
