In 2008, Congress required DOD to compile and review an annual inventory of its contracted services to include the number of contractors providing services to DOD and the functions these contractors were performing. The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act directed GAO to report for 3 years on these inventories.", "For this third report, GAO assessed (1) the progress DOD has made in compiling the fiscal year 2011 inventory of contracted services and efforts to collect contractor manpower data, and (2) the extent to which defense components complied with DOD's guidance for reporting on their inventory reviews. GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed inventory submissions from 31 components, reviewed component certification letters, and interviewed DOD acquisition and manpower officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over the past year and a half, the Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to implement its plan to collect contractor manpower data directly from contractors and to develop and implement a department-wide system, based on the Army's existing system, to collect and store these and other inventory data. DOD officials estimate that the data system will be available in fiscal year 2014, with DOD components reporting on most of their service contracts by fiscal year 2016. DOD, however, is still working on key decisions related to security, funding, and other technological issues and has not developed a plan of action with anticipated time frames and necessary resources to help ensure DOD remains on track to meet its goals. Making timely decisions and developing a plan of action with anticipated timeframes and necessary resources, as GAO has previously recommended, would facilitate DOD's stated intent of implementing a DOD-wide system to collect required inventory information. For the fiscal year 2011 inventory, DOD components generally used the same compilation processes used in the previous year. As such, with the exception of the Army, which already has an inventory data collection system, the remaining components relied primarily on the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). GAO previously reported that FPDS-NG has several limitations, including the inability to identify more than one type of service in a contract or the number of contractor full-time equivalents (FTE), which limit its utility for purposes of compiling a complete and accurate inventory.", "Consistent with DOD's December 2011 guidance, 29 of the 31 components submitted letters certifying that they had conducted an inventory review as of April 2013. DOD officials stated that the requirement to submit certification letters represented a significant improvement over prior years' reviews, when DOD could not determine whether the required reviews were conducted. These officials also stated that the letters provided useful insights into the components' efforts. GAO's analysis, however, indicates that none of the components' certification letters discussed all six elements required by DOD's guidance. For example, GAO's analysis found that the letters generally provided only limited information on their review methodologies or the results of their review efforts. In addition, it is unclear based on the information provided in the certification letters the extent to which the differences in the methodologies components used to conduct the reviews contributed to the variation in the identification of contractors performing inherently governmental functions, unauthorized personal services, or closely associated with inherently governmental functions. For example, the Army, using its review process, identified over 44,000 contractor FTEs performing closely associated with inherently governmental functions, while the Air Force identified about 1,400 contractor FTEs and 13 components reported they had no contractors performing these functions. Further, the Army and the Air Force did not provide complete information on actions taken to resolve instances where they had identified contractors performing inherently governmental functions as part of their reviews, such as by transferring performance of these functions to DOD personnel or modifying the contract's statement of work. The ability to identify contractors performing these functions is valuable as it allows actions to be taken, but that value is significantly reduced if decision-makers have no assurance as to whether corrective actions were taken."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct component heads to discuss in their certification letters all required inventory review elements, as well as how instances where contractors are performing inherently governmental functions were resolved.

First, it  uses a pre-award process that includes detailed checklists to help  assess whether the proposed contract includes services that are  inherently governmental functions or inappropriate personal services,  and to identify services that are closely associated with inherently  governmental functions. For example, to identify work that is closely  associated with inherently governmental functions, the checklists ask  whether the contractor will be providing services related to budget  preparation, feasibility studies, and acquisition planning, among  others. Second, it uses a post-award review, the Panel for  Documentation of Contractors, to review information provided by  commands to make certain determinations such as whether a  contractor\u2019s performance of closely associated with inherently  governmental functions has evolved into the performance of  inherently governmental functions. The panel also evaluates whether  sufficient capacity exists to oversee the contracted workforce. This  process allowed the Army to identify over 900 contractor FTEs  performing inherently governmental functions and over 44,000  contractor FTEs performing closely associated with inherently  governmental functions.", "In contrast, the Department of Defense Education Activity indicated its  review was conducted by comparing data from the inventory with  information gathered through their contract writing system database.  The component provided no additional information on its  methodology.", "Based on the reported methodologies, we could not determine  whether several components took into consideration the way an  activity is performed or administered as part of their inventory reviews,  which was required by the December 2011 guidance. For example,  U.S. Special Forces Command indicated in its certification letter that  all the contracts in its inventory were reviewed before award by the  Special Operations Command Requirements Evaluation Board. The  command did not indicate whether reviews were conducted after  contracts were awarded. While the Office of Federal Procurement  Policy directs agencies to confirm before award that the services to be  procured do not include inherently governmental work, it also directs  agencies to review on an ongoing basis the functions performed by  contractors to ensure that the work being performed is appropriate.

For example, the Army and  the Air Force were able to provide us with the number of contractor  FTEs performing closely associated with inherently governmental  functions, while the Navy identified the number of contracts and the  Defense Logistics Agency identified the percent of contracts that  included this type of activity. As a result, it is difficult to determine how  many contractors are performing closely associated with inherently  governmental functions.

In addition, it is currently assigning priorities and targeting  reduction and conversions from contractors to government positions.  These changes in priorities or workforce realignment would entail a  change where funds are requested in budget justification materials. In  another example, the U.S. Special Operations Command noted that it  uses a requirements approval system to evaluate requirements,  eliminate redundancies, and identify activities to be insourced.

With the exception of the Army,  DOD\u2019s overall progress to date can be characterized as a series of  incremental, ad hoc steps, often taken in response to congressional  direction. Over the past 18 months, DOD has been able to reach internal  agreement on a way forward to collect contractor manpower data directly  from contractors and has taken certain tangible steps toward this goal,  such as by requiring components to begin modifying more than 270,000  contracts and task orders and to require new contracts to include  provisions to require contractors to report direct labor hours, the types of  functions being performed, and other information into interim CMRA  systems. Nevertheless, it will be at least another year before DOD may  have a department-wide eCMRA system in place to collect inventory  data, such as manpower data directly from contractors and 2 more years,  at the earliest, until it may have all components in compliance with  inventory reporting requirements. Further, there are a number of  challenges and unresolved issues that require continued management  attention. For example, while DOD indicates that it remains on track to  have a departmentwide data collection system in place in fiscal year  2014, the working group DOD established in January 2013 is still working  on key decisions related to security, funding, and other technological  issues and has not developed an implementation plan with anticipated  time frames and necessary resources to help ensure DOD remains on  track to meet its goals, as we recommended in 2011.", "Similarly, DOD\u2019s December 2011 guidance has helped ensure that most  components are reviewing their inventories. DOD also believes that the  certifications by components have provided it better insights into the  processes used and results of the reviews. Our review, however,  indicates that the certifications often did not address or provided only  limited information on the six elements that were called for by DOD\u2019s  December 2011 guidance. Most significantly, the letters were inconsistent  in describing the methodology used to identify and review the inventories,  the actions taken or planned to be taken by the military services to  address instances in which contractors were found to be performing  inherently governmental functions or unauthorized personal services, or  how these and other components were providing adequate government  oversight of contractors who were performing work closely associated  with inherently governmental functions. For example, the Army and Air  Force identified instances where contractors were performing inherently  governmental functions and unauthorized personal services, but did not  report whether they fully resolved these issues. Further, based on our  review of the certification letters, it is unclear the extent to which the  differences in the approaches used to conduct the reviews contributed to  the wide variation of instances identified with regard to contractors  performing work that is closely associated with inherently governmental  functions. For example, the Army identified over 44,000 contractor FTEs  performing work closely associated with inherently government functions,  while 13 components did not identify any instances where contractors  were performing these functions.", "Having the ability to identify and report instances of contractors  performing inherently governmental functions, unauthorized personal  services, or those closely associated with inherently governmental  functions is one of the key benefits that the inventory is to provide to  DOD, as it allows DOD to ensure contractors are performing appropriate  work and to decide on the appropriate course of action should the reviews  find that not to be the case. However, that value is significantly reduced if  decision-makers have no assurance on whether corrective action was  taken. DOD\u2019s February 2013 guidance that governs the fiscal year 2012  inventory review attempts to improve accountability of the funds allocated  to certain high risk functions and obtain better insight into the resolution of  instances where contractors are performing inherently governmental  functions or unauthorized personal services.
