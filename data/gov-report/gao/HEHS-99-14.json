They have also expressed concern about the possibility that the Navy may reduce or eliminate services in its hospital on Guam in the future. They believe that VA could better meet veterans\u2019 health care needs if VA established an inpatient facility at the U.S. Naval Hospital on Guam. Several years ago, the Navy studied whether a VA inpatient facility should be established at the U.S. Naval Hospital on Guam and concluded in a March 1996 report that the veteran inpatient workload at the hospital for fiscal years 1992 to 1995 was too low to support a VA inpatient facility.

We visited VA and Navy health care facilities on Guam and met with representatives of veterans organizations on Guam and with Government of Guam officials to discuss veterans\u2019 concerns with VA health care. We also projected the future veteran population and the possible demand for and use of inpatient health care through the year 2010. Further, we obtained VA estimates of the cost to construct, outfit, and staff a possible veterans\u2019 inpatient facility at the U.S. Naval Hospital. We estimated the facility\u2019s cost for ancillary, overhead, and other expenses as well as VA\u2019s cost to obtain future veterans\u2019 health care under its existing sharing agreement with the U.S. Naval Hospital on Guam.

The Navy analyzed VA inpatient admissions at the U.S. Naval Hospital from fiscal years 1992 through 1995 and determined that, on average, less than one VA beneficiary received inpatient care at the hospital each day. The Navy also found that these few patients were integrated into normal hospital operations and were cared for in the hospital location most appropriate to their medical condition.

We further met with Guam Memorial Hospital officials to discuss health care issues on Guam and the hospital\u2019s accreditation status.", "To assess VA\u2019s ability to meet our projected demand, we interviewed VA, DOD, Air Force, and Navy officials and reviewed DOD staffing estimates and U.S. Naval Hospital budget projections."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Estimating Future Demand for Health Care on Guam", "paragraphs": ["To determine Guam and CNMI veterans\u2019 possible demand for health care in the future, we estimated the current veteran population on Guam and CNMI and analyzed possible changes in level of veteran demand for care and patterns of inpatient utilization.", "We projected Guam\u2019s total veteran population to the year 2010 by adjusting 1990 Census data to reflect the aging of the current population since 1990 and recent and expected future separations from the military.We relied on survival data obtained from the Government of Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services and separation data obtained from VA\u2019s Office of Policy and Planning for this projection.", "To estimate how much VA inpatient care veterans on Guam and CNMI could potentially require over the next decade, we developed two different health care demand scenarios, based on actual low and high veteran inpatient utilization rates within the VA system. These scenarios represent a range of potential demand and are not intended to predict a specific future demand. We then used VA\u2019s inpatient planning model and Puerto Rico and Guam current veteran inpatient utilization rates (patient treated rates and average lengths of stay) to compute total bed days of care and inpatient bed requirements for both the low- and high-demand scenarios.Both scenarios age the veteran population through the year 2010 and provide for the same type of hospital beds (medical, surgical, and intensive care) that are currently available at the U.S. Naval Hospital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimating the Cost of a VA Inpatient Facility", "paragraphs": ["To estimate the cost of a VA inpatient facility at the U.S. Naval Hospital on Guam, VA prepared two cost estimates for a 14-bed VA inpatient facility within the U.S. Naval Hospital on Guam\u2014one estimate was for renovating the existing space, the other was for new construction. These estimates provided 10 medical or surgical beds and four intensive care beds, all fully outfitted and within 11,588 square feet (VA\u2019s space planning criteria). VA officials adjusted its renovation and construction cost estimates to reflect that construction on Guam is twice as expensive as in the continental United States.", "Annual operating costs for either VA inpatient facility would consist of staffing; ancillary services; other expenses, such as laundry and food service; housekeeping, maintenance, and utilities; and overhead. VISN-21 estimated staffing costs for 27 VA staff, including 4 physicians. We estimated ancillary and other expenses using the U.S. Naval Hospital average costs per bed day of care in 1997 multiplied by the projected number of VA inpatient bed days of care for 2010. We also estimated housekeeping, maintenance, and utilities based on the U.S. Naval Hospital costs per square foot multiplied by the square footage of the proposed VA facility. We included overhead costs equal to 10 percent of total operating costs. Both a VA and a Naval Hospital official reviewed the methodologies we used to estimate ancillary and other costs and concluded that the approaches would result in a conservative estimate of the potential costs.", "Last, we computed the cost to obtain inpatient care required by the projected high- and low-demand scenarios under the existing VA and DOD sharing agreement at the U.S. Naval Hospital. Our estimate was derived by calculating a 3-year historical average cost per veteran admission at the U.S. Naval Hospital by age category. The resulting historical average cost by age group was then applied to the high- and low-demand veteran admissions by age group in 2010.", "VA and Navy officials reviewed the estimated construction and staffing costs obtained from VA.
