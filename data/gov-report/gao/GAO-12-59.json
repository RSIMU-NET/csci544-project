In 2007,  IRS developed a preliminary cost estimate for budgetary purposes when  very little program information was available (referred to in this report as  the 2007 preliminary cost estimate). As shown in table 1, in 2007, IRDM  system development was estimated to cost about $5 million in fiscal year  2009 and about $23 million per year thereafter. In 2009, EPO developed  a solution concept-based estimate (SCBE, referred to in this report as the  2009 SCBE), which was more rigorous than the 2007 preliminary  estimate. The 2009 SCBE was developed before program implementation  began, when MITS had more information than it did in 2007, but system  design plans were still under development. The 2009 SCBE was about  $36 million less through the first 4 years of the project than the 2007  preliminary estimate.", "IRS used the 2007 preliminary estimate to justify the initial IRDM budget.  According to a MITS official, the 2009 SCBE was not used for budgetary  purposes because program specifications were undergoing modification  in fiscal year 2010, requiring the full $23-million per-year funding. For  example, in 2010, IRS made several changes to the complexity of the  IRDM program, which included dividing it into four projects. One of the  projects required restructuring as a separate development effort, using  different resources and technologies. Changes also necessitated using  new software development methods not previously used within IRS, and  additional contracting support. According to MITS officials, such changes  increased IRDM funding needs above the amounts supported by the  2009 SCBE. As a result, IRS did not revise its initial funding request for  future fiscal years using the SCBE and instead relied on the 2007  preliminary estimate.", "From fiscal years 2009 through 2011, IRS received about $52 million in  total funding for IRDM, of which the IRS had spent $46 million (when  accounting for $2.6 million carried over from fiscal year 2009 funds and  $5.8 million carried over from fiscal year 2010), through fiscal year 2011,  as shown in table 2.", "In our May 2011 report,the most rigorous IRDM cost estimate available at the time and the 2007  preliminary estimate lacked documentation for a complete review.

In response to our report, IRS said it would  update the 2009 SCBE.

Furthermore, although IRS officials cited the WBS as the basis for cost  projections, we found no evidence linking the WBS to cost. Multiple  documents linked software and hardware specifications to cost, but they  did not provide consistent cost information. As a best practice,  documentation should describe the source data used, the estimating  methodology, and show step-by-step how the estimate was developed.

IRS officials said  the discrepancies occurred because the spend plans were developed  using more recent cost information for software purchases that were not  included in the supporting documentation. Additionally, the estimate does  not list any confidence levels or provide a range of possible costs.  According to best practices, unless an estimate is based on an  assessment of the most likely costs and reflects the degree of uncertainty  given all of the risks considered, management will not be able to make  informed decisions. IRDM uses EVM to identify variances between  planned and actual costs, but as discussed below, we found IRDM\u2019s EVM  data to be unreliable, and there was no evidence that IRS uses actual  cost data to evaluate whether cost projections are realistic.", "The estimate does not meet best practices for a credible cost estimate, as  shown in figure 4. For example, the estimate was not crosschecked or  assessed for risk and uncertainty. According to best practices, an  estimate without risk and uncertainty analysis can be unrealistic  because it does not assess how the cost estimate would be affected if, for  example, the schedule slipped, the mission changed, or a proposed  solution did not meet users\u2019 needs.

Further, there is no evidence that another office  performed a separate cost estimate\u2014referred to as an independent cost  estimate\u2014to validate the 2011 cost estimate. In previous work we found  that because of limited resources, IRS generally only does an additional  independent cost estimate for its largest programs, and according to  officials, IRDM is not considered a large enough program in terms of its  funding level.

The IRDM  program office\u2014which does not use the same software or modeling  techniques as EPO\u2014relied on spend plans, EVM, and other documents  to estimate costs. In July 2011, MITS officials said that it would take 90  days for IRDM and EPO staff to complete a new cost estimate for IRDM.

IRDM was not required  to do so because MITS guidance, as of September 2011, does not  require project teams to consult with EPO when updating a cost estimate.  Without EPO involvement, IRS has less assurance that cost estimate  updates will follow best practices.

However, MITS\u2019s Estimation Procedures document, which  provides cost estimation guidance to project teams, suggests some cost  and schedule variance and project size thresholds that, if exceeded,  should cause project managers to contact EPO for an updated estimate.

Further, a project\u2019s schedule,  cost estimate, and EVM system should be based on the same WBS,  according to our cost guide. The WBSs used in IRDM\u2019s schedules do  not match the WBS used for EVM. The WBSs in four of the five IRDM  schedules reflect detailed project-level tasks, while the WBS used for  the EVM data is only broken down by contractor and government  efforts, and does not include any project-level data. The WBS used to  inform the 2011 IRDM cost estimate was not broken down by  contractor or government data, and it did not provide costs for detailed  tasks. Without a WBS, from which to measure progress and to serve  as a consistent framework for the schedules and EVM, there is no  basis for reliable EVM data, according to our cost guide. An IRS  official said that the WBS in the IRDM schedules is not the primary  source of financial information for IRDM. Instead, officials use IRS\u2019s  financial tracking system, which is much less detailed than the  schedules\u2019 WBS, to obtain project level data for EVM. This technique  for gathering EVM data at a project level is contrary to the purpose of  EVM, which is to integrate cost, schedule, and technical data from  detailed work packages that can be monitored for variances against  the original plan. Since a resource-loaded schedule forms the  foundation for the EVM baseline, both the schedule and the EVM data  should be based on the same WBS, according to our cost guide.Because the financial tracking system only provides project level data,  and financial information cannot be traced to the WBS elements in the  schedules, the cost associated with the project tasks is unknown.", "Sequencing: This ANSI guideline states that projects should have a  schedule that describes the sequence of work\u2014that is, a list of  activities in the order in which they are to be carried out\u2014and  identifies significant task interdependencies required to meet project  requirements. All of the IRDM schedules had significant problems with  sequencing. For example, many predecessor and successor tasks  were not linked to one another, which are necessary for properly  sequencing work so that the schedule will update in response to  changes. Because the schedule is missing so many of these \u201clogic  links,\u201d it will not automatically recalculate forecasted start and finish  dates of remaining activities. Thus, any activities that are late will not  automatically recalculate the dates for affected successor activities.  IRS officials said they are aware of some issues with missing links. As  a result of these missing links in all of the IRDM schedules we  reviewed, IRDM\u2019s schedules are not reliable. Because the schedules  form the basis for the performance measurement baseline used to  track cost and schedule variances in an EVM system, the data from  the IRDM EVM system are not reliable.", "Time-phased budget baseline: This ANSI guideline states that a  program should establish and maintain a time-phased budget  baseline, at the control account level, against which performance  can be measured.

IRS was  unable to show evidence that it has established and maintained a  time-phased budget baseline for IRDM.

However, we could not identify these links in our  analysis. IRS officials said the resource-loaded schedules do not show all  project resources because some resources, such as contractor personnel  being used across projects, are used in more than one IRDM project.

Using a WBS that is developed using best practices from  our cost guide could provide a baseline from which to measure progress,  a key component to an EVM system. Similarly, developing a single  integrated schedule for IRDM, that contains all resources needed to  implement the program, could provide more meaningful EVM data.

Require project managers to consult with EPO to determine if projects  could benefit from EPO assistance in updating cost estimates for  programs that exceed thresholds recommended by MITS\u2019s Estimation  Procedures document. For those projects where EPO does not  update the cost estimate, IRS should require that the decision and  rationale be documented. EPO should use the information from  updated cost estimates to develop a historical repository of cost  estimation data.  3.  Review all guidance applicable to cost estimates and take steps to  ensure that they are consistent. As a first step, IRS guidance should  require the use of current and reliable project cost estimates to inform  budget requests, in accordance with the Estimator\u2019s Reference Guide.  4.   Improve the reliability of IRDM\u2019s EVM data, specifically: address WBS issues by developing an EVM baseline for IRDM  that reflects the same WBS as the detailed schedule and IRDM  cost estimate; address sequencing issues and enable the development of a time- phased budget baseline by creating a single integrated master  schedule for IRDM that is properly sequenced and resource- loaded so that effective and meaningful EVM data can be  obtained to better manage the program;  conduct an independent baseline validation for the IRDM EVM  baseline; and  conduct independent surveillance of EVM systems to ensure that  data are reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue for his review and comment.

IRS provided us  with additional comments, which are summarized below. In addition, the  agency provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the  report as appropriate. IRS agreed with one of our four recommendations,  partially agreed with another, and disagreed with two.", "While IRS\u2019s comment letter did not address the recommendation, the  Director of Risk Management in MITS\u2019s Strategy and Planning Office told  us the agency agrees with the recommendation to require certain IT  project managers to consult with EPO about updating cost estimates,  documenting decisions not to update cost estimates, and placing data  from updated cost estimates in a repository.  Similarly, IRS\u2019s comment  letter did not address our recommendation to ensure that its cost  estimation guidance is consistent. However, IRS officials said they  partially agree with this recommendation and have taken steps to ensure  that their estimation practices and procedures follow consistent,  documented guidance. They noted that in all instances, however, IRS IT  cost estimates will be based on the best information available at the time  the estimate is requested or required as opposed to our recommendation  that IRS require the use of current and reliable cost estimates to inform all  budget requests. We note in our report that using an unreliable cost  estimate could lead to budget requests that do not accurately reflect  program funding needs. Once done in conformance with guidance and  best practices, current and reliable cost estimates can be maintained  through normal required monitoring and cost tracking procedures, unless  significant changes in project circumstances warrant updating the cost  estimate.", "IRS disagreed with our recommendation to ensure that the IRDM life- cycle cost estimate is reliable and that budget requests are justified by a  reliable cost estimate that follows best practices.  In its comment letter,  IRS wrote that implementing the recommendation would require it to  spend resources that do not directly contribute to the successful  implementation of the IRDM program, and that the IRDM program is  within its budget and schedule. At the end of fiscal year 2011, IRDM was  under budget by more than 18 percent and behind schedule by almost 13  percent, equal to over 4 months behind schedule, according to IRDM\u2019s  EVM data. Because the IRDM program does not have a reliable cost  estimate, budget authorities do not have reliable information to determine  an appropriate funding level. Such variances indicate that the current  funding level may not be appropriate. As we reported, IRS estimated in  July 2011 that it would take about 90 days, comprising 8 staff months (or  a direct staff cost likely less than $200,000, according to our calculations  using a top government salary rate and general benefits rate), to  complete a new cost estimate for IRDM.  While we agree that federal  resources are tight, we believe that such an investment could produce  benefits that not only improve the reliability of the IRDM cost estimate, but  also better ensure that IRS requests the correct amount of resources to  ensure IRDM fully achieves successful implementation.  Further, benefits  of a new estimate would also stretch beyond that program and provide an  important foundation for improving IRS cost estimates in general. The  OMB Capital Programming Guide directs agencies to develop sound cost  estimates based on our cost guide and states that during the budget  process, the credibility of the costs will be examined, and OMB and the  Congress will hold agencies accountable for meeting the schedule and  performance goals within the cost estimates. More reliable cost estimates  enable Congress and other budget authorities to make more complete  and informed decisions.", "IRS also disagreed with our recommendation to improve the reliability of  EVM data, and stated that OMB\u2019s revisions to Circular A-11 remove EVM  system requirements due to negative cost benefit.  We disagree with IRS,  as Circular A-11, Appendix J and the Capital Programming Guide still  contain language that directs agencies to use EVM for major projects.  Former Circular A-11, section 300.7, instructed agencies to use EVM  system requirements to identify areas where problems are occurring  when reporting on ongoing investments. While current guidance for  Exhibit 300 no longer explicitly discusses EVM reporting on ongoing  investments under section 300.7, other sections of the guidance still  direct the use of EVM for managing IT capital assets and state that in  general cost, schedule and performance goals are to be controlled and  monitored by using an EVM system.  Moreover, our report assessed the  reliability of IRDM\u2019s EVM data because the data were included in IRDM\u2019s  2011 cost estimate and the data are used to track the program\u2019s  progress.
