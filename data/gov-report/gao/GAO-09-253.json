As requested, GAO assessed issues related to the E-rate program's long-term goals, including (1) key trends in the demand for and use of E-rate funding and the implications of these trends; (2) the rate of program participation, participants' views on requirements, and FCC's actions to facilitate participation; and (3) FCC's performance goals and measures for the program and how they compare to key characteristics of successful goals and measures. To perform this work, GAO analyzed data going back to the first year of the program, surveyed a sample of participating schools and libraries, reviewed agency documents, and interviewed agency officials and program stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Requests for E-rate funding consistently exceed the annual funding cap, and increased commitments for telecommunications and Internet services, combined with significant undisbursed funds, limit funding for wiring and components needed for data transmission. Although still exceeding available funds, total amounts requested have generally declined since 2002, largely due to declining requests for wiring and components. Funding commitments in recent years reflect this trend, with the amount of funding for wiring and components outweighed by funding for telecommunications services and Internet access. In addition, a significant amount of committed funds are not disbursed to program participants; for commitments made in 1998 through 2006, about one-quarter of the funds have not been disbursed. Unused funds are reallocated for use in future years but are still problematic because they preclude other applicants from being funded. Participation rates and participants' views on program requirements indicate difficulties in the E-rate application process, which FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)--the program's administrator--are taking steps to address. The participation rate among the more than 150,000 eligible schools and libraries is about 63 percent, but participation rates among groups vary, from 83 percent among public schools to 13 percent among private schools. According to nonparticipants, a key circumstance influencing nonparticipation is the complexity of program requirements, even though participants reported that participation is becoming easier. Still, E-rate program data show that some funding is denied because applicants do not correctly carry out application procedures. In recent years, FCC and USAC have made changes intended to ease the process of participation for schools and libraries, such as giving applicants an opportunity to correct clerical errors in their applications. FCC officials said they will consider further changes to facilitate participation, but their primary interest is in protecting funds from improper use. FCC does not have performance goals for the E-rate program, and its performance measures are inadequate. In 1998, GAO first recommended that FCC develop specific performance goals and measures for the E-rate program in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. FCC set forth specific goals and measures for some of the intervening years, but it does not currently have performance goals in place. Further, the performance measures it adopted in 2007 lack key characteristics of successful performance measures, such as being tied to program goals. Performance goals and measures are particularly important for the E-rate program, as they could help FCC make well-informed decisions about how to address trends in request for and use of funds. Without them, FCC is limited in its ability to efficiently identify and address problems with the E-rate program and better target funding to highest-priority uses. FCC's piecemeal approach to performance goals and measures indicates a lack of a strategic vision for the program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) Schools and Libraries  Universal Service Support Mechanism is a significant source of federal  support for technology funding for schools and libraries, providing about  $2 billion each year to help eligible entities procure telecommunications  and Internet services\u2014including the installation of wiring and components  needed to transmit data. \u201cUniversal service\u201d traditionally has meant  providing residential customers with affordable nationwide access to  basic telephone service. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded  the concept of universal service to include assistance to schools and  libraries for the acquisition of telecommunications and Internet services.  Created in 1997 pursuant to Section 254(h) of the act, the Schools and  Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism\u2014also commonly referred  to as the E-rate program\u2014is similar to a grant program in that schools and  libraries apply annually for support and, if approved, receive discounts for  eligible services actually received. FCC designated a not-for-profit  corporation, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) to  carry out the day-to-day operations of the program and capped the amount  of funding provided by the program at $2.25 billion a year. From 1998\u2014 the first funding year of the program\u2014to 2007, USAC made funding  commitments of nearly $22 billion to schools and libraries across the  country to help pay telephone bills and Internet access fees, and to install  network wiring and components. In the years since the program was  established, schools and school districts have come to rely heavily on  telecommunications networks to deliver educational content and to  administer student achievement tests. Public-access computer terminals in  libraries, particularly those in economically disadvantaged and insular  areas, are in high demand as the Internet becomes more integral to  obtaining government services and participating in commerce. At the same  time, FCC is re-evaluating the purpose, management, and structure of the  Universal Service Fund (USF) and its support programs\u2014including E- rate. The issues FCC is examining include whether USAC is administering  the USF in an effective, efficient, and competitively neutral manner; what  types of performance measures are appropriate for the universal service  support programs; how to strengthen oversight of the USF and its support  programs; and how to improve the support program\u2019s application  processes and reduce the administrative burden on applicants while still  maintaining sufficient control over funds.", "In the interest of assessing certain fundamental issues related to the E-rate  program\u2019s long-term goals and determining whether FCC has the  information it needs to properly manage the program and to use its  resources efficiently, we were asked to address the following questions:    What are key trends in the demand for and use of E-rate funding and  what are the implications of these trends?", "To what extent do eligible entities apply for E-rate funds, how well do  applicants navigate the E-rate program\u2019s requirements, and what steps  is FCC taking to facilitate program participation?", "What are FCC\u2019s performance goals and measures for the E-rate  program, and how do they compare to key characteristics of successful  goals and measures?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed data from USAC on applications,  funding commitments, and disbursements for the first 10 years of the E-rate  program. We obtained from the Department of Education\u2019s National Center  for Education Statistics the most recent complete listings of public schools,  private schools, and libraries, and compared these listings to the entities that  applied for E-rate funding during a comparable time period. We used this  comparison as a basis to determine the rates at which eligible entities  participated in the E-rate program and characteristics of participants and  nonparticipants. We determined that the data obtained from USAC and the  Department of Education were sufficiently reliable for the purposes specified.  We interviewed six nonparticipants chosen on the basis of their entity type\u2014 public school, private school, or library\u2014and whether they were located in a  rural or urban area to obtain anecdotal information on reasons eligible  entities do not apply for support. We conducted a Web-based survey of 697  beneficiaries selected by drawing a stratified, random sample from about  31,000 applications for funding year 2006 to obtain their views on program  requirements and how to improve the program, among other things. This  report does not contain all of the results from the survey; the survey and a  more complete tabulation of the results, as well as detailed statistics on the  results of our participation analysis, can be viewed at GAO-09-254SP. We  reviewed FCC documentation on the agency\u2019s performance goals and  measures for the E-rate program and compared this information with  literature on results-oriented management and effective practices for setting  performance goals and measures. We interviewed officials from FCC\u2019s Office  of Managing Director, Office of Inspector General, and Wireline Competition  Bureau to identify actions undertaken to address previously identified  problems and plans to address issues of concern in the program; officials  from USAC\u2019s Schools and Libraries Division, Office of General Counsel, and  Office of Finance to collect information on program operations and USAC\u2019s  actions to implement prior FCC orders on E-rate; and representatives of E- rate stakeholder groups.

We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sets forth the nation\u2019s goals for  providing affordable telecommunications services to consumers  nationwide, particularly to populations such as individuals living in rural,  isolated, or high-cost areas, or those with low incomes; schools and  libraries; and rural health care facilities. The act instructed FCC to  establish a universal service support mechanism to ensure that eligible  schools and libraries have affordable access to and use of certain  telecommunications services for educational purposes. In addition,  Congress authorized FCC to \u201cestablish competitively neutral rules to  enhance, to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable,  access to advanced telecommunications and information services for all  public and nonprofit elementary and secondary school classrooms . . . and  libraries. . . .\u201d Based on this direction, and following the recommendations  of the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, FCC established  the Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism,  commonly referred to as the E-rate program. FCC designated USAC to  carry out the day-to-day activities of the program, which is funded from  statutorily mandated payments to the Universal Service Fund. FCC  oversees USAC and the program through rule-making proceedings,  enforcement actions, audits of participants, and reviews of funding  decision appeals from participants. FCC also reviews USAC\u2019s procedures,  including its process for reviewing applications for funding; meets  frequently with USAC staff; and provides guidance letters to USAC. A  memorandum of understanding between FCC and USAC, first executed in  June 2007 and updated in September 2008, as well as FCC orders and  rules, set forth the roles and responsibilities of the two parties in the  management, oversight, and administration of the program.", "The E-rate program provides schools, school districts, libraries, and  consortia with discounts on telecommunications services, Internet  access, and data transmission wiring and components used for  educational purposes\u2014that is, activities that are integral, immediate, or  proximate to the education of students or to the provision of services to  library patrons, such as activities that occur on library or school  property. Based on indicators of need, eligible schools and libraries  qualify for a discount of 20 percent to 90 percent on the cost of services  and must show that they can pay for the undiscounted portion of services.  Indicators of need include the percentage of students eligible for free or  reduced-price lunches through the National School Lunch Program and  whether the entity is located in a rural area. Table 1 shows the discount  percentages entities are eligible for based on these indicators. Eligible  entities may apply annually for program support.", "Based on the broad direction in the act, FCC defined two general types of  services that are eligible for E-rate discounts:    Priority 1 services, which include telecommunications services, such as  local, long-distance, and wireless (e.g., cellular) telephone services, as  well as data links (e.g., T-1 lines) and Internet access services, such as  Web hosting and e-mail services\u2014all of which receive priority for  funding under FCC\u2019s rules; and    Priority 2 services, which include cabling, components, routers,  switches, and network servers that are necessary to transport  information to individual classrooms, public rooms in a library, or  eligible administrative areas, as well as basic maintenance of internal  connections, such as the repair and upkeep of eligible hardware and  basic technical support.", "Lists of specific eligible services, including the conditions under which  they are eligible, are updated annually by USAC, finalized by FCC after a  public comment period, and posted on USAC\u2019s Web site. Items ineligible  for E-rate discounts include, among other things, end-user products and  services such as Internet content, Web site content maintenance fees, end- user personal computers, and end-user software.", "All eligible and properly completed requests for Priority 1 services are  funded up to the available amount of funding. Priority 2 services, herein  referred to as internal connections, are funded with what remains after  commitments have been made for all approved requests for Priority 1  services in a given year. Requests for internal connections services are  prioritized by the discount level of the applicant, with funding going first  to applicants with the highest discount level\u201490 percent\u2014and then to  applicants at each descending discount level until the funding is  exhausted; in 2007, for example, internal connections funding was  provided to applicants with discount levels down to 81 percent. Because  of this prioritization, available funding may be exhausted before all eligible  and properly completed requests for internal connections are funded.  According to FCC, the rules of priority equitably provide the greatest  assurance of support to schools and libraries with the greatest level of  economic disadvantage. The rules ensure that all applicants filing during a  time period specified by USAC receive at least some support in the event  that the amounts requested for support exceed the total support available  in a funding year.", "The steps applicants must carry out to obtain program support\u2014including  the application, review, invoicing, and reimbursement processes\u2014are  illustrated in figure 1. This figure is followed by a more detailed  description of each of these steps.", "Prior to submitting an application for E-rate support, an applicant must  complete several steps, including the following:    Prepare a technology plan. The applicant conducts a technology  assessment and develops a technology plan to ensure that any services  it obtains will be used effectively and that it can provide for the  nondiscounted portion of services as well as for the goods or services  that are ineligible for E-rate funding.", "Open competitive bidding. The applicant identifies products and  services needed to implement its technology plan and submits a form  to USAC describing the desired products and services. USAC posts  completed forms on its Web site so that service providers can view and  consider bidding on these requests. To participate in the E-rate  program, service providers must obtain identification numbers from  USAC and certify compliance with program rules in each year that they  provide services under the program.", "Select a service provider and enter into a service agreement. At least  28 days after the applicant\u2019s description of requested services is posted  to USAC\u2019s Web site, an applicant may enter into an agreement with a  provider of eligible services.", "After completing these steps, the applicant submits its application for  program support to USAC. USAC accepts applications during a filing  window, the exact dates for which change somewhat each year but are  generally from November to Feburary. The information the applicant  provides on this form, includes, but is not limited to, the following:  the discount percentage to which the applicant is entitled, calculated  using a worksheet provided on the application;    detailed information about each requested service or product and its  cost\u2014some services have both eligible and ineligible components, in  which case the applicant must calculate the portion of the service  eligible for an E-rate discount, a process referred to as cost allocation;  and    certifications that, among other things, the applicant has adequately  budgeted for the undiscounted portion of services, as well as related  ineligible services\u2014such as computers, training, software, and  electrical capacity\u2014needed to make effective use of the services  ordered.", "USAC reviews requests for funding to determine whether applicants have  properly complied with program rules and requirements; this process is  known as the program integrity assurance (PIA) review. Reviewers may  ask applicants to submit additional information, such as verification of a  contract award date or enrollment and income data for newly constructed  schools. Some applications undergo \u201cselective\u201d reviews, which require  more detailed documentation that the applicant has complied with the  rules. Applicants are chosen for selective review based on defined criteria  to test compliance with specific FCC rules. Additionally, applicants that  fail selective review in a given year must go through selective review the  following year.", "Based on the outcome of the application review, USAC issues funding  commitment decision letters stating how much funding the applicant may  receive based on eligible services provided within the funding year  deadlines. Funding commitments are conditional upon applicants meeting  additional requirements as described later. Funding commitments may be  for the full amount requested or less than the amount requested, or  funding may be denied entirely for reasons such as competitive bidding  violations or requests for ineligible services. Funding requests for Priority  2 services may also be denied if the applicant\u2019s discount percentage falls  below the annual discount percentage threshold for internal connections.", "After eligible services have been delivered, service providers or applicants  submit invoices to USAC to request reimbursement for the discounted  portion of services. Before seeking reimbursement for the discounted  portion of services from USAC, applicants must confirm (1) that the  services are planned to be or are being provided; (2) approval of their  technology plans by a state or other authorized body, if required; and (3)  compliance with the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) and the  Neighborhood Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act, if required. Under these  acts, if required, schools and libraries receiving support for Internet  access, internal connections, or basic maintenance must certify that they  have in place certain Internet safety policies and technology protection  measures. Funding requests for telecommunications services do not  require certification of CIPA compliance. Service providers may apply the  discount rate to the applicant\u2019s bill before sending it to the applicant, in  which case the applicant pays only the nondiscounted portion and the  service provider invoices USAC directly to obtain reimbursement.  Alternatively, applicants may pay for services in full and submit a form to  USAC to request reimbursement. Regardless of which invoicing method is  used, USAC reviews the invoices and disburses payments for universal  service support to service providers; under the latter method, service  providers remit the discounted amount to the applicant. To ensure  compliance with FCC rules, both USAC and FCC\u2019s Office of Inspector  General periodically select a sample of participants to audit and conduct  site visits of beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requests for E-rate Funding Consistently Exceed the Cap, and Increased Commitments for Priority 1 Services, Combined with Significant Undisbursed Funds, Limit Funding for Priority 2 Services", "paragraphs": ["Each year from 1998 through 2007, the amount of funding applicants  requested exceeded the amount available, but the amounts requested have  generally declined since 2002, with most of the decline driven by fewer  requests for Priority 2 services\u2014the wiring and components needed for  data transmission. Although requests for Priority 1 services\u2014that is,  telecommunications and Internet access\u2014have remained roughly level  since 2002, commitments have increased, at least in part, because  applicants received a greater proportion of the funds they requested. The  increasing amounts committed for Priority 1 services has the effect of  decreasing the amounts available for Priority 2 services, which are funded  only after all eligible Priority 1 services requests are satisfied. Regarding  disbursements, a significant proportion of committed funds are not paid  out to beneficiaries. Funding that is not disbursed in the year for which it  was committed is carried over to the next funding year and made available  for new commitments, but undisbursed funding is still problematic  because it prevents some applicants from receiving funding in a given  year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Requests Consistently Outweigh Available Funding", "paragraphs": ["From 1998 through 2007, applicants requested a total of about $41 billion  in E-rate funding\u2014174 percent of the $23.4 billion in program funding  available during that time. Further, in each of these years, the amounts  requested exceeded the amounts available. However, the amounts  requested have generally declined since 2002. Figure 2 shows the annual  funding levels and the amount of E-rate funding requested for Priority 1  services and Priority 2 services for each year from 1998 through 2007.", "Since 2002, the number of applicants and the amounts requested for  Priority 1 services have been stable. As figure 3 shows, the number of  applicants for telecommunications services has been generally stable since  1998, and the number of applicants for Internet access, after showing an  increase the first few years of the program, has been roughly level since  2002. From 2002 through 2007, the amounts requested for Priority 1  services have also been relatively stable.", "In contrast, the number of applicants and amounts requested for Priority 2  services have declined for the past several years, accounting for most of  the decline in the overall amount of funding requested. The amount of  funding requested for Priority 2 services declined 50 percent from 2002  through 2007. (See fig. 4.) The ratio of funding requested for Priority 2  services to that requested for Priority 1 services has also shifted  significantly. From 1998 through 2002, funding for Priority 2 services was  sought at a rate of 2.3 to 1 over funding for Priority 1 services, while from  2003 through 2007, this ratio was 1.4 to 1.", "The following factors may help explain the decrease in requests for  Priority 2 services (internal connections).", "In 1999, the second funding year, Priority 2 requests were funded down  to the 20 percent discount level, which means that all eligible requests  could be funded. As a result, according to USAC, many entities with  lower discounts applied the following years, hoping that the Priority 2  cutoff point would be similarly low; this is consistent with the dramatic  increase in the number of applicants and amount requested in 2000. But  the cutoff point in the following 3 years was in the 80 percent range,  and, as a result, according to USAC officials, there was a gradual drop- off in Priority 2 requests from entities with lower discounts. According  to FCC, entities with low discount levels stopped applying for Priority 2  funding because they knew that their requests would not receive  funding.", "A second factor is an FCC rule implemented in 2005 that limited  applicants\u2019 receipt of Priority 2 funding to 2 out of every 5 years,  reducing the number of applicants for these services in a given year.  FCC adopted this rule in order to make funding for internal  connections available to more eligible schools and libraries on a  regular basis.", "The emphasis on Priority 1 services is likely to continue, according to our  analysis of survey responses on future information technology goals. We  asked respondents about a number of goals related to telephone and  Internet connectivity and equipment needed to make use of such  connectivity; items in the survey included both those eligible for E-rate  discounts and those not eligible.  Our analysis of responses to this  question shows that participants are somewhat more focused on goals  related to maintaining existing information technology services than on  those related to adding new capabilities. For instance, we estimate that  providing telephone services is a goal for 96 percent of participants and  providing access to the Internet is a goal for 91 percent to 94 percent of  participants; in contrast, installing or upgrading wiring and components  needed for Internet or network access is a goal for 73 percent to 74  percent of participants. Similarly, when we asked what participants\u2019  highest-priority information technology goals were, the E-rate-eligible  expenses cited most often were providing (1) telephone services, (2)  additional bandwidth to locations already equipped with Internet access,  and (3) Internet access for student or library patron use. According to our  analysis of survey responses, the highest-priority goal of participants is  increasing the number of or replacing existing computers for student or  library patron use but the E-rate program does not cover either.", "While the E-rate program\u2019s statutory purpose is to help schools and  libraries obtain advanced telecommunication services, it is not clear  whether the growing emphasis on Priority 1 services and the  corresponding decline in emphasis on Priority 2 services represent the  most efficient and effective use of the program resources. As the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) noted in a 2005 assessment of the E- rate program, given the increase in schools\u2019 and libraries\u2019 level of Internet  connectivity, it is no longer clear that the program serves an existing  need. Similarly, it is difficult to determine whether the program\u2019s funding  structure\u2014including the priority rules and the discount matrix, which  contributes to the trends in funding\u2014is the best way to distribute funding  in a manner consistent with the program\u2019s intent. As we discuss below,  FCC does not have specific, outcome-oriented performance goals or long- term goals for the program, and therefore the agency does not have a basis  on which to determine whether the growing emphasis on Priority 1  services is appropriate. FCC\u2019s rule-making proceeding on universal service  reform, which is discussed in more detail in the following section, has  been ongoing since 2005, but FCC has not made a determination\u2014either  as part of this proceeding or otherwise\u2014as to what changes, if any, should  be made to the overall structure of the program to better achieve the goals  of the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Commitments for Priority 1 Services Leave Less Funding for Priority 2 Services", "paragraphs": ["Similar to the trend in funding requests, funding commitments also show a  growing emphasis on Priority 1 services. During the first years of the  program, more funding was committed for Priority 2 services than for  Priority 1 services, but this trend reversed in 2004 and continued through  2007, as figure 5 shows. Although commitments for Priority 2 services  increased in 2007, they were outweighed by commitments for Priority 1  services by 64 percent.", "From 1999 through 2007, the amounts committed annually for  telecommunications services increased each year for a total increase of 79  percent, and the amounts committed annually for Internet access nearly  doubled. The increase in amounts committed for Priority 1 services is a  result of individual applicants receiving a greater proportion of the funding  they request, and not a result of an increasing number of requests because,  as noted earlier, the number of requests for these services has not been  growing at a substantial rate. As figure 6 shows, the proportion of  requested funding that applicants receive as a commitment has been  increasing, with about half of applicants receiving 75 percent or more of  the amount they requested in 2000 and almost 80 percent of applicants  receiving 75 percent or more in 2007.", "In addition to the proportion of dollars committed in each of these service  categories, the proportion of participants that receive commitments in  these categories is important, particularly when considering whether  funds are being targeted appropriately. Based on our survey, we estimate  that 99 percent of participants have used E-rate to pay for telephone  services, and around 75 percent have used E-rate to pay for access to the  Internet, whereas 36 percent to 38 percent of participants have used E-rate  to install or upgrade wired internal connections and 20 percent to 24  percent have used it to install or upgrade wireless internal connections.  USAC stated that it is likely that the lower usage levels for internal  connections are due to the inherent limitations that the funding cap places  on access to Priority 2 funding.", "The increasing success of applicants requesting Priority 1 services has  implications for the amount of funding available in future years for  Priority 2 services and, accordingly, for how FCC manages the E-rate  program and whether the program\u2019s existing structure is still suitable to  best meet the current technology needs of schools and libraries. From  2002 through 2007, requests for Priority 1 services averaged 69 percent of  available funding; if a substantially higher proportion of such requests  had been funded, a smaller percentage of funding would have been  available for Priority 2 requests. As it was, from 1998 through 2007, after  eligible requests for Priority 1 services were satisfied, only about one- third of all requests for Priority 2 services were able to be funded.

Starting in 2003, funds that were not disbursed in a given year  were carried forward to subsequent years to be available for commitment,  thereby increasing the amount that could be committed beyond the $2.25  billion cap. The amount of committed funding not used includes $2.6  billion for Priority 1 services and $2.4 billion Priority 2 services. Figure 7  shows the percentage of committed funding that was disbursed in each  service category each year from 1998 through 2006.", "Underuse of committed funding is widespread among participants, but the  proportion of participants using a higher percentage of the funds  committed to them is rising. Thirty-five percent of participants in 2006  received disbursements for less than 75 percent of the funds that were  committed to them, including 9 percent that did not receive any  disbursement, but the percentage of participants receiving disbursements  for 75 percent or more of their committed funds increased each year from  2001 to 2006 (see fig. 8). Similarly, the proportion of participants that did  not receive any disbursement has been declining since 1999. Nonetheless,  the overall disbursement rate has not increased because applicants that  ultimately do not receive disbursements equal to their funding  commitment are receiving relatively larger commitments.", "For a number of reasons, participants may not use the full amount of their  funding commitment:", "Participants\u2019 expenditures are less than the amounts applied for.", "Applicants may overestimate costs for Priority 1 services, such as  telephone bills and Internet access charges, to ensure sufficient  funding for the year. Based on our survey, we found that lower-than- projected costs of Priority 1 services was a major reason for not using  all committed funds for an estimated 54 percent of participants and a  minor reason for an additional 20 percent of participants. State E-rate  officials we met with noted that there is no disincentive to \u201caim high\u201d in  the amount of funding requested. Additionally, some of these officials  told us that participants may have planned for Priority 2 services  projects or upgrades, but changes in their circumstances resulted in  project delays or cancellations. For example, in the time between  applying for funding and receiving the commitment decision, the local  funds needed for the project may no longer be available or the  construction of a new school, including the installation of network  wiring, could be delayed.", "Participants do not seek reimbursement for the full amount of E-rate  eligible expenses because of the complexity of paperwork and lack of  staff expertise. According to state E-rate officials we spoke with, bills  and invoices from service providers are complicated, and participants  do not always identify all items eligible for reimbursement in part  because it can be unclear which items are eligible and which are not,  particularly for Priority 1 services. Moreover, participants are  commonly dealing with multiple applications covering 2 or 3 funding  years at once. This complexity makes billing even more complicated  because it can be difficult to determine which year\u2019s funding  commitment is associated with which bill.", "In addition, school and library staff responsible for E-rate administrative  tasks face challenges associated with turnover and availability. Based on  our survey, we estimate that about one-quarter of the individuals at  schools and libraries responsible for E-rate-related tasks have 3 years or  less experience with the E-rate program.

Finally, USAC noted that some committed funds are also not  disbursed because when a service provider or beneficiary submits invoices  for payment, USAC may identify services or uses that are not eligible for  reimbursement.", "We reported in 2000 on the issue of undisbursed funds in the E-rate  program, recommending that FCC take steps to identify factors affecting  the rate at which funds are disbursed, and to address these factors. The  following actions were taken in response to this recommendation:    FCC and USAC agreed to commit funds above the $2.25 billion cap and  used this approach between August 2001 and September 2004. FCC  then determined that the Antideficiency Act applies to the Universal  Service Fund. Once this determination was made, funding  commitments were considered obligations for the purposes of the act,  and therefore USAC could no longer commit funds above the cap  without larger budgetary resources being made available.", "In 2003, FCC amended its rules to allow unused funds from prior  funding years to be carried forward on an annual basis and be available  for commitment the next funding year; previously, these funds were  used to reduce the amounts telecommunications companies were  required to pay into the Universal Service Fund. FCC has carried  forward funding several times since this change was made, including  $650 million in June 2007 and $600 million in June 2008.", "FCC implemented new policies to provide applicants with flexibilities  that were intended to facilitate the use of funds, such as the ability to  change service providers or modify the services originally requested.", "FCC and USAC established new deadlines for notification of the receipt  of services.", "Additionally, FCC required USAC to file quarterly estimates of unused  funds from prior funding years when it submits its projection of demand  for E-rate funds for the upcoming quarter. According to FCC, the estimates  are used solely to determine how much funding to carry over. Despite  these changes, the proportion of disbursed funds is now lower, on  average, than it was when we made the recommendation. The proportion  of committed funds that were disbursed from 1998 through 2000 averaged  79 percent but averaged only 72 percent annually from 2001 through 2006  (see fig. 9).", "Unused funding is problematic because it has the potential to reduce the  number of participants that will receive commitments for Priority 2  services in a given year, even when unused funds are carried over to  subsequent years. Because Priority 1 services always receive priority for  funding, commitments for Priority 2 services may or may not be made,  based on the level of commitments for first-priority services. Carrying over  unused funds may result in more funding for Priority 2 services requests,  but only if commitments for Priority 1 services remain stable or decline,  neither of which is the current trend. Thus, some applicants for Priority 2  services, who would receive funding if aggregate requests and  commitments were more consistent with actual disbursements, do not  receive funding in the current environment.", "We recently reported on the long-standing problem of unused funds in  federal grant programs, and although the E-rate program is not technically  a grant program, it has features in common with grant programs that make  some degree of comparison appropriate. Our report noted that unused  balances in expired grant accounts, which may be caused by poorly timed  communications with grantees, are noteworthy because they can hinder  the achievement of program objectives. We found that when agencies  made concerted efforts to address the problem, they were able to decrease  the amount of undisbursed funding in expired grant accounts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The E-rate Application Process Poses Difficulties for Some Entities, Which FCC and USAC Are Taking Steps to Address", "paragraphs": ["The overall participation rate among E-rate-eligible entities is about 63  percent, with public schools participating at a substantially higher rate  than private schools and libraries, based on 2005 data.

These circumstances may not be  applicable for all entities that do not participate, but they provide some  insight into issues that some nonparticipants are facing, particularly the  following:    Burdensome nature of program participation. Among the six  nonparticipants we spoke with and the comments we received from  survey respondents, the predominant reason for nonparticipation was  that the application process is too complex, takes too much time, or  requires too many resources. Four of the six nonparticipants we spoke  with\u2014two libraries and two public schools\u2014cited the difficult or  cumbersome nature of the application process as a reason for not  participating. Among 28 survey respondents who responded to an  open-ended question on reasons for nonparticipation, 5 stated that the  program is too complicated or difficult or that their staff did not have  enough time for the required tasks; another 4 stated that the amount of  time required to participate in the program was not worth the return.  Another 5 respondents said they intended to apply for funding but  missed an application deadline. Additionally, a 2007 survey of public  libraries by the American Library Association (ALA) estimated that 38  percent of libraries did not participate in E-rate because the application  process is too complicated.", "Internet filtering requirements. Public libraries may be reluctant to  participate in E-rate because of the requirement that recipients of  Internet access or Priority 2 funding install Internet content filters in  accordance with the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act. Both of the  nonparticipating libraries we spoke with cited this as a reason for  nonparticipation, and ALA, based on responses to its survey, estimates  that 34 percent of libraries do not apply for E-rate because of this  requirement. One library official we spoke with said that Internet filters  inhibit access to free and open communication. Additionally, according  to this official, if adult users want to access blocked information,  library workers have to take the time to manually turn filters off and  then back on, which creates an administrative burden.", "Inability to prove discount percentage. As discussed previously, the  primary mechanism participants use for calculating their discount rate  is student eligibility for the National School Lunch Program. However,  some private schools do not participate in this program and therefore  use an alternative FCC-approved method, such as surveying families of  children who attend the school to determine the family\u2019s income. One  nonparticipating private school we spoke with said it had been unable  to collect this information because families may consider the  information personal or sensitive and be reluctant to provide it.

Representatives of the National Association of Independent  Schools also noted the inability to prove discount percentages as one  of the main reasons why private schools do not participate in E-rate.", "FCC has been aware for some years that a portion of eligible entities do  not participate in the E-rate program. For example, in conducting research  for our December 2000 report on the E-rate program, we learned from  FCC officials that they had finalized a new performance plan for the E-rate  program that included tactical goals for increasing participation by urban  low-income school districts and rural school districts, as well as rural  libraries and libraries serving small areas, all of which had below-average  participation rates.

Of those who had been participating in the program since  that time, we estimate that 15 percent find the program more difficult, with  the remaining respondents evenly split between finding the program easier  and finding it to be about the same.

These program goals should in turn  be linked to the overall agency goals. However, the measures that FCC  has adopted are not based on such linkage because the agency does not  currently have performance goals for the E-rate program. By  establishing performance measures before establishing the specific  goals it seeks to achieve through the E-rate program, FCC may waste  valuable time and resources collecting the wrong data and,  consequently, not develop the most appropriate measures for results.", "Measures should address important aspects of program performan For each program goal, a few performance measures should be  selected that cover key performance dimensions and take different  priorities into account. For example, limiting measures to core  program activities enables managers and other stakeholders to as accomplishments, make decisions, realign processes, and assign  accountability without having an excess of data that could obscure  rather than clarify performance issues. Also, performance measures  should cover key governmentwide priorities\u2014such as quality,  timeliness, and customer satisfaction.

However, again, without first setting specific performance goals for the E-rate program, FCC cannot be sure it has adopted the  most appropriate performance measures.", "Measures should provide useful information for decision making.  Performance measures should provide managers with timely, action- oriented information in a format that helps them make decisions that  improve program performance.

However, the application-processing data are output, not  outcome, oriented, and the intended uses of the data do not include  such program-management activities as allocating resources or  adopting new program approaches if needed. The limited use of these  data, combined with the absence of specific program goals, raises  concern about the effectiveness of these performance measures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress said that access to  advanced telecommunications for schools and libraries was one of the  principles for the preservation and advancement of universal service. In  managing the E-rate program, FCC has been guided by how well the  program meets the broad, overarching goal of universal service, rather  than strategic goals specific to the E-rate program. After 12 years of  program operations and committing more than $20 billion in funding  awards, FCC has not developed adequate performance goals and measures  for the E-rate program. Because we have repeatedly identified the lack of  adequate performance goals and measures as a weakness in the E-rate  program, we reiterate our 2005 recommendation that FCC define annual,  outcome-oriented performance goals for the E-rate program that are  linked to the overarching goal of providing universal service. Moreover,  we have identified several trends that raise questions about the direction  of the program. Is it in the national interest, in an increasingly broadband- oriented world, that a substantial and growing portion of commitments is  for telecommunications services such as local and cellular telephone  service? Does the program\u2019s high participation rate among public schools,  but lower participation rate among private schools and libraries, lead to an  acceptable distribution of E-rate funding among eligible entities? Without  a strategic vision for the program, and accompanying performance goals  and measures, it is difficult for FCC to make informed decisions about the  future of the program and more effectively target available funding.", "Additionally, we have previously identified the program\u2019s low  disbursement rate as an area of concern. In response to a previous  recommendation, FCC took steps to increase the disbursement rate.  However, we found that the disbursement rate has not increased and a  substantial amount of committed funding is not disbursed. In the current  E-rate environment, where requests for funding consistently exceed the  annual funding cap, many applicants seeking support for Priority 2  services are denied funding, yet a significant amount of funding committed  to applicants is not disbursed. If applications and commitments more  closely tracked disbursements\u2014that is, if the disbursement rate were  higher\u2014some applicants who were denied funding might have received  funding for internal connection projects. Moreover, in light of the nation\u2019s  current fiscal constraints, it is appropriate to make the most effective  possible use of available E-rate funding by minimizing the amounts of  committed funds that are not disbursed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better provide a foundation for effective management of the E-rate  program and to ensure that program funds are used efficiently and in a  manner to support desired program outcomes, we recommend that the  Federal Communications Commission take the following two actions:    Review the purpose and structure of the E-rate program and prepare a  report to the appropriate congressional committees identifying FCC\u2019s  strategic vision for the program; this report should include the  program\u2019s long-term goals, whether the vision can be achieved using  the existing program structure (e.g., the priority rules and discount  matrix), and whether legislative or regulatory changes are necessary.", "Provide information in its annual performance plan on  the amount of undisbursed funding associated with commitments  that have expired and why these funds were not disbursed, and  the actions taken to reduce the amount of undisbursed funding and  the outcomes associated with these actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FCC and USAC for their review and  comment.

In particular, FCC noted that it  identified goals for the E-rate program when it first adopted the program  and recently requested comment on establishing new goals. Further, FCC  noted that its performance measures do, or will, meet the three  characteristics of successful measures that we identified. We acknowledge  the efforts FCC has made to date and recognize the successes of the E-rate  program that FCC identified in its letter. However, these efforts are not  consistent with successful performance goals and measures. For example,  agencies should establish explicit performance goals and measures, use  intermediate goals and measures to illustrate progress, and identify  projected target levels of performance for multiyear goals. Establishing  effective performance goals and measures will help FCC guide the E-rate  program. Finally, FCC noted that it has taken action to address the  disbursement rate and that our analysis may inaccurately portray a  decrease in the disbursement rate since disbursements typically occur  over several years and therefore the disbursement rate in the first few  years after commitments are made will be lower than in later years. We  agree that the disbursement rate in the first few years could be lower than  in later years. However, the disbursement rate for every funding year  (including 2001 through 2004) remains less than the rate in 2000, when we  made our initial recommendation on this issue.

We assessed the reliability of the data by questioning  officials about controls on access to the system and data back-up  procedures; additionally, we reviewed the data sets provided to us for  obvious errors and inconsistencies.

To develop the survey  questionnaire, we reviewed existing studies about the program, including  previous and ongoing GAO work, and interviewed stakeholder groups  knowledgeable about the program and issues of concern to beneficiaries.  We designed draft questionnaires in close collaboration with a GAO social  science survey specialist. We conducted pretests with eight E-rate  participants representing different types of applicants\u2014schools, school  districts, and libraries\u2014and from rural and urban areas, to help further  refine our questions, develop new questions, and clarify any ambiguous  portions of the survey.

The remaining three entity types were  therefore used for our first stratification variable.", "Urban/rural status. Applicants must report whether they are located in  a rural or urban area because this information is used to determine  their discount level. Three percent of the applications were for entities  located in a mixed urban-rural area; we excluded this category of  applications as out of scope for this survey. The remaining cases were  divided between urban and rural for our second stratification variable.", "Priority level of funding. The third stratification variable was the  priority level for the funding commitments made for each application.  To control the funding priority in our sample, we divided the  applications into those associated with beneficiaries that requested (1)  only Priority 1 services funding, (2) only internal connections funding,  and (3) both. We combined funding priority categories (2) and (3) for  analysis of survey results.", "Analysis of the application data that we received revealed that many  beneficiaries filed more than one application with USAC for funding year  2006 and received funding commitments for these requests.

We sent these entities  only one survey and weighted their responses accordingly.", "The number of applications in each of our sample strata and the sample  size are shown in table 4.", "We used a proportional allocation to assign sample units to strata with an  adjustment for strata that had small populations. If the proportional  allocation was less than 20, we used either the total number of  applications in the stratum if it was less than 20 or set the sample  allocation at 20. The stratum sample sizes for our survey were determined  to provide a 4 percent overall precision for an attribute measure at the 95  percent level of confidence.", "Our goal was to survey individuals who were responsible for completing  E-rate-related tasks\u2014such as preparing forms and responding to  information requests\u2014for each sampled entity.

Because some entities  employ a consultant to fill out their application and others use a regional  or state official who is responsible for multiple entities\u2019 applications, our  sample included different entities that shared the same contact person. We  contacted these individuals to identify an alternate entity-specific contact  to receive the survey. If no such alternate could be found, the original  contact was sent one survey for each sample entity. We contacted such  individuals to make arrangements for them to fill out the questions that  pertained to all applications only once, then separately obtained the  application-specific information for each of their surveys.

For example, differences in  how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of information  available to respondents, or the types of people who do not respond can  introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We included steps  in both the data collection and data analysis stages to minimize such  nonsampling errors. As indicated above, we collaborated with a GAO  social science survey specialist to design draft questionnaires, and  versions of the questionnaire were pretested with eight members of the  surveyed population. In addition, we provided a draft of the questionnaire  to FCC and USAC for their review and comment. From these pretests and  reviews, we made revisions as necessary.

We received two files from USAC\u2014 one for schools and one for libraries\u2014that included the entity\u2019s name,  NCES identification number, address, city, state, and ZIP code. The  school file also included information on whether each school was public  or private; we used this information to separate public from private  schools. We assessed the reliability of the STARS data system as discussed  previously. Additionally, we examined the data set that we obtained for  matching purposes to identify inconsistencies or obvious errors. We found  that some of the data fields were not fully completed. For example, there  were a number of records with missing data, incomplete data, and  incorrect NCES identification numbers. However, we concluded that the  incomplete nature of some of the records did not significantly affect our  intended purpose of identifying program participants, and we therefore  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable.", "We matched USAC\u2019s public school data against CCD, USAC\u2019s private  school data against PSS, and USAC\u2019s library data against the PLS from  NCES. To identify which entities in the NCES data sets were E-rate  participants, we used SAS, a statistical software application, to compare  USAC records with NCES records, matching first on identification  numbers, then on combinations of entity names, states, cities, ZIP codes  and street addresses. When this procedure could find no exact match, we  used an SAS function that measures asymmetric spelling distance between  words (SPEDIS), to determine the likelihood that entity names from the  two data sets did match and to generate possible pairs of matching  entities. The possible matches for an entity were written to a spreadsheet,  which we reviewed manually to select the best possible match. For both  computerized and manual matches, we assessed a random sample of the  matches to calculate error rates for the analysis. Based upon our sample  results, we estimate the error rate for matching records between the USAC  and the Department of Education\u2019s databases as 1.7 percentage points.  Unless otherwise noted, all of the percentage estimates cited in the report,  which are based upon matching of entity records, have an overall error  rate of 3.4 percentage points or less at the 95 percent level of confidence.
