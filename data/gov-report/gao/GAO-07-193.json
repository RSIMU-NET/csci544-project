The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for coordinating federal efforts to protect the safety and health of workers involved in the response to large national disasters. Under the Comptroller General's authority, GAO initiated a number of Katrina-related reviews. For this review, GAO examined (1) what is known about the number of response and recovery workers deployed to the Gulf Coast in response to Hurricane Katrina; (2) the extent to which OSHA tracked injuries and illnesses sustained by these workers; and (3) how well OSHA met the safety and health needs of workers. To address these issues, GAO reviewed reports; analyzed data; interviewed federal, state, and local officials; and conducted site visits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["No one, including OSHA,was responsible for collecting information on the total number of response and recovery workers deployed to the Gulf Coast in response to Hurricane Katrina and no one collected it, but 10 federal agencies provided estimates showing that, on October 1, 2005, the agencies had about 49,000 federal workers in the Gulf Coast area. In addition, six of these agencies estimated that their contractors had about 5,100 workers in the area on December 1, 2005, but the other four either did not track the number of workers employed by their contractors or did not employ contractors. Although OSHA was responsible for tracking the injuries and illnesses that federal response and recovery workers sustained during the response to Hurricane Katrina, the agency's efforts to collect it were delayed and it was unable to collect usable information. According to OSHA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must assign and fund specific responsibilities for each disaster. However, FEMA did not direct OSHA to collect injury and illness data until more than 3 weeks after the hurricane struck. OSHA attempted to collect the data, but the information federal agencies provided were incomplete and unreliable. OSHA and other agencies did track fatalities. They reported nine worker fatalities attributed to work-related accidents: three employees of federal contractors and six nonfederal workers or volunteers. OSHA provided assistance to many response and recovery workers who responded to Hurricane Katrina, but not all workers' safety and health needs were met. OSHA quickly established operations in the Gulf area; intervened in thousands of potentially hazardous situations; and assessed air, water, soil, and noise hazards at many work sites. However, disagreements between OSHA and FEMA about which agency was in charge of providing safety and health assistance to federal agencies and workers and how it would be provided delayed some of OSHA's efforts. Also, some agencies' lack of awareness about the role OSHA plays in a disaster further hindered its ability to provide assistance. As a result, OSHA did not fully meet workers' safety and health needs, particularly their need for training and protective equipment. OSHA also did not coordinate with the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that workers had needed mental health services, and OSHA was not assigned responsibility for coordinating the needs of nonfederal workers, including state and local agency workers; many immigrants; and volunteers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, federal  After Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, federal  agencies undertook one of the largest rescue and recovery efforts in  agencies undertook one of the largest rescue and recovery efforts in  American history.

OSHA did not establish a process for gathering these data between the  time the Annex was issued in December 2004 and when Hurricane Katrina  hit the Gulf Coast in late August 2005. According to OSHA officials, during  this 8-month period, they focused their efforts on introducing federal,  state, and local agencies to OSHA\u2019s new role under the Annex in a disaster  rather than developing a process for collecting data on workers\u2019 injuries  and illnesses during a response.", "The second factor that hindered OSHA\u2019s ability to collect data on workers\u2019  injuries and illnesses was that fact that FEMA did not issue a mission  assignment directing OSHA to collect these data for federal agencies\u2019  workers until more than 3 weeks after the hurricane hit the Gulf.

In  November 2005, OSHA asked federal agencies and their contractors to  submit their injury and illness logs for worksites located in the Gulf area to  OSHA headquarters on a monthly basis. However, according to OSHA  officials, because they did not request agencies to provide their injury and  illness logs to OSHA until five or six weeks after the hurricane hit, and  because agencies are normally not required to send their logs to OSHA,  not all agencies submitted their logs. In addition, many of the agencies  could not separate data for workers assigned to the Gulf Coast area  temporarily since employers are not required to establish separate logs for  temporary worksites expected to be in operation for one year or less.  Some agencies provided their logs to OSHA, but the data they provided  were incomplete and unreliable, according to OSHA officials. For  example, one agency\u2019s logs included information on accidents involving  heavy equipment but did not contain information on the related injuries to  workers. OSHA officials cited several reasons for the poor quality of the  data, including the fact that the agencies may have placed a low priority on  recording injuries and illnesses while responding to a disaster.", "In technical comments on the draft report, OSHA officials stated that  neither their efforts to educate the federal community about the Annex  nor the more than 3-week delay in receiving its mission assignment  prevented them from developing a system for collecting injury and illness  data.", "In a mission assignment, FEMA tasked OSHA to collect these data in order  to facilitate consistent formatting and data sharing among response  organizations. OSHA could then use the data to track emerging trends in  the types of injuries and illnesses sustained by workers so that appropriate  measures, such as providing specific safety training and information on  hazards, could be taken to address emerging safety issues and prevent or  reduce injuries and illnesses.

For example, when OSHA had difficulty  finding housing for its staff in New Orleans, it contacted a chemical  company that is part of one of OSHA\u2019s cooperative programs, and the  company gave OSHA space in its parking lot for recreational vehicles that  OSHA used to house several of its field staff. OSHA also obtained support  from the Mine Safety and Health Administration, another agency within  the Department of Labor, for almost 3 months after the hurricane. The  agency provided OSHA with two large trailers equipped with satellite  communications that it uses for mine rescue operations. OSHA used the  trailers as mobile command post centers to communicate with other  agencies at a time when communication in the area was very difficult. The  agency also gave OSHA generators to power electricity and plumbing.", "OSHA also capitalized on relationships with utility companies established  during previous responses to hurricanes in the three affected states to  target its safety and health assistance. Utility companies are among the  first responders on the scene of hurricanes, restoring power and  communications in the affected areas. OSHA accompanied the utility  companies to staging areas each morning to brief workers on safety and  distribute printed safety information. OSHA also advised utility workers  on using the proper safety equipment.

For example, an OSHA official in  Louisiana stopped work at a site until unprotected workers in an aerial lift  50 feet above the ground received safety harnesses and orange cones were  placed around the lift to protect against traffic. On the few occasions when  an employer did not follow OSHA\u2019s recommendations, or if there were  repeat problems with an employer, OSHA would elevate its concerns to  company management or to the federal agency that contracted with the  company and this usually brought abut the needed changes, according to  OSHA officials. For example, OSHA staff told a supervisor at one worksite  that workers repairing a bridge needed safety harnesses to protect them  from falls, but the workers did not have the equipment when OSHA visited  the next day. OSHA staff then called the owner of the company, who  promptly provided the safety equipment and made sure the workers   used it.", "Other federal agencies asked OSHA to intervene in hazardous situations.  For example, EPA asked OSHA to monitor the health of workers at the site  of an oil spill where more than a million gallons of crude oil leaked from  an above-ground storage tank. FEMA asked OSHA to provide a hazardous  materials specialist to accompany its staff to jails and Department of  Justice buildings in New Orleans and assess what protective gear was  needed to enter and inspect buildings and to a local hospital to assess  general safety and health hazards. FEMA also asked OSHA to conduct air- monitoring tests and assess hazards at local courts and other public  buildings in the area, and OSHA staff advised FEMA on how to properly  ventilate temporary housing trailers contaminated with formaldehyde gas  emitted by construction materials such as plywood and rugs.", "Officials with OSHA and other federal agencies told us that the technical  assistance OSHA provided during the response was well received and was  more effective in protecting workers than if the agency had been operating  in an enforcement mode. The officials noted that enforcement actions can  take months to complete due to the legal requirements of an investigation,  the amount of documentation required, and the due process provided to  employers to appeal citations. By providing technical assistance and  immediately addressing hazardous situations, OSHA officials said they  were able to assist many more workers and correct more hazardous  situations during the response than if they had been operating in an  enforcement mode. OSHA typically conducts about 1,500 inspections each  year in the three affected states\u2014about 430 in Alabama, about 530 in  Louisiana, and about 500 in Mississippi\u2014but intervened in over   15,000 potentially hazardous situations during approximately 11 months   of the response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA Sampled Air, Water, Soil, and Noise Levels at Many Work Sites", "paragraphs": ["In addition to providing safety and health technical assistance, OSHA also  took more than 6,000 samples at work sites throughout the Gulf Coast area  to assess air, water, soil, and noise hazards. As shown in figure 8, workers  in the Gulf Coast area faced many airborne hazards.", "EPA was responsible for sampling the general environment\u2014such as the  air, water, and soil\u2014in order to assess the dangers to the public, while  OSHA was responsible for sampling worksites for hazardous substances  harmful to workers. For example, OSHA field staff pinned small personal  monitors on workers\u2019 clothing to sample for potential exposure to  hazardous chemicals and substances, and sampled water and soil at  worksites (see fig. 9).", "OSHA field staff also monitored unoccupied buildings for carbon  monoxide that may have accumulated from the use of generators before  the building was vacated and to determine whether the siding and shingles  contained asbestos.

As a result, some of OSHA\u2019s efforts to provide assistance were delayed.  Additionally, before Hurricane Katrina, OSHA provided limited  information to federal, state, and local agencies about the Annex, and  many agencies did not understand the services OSHA can provide or that  OSHA provides technical assistance, not enforcement, in a disaster. This  may have contributed to agencies not inviting OSHA to participate in  emergency preparedness exercises held prior to Hurricane Katrina or  asking for OSHA\u2019s help during the response and recovery efforts once the  storm hit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OSHA and FEMA Disagreed about Implementation of the Annex and about Each Other\u2019s Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["FEMA did not issue a mission assignment to OSHA implementing the  Annex until September 21, 2005\u2014more than 3 weeks after the hurricane  hit the Gulf Coast. Before Hurricane Katrina, FEMA and OSHA had not  developed criteria or procedures for implementing the Annex in a  disaster. FEMA officials told us that all of the NRP\u2019s annexes take effect  when the NRP is implemented; however, OSHA said it must first receive a  mission assignment from FEMA to receive funding and begin its work as  described in the Annex. OSHA used its own staff and budget to establish  operations and provide assistance to workers in the Gulf before receiving  authorization for reimbursement from FEMA. However, OSHA delayed  activities that involved substantial funding, such as deploying worker  safety and health trainers and purchasing protective gear for other federal  agencies, until FEMA formally authorized funding through mission  assignments, assuring that such activities would be reimbursed. However,  although FEMA and OSHA were developing procedures for their  operations in future disasters, as of December 2006, these procedures did  not contain criteria that clearly defined when and how OSHA will carry  out its responsibilities under the Annex or the type or magnitude of  disasters in which OSHA will be involved.", "FEMA and OSHA also disagreed about which agency was in charge of  worker safety and health for the response and recovery efforts and which  workers should be covered. The agency in charge assumed the role of  Safety Coordinator at the Joint Field Office in each state, where the  federal agencies met to coordinate their response and recovery efforts.", "Because of their disagreement about leadership, FEMA and OSHA each  fulfilled the role of Safety Coordinator for different periods of time in  Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, and other federal agencies did not  know which agency was consistently and officially in charge. In addition,  some FEMA officials viewed the role of the Safety Coordinator as  providing support only to FEMA employees and personnel at FEMA- managed facilities. In contrast, OSHA officials saw the role of the Safety  Coordinator as supporting all federal workers, including federal contractor  employees involved in the response. For example, both FEMA and OSHA  officials in Mississippi identified a need for driver training because of the  large number of motor vehicle accidents. FEMA\u2019s Safety Coordinator in  Mississippi sought the driver training for FEMA staff only, while, under its  mission assignment, OSHA had already worked with the National Institute  of Environmental Health Sciences to develop a similar program that was  available to all federal responders.", "In addition, under the Annex, OSHA is responsible for coordinating with  the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor the medical  conditions of responders and evaluate the need for long-term medical  monitoring. However, FEMA did not direct OSHA to coordinate this  activity in the mission assignments issued for Hurricane Katrina because,  according to FEMA officials, they do not have the authority under the  Stafford Act to pay for the collection and management of data for long- term studies or analysis. Although it is not clear whether there is a need  for this type of monitoring for response and recovery workers involved in  the response to Hurricane Katrina, the fact that some workers at the World  Trade Center disaster did not exhibit symptoms of illnesses until months  or years after they left the site, and others developed acute conditions at  the site that later worsened or became chronic, highlights the importance  of considering these issues for rescue and recovery workers who  responded to Hurricane Katrina or for those involved in future disasters.", "FEMA and OSHA are in the process of developing new procedures for  future disasters. However, the procedures do not specify the type or  magnitude of disaster in which OSHA will be involved, and they include  FEMA\u2019s definition of the scope of the Safety Coordinator as providing  safety and health support only to FEMA employees and personnel at  FEMA-managed facilities, not OSHA\u2019s definition that covers all  responders, including federal contractor employees at all facilities. As a  result, OSHA may have difficulty providing assistance to all workers  involved in future response efforts. The new procedures also do not  resolve the issue of how OSHA will be able to monitor the medical  condition of responders or evaluate the need for long-term medical  monitoring in future disasters as described in the Annex, given that FEMA  does not believe it can authorize such activities or reimburse them under  the Stafford Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Agency Officials Were Not Aware of OSHA\u2019s Role in a Large Disaster", "paragraphs": ["OSHA officials told us they did not have enough time to conduct extensive  outreach to other federal agencies in the months between the issuance of  the NRP in December 2004 and the end of August 2005 when Hurricane  Katrina hit the Gulf Coast.

OSHA was in the process of developing  this committee when Hurricane Katrina hit, but these efforts were  suspended during the response.", "OSHA\u2019s efforts to inform state and local agencies about its role under the  Annex were limited to making presentations and staffing information  booths at training sessions conducted by the Department of Homeland  Security after the NRP and Annex became effective in April 2005. The  sessions were offered in seven cities to state and local emergency and  health officials from fire departments, police departments, and local  hospitals. The Department of Homeland Security chose to visit cities it  considered likely targets in future terrorist attacks: the District of  Columbia, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami, and Houston.  According to OSHA and FEMA officials, the presentations were attended  by individuals from federal, state, and local agencies; trade groups; and  support personnel.

For example, OSHA attended a national emergency  preparedness exercise conducted by FEMA in June 2005 that simulated a  response to a large, destructive hurricane, but the exercise did not include  implementing the safety and health Annex. OSHA headquarters officials  told us they thought the Annex was not implemented during these  exercises because other agency officials did not fully understand the  assistance OSHA can provide in a disaster or its new role under the Annex.  OSHA\u2019s participation in state and local emergency preparedness exercises  held prior to Hurricane Katrina was also limited. Two of OSHA Area Office  Directors in the affected states told us they had difficulty getting invited to  participate in state and local emergency preparedness exercises, and often  when they were invited, they did not play an active role in the exercise.  For example, the Director of OSHA\u2019s Mobile Area Office told us he  attended regional training exercises on his own initiative. It took him a  year to convince the sponsoring agencies that OSHA provides assistance in  a disaster, at which point they incorporated OSHA into an exercise  involving a chemical spill from a railroad car, but OSHA\u2019s services were  not used during the exercise.", "Since its response to Hurricane Katrina, OSHA officials say the agency has  been invited to participate in more emergency response exercises where  the Annex is implemented and the agency plays an active role.

In addition, some agencies did  not ask OSHA to provide training because they did not realize that OSHA  offered this type of training. For example, EPA regional officials told us  that, although their response managers noted a need for driver safety  training in October 2005 because of the large number of motor vehicle  accidents that occurred in the Gulf Coast area during the initial response  efforts, it was not provided until March 2006 because it took them several  months to determine that OSHA could provide this training. Workers faced  many hazardous driving conditions during the response to Hurricane  Katrina, including missing road signs or signs pointing the wrong  direction, debris-strewn streets, intersections without working traffic  signals, and lack of street lights\u2014which made nighttime driving especially  hazardous.

In its lessons learned from the World Trade  Center disaster, OSHA recognized the need to ensure an adequate supply  of personal protective equipment before a future incident and to develop a  program to ensure for the storage, transportation, and distribution of this  equipment through FEMA and other federal agencies. However, OSHA did  not have such a program in place prior to Katrina, and OSHA and FEMA  disagreed on how to obtain personal protective equipment: OSHA ordered  equipment from its Cincinnati Technology Center, while FEMA ordered  equipment from its contractor. In addition, OSHA had not made prior  arrangements for storing the equipment during the response. OSHA and  FEMA resolved their disagreements about suppliers and OSHA arranged to  store equipment in its area offices and FEMA-managed facilities near the  Joint Field Offices in Louisiana and Mississippi, but these difficulties  delayed the provision of some equipment to workers and highlighted the  need to establish a personal protection equipment program in advance of a  disaster.", "Some federal agency officials reported needing advice on proper  protective gear, and other officials reported a shortage of equipment. For  example, National Guard officials in Louisiana told us they would have  liked information from OSHA on the hazards workers were facing,  recommendations on how to protect workers, and assistance in obtaining  protective equipment such as rubber boots needed to protect workers  from contaminated floodwaters. USACE officials told us they had  difficulty obtaining sufficient supplies of protective equipment such as  gloves and reflective vests.", "OSHA officials told us the agency has not yet fully addressed what the  personal protective equipment program, as defined in the Annex, should  entail.

OSHA and FEMA officials told us it was difficult  to get mental health counselors to go to the base camps where workers  lived during the response and to get counselors to provide services during  off-hours to workers who did not have standard work schedules. They also  said it was difficult to obtain mental health services for non-FEMA  employees because while FEMA believed its contract with a unit of the  Department of Health and Human Services, Federal Occupational Health ,  to provide counseling would cover all federal workers responding to  Hurricane Katrina, the contractor interpreted the contract to only cover  FEMA workers. In addition, instead of sending counselors to work sites  throughout the Gulf, the contractor provided a toll-free number for  workers to call. This was not an effective way to provide services because  phone service in the Gulf was widely disrupted, and OSHA and FEMA  officials said they thought on-site counseling was a better way to help  workers. Although the contractor eventually provided services to non- FEMA employees by sending counselors to work sites and base camps in  the Gulf area and distributing literature about available services, these  efforts did not begin until late December 2005\u2014too late to address the  needs of response workers who were most in need of these services and  the needs of many recovery workers involved early in the response.", "According to a FEMA official, the agency recently began an effort to  review its contracts to ensure that non-FEMA employees are explicitly  covered in the event of a future disaster response.

OSHA officials in  Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi said it was difficult to address the  needs of these populations. The mission assignment FEMA issued to  OSHA only covered federal workers and federal contractor employees.  OSHA\u2019s efforts, therefore, were focused on those workers, and no other  federal agency had responsibility for meeting the safety and health needs  of nonfederal workers. OSHA had limited access to state and local  workers because the states did not request the agency\u2019s assistance. OSHA  also had difficulty addressing the needs of immigrant workers because of  language barriers, low literacy levels among some immigrants, the  transience of many employers that hire immigrant workers, and  immigrants\u2019 fear of deportation and the federal government.

An  official with the New Orleans Police Department told us the only staff who  had waders to use during rescue efforts were fishermen and hunters who  owned their own waders. However, because the governors of the three  states most affected by Hurricane Katrina did not request OSHA\u2019s  assistance, the mission assignments issued to OSHA by FEMA did not  cover state or local workers, they only covered federal workers.

In preparing for future disasters, however, it is  important for OSHA to note the areas in which its efforts in responding to  Hurricane Katrina could have been improved. Without the ability to collect  data on injuries and illnesses sustained by workers involved in disaster  recovery efforts, OSHA cannot fulfill its role as defined in the Annex to  identify trends and use this information to prevent further injuries and  illnesses by informing workers and their employers about potential safety  and health hazards. Furthermore, unless OSHA and FEMA clearly define  their roles, the type and magnitude of the disasters in which OSHA will be  involved, and how and when the Annex will be implemented, there may  continue to be delays in providing critical assistance and information  needed to protect workers in future disasters. As a result, workers may  sustain injuries and illnesses that could have been prevented.

Further, because OSHA was not prepared to establish a program for  providing information on what protective equipment is needed or how to  use it during future disasters or for ensuring that agencies obtain adequate  supplies of equipment, workers may not be properly protected from  potential hazards. Finally, some workers\u2019 needs for mental health services  in future disasters may not be not met, and the full extent of workers\u2019  unmet mental health needs will not be known because OSHA has not  coordinated with the Department of Health and Human Services to  determine how it will assess the need for mental health services or ensure  that these services are provided to rescue and recovery workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the ability to meet workers\u2019 safety and health needs in  the event of a future disaster, the Secretaries of the Departments of Labor  and Homeland Security should direct the Administrators of OSHA and  FEMA to    clearly define the criteria to be used in deciding when OSHA will be  responsible for carrying out its duties under the Worker Safety and  Health Support Annex to the National Response Plan, including the  types and magnitude of disasters in which OSHA will be involved,  and    clearly define OSHA\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s roles under the Worker Safety  and Health Support Annex, including resolving the issue of how the  need for long-term medical monitoring of workers involved in the  response to future disasters will be met; and    proactively work to provide information to federal, state, and local  agencies about OSHA\u2019s role in a disaster and the assistance it can  provide under the Worker Safety and Health Support Annex,  including seeking opportunities for OSHA to participate in  emergency preparedness exercises at federal, state, and local levels.", "In addition, the Secretary of the Department of Labor should direct OSHA  to    establish a process for collecting data on injuries and illnesses  sustained by workers who respond to disasters as defined in the  Worker Safety and Health Support Annex to the National Response  Plan, such as requiring employers to record injuries and illnesses on  logs maintained at each disaster work site and periodically submit  them to OSHA during the response;    use the information collected on injuries and illnesses to identify  safety and health hazards and analyze injury and illness trends; and    develop, implement, and monitor an incident personal protective  equipment program as defined in the Worker Safety and Health  Support Annex.", "In order to improve the ability to meet workers\u2019 needs for mental health  services in the event of a future disaster, the Secretaries of the  Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services should    develop a plan for coordinating and providing mental health  services to response and recovery workers as described in the  Worker Safety and Health Support Annex to the National Response  Plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretaries of the Departments of  Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior,  and Labor; EPA; the Coast Guard; DOD; the National Guard; and USACE  for comment.

Four of the 10 agencies\u2014EPA, USACE, the Coast Guard, and  the Department of the Interior\u2014provided data on injuries and illnesses for  workers deployed to the Gulf Coast that were sufficiently reliable for us to  report. However, each of these agencies used different methods to report  this information. In an effort to summarize the injury and illness data  reported by the agencies, we developed a coding scheme for classifying  and combining the data on injuries and illnesses provided by EPA and  USACE into more consistent and concise categories. For example, we  classified an injury described in USACE\u2019s data as \u201ccontractor chain saw  operator suffered laceration,\u201d as a \u201claceration,\u201d and an injury described in  EPA\u2019s data as \u201cemployee lost his footing and fell onto the deck landing,\u201d as  a \u201ctrip/fall.\u201d We determined that the codes used by the Coast Guard were  sufficiently reliable in coding scheme to use to report the number and  types of injuries and illnesses sustained by their workers.

Many agency officials  told us that they could not provide the total number of workers for the  entire period because they did not collect data in a way that would enable  them to provide us with unduplicated counts of workers who rotated in  and out of the Gulf Coast area. However, many said they could provide us  with estimates of the total number of workers for specific points in time so  we requested such data from all 10 agencies.", "We asked them to provide the total number of full-time equivalent workers  they employed in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi on the first day of  each month from September 1, 2005, through April 1, 2006.

Only 6  of the 10 agencies tracked information on the number of workers  employed by their contractors in these three states to work on response  and recovery work related to Hurricane Katrina: the Departments of  Agriculture, the Interior, Health and Human Services, EPA, OSHA, and  FEMA. Although officials with three of the other four agencies\u2014the  Department of Defense, USACE, and the Coast Guard\u2014said they  employed contractors in the Gulf, they did not track the number of  workers employed by their contractors.

We disagree that our report does not fairly and adequately capture the  actions OSHA took to prevent occupational injuries and illnesses and  work-related fatalities in the Hurricane Katrina response operations.  The information on pages 15 through 27of the report details many of  these activities, but the purpose of the report was to provide a broader  picture of OSHA\u2019s overall effectiveness. While the magnitude of the  activities accomplished by OSHA\u2019s field staff was noteworthy, the  agency\u2019s overall effectiveness was hampered by its lack of preparation  for implementing its responsibilities under the Annex at the national  level. This was also noted by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  National Preparedness Task Force, which stated in its technical  comments that, \u201cAs a signatory agency, Department of Labor should  have anticipated and put in place mechanisms to ensure the success of  OSHA in meeting their Workforce Safety responsibilities.\u201d In addition,  our work focused on OSHA\u2019s activities through December 2006, not  December 2005.  2.  Although OSHA provides more detailed information about its action  during the response to Hurricane Katrina, our report mentions many of  these same activities. For example, on page 33 of the report, we stated  that OSHA distributed personal protective equipment to many agencies  and workers; on pages 25 to 27, we noted that OSHA sampled many  worksites for hazards; on pages 19 and 20, we provided examples of  the quick cards and fact sheets OSHA developed and distributed  throughout the Gulf; and on page 21, we discussed the thousands of  interventions that the agency\u2019s staff conducted.  3.  We agree that OSHA, nor any other federal agency, was responsible for  collecting information on the number of workers deployed to the Gulf  area in response to Hurricane Katrina. In the absence of such  information, we attempted to collect it ourselves but, as noted in the  report, were not entirely successful because many of the agencies we  contacted did not have systems in place for tracking the number of  workers deployed.  4.  We noted on page 9 of the report that the mission assignment FEMA  issued to OSHA implementing the Annex for Hurricane Katrina  included all of the activities listed in the Annex except long-term  medical monitoring. We measured the effectiveness of OSHA\u2019s  performance only against those activities included in its mission  assignment.  5.  Despite OSHA\u2019s efforts, as noted on page 32 of the report, other agency  officials told us that there still were gaps in the training provided to  workers involved in the response effort and additional information was  needed about available training.  6.  While we agree that establishing a personal protective equipment  program for a disaster response is a difficult and complex task, we  continue to believe that the underlying issue is the need for OSHA to  define how it will implement and monitor such a program as specified  in the Annex. The issues that OSHA raises need to be addressed in  developing an incident personal protective equipment program for  future disasters, including developing a process for deciding what  providing equipment on an \u201cad-hoc\u201d basis means, what types of  equipment will be provided, who will provide it, which workers will  receive it, and where will it be stored.  7.  We disagree with OSHA\u2019s comment that our statement about its lack of  coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services is  inaccurate. Our statement is based on OSHA\u2019s lack of coordination  before the disaster in order to ensure that the cooperating agencies  were adequately prepared to meet the mental health needs of workers.  Furthermore, in technical comments on the report, the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s National Preparedness Task Force also noted this  lack of coordination. It stated that OSHA did not seek assistance from  cooperating agencies that have provided mental health services during  major events in the past, such as the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.  8.  We disagree with OSHA\u2019s assertion that the report does not accurately  reflect the awareness of the Annex among federal agencies before  Hurricane Katrina. As noted in the report, many of the agency officials  we interviewed who were in charge of day-to-day operations in the  Gulf area were not aware of OSHA\u2019s role or the services it could  provide. We continue to believe that OSHA needs to provide  information to federal, state, and local agencies about its role in a  disaster, including seeking opportunities to participate in emergency  preparedness exercises at all levels of government. Because so many  responders are associated with nonfederal agencies, it is particularly  important for OSHA to reach out to state and local agencies to provide  this information.  9.  We used the word \u201csuspend\u201d to describe the fact that, in its press  releases, OSHA noted that it had \u201cexempted\u201d large areas of the three  affected states from its normal enforcement operations for specific  periods and limited its inspections to cases involving fatalities,  catastrophic accidents, or complaints, as noted on page 7 of the report.  We changed the wording of the report in response to OSHA\u2019s technical  comments and no longer use the term \u201csuspend.\u201d However, we believe  that this is an accurate reflection of the change in OSHA\u2019s activities  during a disaster.  10. The challenges OSHA recognizes in its comments regarding the use of  its standard recordkeeping forms (OSHA forms 300 and 301) to collect  data on injuries and illnesses sustained by workers during a disaster  correctly identify some of the drawbacks involved in using the forms  for this purpose. OSHA\u2019s comments also emphasize the need for it to  develop a process for collecting needed data that overcomes the  challenges identified. We disagree, however, that the forms are a good  platform on which to build such a process. They do not contain  detailed information on injuries, and employers are not required to  include many of the more minor injuries and illnesses sustained by  workers, such as those requiring only first aid. In addition, the use of  the logs could cause confusion among federal agencies about whether  the standard rules for recording injuries and illnesses are to be applied.  For example, federal agencies are not normally required to submit  their injury and illness logs to OSHA, but OSHA will need to obtain this  information on a timely basis during a disaster response in order to  monitor injuries and illnesses and identify trends."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Revae E.
