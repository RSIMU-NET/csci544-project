While major carriers and the Postal Service believe such shipments are rare, their belief is based mainly on inspections of problem shipments, such as those that leak. Statistically valid, generalizable data are not available and would be difficult to obtain, not only because more inspections would entail costly delays for carriers but also because Constitutional protections limit DOT's and the Postal Service's inspection authority. DOT is seeking greater authority to open potentially problematic shipments for inspection, but its efforts are not limited to air transport and would not enable DOT's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to obtain statistically valid, generalizable data on the nature and frequency of undeclared air shipments. A change in the law requiring that shippers consent to the opening of packages for inspection might be appropriate for air transport and would enable FAA to obtain such data. FAA could then identify the resources and actions needed to address the problem. Federal regulations create a framework for transporting dangerous goods safely, and outreach to shippers and carriers helps to prevent undeclared shipments. Private industry does business primarily with \"known shippers\" (those that have shown they comply with the regulations). The Postal Service cannot restrict its business to known shippers, but it requires customers to bring packages weighing 16 ounces or more to a post office for screening. Carriers and the Postal Service both train their employees to screen for undeclared shipments. The Postal Service and FAA monitor and enforce compliance with federal regulations for transporting dangerous goods by air. However, the Postal Service cannot fine violators and seldom takes criminal action, since most violations are inadvertent. FAA's enforcement guidance calls for documenting the reasons for any changes in the fines its inspectors initially propose. GAO's review of enforcement case files indicates that the reasons for changes were not always documented. FAA attributes some changes to the results of penalty negotiations. Because FAA is not always following its guidance, it cannot ensure that its fines are appropriate or consistent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each day, businesses, individuals, and government agencies package and  ship dangerous goods on ships, trains, trucks, and airplanes.

As agreed with  your office, we addressed three researchable questions:    What do DOT, the Postal Service, and others involved in the commercial  air transport of dangerous goods know about the nature and frequency of  undeclared shipments?", "What are the key mechanisms the federal government and private industry  have in place to prevent dangerous goods shipments from compromising  aviation safety?", "What do DOT and the Postal Service do to enforce federal regulations for  shipping dangerous goods by air?", "We focused our review primarily on the shipments of dangerous goods  onboard cargo aircraft, in part, because more types and quantities of  dangerous goods are permitted on cargo aircraft than on passenger  aircraft. To address these questions, we analyzed recent reports by DOT  on its dangerous goods programs and on the threat that carrying such  goods can pose, particularly when the shipments are undeclared. We  reviewed research on methods that might be used to estimate the  frequency of undeclared shipments, and we consulted with both GAO and  academic experts in these methods. To determine the extent to which  undeclared shipments may occur, we interviewed officials of four major  carriers that handle over 60 percent of annual air freight traffic in the  United States, and we visited the premises of three of these carriers to  review their procedures for identifying and preventing undeclared  dangerous goods shipments. We also reviewed the results of a joint effort  by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Customs  Service, which has the authority to inspect and search international  shipments, to detect, among other things, undeclared dangerous goods  shipments. We interviewed Postal Service, FAA, and other DOT officials  with various oversight responsibilities for dangerous goods transportation.  To evaluate FAA\u2019s enforcement strategy, we examined the agency\u2019s  assessments in 30 cases. These cases were randomly selected to fairly  represent the full range of over 2,000 cases in the database. While the  number of cases we tested was too small for us to estimate the extent to  which FAA\u2019s enforcement strategy was followed in the entire database,  our examination allowed us to describe the types of practices that occur at  critical points in the penalty assessment process.

Most of the dangerous goods that may  not travel by air at all are the most highly explosive, toxic, oxidizing, self- reactive, or flammable chemical substances or articles in their class. In  addition to prohibiting some types of dangerous goods from being carried  by air at all, DOT restricts the types and amounts of other dangerous  goods that any individual passenger or cargo aircraft may carry. For both  passenger and cargo aircraft, DOT spells out these restrictions in four  ways:    By name\u2014dangerous goods that represent an unacceptable hazard on  aircraft or are known to have caused an aircraft fire or explosion, such as  chemical oxygen generators, are specifically forbidden by name.", "By hazard class and subdivision\u2014certain subdivisions of the classes of  dangerous goods are known to be highly reactive or toxic (for example,  most explosives and all spontaneously combustible materials), so DOT  excludes them from passenger flights.", "By quantities contained per outer package\u2014DOT restricts on passenger  aircraft the quantity of certain substances or the number of articles that  may be present in the outermost shipping containers in the cargo hold. For  example, DOT allows the carriage of up to 30 liters of certain highly  flammable liquids per outer package on cargo aircraft, but imposes limits  of 1 liter or less on passenger aircraft.", "By packaging integrity\u2014dangerous goods must be packaged so as to  protect the integrity of the shipment and safeguard against accidental  leaks or spills.", "For passenger aircraft, whose cargo areas are divided into multiple  compartments, DOT also restricts the aggregate quantities of dangerous  goods that may be carried per cargo compartment. Figure 2 shows the  kinds of containers in which dangerous goods typically travel in these  cargo compartments.", "Dangerous goods permitted onboard passenger aircraft include dry ice and  solvents; cargo aircraft may also carry materials such as paint or medical  waste.

However, the vast majority of flammable liquids travel by other modes.  The percentage of total shipments made by air was greatest for radioactive  materials (class 7)\u2014just over 8 percent of the total radioactive tonnage  shipped in 1997 was shipped by air. According to FAA, cargo aircraft, such  as those operated by the major delivery services FedEx and United Parcel  Service, Inc.

Within DOT, the following have responsibility for dangerous goods:    The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) regulates the  transportation of dangerous goods by truck, train, ship, pipeline, and  plane. It decides which materials to define as hazardous; writes the rules  for packaging, handling, and carrying them; and prescribes training  requirements for shippers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 dangerous goods employees.  RSPA, along with the other DOT operating administrations that operate  and manage dangerous goods programs, conducts inspections and  investigations to determine compliance with dangerous goods laws and  regulations for all modes of transportation and, where appropriate,  initiates enforcement actions against those it finds not to be in  compliance. RSPA maintains a database for closed dangerous goods  enforcement actions from these operating administrations, and another  database that tracks dangerous goods incidents from these operating  administrations.", "The Office of Intermodalism, reporting to the Secretary of Transportation,  is responsible for implementing recommendations from a March 2000  evaluation of DOT\u2019s dangerous goods program, coordinating intermodal  and cross-modal dangerous goods activities, and coordinating DOT-wide  outreach activities. For example, in 2001, to improve awareness of  dangerous goods incidents occurring during shipments, this office sent out  letters to shippers most frequently identified in RSPA\u2019s dangerous goods  incident database.", "FAA carries out responsibilities for ensuring compliance with the rules for  transporting dangerous goods by air.

They are required to train their employees to package their shipments  safely and to tell the carriers to whom they deliver these shipments that  they contain dangerous goods. Carriers share some of the responsibility  for the safe transportation of dangerous goods. They do so by training  their employees to handle these shipments properly, to identify likely  instances of improper shipments (such as those containing undeclared  dangerous goods), and to verify that the indirect air carriers from whom  they accept consolidated cargo shipments have FAA-approved security  programs in place to prevent explosive or incendiary devices from being  placed onboard.

In recent years, both  RSPA and FAA have expressed concern about undeclared dangerous  goods shipments. In its departmentwide March 2000 evaluation of the  dangerous goods program, DOT reported that the United States has a  relatively good safety record, given the amounts of dangerous goods that  are shipped by all modes of transportation each year. However, DOT  added that the potential still remains for dangerous goods incidents with  catastrophic consequences, and, even though relatively small amounts of  dangerous goods travel by air (compared with other modes of  transportation), a single mishap can have serious consequences. For  example, FAA has reported the following incidents:  In 1996, a major passenger airline carried undeclared dangerous goods\u2014 calcium hypochlorite and liquid bleach\u2014on a flight from California to  Jamaica. Upon arrival, airport personnel discovered smoke coming from  the aircraft\u2019s cargo doors and encountered toxic fumes when they opened  the cargo compartment. The box of undeclared dangerous goods was  leaking and burst into flames shortly after the airport personnel removed it  from the cargo hold.", "In 1998, an undeclared shipment of electric storage batteries (considered  \u201cwet\u201d because they contain either electrolyte acid or alkaline corrosive  battery fluid) burst into flames while en route by truck to an airport,  where it had been scheduled to be placed aboard a major passenger  carrier\u2019s aircraft.", "In 1999, a major cargo carrier transported an undeclared shipment of  liquefied petroleum gas from Portland, Oregon, to New York on a regularly  scheduled cargo flight. One day after arriving in New York, the package  burst into flames at the carrier\u2019s sorting facility.", "Three of the four major carriers we interviewed and DOT expressed  concern about the safety of carrying dangerous goods. According to these  three carriers, even though they discover relatively few undeclared  shipments, their greatest safety concern in the air transportation of these  goods is prompted by the undeclared shipments\u2014particularly those they  do not detect before accepting them. They expressed this concern over  not knowing how much of the volume of undeclared dangerous goods they  do not find, because these shipments present a greater risk than do those  that shippers properly declare.", "The major cargo carriers we interviewed and the Postal Service agreed  that ignorance or misunderstanding of the rules for transporting  dangerous goods is by far the most common reason why shippers fail to  properly declare their dangerous goods shipments. According to one  carrier, in very limited instances, shippers will deliberately not declare  their shipments even when they know they are breaking the rules.  However, no carrier cited cost as a reason why shippers fail to declare  their shipments, even though shipping costs are usually higher for  dangerous goods than for nondangerous goods. An official from one  carrier stated that he had never seen a case of a shipper willfully failing to  properly declare a dangerous goods shipment because of cost concerns.  Furthermore, at the Postal Service, it is doubtful that cost is a cause of  undeclared shipments, because the Postal Service does not charge more  for carrying these shipments than it does for carrying those that are not  hazardous; all of the Postal Service\u2019s charges are based on weight and  class, regardless of the contents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Limitations Make Estimates of Undeclared Dangerous Goods Shipments Difficult", "paragraphs": ["According to a 1999 threat assessment published by DOT\u2019s Volpe Center,  three types of data that are needed to thoroughly assess the risks of  carrying declared and undeclared dangerous goods by air were  unavailable. These were    what amounts of dangerous goods are shipped by class and division (for  all modes of transportation),   how often incidents related to dangerous goods involve undeclared    what amounts and what types of undeclared dangerous goods are shipped  by air.", "Without these data, the Volpe Center was limited to assessing the threat  from dangerous goods instead of the risk. The danger associated with a  specific item is its \u201cthreat,\u201d while the likelihood that the threat will actually  result in harm is its \u201crisk.\u201d Assessing risk, according to the Volpe Center,  requires some indication of the likelihood that dangerous goods will be  present on an aircraft\u2014and the data to determine this likelihood were not  available.", "Volpe Center officials attempted to find or compile data sources that  would allow them to estimate the total amount of various dangerous goods  that might be shipped (for example, over the course of a year), but they  were unsuccessful. They found no single source of such data and were not  able to piece together data sources. For example, Volpe Center staff  attempted to compile data from chemical manufacturers to identify the  total amounts of their products that move by air and the related  distribution chain (that is, the amounts that move by other modes); this  information would enable them to identify aggregate amounts of certain  dangerous goods that shippers should be declaring, which would be a first  step in working toward an estimate of undeclared shipments. However,  the industry sources the Volpe Center consulted considered such  information proprietary and would not share it. Volpe Center staff also  considered assembling cargo manifest information from the airlines,  because these records indicate for each flight the amounts and types of  dangerous goods the aircraft is carrying. However, Volpe Center staff said  the airlines informed them that these data are not in a form usable for such  an analysis. Even if the manifest information were available, data on the  overall amounts of dangerous goods shipments (such as the Volpe Center  sought from the chemical industry) would still be necessary before this  manifest information could be useful for estimating undeclared dangerous  goods shipments.", "According to Volpe Center staff, the limitations in the amount and quality  of data on dangerous goods shipments make estimating how many  shipments contain undeclared dangerous goods more difficult. Our  experts in applied research and methodology agreed, noting that certain  \u201chidden populations\u201d methods might be useful for estimating the amount  of undeclared dangerous goods shipments, but only if data limitations  such as those the Volpe Center identified were overcome. A Massachusetts  Institute of Technology expert in transportation research with whom we  met agreed that none of the known methods for estimating hidden  populations would be feasible for undeclared dangerous goods.", "The major carriers we interviewed said they most commonly identify  undeclared dangerous goods (after accepting them for shipment) when  some occurrence prompts them to open a package or, in the case of the  Postal Service, to set the package aside for further investigation (because  the Postal Service generally cannot open such a package without a search  warrant). Most often, this happens when a package leaks, spills, breaks  open, or emits an odor, and the carrier or Postal Service employees  identify the occurrence as potentially a dangerous goods incident. One  carrier also indicated that occasionally packages open as a result of  handling or must be opened when they lose their address labels. In some  of these instances, the company has discovered undeclared dangerous  goods. This same company also noted that, on rare occasions, it learns of  undeclared dangerous goods from informants\u2014employees of either the  company that shipped the package or competitors of that company.", "The carriers we interviewed reported that, although they have the consent  of shippers to open packages that have been accepted for shipment, they  seldom discover undeclared dangerous goods. Although they did not cite a  specific percentage, they described shipments of undeclared dangerous  goods as \u201cvery rare\u201d and \u201ca handful.\u201d The numbers are believed to be  similarly small for the Postal Service\u2014officials estimated that declared  dangerous goods represent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of their  shipments, and the percentage of these shipments that is undeclared is  \u201cvery small.\u201d The Volpe Center reported in a 1999 threat assessment that  undeclared dangerous goods shipments made up about 0.05 percent of the  shipments of several large cargo carriers, but this estimate was based on  the recollections of the carriers of how many incidents they typically  report to RSPA.", "Because estimates by the Volpe Center, major carriers, and the Postal  Service are based on reported incidents or memory, they are incomplete.  Moreover, these estimates refer only to those undeclared shipments that  resulted in dangerous goods incidents\u2014they do not include undeclared  shipments that never gave carriers cause to open them. As a result,  according to the Volpe Center, there are no valid figures for the numbers  of dangerous goods shipments that do not comply with regulations for  transportation by air.", "Additionally, when a carrier reports an incident to DOT, RSPA does not  currently require the carrier to report whether the shipper properly  declared the dangerous goods. Consequently, the estimates of undeclared  shipments reported by the Volpe Center and by carriers to us may not  include all of the incidents carriers discovered, because the estimates are  based on memory and are therefore subject to error. RSPA plans to  remedy this limitation by requiring carriers to report whether dangerous  goods shipments involved in incidents were declared or undeclared. To do  so, RSPA is modifying its incident-reporting paperwork (Form 5800.1) to  more systematically collect and analyze information on undeclared  shipments. RSPA expects to complete this and other ongoing revisions to  its incident-reporting form by spring 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technological, Economic, and Legal Hurdles Also Make Estimates of Undeclared Dangerous Goods Shipments Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Technological limitations complicate efforts to estimate the incidence of  undeclared dangerous goods shipments. Ideally, technologies generally  considered to be less intrusive, such as X-ray or explosives-detection  equipment, could be used to identify and characterize undeclared  shipments. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is  currently using this equipment to screen passenger carry-on and checked  baggage for weapons and explosives, and, under the Aviation and  Transportation Security Act, TSA must ensure that a system is in  operation to screen, inspect, or otherwise provide for the security of all air  cargo to be transported in all cargo aircraft as soon as practicable.  However, X-ray and explosives-detection equipment is not designed to  detect many types of dangerous goods. In the future, technology may  enable the rapid, less intrusive screening of packages, but in the near term,  opening packages remains the best way to obtain information on the  nature and frequency of undeclared shipments.", "Economic obstacles\u2014particularly the costs of opening packages after  accepting them\u2014also make it difficult to estimate the nature and  frequency of undeclared dangerous goods shipments. According to each of  the major carriers we interviewed, the volume of cargo that these airlines  carry each day is tremendous. For example, the carriers stated that they  carry from at least 1.3 million to more than 2 million shipments each night,  a small fraction of which contain dangerous goods. Because the carriers  typically guarantee delivery on nearly all of the shipments they carry (such  as within 24 hours or 2 business days), anything that slows their ability to  move shipments could compromise their ability to meet their guarantees  to their customers and, as a result, hurt their competitive position in their  industry.", "Although the carriers we interviewed told us that they obtain the consent  of shippers to open packages, they also said they seldom do open  packages. Carriers and an association representing cargo and passenger  airlines stressed that they are not in the business of opening packages,  particularly when shippers are primarily responsible for ensuring the  integrity and proper declaration of those packages. The carriers indicated  that they have confidence in and place a great, ongoing emphasis on their  up-front screening to prevent shippers from offering them undeclared  dangerous goods in the first place. Opening packages without probable  cause to do so would also be costly to the carriers because they would be  responsible for repackaging anything they found to be properly declared\u2014 and dangerous goods require special, more expensive packaging than  other shipments. Although carriers remain concerned about the possibility  of undeclared shipments they may miss, to date the frequency with which  they discover shipments of undeclared dangerous goods does not, in their  view, justify a step as disruptive and costly as systematically opening a  random or targeted selection of shipments.", "Because the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits  unreasonable searches and seizures and neither DOT nor the Postal  Service has obtained the consent of owners to have their packages opened  for inspection, neither agency may conduct or require random or targeted  intrusive inspections of domestic cargo shipments to look for undeclared  dangerous goods. Although FAA may remove a package from an aircraft  and take such emergency actions if it reasonably believes that the package  presents an immediate threat, it has no authority, generally, to open and  inspect a package without a warrant or without the owner\u2019s consent.", "The Postal Service may inspect Parcel Post packages. However, packages  sent as First Class or Express mail traveling by air may not be inspected.  The mail classification schedule recommended by the Postal Rate  Commission and adopted by the Postal Service does not distinguish  between letters and packages, treating both as \u201csealed against inspection\u201d  and protected by the Fourth Amendment.

Most recently, in June  and July 2000, the U.S. Customs Service and FAA together conducted  inspections of passenger carry-on and checked bags and cargo aboard  flights that were entering or departing from the United States at 19  domestic airports. This series of inspections found that    8 percent of targeted cargo shipments (those whose tariff codes indicated  that their contents might be hazardous) contained undeclared dangerous  goods,   1 percent of passenger carry-on bags contained undeclared dangerous  just under 0.5 percent of passenger checked baggage contained  undeclared dangerous goods.", "The undeclared dangerous goods in the cargo shipments included  flammable liquids, fuel control units, aerosols, fire extinguishers, and  devices powered by flammable liquid.

According to DOT, this authority, which is  specific to all modes, would require its officers or inspectors to have a  \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting a violation, such as a  pattern of shipping undeclared dangerous goods, in order to open an  unmarked package. DOT further stated that this enhanced authority would  enable it to more effectively detect potential violations and to ensure that  it took the appropriate remedial actions. According to DOT officials, its  reauthorization proposal has not been enacted for reasons unrelated to the  merits of its request for additional inspection authority.", "Because DOT\u2019s reauthorization proposal applies equally to all modes of  transportation, it would, if approved, allow DOT to follow up on problem  shippers across the modes. However, the proposal would also extend the  government\u2019s inspection authority without regard to the differences  inherent in transporting dangerous goods by different modes.

The proposal has not been designed to obtain better  information about the nature and frequency of undeclared air shipments.  Because it would require a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for opening  packages, it would not allow DOT to identify a random sample of packages  and conduct inspections whose results could be generalized to all  packages in air transport. Thus, its usefulness as a tool for gathering data  to estimate the nature and frequency of undeclared air shipments and to  profile and target violators would be limited. DOT officials agree that their  proposal would not generate statistically valid data, and they have  indicated their willingness to modify the proposal so that it would yield  more useful information.", "An alternative to DOT\u2019s proposal, based on the premise that additional and  perhaps unique measures are needed to protect air commerce, would  require that shippers consent to DOT\u2019s opening packages shipped by air  for inspection.

As discussed in the background section of this report,  these regulations define dangerous goods, identify those that may and may  not travel by air, and specify how the materials are to be packaged,  handled, and carried. In addition, the regulations prescribe initial and  recurrent training for shippers\u2019 and carriers\u2019 employees, and require  shippers and carriers to test their employees\u2019 understanding of the  material covered in the training. The training, which is designed to  increase dangerous goods employees\u2019 safety awareness and to reduce the  frequency of dangerous goods incidents, is important because insufficient  understanding of the rules is often a factor contributing to such incidents.  For example, in 17 of 25 dangerous goods enforcement cases we reviewed  involving businesses, FAA identified employees\u2019 lack of training as a  contributing factor.", "To monitor the effectiveness of its regulations in promoting safety, RSPA  collects information on dangerous goods incidents occurring in the air,  water, rail, and truck modes through its Form 5800.1. Nonetheless, the  form is not designed to collect all the information that would be useful in  monitoring the effectiveness of DOT\u2019s dangerous goods regulations.

While the form has space for  written comments, there is no mechanism for standardizing and entering  the information from the comments into DOT\u2019s databases. RSPA is  revising the form to overcome these limitations. Once carriers begin  collecting information on dangerous goods incidents using this revised  form, better information on the incidence of undeclared shipments and  reasons for packaging deficiencies should be available to FAA and the  other operating administrations.", "In the course of such monitoring, DOT sometimes identifies safety issues  that require further research. For example, DOT is currently evaluating  ways in which it will strengthen the regulations for shipping batteries,  because its analysis indicated that the existing dangerous goods  regulations for these shipments may not be sufficient. Beginning in the  early 1990s, FAA identified a number of incidents associated with  batteries, particularly lithium batteries, aboard aircraft in which the  batteries caused fires, smoke, or extreme heat\u2014precisely the kind of  effects that make dangerous goods dangerous. In response to these and  other concerns, RSPA has taken a number of actions designed to improve  the regulations for the transportation of lithium batteries.", "FAA\u2019s monitoring of reports on incidents involving dangerous goods also  led to further work on packaging standards. In examining nearly 3,000  reports from 1998 and 1999, FAA found that 60 percent of the incidents  involved properly declared shipments, indicating that the shipments  complied with the existing packaging standards. Yet just over half (873) of  these properly declared shipments had problems because their packaging  failed\u2014that is, their closures or seals leaked. These data prompted FAA to  attempt to determine the adequacy of packaging standards for air  transportation and the likely causes of leaking closures and seals.  Observing an increase in the number of package failures in the past 3  years, FAA questioned whether the existing test methods simulate the  realistic combined effects of pressure, temperature, and vibration. As a  result, FAA contracted with Michigan State University to study packaging  in air transportation. The results of that study, which FAA recently  received, indicate that closures are continuing to leak in packages marked  as complying with existing packaging standards. Subjecting packages to  both high altitude and vibration resulted in a package failure rate of 50  percent. RSPA is reviewing these results.", "To help prevent dangerous goods incidents aboard passenger aircraft, FAA  and RSPA conduct outreach to the public. For example, FAA worked with  RSPA to develop for air travelers a brochure that lists items prohibited in  passenger baggage (see app. I). The brochure also explains that in-flight  variations in temperature and pressure can cause seemingly harmless  items to leak or generate toxic fumes during air travel. RSPA requires that  signs be posted in airport terminals and at check-in counters listing items  prohibited in air travel, some of which passengers may not recognize as  hazardous in air transportation. In addition, FAA has placed kiosks with  information on dangerous goods at 24 major airports to better inform the  general public about items that are considered hazardous onboard aircraft.", "The Postal Service also does consumer outreach to better inform the  public about the materials that may and may not be sent through the mail.  According to Postal Service officials, there are posters in all of its facilities  that warn customers about shipping restricted dangerous goods.

According to  officials of one of the carriers, the steps involved in becoming a known  shipper reduce to an acceptable level the risk that the shipper presents to  the carrier. By contrast, the carriers have found, casual or one-time  shippers are more likely to offer undeclared dangerous goods for  shipment. Three of the four carriers said they try to limit their business  with casual or one-time shippers and do not advertise to them. Rather, two  of the carriers said, they target business-to-business shippers that typically  have experience with shipping high volumes of dangerous goods and may  have long-standing relationships with the carriers. The fourth carrier said  that it does not accept dangerous goods from casual shippers at all and,  for other shippers, requires the establishment of a dangerous goods\u2013 shipping agreement, or contract, that spells out obligations for shippers,  such as recurring employee-training requirements.

For example, the carriers said they refuse to  carry materials such as toxic or infectious substances, certain explosives,  and organic peroxides. In addition, one of the carriers said it would not  accept dangerous goods shipments at its retail establishments. This carrier  said it would accept such shipments only when its own drivers picked  them up from established customers.

The intent of this program is to prevent explosives in the mail,  but Postal Service officials indicated it has a residual benefit in helping to  prevent undeclared shipments of dangerous goods.

For example, a driver picking up a shipment  from a customer who typically sends some dangerous goods would be  expected to raise questions if the customer did not label or declare any of  the packages as dangerous. In such an instance, the shipper may have  made a mistake or forgotten to declare the dangerous goods.", "The Postal Service trains its retail employees, who accept packages from  the public, to screen packages and prevent those with undeclared or  improperly packaged dangerous goods from entering the mail system.  According to Postal Service officials, as of August 2002, the agency had  trained all 131,000 of its retail employees in procedures for preventing the  acceptance of any package containing prohibited materials. These  procedures include (1) asking shippers a series of questions about the  contents of their packages, including whether the packages contain  anything hazardous; (2) visually inspecting packages to look for signs of  problems, such as leaks, the lack of a return address, or markings  indicating that a package contains something a shipper may not know is  hazardous; and (3) referring to a reference guide for assistance in  answering shippers\u2019 questions about items that may or may not be  permissible in the U.S. mail.

In late 2001, the Postal Service began  including in the mystery shopper tests a determination of whether the  retail employees were following requirements for asking the question  about dangerous goods. To date, the Postal Service\u2019s tests indicate that the  retail employees asked the required screening question 69 percent of the  time. When the retail employees failed to ask the dangerous goods  question, Postal Service officials said they provided feedback and  retrained the employees.
