While the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Fostering Connections Act) allows tribes to administer a title IV-E foster care program, it generally did not modify title IV-E's requirements for tribes. By contrast, some other programs administered by HHS offer tribes additional flexibilities, provided they are consistent with the objectives of the program. Given tribes' resource constraints and cultural values, adopting some title IV-E requirements has been difficult. For example, officials from 6 of 11 tribes developing title IV-E programs that GAO interviewed said that the requirement to electronically submit case-level data on all children in foster care was challenging. In addition, 7 of these 11 tribal officials reported that incorporating termination of parental rights\u2014which severs the legal parent-child relationship in certain circumstances\u2014into their tribal codes was challenging because it conflicts with their cultural values. HHS recognizes that termination of parental rights may not be part of an Indian tribe's traditional beliefs; however according to the agency it lacks the statutory authority to provide a general exemption for tribal children from the requirement.", "HHS provided assistance to tribes interested in directly operating a title IV-E program through its regional offices, headquarters office, and technical assistance providers. Eight of the 11 tribes GAO spoke with reported using HHS-funded technical assistance providers, including a tribally-focused center that was established after the enactment of the Fostering Connections Act. However, GAO found that there are no procedures in place to ensure that the guidance provided by HHS regional staff is consistent across offices or that the review of tribes' draft IV-E plans is timely. To operate a title IV-E program, HHS must approve a tribe's title IV-E plan, ensuring that it complies with program requirements. HHS does not provide its staff or tribes with examples of tribal codes or regulations that would satisfy title IV-E requirements. Regional staff may use their discretion to determine what is allowable in a tribe's plan. HHS officials said they do not provide examples because each tribe is unique and examples for one tribe may not be appropriate for all tribes. However, officials from 6 of 11 tribes GAO interviewed said that they received conflicting guidance from HHS officials, some of them from the same HHS office. Officials from one tribe said that participating in title IV-E peer-to-peer consultations with other tribes\u2014an activity encouraged and sponsored by HHS\u2014can be frustrating because regional offices have provided tribes with different information. HHS officials said that inconsistencies often resulted from differing tribal circumstances rather than interpretations of federal policy. In addition, officials from six tribes GAO spoke with said HHS's suggested revisions on their draft title IV-E plans were not provided in a timely manner. HHS headquarters officials have not provided regional staff with expected timeframes for draft title IV-E plan reviews and there is no limit on the amount of time staff may spend on the reviews.

According to headquarters officials, ACF centralized its  technical assistance for tribes to ensure that ACF is proactively identifying  and providing assistance to tribes. To address tribes\u2019 past access  concerns, the tribal-capacity center provider has proposed a new  technical assistance request process, which it will finalize with ACF  before the center begins providing services in January 2015. The three  new centers will also be expected to work together and in close  coordination with the regional offices, according to ACF officials.", "In addition to these access issues, some tribal officials we interviewed  said the assistance received from HHS lacked cultural understanding.  Representatives of 7 of the 11 tribes developing title IV-E plans we  interviewed said that they experienced cultural insensitivity when  receiving assistance from HHS staff. Tribal officials told us that HHS  headquarters and regional staff did not appropriately acknowledge the  government-to-government relationship the United States has with  federally recognized tribes. For example, three tribal officials reported that  HHS regional officials\u2019 approach was inappropriately prescriptive when  working with their tribe. These tribal officials preferred that HHS instead  explain the title IV-E requirements and then allow the tribes to determine  how to meet them. Officials from two tribes also reported that HHS was  not aware that federal law authorizes a hiring preference for Indians in  some circumstances, and initially did not permit inclusion of this  preference in the tribes\u2019 title IV-E plan based on discrimination  concerns. All five of the tribal child welfare experts we interviewed were  also concerned that HHS\u2019s assistance does not always meet the needs of  tribes. These experts cited HHS officials\u2019 lack of experience working with  tribes and understanding of the type of technical assistance needed, such  as in-person or intensive capacity-building assistance. In a recent report,  HHS also noted that in-person meetings with tribal communities can help  build relationships and facilitate meaningful conversations.", "Development grantees raised these cultural concerns to HHS in 2010 and  the agency has taken some steps to address them. For example, as of  August 2014, ACF staff had visited all but two of the tribal IV-E  development grantees and had plans to visit the remaining grantees. ACF  officials reported that the visits have been helpful in establishing  relationships with tribal officials, learning about the tribes\u2019 government  structures, and providing a greater understanding of what it means to run  a title IV-E program on tribal lands. ACF also has regular monthly phone  calls with development grantees, among other activities, to build  relationships. ACF headquarters officials also reported holding some staff  training related to working with tribal nations. For example, ACF reported  holding a cross training in July 2014 with the HHS Office of Family  Assistance, and BIA\u2019s Chief of Social Services on BIA child welfare  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Does Not Have Procedures in Place to Ensure Consistent Guidance or Timely Reviews of Draft Title IV-E Plans", "paragraphs": ["Although HHS regional staff are the primary technical assistance  providers for tribes, we found that some guidance and relevant HHS  regulations were not in place at the time they began assisting tribes with  their title IV-E plans. The Fostering Connections Act authorized HHS to  begin providing title IV-E development grants to tribes in 2009; however,  ACF issued tribal title IV-E guidance for HHS staff and tribes over several  years. Federal standards for internal control state that relevant  information should be identified and distributed in a form and time frame  that allows staff to perform their duties. Regional officials had to begin  assisting the first groups of tribal IV-E development grantees without  some of this guidance in place. For example, specific guidance on how to  develop a CAM was not finalized until the first group of grantees was 14  months into the 24-month award period. Similarly, HHS\u2019s interim final rule  implementing the tribal title IV-E program was issued after the first two  grantee groups had completed the majority of their award periods.", "While ACF has developed, over time, additional title IV-E guidance for  regional offices to use as they work with tribes, it has not developed  procedures to ensure that the guidance is consistent across all HHS  regional offices. ACF officials said the title IV-E pre-print document is the  regional officials\u2019 primary source for information on program requirements  and how HHS ensures consistent interpretation of program requirements  across offices. While the pre-print document lists all title IV-E  requirements, it does not provide examples of tribal codes or  administrative regulations that would meet those requirements. Regional  staff may use their discretion to determine what is allowable in a tribe\u2019s  plan. A senior ACF official acknowledged that some regional officials may  interpret title IV-E requirements differently than others. Regional officials  have the option to send questions that emerge from tribal-regional office  discussions to headquarters for resolution. ACF headquarters officials  said they forward any resulting clarifications that are important for all  tribes to all regional offices for their use in future discussions with tribes.", "Despite these efforts by ACF, officials from 6 of the 11 tribes developing  title IV-E plans we spoke with told us that they received inconsistent  guidance from HHS regional officials while developing their plans. For  example, officials from one tribe said they received conflicting information  from HHS regional staff regarding a word the tribe could use\u2014other than  \u201ctermination\u201d\u2014to address title IV-E\u2019s termination of parental rights  requirements in a way more aligned with their cultural values. These  officials also said that participating in title IV-E peer-to-peer consultations  with other tribes\u2014an activity encouraged and sponsored by HHS\u2014can be  frustrating because regional offices have provided tribes with different  information. Representatives from another tribe said they began tracking  the information received from their HHS regional office because staff  provided conflicting guidance on the same issues over time. These tribal  officials recommended that HHS provide the same guidance to tribes  regardless of their location and create a threshold for what is minimally  acceptable for meeting title IV-E requirements, such as providing an  example of documentation that would satisfy the termination of parental  rights requirement. Two grantees from our conference discussion groups  also reported receiving different responses to the same questions from  officials within the same HHS regional office. ACF officials told us tribes  can contact headquarters staff if they receive conflicting information from  their regional office.", "Child welfare experts we spoke to and two studies we reviewed also  identified inconsistent guidance from HHS staff as a challenge for tribes.  The two experts we interviewed said such inconsistencies made it difficult  for tribes to develop title IV-E programs. One expert said inconsistencies  and delays in receiving information have frustrated and discouraged  some tribes that are in the process of developing their title IV-E programs.  In addition, a 2013 study that we reviewed concluded that consistent  interpretation of federal law and guidance is critical for tribes to develop  approvable title IV-E plans. Another study we reviewed recommended  that in order to address ambiguities and inconsistent interpretation in  tribal IV-E policies and regulations, there should be explicit models,  guidelines, and tools for tribes and HHS to use while developing title IV-E  plans. According to ACF officials, they have not provided tribes or  regional office staff with examples because the language in the examples  for one tribe may not be appropriate for all tribes.", "We also found that ACF does not have procedures in place to ensure  timely reviews of submitted draft title IV-E plans. The tribal title IV-E  regulations established a process and timeline for the review of final title  IV-E plans (see fig. 6 for process for review of final title IV-E plans).", "In contrast, no similar process exists for the review of draft title IV-E  plans. Before submitting a final IV-E plan to HHS for review, tribes submit  draft plans to their regional HHS offices, whose staff then work with the  tribe to finalize the plan. However, ACF has not set any expectations for  regional office staff on the amount of time they should spend reviewing  draft title IV-E plans. A senior ACF official explained that the agency does  not provide expected timeframes for regional office reviews of draft plans  and that there is not any limitation on the amount of time staff can spend  reviewing the plans. Federal standards for internal control state that  information should be recorded and communicated within a timeframe  that enables relevant entities to carry out their responsibilities. Given  HHS\u2019s goal of approving more tribal title IV-E plans, a lack of draft IV-E  plan review timeframes for its staff could continue to result in long tribal  IV-E plan development and review periods.", "HHS\u2019s process for reviewing and working with tribes to finalize title IV-E  plans is iterative, meaning there are many discussions between tribes  and their regional office to revise the draft IV-E plan and ensure it meets  program requirements before it is finalized. We examined HHS  documentation for the five tribes with approved title IV-E plans. We found  it took from 5 to 33 months to finalize and approve the tribes\u2019 title IV-E  plans after they submitted their draft plans to HHS (at the end of the 24- month initial development grant period).", "While HHS\u2019s iterative process for reviewing draft IV-E plans worked well  for some tribes, others reported challenges with the timeliness of these  reviews. A representative for one tribe that had submitted its title IV-E  plan for review said the tribe\u2019s HHS regional office returned draft plan  sections in plenty of time for the tribe to make revisions. However,  officials from four tribes we interviewed and two additional conference  attendees, all of whom had submitted their title IV-E plans, reported  untimely reviews by their HHS regional office. One tribal official said the  tribe expected a response from its HHS regional office within 45 to 60  days, based on prior federal program experience, but no review  timeframe was communicated by HHS regional officials and the tribe had  to wait approximately three months for a response. This official estimated  that the review process was extended by at least 6 months due to HHS  regional office delays. Officials from two additional tribes also noted that  HHS regional offices did not provide updates on their plans after  submission and they had to follow-up with HHS in order to learn the  status of their plan. Some tribal officials said delays in HHS regional office  responses cost additional tribal staff time, which strained their limited staff  and resources. ACF officials reported, however, that certain tribal actions  taken to address HHS revisions can result in delays. These include  responding to HHS\u2019s suggested changes, scheduling meetings, and  coordinating with states."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While the Fostering Connections Act provided a new opportunity for tribes  to access federal child welfare funding for the care of their children, the  act also required tribes to meet title IV-E\u2019s complex program requirements  which were originally designed for states. Given existing tribal resource  constraints, many tribes have faced challenges in developing approvable  title IV-E plans. These challenges have been further complicated by  inconsistent guidance from HHS. Ensuring consistent guidance on tribal  title IV-E requirements across all HHS offices could help the agency more  effectively communicate program requirements to tribes and support  tribes in developing their title IV-E plans. While some tribes received  timely title IV-E draft plan reviews, others did not, in part because HHS  has not provided its regional office staff with expected timeframes for  reviewing draft title IV-E plans. Establishing procedures to ensure timely  reviews could improve relationships with tribes and promote a smoother  process for tribes developing their plans. These changes would also  support HHS\u2019s strategic goals of approving more tribal title IV-E plans.  Without improvements in the consistency of HHS guidance and timeliness  of title IV-E plan reviews, tribes may continue to have limited direct  access to child welfare program funding, hindering tribes\u2019 ability to take  advantage of this opportunity to exercise tribal sovereignty over their  foster care programs. In addition, given tribes\u2019 resource constraints, the  complexities of title IV-E\u2019s statutory requirements and HHS\u2019s limited  authority to modify them, the agency could benefit from considering, in  consultation with tribes, if flexibilities in program requirements would help  more tribes develop successful title IV-E plans without compromising  requirements that children be placed in safe and stable environments.  Both HHS and tribes are committed to ensuring that tribal children in  foster care are well cared for, and a collaborative approach to considering  flexibilities in program requirements would help maintain that goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help enhance tribes\u2019 participation in the title IV-E program, the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with tribes,  should take steps to consider whether additional flexibilities in program  requirements would be helpful for tribes in developing title IV-E plans,  while also maintaining safe and stable out-of-home care for children. If  HHS determines, as part of this process, that statutory changes are  necessary to implement these flexibilities, it should develop and submit  an appropriate legislative proposal to Congress.", "To improve the consistency of assistance provided to tribes, the  Secretary of Health and Human Services should take steps to provide  consistent title IV-E guidance to tribes across its regional offices.", "To improve the timeliness of assistance provided to tribes, the Secretary  of Health and Human Services should establish procedures to ensure  reviews of draft title IV-E plans are conducted by regional office staff in a  timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.

HHS also  provided technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate.", "HHS concurred with our recommendation that the agency, in consultation  with tribes, consider whether additional flexibilities in title IV-E program  requirements would enable more tribes to participate in the program. HHS  noted the importance of continuing to engage in tribal consultation around  programs and policies affecting tribal child welfare services. According to  HHS, if it determines that legislative changes are necessary to facilitate  greater tribal participation in title IV-E, the agency plans to consider  developing legislative proposals, in the context of existing procedures for  the development of the President\u2019s budget.", "HHS also concurred with our recommendation that the agency take steps  to provide consistent title IV-E guidance to tribes across its regional  offices. The agency noted that it has taken an initial step to improve  consistency. Specifically, HHS stated that it plans to hire a tribal  coordinator to work in the office of the Associate Commissioner of the  Children\u2019s Bureau at ACF to help ensure greater consistency by  facilitating additional communication across HHS regional office staff and  among tribes. In addition, HHS commented that reported inconsistencies  may be related to differing circumstances between grantees rather than  differing interpretations of federal policy. HHS noted that this further  reinforces the need to have clear and effective communications with HHS  staff and with tribal officials.", "With regard to our third recommended action, HHS agreed that it is  important to provide timely feedback to development grantees and noted  that the department currently provides feedback through a variety of  communication methods. However, the department did not agree that  procedures were needed to ensure the timely review of draft title IV-E  plans at this time. The department acknowledged that the agency has not  established firm timeframes for working with states or tribes during the  development phase. HHS believes that it is not possible to respond to  tribes\u2019 draft IV-E plan submissions within a specific timeframe given the  lack of consistency in materials received from tribal grantees, and HHS  reported establishing a protocol for conducting monthly calls with  development grantees to provide feedback and respond to questions.", "We maintain that establishing procedures, including but not limited to  timeframes for responses, would help ensure that tribes receive timely  feedback from regional offices regarding their draft title IV-E plans. This is  because we found that of the five tribes with approved title IV-E plans, it  took a median of 28 months to finalize and approve their title IV-E plans  after submitting a draft to HHS. We noted in the report that HHS has an  iterative process for reviewing draft title IV-E plans and that certain tribal  actions taken to address HHS revisions, such as scheduling meetings  and coordinating with states, can result in delays. We also noted that  while this iterative review process worked well for some tribes, others  reported challenges with the timeliness of these reviews. For example,  officials from two tribes told us that HHS regional offices did not provide  updates on their plans after submission and that they had to follow-up  with HHS to learn the status of their plan. HHS\u2019s plan to hire a tribal  coordinator along with continuing to conduct monthly conference calls  with development grantees are positive steps towards improving  communication across the regions and with tribes.

To address our objectives we conducted interviews with officials of tribes  and federal agencies, and child welfare experts. We interviewed  representatives from 17 federally recognized tribes and tribal consortia in  Alaska, Arizona, California, Michigan, Montana, Oklahoma, and  Washington. Tribes in these states were selected to achieve variation in  how far along the tribe was in developing a title IV-E program and size of  the tribe. These 17 tribes are located in five different HHS regions. Our  tribal interviewees included representatives of 10 tribes that received a  title IV-E development grant and one tribe that is approved to operate the  program, but did not receive a development grant. In the report, we  referred to this group as the 11 tribes we interviewed that are developing  title IV-E plans. The group of 11 tribes also included four of the five tribes  with approved title IV-E plans. In addition, we interviewed six tribes that  expressed interest initially but have not sought approval to operate a title  IV-E program. We also convened two discussion groups with tribes. One  discussion group was held at the National Indian Child Welfare  Association annual conference in April 2014 and the other was held at the  Casey Family Programs Tribal Title IV-E Development Plan Grantee  Convening in May 2014. Our discussion groups were advertised in the  agendas for these events and all tribes in attendance at these events  were invited to participate. In total, representatives of 19 tribes  participated in the two discussion groups. Of the 19 tribes represented in  our two discussion groups, six tribes participated in both discussion  groups. We interviewed eight of these 19 tribes individually based on our  aforementioned selection criteria, and 12 of these tribes received title IV- E development grants. The information obtained in our interviews and  discussion groups with tribes is not generalizable, but provides examples  of tribes\u2019 experiences with developing title IV-E programs and obtaining  related HHS technical assistance.", "We interviewed officials from HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and  Families (ACF), including the nine regional offices that provide technical  assistance to federally recognized tribes and the fiscal year 2010-2014  HHS-funded tribal resource center. We also interviewed Social Services  program staff at the Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs  (BIA). In addition to conducting interviews, to help determine HHS\u2019s role  with regards to tribal title IV-E programs, we reviewed relevant federal  laws, regulations, HHS guidance from January 2008 to November 2014,  and federal standards for internal control. We also reviewed ACF\u2019s  strategic plan and the Interim Final Rule implementing the tribal title IV-E  program.", "We conducted key word searches of various databases, such as  ProQuest and EconLit, to identify peer-reviewed journal articles,  association publications, and government reports published from January  2008 to May 2014 on tribes\u2019 experiences with the title IV-E program. We  identified additional studies related to tribal title IV-E on the National Child  Welfare Resource Center for Tribes\u2019 website. Five studies we identified  during this literature review are included in this report. In addition, we  interviewed five child welfare experts. We interviewed these experts  because they had researched and published studies on tribal child  welfare issues related to the title IV-E program. Some of these experts  were identified via the review of studies described above.", "We analyzed all semi-annual progress reports submitted to HHS from  March 2010 through March 2014 for the 21 tribes awarded grants from  fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013. We reported our analysis for  the 11 tribes that were awarded grants from fiscal year 2009 through  fiscal year 2011 because these tribes have completed their grant period.  Development grantees self-report to HHS the progress made in  developing their title IV-E programs in each semi-annual progress report,  using the SF-PPR, Performance Progress Report. HHS has published  overall guidance on the grants through its Grants Policy Statement. Each  tribe submitted between one and seven progress reports depending on  when it received the title IV-E development grant from HHS. For example,  the 11 tribes that were awarded grants in fiscal year 2009 through fiscal  year 2011 submitted between four and seven progress reports. We  confirmed that each development grantee submitted a complete set of  required progress reports.", "To analyze the progress reports, we defined a list of activities tribes may  engage in as they work on the title IV-E plan based on the program\u2019s  requirements as outlined in the title IV-E pre-print and our interviews with  tribes and HHS. Two analysts independently reviewed a sample of the  progress reports using those definitions. Based on that review we refined  and finalized the list of potential title IV-E program development activities.  One analyst then independently analyzed the entire set of progress  reports using the final categories. Tribes were counted as having  engaged in an activity if an example of the activity was in at least one  progress report. A second analyst reviewed and verified each of the  progress reports and associated counts. Since the progress reports  included sections for the tribes to describe accomplishments and  problems they encountered while developing a title IV-E plan, our  analysis was also used to identify obstacles the tribes faced and  examples of their experiences using HHS assistance. However, the  tribes\u2019 self-reported data has limitations, including being subject to  inaccuracies, containing differing definitions of activities, recall errors, or  choosing to selectively describe some activities over others which would  affect the accuracy of our coding of activities. In addition, according to an  HHS official, tribes were instructed to report on all progress made in  developing title IV-E programs. As a result, it is possible that tribes used  other funds in addition to those provided via the IV-E development grant  to complete the activities described in their progress reports. While we did  not attempt to verify the accuracy of the progress reports, we did check  for internal inconsistencies or illogical content during the course of our  review. In addition, while self-reporting errors may affect the accuracy of  the content of individual reports, we focused on tribes that had submitted  at least four progress reports and the coding we used to identify activities  was based on whether there was at least one instance of an activity such  as hiring personnel or developing specific procedures in any of the  completed progress reports. Allowing for an activity to be reported across  any of the reports may reduce some inaccuracies, such as errors  associated with recall bias. We determined that the progress reports were  sufficient enough to provide a general description of the activities  undertaken by tribal development grantees to help establish their title IV- E programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Elizabeth Morrison (Assistant  Director), Andrea Dawson (Analyst-in-Charge), Maria Gaona, and Kwame  Som-Pimpong made key contributions to this report.
