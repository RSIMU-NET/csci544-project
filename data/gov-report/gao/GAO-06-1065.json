The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not pursued some tax debt because of limited resources and higher priorities.

IRS has developed a Private Debt Collection (PDC) program to start with a limited implementation in September 2006 and fuller implementation in January 2008.

GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed officials to identify IRS's approaches and steps taken to address the factors. Taken together, IRS's actions were intended to ensure that the PCAs will be able to do the job and work the range of cases assigned, IRS will have the necessary resources and caseload ready, and taxpayer rights and data will be protected. Even with this progress, IRS has not completed work for three subfactors--setting results-oriented goals and measures, determining all PDC program costs, and evaluating the program based on the results-oriented goals and measures, once they are established. As a result, IRS risks not providing complete information that decision makers would find useful. Finishing work on the factors could help achieve but cannot guarantee program success, which also depends, in part, on how IRS addresses the factors and identifies and resolves any problems in the limited implementation phase. Although IRS officials indicated that a purpose of the limited implementation phase is to assure readiness for full implementation to up to 12 PCAs, IRS has not yet documented how it will identify and use the lessons learned to ensure that each critical success factor is addressed before expanding the program starting in January 2008. Because program success will be affected by how well IRS makes adjustments, assessing the lessons learned in limited implementation is critical. Also, IRS has not documented criteria that it will use to determine whether the limited implementation performance warrants program expansion. IRS officials indicated that they are considering criteria that could trigger a go/no go decision, such as the amount of taxes collected and indications of PCAs abusing taxpayers or misusing taxpayer data. IRS has not decided on whether these targets will include comparing the taxes collected to program costs, which was a key reason for canceling a 1996 PCA pilot program. Finally, IRS will have a little more than a half year to identify the lessons learned before incorporating them into the next contract solicitation, which IRS intends to release in March 2007. Related to such decisions on expansion is IRS's planned comparative study of using PCAs. That study is to compare using PCAs to investing IRS's PDC-related operating costs into having IRS staff work IRS's \"next best\" collection cases. Under the documented study design, IRS would exclude the fees paid to PCAs from the costs and subtract those fees from the tax debts collected by PCAs. While such a study might produce useful information, it will not compare the results of using PCAs with the results IRS could get if given the same amount of resources, including the fees to be paid to PCAs, to use in what IRS officials would judge to be the best way to meet tax collection goals. Adequately designing and implementing the study is important to ensure policymakers are aware of the true costs of contracting with PCAs and know whether PCAs offer the best use of federal funds."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, the federal government does not collect billions of dollars of  delinquent taxes. At the end of fiscal year 2005, the Internal Revenue  Service\u2019s (IRS) inventory of delinquent tax debt with some collection  potential was $132 billion (up from $122 billion in the previous year).  Because of inadequate resources to deal with the workload and the need  to work higher priority cases, IRS has shelved or delayed collection on  billons of dollars of delinquent taxes due since 1999. In addition, voluntary  compliance may be undermined to the extent taxpayers become aware  that IRS is unable to collect taxes due.", "Because of concerns about, and congressional consideration of, proposals  that IRS use private collection agencies (PCA) to help collect more of the  growing tax debt inventory, in May 2004 we issued a report on IRS\u2019s efforts  to plan for a Private Debt Collection (PDC) program. We identified 5  critical success factors and 17 related subfactors that should be addressed  to help ensure that a PDC program achieves desired results and  recommended that after gaining some experience with PCAs, IRS do a  study to compare the use of PCAs to another collection strategy that IRS  officials determine to be the most effective and efficient overall way of  achieving collection goals.", "In October 2004, Congress authorized PDC contracting authority in the  American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Based on that authority, IRS has  contracted with 3 PCAs as part of a planned limited implementation phase  that started with delinquent tax cases being turned over to the PCAs on  September 7, 2006, and has plans to expand the program, beginning in  January 2008, eventually to up to 12 PCAs. However, members of  Congress, the National Treasury Employees Union, the National Taxpayer  Advocate, and others continue to raise concerns about IRS using PCAs,  such as the potential for misuse of taxpayer data, taxpayer mistreatment,  or higher costs and lower effectiveness when compared to hiring more IRS  employees.", "Given our 2004 report and these concerns, you asked that we answer these  questions:    To what extent will IRS have addressed the critical success factors before  turning over collection cases to PCAs for the limited implementation  phase?", "How will IRS use the lessons learned from the limited implementation  phase to assess critical success factors and program performance before  full program implementation?  Is the design of IRS\u2019s planned study of using PCAs adequate to provide  useful information to help determine whether contracting is the best use  of federal funds for achieving tax collection goals?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed available IRS documents and  interviewed responsible IRS officials to identify the steps taken. For  example, to determine the extent to which IRS has addressed the critical  success factors before sending cases for the limited implementation phase,  we sought documentation on IRS\u2019s steps taken to address each of the 17  subfactors. For areas such as the contracting process, information  systems, and cost tracking, we used generally accepted criteria. We  focused on whether IRS would complete the steps to address each  subfactor. We did not test or otherwise evaluate how well IRS\u2019s actions  would work or address the factors. Appendix I summarizes the results of  our work for each of the subfactors as well as the results of our work on  the other two questions through a series of briefing slides. Appendix II  offers more details on our scope and methodology overall. We did our  work from August 2005 to September 2006 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IRS has two major programs to collect tax debts. First, IRS staff in the  telephone function may attempt collection over the phone or in writing.  Second, if more in-depth collection action is required, field collection staff  may visit delinquent taxpayers at their homes or businesses as well as  contact them by telephone and mail. Under certain circumstances, IRS  staff can initiate enforced collection action, such as recording liens on  taxpayer property and sending notices to levy taxpayer wages, bank  accounts, and other financial assets held by third parties. Field collection  staff also can be authorized to seize other taxpayer assets to satisfy the tax  debt. However, as we have previously reported, IRS has deferred  collection action on billions of dollars of delinquent tax debt and, until  recently, IRS collection program performance indicators have declined, in  part because of higher workload in other priority areas and unbudgeted  cost increases (such as for rent or pay). Although IRS data indicate that  trends in collections have shown some improvements, the enforcement of  the tax laws\u2014including the collection of unpaid taxes\u2014remains one of  GAO\u2019s \u201chigh-risk\u201d areas of government.", "To help address the growing tax debt inventory and declines in IRS\u2019s tax  collection efforts, the Department of the Treasury proposed that Congress  authorize IRS to use PCAs to help collect tax debts for simpler types of  cases, paying them out of a revolving fund of tax revenues that they  collect. IRS officials said that this proposal arose, in part, because of the  belief that Congress was not likely to provide the increased budget to hire  enough IRS staff to work the inventory of collection cases.", "In 2004, Congress authorized IRS to use PCAs to take certain defined steps  to collect tax debts\u2014including locating taxpayers, requesting full payment  of the tax debt or offering taxpayers installment agreements if full  payment cannot be made, and obtaining financial information from  taxpayers. PCAs are to have limited authorities and are not to adjust the  amount of tax debts or to use enforcement powers to collect the debts,  which are inherently governmental functions that are to be performed by  IRS employees. IRS is authorized to pay PCAs up to 25 percent of the  amount of tax debts collected and retain another 25 percent of taxes  collected to fund IRS collection enforcement activities.", "IRS initially envisions using PCAs on simpler cases that have no need for  IRS enforcement action and that involve individual taxpayers that (1) filed  tax returns showing taxes due but did not pay all those taxes and (2) made  three or more voluntary payments to satisfy an additional tax assessed by  IRS but have stopped the payments. To start, IRS plans to send cases to  PCAs that have not recently been worked by IRS because of their lower  priority, such as cases set aside because of inadequate IRS resources to  work them or those in the queue to be worked but not yet assigned to IRS  staff. After gaining some experience, IRS plans to expand the types of  cases to be sent to PCAs to include those unassigned cases that IRS staff  now may work, including those in which IRS attempts to find taxpayers  that appeared to not file required tax returns, according to IRS officials.", "IRS first attempted to contract collections with a pilot test in 1996 but  abandoned the effort, in part, because the $3.1 million collected fell below  the $4.1 million in direct costs plus the $17 million in lost revenues from  using IRS staff to work on the pilot test rather than collect taxes. Also,  limitations in IRS\u2019s computer systems and ability to transfer data  hampered efforts to send appropriate cases to PCAs.", "The current PDC program differs from the 1996 pilot because IRS will  require PCAs to try to resolve collection cases within guidelines rather  than just remind taxpayers of their debt, will pay PCAs a percentage of  dollars they collect rather than a fixed fee, and will electronically send and  protect taxpayer data rather than send the cases manually. Appendix III  provides some data and information about the PDC program in terms of  costs, projected tax revenue to be collected, staffing, and cases to be sent  to PCAs.", "Our 2004 report identified and validated five critical success factors for  contracting with PCAs to collect tax debt. Table 1 describes the critical  success factors and their related subfactors.", "To identify the critical success factors, we reviewed reports on contracting  and interviewed parties with experience in contracting for debt collection,  such as officials from 11 states, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial  Management Service, the Department of Education, and three PCA firms  that IRS selected as subject matter experts for the program. To  corroborate the factors, we interviewed officials from IRS who were  developing the PDC program, the IRS Office of Taxpayer Advocate, and  the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents IRS employees.  As a validation tool, we asked for comments on our draft list of factors  from those whom we consulted to identify the factors as well as from  officials at four additional PCA firms. We made changes based on their  comments where appropriate.", "After receiving authority to use PCAs in 2004, IRS had planned to issue  task orders to three PCAs in January 2006 as part of a limited  implementation phase running through December 2007. However, IRS was  delayed by a lawsuit and bid protest filed by certain PCAs to challenge  IRS\u2019s request for and evaluation of bids from PCAs. Specifically:  IRS issued a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to solicit debt collection  services for the PDC program on April 25, 2005, under which IRS would  start sending cases to three PCAs in January 2006. Because of a lawsuit  filed in June 2005, IRS revised and reissued the RFQ on October 14, 2005,  with plans to send cases to the PCAs in July 2006.  IRS selected the three PCAs on March 9, 2006. Because one of the PCAs  that were not selected filed a bid protest later in March 2006, IRS stopped  working with the three selected PCAs and pushed back the date to send  cases to those PCAs to the August-September 2006 time frame.  IRS prevailed in the bid protest in a decision issued on June 14, 2006,  allowing it to resume its work with the selected PCAs. IRS sent cases to  the three PCAs on September 7, 2006.", "In addition to contracting with PCAs, the PDC program includes IRS\u2019s  acquisition and deployment of an information system for automating case  selection and managing the case workload. IRS plans to eventually also  use this system to select and manage the caseloads for its telephone and  field collection functions. IRS had originally planned to deploy the system  with two limited-functionality subreleases concurrent with the limited  implementation phase (in which IRS is contracting with three PCAs  through December 2007) and begin ramping up the number of contractors  (eventually to up to 12) with the third, fully functional information system  subrelease in January 2008. However, IRS officials said that information  systems budget constraints require IRS to change its information system  plan. Although IRS has not yet finalized decisions on ramping up the  number of PCAs and implementing the information system, the proposed  plan IRS officials are considering is to begin increasing the number PCAs  and deploy an interim subrelease with some enhancements in January  2008, but delay the full-function subrelease indefinitely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 2, in preparation for turning over collection cases to  PCAs, as of September 15, 2006, IRS has made major progress in  addressing the 5 critical success factors and 17 related subfactors for  contracting for tax debt collection, but nevertheless has more to do.", "IRS has completed steps to address 14 of the 17 subfactors. Although IRS  has taken steps on the remaining 3 subfactors, IRS still has work to do to  complete addressing them. For example, IRS had not yet documented all  of its specific goals and related measures to orient and evaluate the PDC  program in terms of achieving desired results, such as goals and measures  for improving the productivity of IRS staff. Also, IRS had not determined  all historical program costs, that is, how much IRS has invested to date to  develop and implement the PDC program.

However, officials did not have  specifics on how IRS would ensure all factors had been adequately  addressed before moving to full implementation in January 2008. Also, IRS  has not documented criteria that it will use to determine whether limited  implementation phase performance was sufficient to warrant program  expansion. IRS officials indicated that they plan to further discuss  performance criteria that could trigger a go/no go decision, and might  consider criteria such as the amount of taxes collected and indications of  PCAs abusing taxpayers or misusing taxpayer data.

Even with this progress, IRS  has not yet completed the related steps that it must take for 3 subfactors  on setting goals and measures, determining all program costs, and  evaluating the program. Having information on whether the program met  its goals and desired results given the program costs would be critical for  policymakers. In addition, IRS lacks clear criteria and processes for  assessing how well it addressed the critical success factors and whether  the program performance warrants expanding the number of PCAs and  turning over more cases to them.", "It is understandable that IRS officials have focused on rolling out this new  program and dealing with many pressing concerns such as making sure  that the PCAs are ready and that IRS can do its part, while delaying work  on these three subfactors and on the criteria and processes for deciding on  future program expansion. However, if it waits too long, IRS risks not  having critical information in a timely and cost-effective manner in order  to answer important questions about whether the PDC program is  producing desired results at acceptable costs and whether the program  should be expanded. Having plans to answer these questions is especially  critical now that lawsuit and bid protest delays have reduced the time that  IRS has to collect and analyze performance data before having to make  decisions about expanding the PDC program. Therefore, it is all the more  important that IRS determine program costs and make decisions about its  goals and measures, evaluation plans, approach to assessing critical  success factors, and program expansion decision criteria as soon as  possible.", "Related to such decisions on expansion is IRS\u2019s planned comparative  study of using PCAs. If this study is not adequately designed and  implemented, policymakers may not be aware of the true costs of  contracting with PCAs\u2014including the fees paid to PCAs.
