At the request of the House Financial Services Committee, GAO was asked to provide a report on overall trends in management-level diversity and diversity initiatives from 1993 through 2004.

Two years ago, this  subcommittee held a hearing that raised concerns about the lack of  diversity in the financial services industry, particularly in key management  positions. As you may recall, some witnesses noted that these firms\u2014 banks and securities firms, for example\u2014had not made sufficient progress  in recruiting minorities and women at the management level. Others  expressed concerns about the ability of minority-owned businesses to  raise debt and equity capital.", "My remarks are based on our report that is being released today, which we  prepared at the request of the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of  the full committee, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and Representative David  Scott.  Specifically, I will discuss (1) what the available data show  about diversity at the management level in the financial services industry  from 1993 through 2004, (2) the types of initiatives that the financial  services industry and related organizations have taken to promote  workforce diversity and the challenges involved, and (3) the ability of  minority- and women-owned businesses to obtain capital and initiatives  financial institutions have taken to make capital available to these  businesses.", "For our analysis, we used the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission\u2019s (EEOC) Employer Information Report (EEO-1) data on  financial services firms with 100 or more employees. We also reviewed  publicly available information, including reports, and interviewed officials  from a variety of financial services firms, including commercial banks,  securities firms, and private equity/venture capital organizations, as well  as representatives from industry trade organizations and federal agencies.", "From 1993 through 2004, overall workforce diversity at the management  level in the financial services industry did not change substantially, but  some racial/ethnic minority groups experienced more change in  representation than others.

Specifically, African-Americans increased their  representation from 5.6 percent to 6.6 percent, Asians from 2.5 percent to  4.5 percent, Hispanics from 2.8 percent to 4.0 percent, and American  Indians from 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent. Representation by white women  remained constant at slightly more than one-third during this period, while  representation by white men declined from 52.2 percent to 47.2 percent.  Depository institutions, such as commercial banks, and insurance  companies generally were more diverse at the management level than  securities firms. In addition, according to the 2004 EEO-1 data, minorities  held 13.5 percent and white women held 32.4 percent of all \u201cofficials and  managers\u201d positions in the accounting industry.", "Although financial services firms and trade groups have initiated programs  to increase workforce diversity, these initiatives face challenges that may  help explain why overall diversity at the management level has not  changed substantially. Officials at financial services firms said that  diversity was an important goal and that top leadership was committed to  recruiting and retaining minority and women candidates. Some financial  services firms have established scholarship and internship programs or  partnered with groups that represent minority professionals.

A 2004 report by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s  Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) stated that minority- owned businesses may have difficulty obtaining capital because they are  often concentrated in service industries and lack sufficient assets to  pledge as collateral. Some studies suggest that lenders may discriminate  in deciding whether to make loans to minority businesses, but proving  such an allegation is complicated by the lack of available data. In  particular, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation B prohibits financial  institutions from requiring information on race and gender from applicants  for nonmortage credit products. Some federal financial regulators have  stated that removing the prohibition would allow them to better monitor  and enforce laws prohibiting discrimination in lending.

According to the EEO-1 data, the  financial services firms we reviewed for this testimony, which have 100 or  more staff, employed nearly 3 million people in 2004.  Moreover, according  to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in management and  professional positions in the financial services industry was expected to  grow at a rate of 1.2 percent annually through 2012. Finally, a recent U.S.  Census Bureau report based on data from the 2002 Economic Census  stated that, between 1997 and 2002, Hispanics in the United States opened  new businesses at a rate three times faster than the national average."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Diversity in the Financial Services Industry at the Management Level Did Not Change Substantially between 1993 and 2004", "paragraphs": ["Overall EEO-1 data do not show substantial changes in diversity at the  management level and suggest that certain financial sectors are more  diverse at this level than others.

Management-level  representation by white women was largely unchanged at slightly more  than one-third during the period, while representation by white men  declined from 52.2 percent to 47.2 percent.", "EEO-1 data may actually overstate representation levels for minorities and  white women in the most senior-level positions, such as Chief Executive  Officers of large investment firms or commercial banks, because the  category that captures these positions\u2014\u201dofficials and managers\u201d\u2014covers  all management positions. Thus, this category includes lower level  positions (e.g., assistant manager of a small bank branch) that may have a  higher representation of minorities and women.  In 2007, EEOC plans to  use a revised form for employers that divides this category into  \u201cexecutive/senior-level officers and managers\u201d and \u201cfirst/mid-level  officials,\u201d which could provide a more accurate picture of diversity among  senior managers.", "As shown in figure 2, EEO-1 data also show that the depository and  nondepository credit sectors, as well as the insurance sector, were  somewhat more diverse at the management level than the securities and  holdings and trust sectors. In 2004, minorities held 19.9 percent of  management-level positions in nondepository credit institutions, such as  mortgage bankers and brokers, but 12.4 percent in holdings and trusts,  such as investment companies.", "You also asked that we collect data on the accounting industry.

Some firms and trade  organizations have also developed partnerships with groups that represent  minority professionals and with local communities to recruit candidates  through events such as conferences and career fairs. To help retain  minorities and women, firms have established employee networks,  mentoring programs, diversity training, and leadership and career  development programs.", "Officials from some financial services firms we contacted, as well as  industry studies, noted that that financial services firms\u2019 senior managers  were involved in diversity initiatives. For example, according to an official  from an investment bank, the head of the firm meets with every minority  and female senior executive to discuss his or her career development.  Officials from a few commercial banks said that the banks had established  diversity \u201ccouncils\u201d of senior leaders to set the vision, strategy, and  direction of diversity initiatives. A 2005 industry trade group study and  some officials also noted that some companies were linking managers\u2019  compensation with their progress in hiring, promoting, and retaining  minority and women employees.", "A few firms have also developed performance indicators to measure  progress in achieving diversity goals. These indicators include workforce  representation, turnover, promotion of minority and women employees,  and employee satisfaction survey responses.

First, officials said that the industry  faced ongoing challenges in recruiting minority and women candidates.  According to industry officials, the industry lacks a critical mass of  minority employees, especially at the senior levels, to serve as role models  to attract and retain other minorities. Available data on minority students  enrolled in Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs suggest  that the pool of minorities, a source that may feed the \u201cpipeline\u201d for  management-level positions within the financial services industry and  other industries, is relatively small. In 2000, minorities accounted for 19  percent of all students enrolled in MBA programs in accredited U.S.  schools; in 2004, that student population had risen to 23 percent. Financial  services firms compete for this relatively small pool not only with one  another but also with firms from other industries.", "Evidence suggests, however, that the financial services industry may not  be fully leveraging its \u201cinternal\u201d pipeline of minority and women  employees for management-level positions. As shown in figure 3, there are  job categories within the financial services industry that generally have  more overall workforce diversity than the \u201cofficial and managers\u201d  category, particularly among minorities.  For example, minorities held 22  percent of \u201cprofessional\u201d positions in the industry in 2004 as compared  with 15 percent of \u201cofficials and managers\u201d positions.  According to a  recent EEOC report, the professional category represented a possible  pipeline of available management-level candidates. The EEOC states that  the chances of minorities and women (white and minority combined)  advancing from the professional category into management-level positions  is lower when compared with white males.", "Many officials from financial services firms and industry trade groups  agreed that retaining minority and women employees represented one of  the biggest challenges to promoting workforce diversity. One reason they  cited is that the industry, as described previously, lacks a critical mass of  minority men and women, particularly in senior-level positions, to serve as  role models. Without a critical mass, the officials said that minority or  women employees may lack the personal connections and access to  informal networks that are often necessary to navigate an organization\u2019s  culture and advance their careers.  For example, an official from a  commercial bank we contacted said he learned from staff interviews that  African-Americans believed that they were not considered for promotion  as often as others partly because they were excluded from informal  employee networks needed for promotion or to promote advancement.", "In addition, some industry officials said that achieving \u201cbuy-in\u201d from key  employees such as middle managers could be challenging. Middle  managers are particularly important to diversify institutions because they  are often responsible for implementing key aspects of diversity initiatives  and for explaining them to other employees.  However, the officials said  that middle managers may be focused on other aspects of their  responsibilities, such as meeting financial performance targets, rather than  the importance of implementing the organization\u2019s diversity initiatives.   Additionally, the officials said that implementing diversity initiatives  represents a considerable cultural and organizational change for many  middle managers and employees at all levels.  An official from an  investment bank told us that the bank has been reaching out to middle  managers who oversee minority and women employees by, for example,  instituting an \u201cinclusive manager program.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Minority- and Women- Owned Businesses Often Face Difficulties in Obtaining Capital", "paragraphs": ["Studies and reports, as well as interviews we conducted, suggest that  minority- and women-owned businesses face challenges obtaining bank  credit in conventional financial markets for several reasons, including  business characteristics (e.g., small firm size) and the possibility that  lenders may discriminate.

For example, many minority-owned businesses are in the retail and  service sectors and may have few assets to offer as collateral. Further,  many of these businesses are relatively young and may not have an  established credit history. Many also are relatively small and often lack  technical expertise.", "On the other hand, some studies suggest that lenders may discriminate  against minority-owned businesses. We reviewed one study that found  given comparable loan applications\u2014by African-American and Hispanic- owned firms and white-owned firms\u2014the applications by the African- American and Hispanic-owned firms were more likely to be denied.  However, assessing such alleged discrimination may be complicated by  limitations in data availability. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation B, which  implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibits financial  institutions from requiring information on race and gender from applicants  for nonmortgage credit products. Although the regulation was initially  implemented to prevent such information from being used to discriminate  against certain groups, some federal financial regulators have stated that  removing the prohibition would allow them to better monitor and enforce  laws prohibiting discrimination in lending. Likewise, at least one bank  official noted that Regulation B limited the bank\u2019s ability to measure the  success of its efforts to provide financial services to minority groups. We  note that under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lenders are  required to collect and report data on racial and gender characteristics of  applicants for mortgage loans. Researchers have used the HMDA data to  assess potential mortgage lending discrimination by financial institutions.", "Research also suggests that some business characteristics (e.g., limited  technical expertise) that may affect the ability of many minority- and  women-owned businesses to obtain bank credit, as discussed earlier, may  also limit their capacity to raise equity capital.  Although venture capital  firms may not have traditionally invested in minority-owned businesses, a  recent study suggests that firms that do focus on such entities can earn  rates of return comparable to those earned on mainstream private equity  investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Commercial Banks Have Developed Programs for Minority- and Women- Owned Businesses", "paragraphs": ["Officials from some financial institutions we contacted, primarily large  commercial banks, told us that they are reaching out to minority- and  women-owned businesses by marketing their financial products to them  (including in different languages), establishing partnerships with relevant  trade and community organizations, and providing technical assistance.
