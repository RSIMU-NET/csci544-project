The Army has not consistently carried out the statutory requirements for monitoring the health and dental status of Army early-deploying reservists. At the early-deploying units GAO visited, approximately 66 percent of the medical records were available for review. For example, we found that about 68 percent of the required 2-year physical examinations for those over age 40 had not been performed and that none of the annual medical certificates required of reservists were completed by reservists and reviewed by the units. The Army's automated health care information system does not contain comprehensive physical and dental information on early-deploying reservists.

In an effort to obviate similar problems, the Congress passed  four statutory requirements to monitor the health status of those  designated as early-deploying reservists. These requirements are in  addition to two requirements that had been in place prior to the Persian  Gulf War. To meet these requirements, the Army is to provide annual  medical screenings, annual dental screenings, selected dental treatment,  and for those over age 40, physical examinations every 2 years. Early- deploying reservists are required to disclose annually to the Army the  status of their physical and dental condition, and those under age 40 are  required to undergo a physical examination once every 5 years. These six  requirements are used to help ensure that the reservists meet the military\u2019s  health standards so they are ready to perform their assigned duties.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 directed that  we obtain information on the value of periodic physical and dental  examinations and determine the advisability of the statutory requirements  for the Army\u2019s early-deploying reservists.

We also reviewed Army National Guard policies and  procedures governing reservists\u2019 health care but did not review medical or  dental records at Army National Guard units. Additionally, we analyzed  Army data showing the cost to perform periodic physical and dental  examinations and to provide dental treatment. We reviewed studies from  the Department of Defense (DOD) including its 1999 report to the  Congress on ways to improve the medical and dental care provided to  reservists. We also reviewed studies and information on the effectiveness  of periodic physical and dental examinations published by the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health, the  American Medical Association, the Academy of General Dentistry, and  others. We interviewed DOD officials in the offices of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs and the Assistant Secretary for  Health Affairs, and officials in the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S.  Army Forces Command and the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army  Reserve Command to obtain information on the health care provided to  Army early-deploying reservists.

The Army is increasingly relying on  its reserve forces to provide assistance with military conflicts and  peacekeeping missions. As of April 2003, approximately 148,000 reservists  from the Army National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve were mobilized  to active duty positions. In addition, other reservists are serving  throughout the world in peacekeeping missions in the Balkans, Africa,  Latin America, and the Pacific Rim. The involvement of reservists in  military operations of all sizes, from small humanitarian missions to major  theater wars, will likely continue under the military\u2019s current war fighting  strategy and its peacetime support operations.", "The Army has designated some Army National Guard and U.S. Army  Reserve units and individuals as early-deploying reservists to ensure that  forces are available to respond rapidly to an unexpected event or for any  other need. Usually, those designated as early-deploying reservists would  be the first troops mobilized if two major ground wars were underway  concurrently. The units and individual reservists designated as early- deploying reservists change as the missions or war plans change. The  Army estimates that of its 560,000 reservists, approximately 90,000 are  reservists who have been individually categorized as early-deploying  reservists or are reservists who are assigned to Army National Guard and  U.S. Army Reserve units that have been designated as early-deploying  units.", "The Army must comply with the following six statutory requirements that  are designed to help ensure the medical and dental readiness of its early- deploying reservists.", "All reservists including early-deployers are required to    have a 5-year physical examination, and    complete an annual certificate of physical condition.", "All early-deploying reservists are also required to have    a biennial physical examination if over age 40,    an annual medical screening,    an annual dental screening, and    dental treatment.", "Army regulations state that the 5- and 2-year physical examinations are  designed to provide the information needed to identify health risks,  suggest lifestyle modifications, and initiate treatment of illnesses. While  the two examinations are similar, the biennial examination for early- deploying reservists over age 40 contains additional age-specific  screenings such as a prostate examination, a prostate-specific antigen test,  and a fasting lipid profile that includes testing for total cholesterol, low- density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins. The Army pays for  these examinations.", "The examinations are also used to assign early-deploying reservists a  physical profile rating, ranging from P1 to P4, in six assessment areas: (a)  Physical capacity, (b) Upper extremities, (c) Lower extremities, (d)  Hearing-ears, (e) Vision-eyes, and (f) Psychiatric. (See app. II for the  Army\u2019s Physical Profile Rating Guide.) According to the Army, P1  represents a non-duty-limiting condition, meaning that the individual is fit  for duty and possesses no physical or psychiatric impairments. P2 means a  condition may exist; however, it is not duty-limiting. P3 or P4 means that  the individual has a duty-limiting condition in one of the six assessment  areas. P4 means the individual functions below the P3 level. A rating of  either P3 or P4 puts the reservist in a nondeployable status or may result  in the changing of the reservist\u2019s job classification.", "Beginning in January 2003, early-deploying reservists with a permanent  rating of P3 or P4 in one of the assessment areas must be evaluated by an  administrative screening board\u2014the Military Occupational  Specialty/Medical Retention Board (MMRB). This evaluation determines if  reservists can satisfactorily perform the physical requirements of their  jobs. The MMRB recommends whether a reservist should retain a job, be  reassigned, or be discharged from the military.", "Army regulations that implement the statutory certification requirement  provide that all reservists\u2014including early-deploying reservists\u2014certify  their physical condition annually on a two-page certification form. Army  early-deploying reservists must report doctor or dentist visits since their  last examination, describe current medical or dental problems, and  disclose any medications they are currently taking. (See app. III for a copy  of the annual medical certificate\u2014DA Form 7349.) In addition, the Army is  required to conduct an annual medical screening for all early-deploying  reservists. According to Army regulations, the Army is to meet the annual  medical screening requirement by reviewing the medical certificate  required of each early-deploying reservist.", "In addition, Army early-deploying reservists are required to undergo, at the  Army\u2019s expense, an annual dental examination. The Army is also required  to provide and pay for the dental treatment needed to bring an early- deploying reservist\u2019s dental status up to deployment standards\u2014either  dental class 1 or 2. (See table 1 for a general description of each dental  classification.)", "According to Army officials, most of the 5-year and 2-year physical  examinations, the dental examinations, and the dental treatments that  have been performed were administered by military medical personnel.  However, beginning in March 2001, the Army started outsourcing some  examinations through the Federal Strategic Healthcare Alliance  (FEDS_HEAL)\u2014an alliance of private physicians and dentists and other  physicians and dentists who work for the Department of Veterans Affairs  and HHS\u2019s Division of Federal Occupational Health. FEDS_HEAL is a  program that allows Army early-deploying reservists to obtain required  physical and dental examinations and dental treatment from local  providers. The Army contracts and pays for these examinations. About  12,000 of these providers nationwide participate in FEDS_HEAL. The  Army plans to increase its reliance on FEDS_HEAL to provide physical  and dental examinations, and dental treatment for early-deploying  reservists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Periodic Physical and Dental Examinations Are Valuable for Assessing Health Status and Provide Beneficial Information to the Army", "paragraphs": ["Medical experts recommend physical and dental examinations as an  effective means of assessing health.

Because Army early-deploying reservists need to be healthy to  fulfill their professional responsibilities, periodic examinations are useful  for assessing whether they can perform their assigned duties.  Furthermore, the estimated annual cost to conduct periodic  examinations\u2014about $140\u2014is relatively modest compared to the  thousands of dollars the Army spends for salaries and training of early- deploying reservists\u2014an investment that may be lost if reservists can not  perform their assigned duties."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Experts Look to Screenings and Examinations as Key Indicators of Health", "paragraphs": ["Physical and dental examinations are geared towards assessing and  improving the overall health of the general population. The U.S. Preventive  Services Task Force and many other medical organizations no longer  recommend annual physical examinations for adults\u2014preferring instead a  more selective approach to detecting and preventing health problems. In  1996, the task force reported that while visits with primary care clinicians  are important, performing the same interventions annually on all patients  is not the most clinically effective approach to disease prevention.  Consistent with its finding, the task force recommended that the frequency  and content of periodic health examinations should be based on the  unique health risks of individual patients. Today, many health associations  and organizations are recommending periodic health examinations that  incorporate age-specific screenings, such as cholesterol screenings for  men (beginning at age 35) and women (beginning at age 45) every 5 years,  and clinical breast examinations every 3 to 5 years for women between the  ages of 19 and 39. Further, oral health care experts emphasize the  importance of regular 6- to 12-month dental examinations.", "Both the private and public sectors have established a fixed schedule of  physical examinations for certain occupations to help ensure that workers  are healthy enough to meet the specific demands of their jobs. For  example, the Federal Aviation Administration requires commercial pilots  to undergo a physical examination once every 6 months. U.S. National  Park Service personnel who perform physically demanding duties have a  physical examination once every other year for those under age 40, and on  an annual basis for those over age 40. Additionally, guidelines published by  the National Fire Protection Association recommend that firefighters have  an annual physical examination regardless of age.", "In the case of Army early-deploying reservists, the goal of the physical and  dental examinations is to help ensure that the reservists are fit enough to  be deployed rapidly and perform their assigned jobs. Furthermore, the  Army recognizes that some jobs are more demanding than others and  require more frequent examinations. For example, the Army requires that  aviators undergo a physical examination once a year, while marine divers  and parachutists have physical examinations once every 3 years.", "While governing statutes and regulations require physical examinations at  specific intervals, the Army has raised concerns about the appropriate  frequency for them. In a 1999 report to the Congress, the Offices of the  Assistant Secretaries of Defense for Health Affairs and Reserve Affairs  stated that while there were no data to support the benefits of conducting  periodic physical examinations, DOD was reluctant to recommend a  change to the statutory requirements. The report stated that additional  research was needed to identify and develop a more cost-effective,  focused health assessment tool for use in conducting physical  examinations for reservists\u2014in order to ensure the medical readiness of  reserve forces. However, as of February 2003, DOD had not conducted this  research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost of Conducting Physical and Dental Examinations and Providing Dental Treatments", "paragraphs": ["For its early-deploying reservists, the Army conducts and pays for physical  and dental examinations and selected dental treatments at military  treatment facilities or pays civilian physicians and dentists to provide  these services. The Army could not provide us with information on the  cost to provide these services at military hospitals or clinics primarily  because it does not have a cost accounting system that records or  generates cost data for each patient. However, the Army was able to  provide us with information on the amount it pays civilian providers for  these examinations under the FEDS_HEAL program.", "Using FEDS_HEAL contract cost information, we estimate the average  cost of the examinations to be about $140 per early-deploying reservist per  year. We developed the estimate over one 5-year period by calculating the  annual cost for those early-deploying reservists requiring a physical  examination once every 5 years, calculating the cost for those requiring a  physical examination once every 2 years, and calculating the cost for those  requiring an initial dental examination and subsequent yearly dental  examinations. The FEDS_HEAL cost for each physical examination for  those under 40 is about $291, and for those over 40 is about $370. The  Army estimates that the cost of annual dental examinations under the  program to be about $80 for new patients and $40 for returning patients.  The Army estimates that it would cost from $400 to $900 per reservist to  bring those who need treatment from dental class 3 to dental class 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits of Conducting Periodic Examinations", "paragraphs": ["For the Army, there is likely value in conducting periodic examinations  because the average cost to provide physical and dental examinations per  early-deploying reservist\u2014about $140 annually over a 5-year period\u2014is  relatively low compared to the potential benefits associated with such  examinations. These examinations could help protect the Army\u2019s  investment in its early-deploying reservists by increasing the likelihood  that more reservists will be deployable. This likelihood is increased when  the Army uses examinations to identify early-deploying reservists who do  not meet the Army\u2019s health standards and are thus not fit for duty. The  Army can then intervene by treating, reassigning, or dismissing these  reservists with duty-limiting conditions\u2014before their mobilization and  before the Army needs to rely on the reservists\u2019 skills or occupations.  Furthermore, by identifying duty-limiting conditions or the risks for  developing them, periodic examinations give early-deploying reservists the  opportunity to seek medical care for their conditions\u2014prior to  mobilization.", "Periodic examinations may provide another benefit to the Army. If the  Army does not know the health condition of its early-deploying reservists,  and if it expects some of them to be unfit and incapable of performing  their duties, the Army may be required to maintain a larger number of  reservists than it would otherwise need in order to fulfill its military and  humanitarian missions. While data are not available to estimate these  benefits, the benefit associated with reducing the number of reservists the  Army needs to maintain for any given objective could be large enough to  more than offset the cost of the examinations and treatments. The  proportion of reservists whom the Army maintains but who cannot be  deployed because of their health may be significant. For instance,  according to a 1998 U.S. Army Medical Command study, a \u201csignificant  number\u201d of Army reservists could not be deployed for medical reasons  during mobilization for the Persian Gulf War (1990-1991). Further,  according to a study by the Tri-Service Center for Oral Health Studies at  the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, an estimated 25  percent of Army reservists who were mobilized in response to the events  of September 11, 2001, were in dental class 3 and were thus  undeployable. In fact, our analysis of the available current dental  examinations at the seven early-deploying units showed a similar  percentage of reservists\u201422 percent\u2014who were in dental class 3. With  each undeployable reservist, the Army loses, at least temporarily, a  significant investment that is large compared to the cost of examining and  treating these reservists. The annual salary for an Army early-deploying  reservist in fiscal year 2001 ranged from $2,200 to $19,000. The Army  spends additional amounts to train and equip each reservist and, in some  cases, provides allowances for subsistence and housing. Additionally, for  each reservist it mobilizes, the Army spends about $800.
