We further stated that the insufficient or  ineffective use of flexibilities can significantly hinder the ability of  agencies to recruit, hire, retain, and manage their human capital.  Additionally, in May 2003, we reported that OPM can better assist agencies  in using human capital flexibilities by, among other things, maximizing its  efforts to make the flexibilities more widely known to agencies through  compiling, analyzing, and sharing information about when, where, and  how the broad range of flexibilities are being used, and should be used, to  help agencies meet their human capital management needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Entry-Level Pay and Benefits Varied among the Police Forces", "paragraphs": ["Entry-level pay and retirement benefits varied widely across the 13 police  forces.

In  our report on homeland security issued last December, we recommended  that OPM, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget and  the agencies, should develop and oversee the implementation of a long- term human capital strategy that can support the capacity building across  government required to meet the objectives of the nation\u2019s efforts to  strengthen homeland security. With respect to DHS, in particular, this  strategy should    establish an effective performance management system, which  incorporates the practices that reinforce a \u201cline of sight\u201d that shows how  unit and individual performance can contribute to overall organization  goals;   provide for the appropriate use of the human capital flexibilities granted to  DHS to effectively manage its workforce; and foster an environment that promotes employee involvement and  empowerment, as well as constructive and cooperative labor management  employee relations.", "In response to these recommendations, the Director of OPM stated that  OPM has created a design process that is specifically intended to make  maximum use of the flexibilities that Congress has granted to DHS,  including the development of a performance management system linking  individual and organizational performance. Chairwoman Davis, at your  and Senator Voinovich\u2019s request, we are reviewing the design process DHS  and OPM have put in place and we expect to issue our first report this  September.", "DHS must also consider differences in pay, benefits, and performance  management systems of the employee groups that were brought into DHS.  Last March, the Secretary of Homeland Security highlighted examples of  such differences. For example, basic pay is higher for Secret Service  Uniformed Division officers than for General Schedule police officers. TSA  uses a pay banding system with higher pay ranges than the General  Schedule system. The Secretary also cited differences in benefits. The  Secret Service Uniformed Division officers and TSA Air Marshals are  covered under the law enforcement officer retirement benefit provisions,  while the Federal Protective Service police and law enforcement security  officers and various Customs Service employees, among others, are not.  Further, the Secretary stated that DHS and OPM employees will determine  if the differences in pay and benefits constitute unwarranted disparities  and if so, they will make specific recommendations on how these  differences might be eliminated in DHS\u2019s human resources management  system proposal, which will be submitted later this year.", "The performance management systems among DHS components also have  significant differences that need to be considered. The performance  management systems vary in fundamental ways. Of the 4 largest agencies  joining DHS, the Customs Service\u2019s and TSA\u2019s performance management  systems have 2-level performance rating systems. We have raised  concerns that such approaches may not provide enough meaningful  information and dispersion in ratings to recognize and reward top  performers, help everyone attain their maximum potential, and deal with  poor performers. The Coast Guard has a 3-level system and Immigration  and Naturalization Service has a 5-level system.", "One of the key practices mentioned above to a successful merger and  transformation is to use the performance management system to define  the responsibility and assure accountability for change. An effective  performance management system can be a strategic tool to drive internal  change and achieve desired results. Effective performance management  systems are not merely used for once- or twice-yearly individual  expectation setting and rating processes, but are tools to help the  organization manage on a day-to-day basis. These systems are used to  achieve results, accelerate change, and facilitate two-way communication  throughout the year so that discussions about individual and  organizational performance are integrated and ongoing. The performance  management system must link organizational goals to individual  performance and create a line of sight between an individual\u2019s activities  and organizational results.", "Chairwoman Davis, at your and Senator Voinovich\u2019s request, we identified  a set of key practices that federal agencies could use to create this line of  sight and develop effective performance management systems. These  practices helped public sector organizations both in the United States and  abroad create a line of sight between individual performance and  organizational success and, thus, transform their cultures to be more  results-oriented, customer-focused, and collaborative in nature. DHS has  the opportunity to develop a modern, effective, and credible performance  management system to manage and direct its transformation. DHS should  consider these key practices as it develops a performance management  system with the adequate safeguards, including reasonable transparency  and appropriate accountability mechanisms in place, to help create a clear  linkage between individual performance and organizational success.", "We recently reported that TSA, one of the components that joined DHS,  has taken the first steps in creating such a linkage and establishing a  performance management system that aligns individual performance  expectations with organizational goals. TSA has implemented  standardized performance agreements for groups of employees, including  transportation security screeners, supervisory transportation security  screeners, supervisors, and executives. These performance agreements  include both organizational and individual goals and standards for  satisfactory performance that can help TSA show how individual  performance contributes to organizational goals. For example, each  executive performance agreement includes organizational goals, such as  to maintain the nation\u2019s air security and ensure an emphasis on customer  satisfaction, as well as individual goals, such as to demonstrate through  actions, words, and leadership, a commitment to civil rights. To strengthen  its current executive performance agreement and foster the culture of a  high-performing organization, we recommended that TSA add  performance expectations that establish explicit targets directly linked to  organizational goals, foster the necessary collaboration within and across  organizational boundaries to achieve results, and demonstrate  commitment to lead and facilitate change.
