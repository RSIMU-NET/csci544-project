For professionals, such as physicians, participation increased from 21 percent of those eligible for 2011 to 48 percent of those eligible for 2012. While increases occurred, a substantial percentage of providers that participated in 2011 did not participate in 2012. Officials who oversee the programs at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) noted there could be several reasons for this, such as challenges in demonstrating meaningful use, and are monitoring the issue. Various program changes make future participation difficult to estimate. For example, increased stringency of requirements for the programs' second phase beginning in 2014\u2014Stage 2\u2014may slow participation, while the introduction of penalties in 2015 for some providers may motivate participation.", "Reporting on meaningful use for 2011 and 2012 indicates that providers who have already participated in the programs' first phase\u2014Stage 1\u2014used their certified EHR systems more often than required. For example, for both 2011 and 2012, Medicare hospitals reported using computerized provider order entry for over 84 percent of patients\u2014in excess of the required threshold for Stage 1 of 30 percent. However, some meaningful use measures may be more challenging for providers, including measures involving the electronic exchange of information. For example, less than 15 percent of professionals reported on an optional Stage 1 measure to provide a summary of care document at each care transition or referral, which is mandatory in Stage 2. A CMS official said the agency is taking steps to help providers prepare for Stage 2 meaningful use measures.", "The lack of a comprehensive strategy limits HHS's ability to ensure the department can reliably use the clinical quality measures (CQM) collected in certified EHRs for quality measurement activities. Reliability issues persist, although CMS and HHS's Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) have made efforts to address concerns. For example, different providers may report CQMs based on and tested to different requirements depending on whether their EHRs have incorporated technical updates. Without a comprehensive strategy, efforts to address reliability issues (in accordance with the internal control standard requiring relevant and reliable information) and improve quality and efficiency may be limited.", "Consistent with law and GAO guidance on assessing agency performance, HHS, CMS, and ONC have established some performance measures for the EHR programs that are tied to strategic goals regarding adoption and meaningful use of EHRs; however, they have not established measures that would help them to track progress toward program outcomes such as health care quality, efficiency, and patient safety. Although HHS expects that the use of EHRs can help achieve improved outcomes and support other efforts that are also intended to improve care, that result is not yet assured.

For example, CMS officials told us the agency  has partnered with the American Association of Pediatricians to identify  states in need of more outreach to encourage pediatricians to participate  in the Medicaid EHR program, and ONC\u2019s Regional Extension Center  program has provided assistance to providers such as professionals in  solo practices or rural areas to help them participate in the EHR  programs. As we previously reported, participation in the Medicare EHR  program among rural hospitals and professionals in solo practices  increased faster from 2011 to 2012 than participation by hospitals and  professionals overall. Furthermore, CMS has made changes to certain  program eligibility requirements that may increase the number of  providers participating. For example, beginning in 2014, professionals  that are hospital-based may receive incentive payments if they can  demonstrate that they fund the acquisition, implementation, and  maintenance of EHRs in lieu of using a hospital\u2019s EHRs.these professionals were ineligible to participate in the EHR programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Providers Exceeded Meaningful Use Requirements for Most Stage 1 Measures, but May Face Challenges with Certain More Stringent Stage 2 Measures", "paragraphs": ["The meaningful use measures reported by providers for 2011 and 2012  indicate that providers used their certified EHR systems more often than  required and suggest that many providers who have already reported  certain Stage 1 measures will be able to meet most of the more stringent  reporting thresholds for similar measures in Stage 2.

For both 2011 and 2012, Medicare hospitals  reported using computerized provider order entry for medication orders  for over 84 percent of patients\u2014about 2.8 times the required threshold for  Stage 1. Medicare professionals also greatly exceeded the reporting  thresholds. We did not conduct an analysis of meaningful use measures  reported by Medicaid providers, but there is some evidence that Medicaid  professionals also consistently exceeded required thresholds for 2012.  While providers that have not participated in the EHR programs may have  different experiences, the fact that Medicare providers and Medicaid  professionals that participated in 2011 or 2012\u2014the first two years of  Stage 1\u2014generally exceeded most reporting thresholds by wide margins  for the measures they reported suggests that they will be able to meet  most of the more stringent reporting thresholds in Stage 2. For example,  in Stage 2, providers are required to use their certified EHRs to record  and chart changes in vital signs for more than 80 percent of patients.  Medicare hospitals and professionals exceeded this threshold for both  2011 and 2012, reporting that they met this measure for over 90 percent  of patients.", "In addition to consistently exceeding most required reporting thresholds,  other analyses identify some measures that were frequently reported by   (See app. IV, table 7.)

These capabilities are related to optional   Stage 1 measures but will be required in Stage 2 or become more  complex in Stage 2. An analysis of the National Center for Health  Statistics\u2019 2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey shows similar  results for physicians. Among the capabilities related to meaningful use  measures, office-based physicians were least likely to have routinely  submitted electronic data to immunization registries or information  systems, or to have routinely communicated with patients using secure  messaging.

CMS has been modifying its materials and  holding training sessions and discussions with various provider groups. In  anticipation of obstacles to the exchange of health information and in  order to accelerate electronic exchange even among providers not  eligible for incentive payments from the EHR programs, ONC and CMS  issued a request for information in March 2013 to, among other things,  solicit feedback on the challenges to the electronic exchange of health  information and on possible mechanisms to overcome those challenges.  Using the information collected, CMS and ONC issued a strategy in  August 2013 for how they expect to advance health information  exchange, which includes various steps the agencies plan to take under  three broad categories\u2014accelerating health information exchange,  advancing standards and interoperability, and patient engagement.Ongoing work is examining the key challenges to the electronic exchange  of health information that have been reported by providers and  stakeholders and HHS\u2019s efforts to address those challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Lacks a Comprehensive Strategy to Help Ensure Reliability of EHR Data Collected to Improve Quality of Care", "paragraphs": ["The lack of a comprehensive strategy limits HHS\u2019s ability to ensure that  the department can reliably use the CQMs collected in certified EHRs for  quality measurement activities.

In order to drive quality improvement and  accountability and to effectively utilize CQM data collected in EHRs for  HHS\u2019s quality measurement activities, the data collected must be reliable,  that is, both accurate and complete.

Problems with feasibility can  compromise the accuracy or completeness of the data.", "Certification criteria. To address providers\u2019 concern that their 2011- edition EHRs did not collect all of the data elements necessary to  calculate the CQMs, ONC modified the CQM-related certification criteria.", "Specifically, 2014-edition EHRs must collect each of the data elements  associated with a specific CQM to be certified for that measure.", "Certification program. The program for certifying 2011-edition EHRs did  not test whether the EHR system correctly collected and calculated the  CQMs. However, beginning with the certification of 2014-edition EHRs,  the certification bodies and testing laboratories will test whether EHRs  accurately collect and calculate CQMs. These tests will be performed  using a certification testing tool developed by ONC, known as Cypress. Further, beginning in 2014, the certification bodies will be required by  ONC to conduct specific annual surveillance activities to determine  whether 2014-edition EHRs are functioning as intended after being  implemented by providers. CQMs have been identified as a priority area  for these surveillance activities, which may help to inform CMS and ONC  on whether the changes they have made to the specifications,  certification criteria, and certification program are improving the reliability  of CQMs, as intended, and whether further changes are needed.", "CMS and ONC officials indicated the changes made thus far should help  to address reliability concerns, but provider experience with 2014-edition  EHRs will be an important gauge of the effectiveness of the changes.  Furthermore, there are still issues that could result in reliability problems,  hindering CMS\u2019s ability to use the data for its quality measurement  activities. For example, after EHRs are certified as 2014-edition EHRs,  the agencies do not require them to be recertified following updates to the  specifications, which may be made annually or more frequently, or  following updates to the certification testing tool.", "Testing bodies use the certification testing tool\u2014Cypress\u2014to test that EHRs accurately  export, calculate, and electronically submit the data.

CMS has taken some steps to mitigate the potential effect  of these issues on the reliability of CQM data submitted by professionals  who electronically submit CQM data by requiring them to report CQMs  collected using EHR technology based on and tested to the most recent  version of the electronic specifications. However, this variability may limit  the ability to reliably compare quality across other providers, including  hospitals, and undermines efforts CMS officials said they are taking to  ensure that the CQMs lead to standardized, consistent data reporting.  Another issue that may affect reliability is that many providers reported at  least one CQM based on few patients, which may result in data that are  not statistically reliable and therefore should not be used in quality  measurement. We analyzed data submitted by providers to demonstrate  meaningful use under the Medicare EHR program for 2011 and 2012 and  found that 90 percent of hospitals and 50 percent of professionals  reported at least one CQM based on few patients for 2012, a slight  increase compared to 2011, when 86 percent of hospitals and 46 percent  of professionals reported at least one CQM based on few patients.", "In addition, stakeholder organizations continue to have concerns about  reliability. CHIME members indicated that they do not think the  specifications required to generate CQMs using 2014-edition EHRs will  substantially improve the reliability of the data collected in Stage 2. They  noted that the collection of CQM data includes data elements not  currently captured by EHRs, and the data elements are not automatically  part of most clinicians\u2019 workflow (that is, incorporated into the tasks  performed during the delivery of routine care). Due to these obstacles,  CHIME members are concerned that clinicians will not consistently collect  the required data elements, ultimately leading to problems with CQM  reliability and comparability. CMS and ONC are making changes to the  process used to develop new measures, which includes greater  consideration of clinician workflow and provider burden. However, new  CQMs will not be available until the beginning of Stage 3 in 2017.", "Another concern expressed by stakeholder organizations such as the  American Health Information Management Association, the American  Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the Healthcare  Information and Management Systems Society, and The Joint  Commission is that the CQMs generated from EHRs\u2014which are based  on electronically specified measures and are extracted automatically from  EHRs\u2014do not produce results that are comparable to corresponding  measures based on data obtained through other methods, such as  through manual abstraction of patient medical records by trained  professionals. In its fiscal year 2014 Inpatient Prospective Payment  System final rule, CMS noted that it intends to use the electronic CQM  data submitted voluntarily by hospitals to assess the differences in  performance rates from CQMs collected using EHRs and CQMs collected  through chart-abstraction. However, CMS did not indicate when this  study would be completed or describe how it would be designed.  Designing the study to control for any other systematic differences  between providers that use EHRs and other providers could have an  important effect on CMS\u2019s ability to understand the extent and  implications of potential differences in performance rates.", "Although CMS officials told us that they were beginning to develop an  approach to validate CQM data generated from EHRs, HHS has not yet  developed a comprehensive strategy to address concerns with the  reliability of CQMs collected using certified EHRs. Consistent with  GPRAMA and our prior work, which identifies several important practices  that can guide agencies in planning and implementing an effective  government program, a comprehensive strategy would establish  objectives, steps to achieve results, priorities, and milestones and identify  the steps necessary to achieve desired results. Addressing the concerns  is important to ensure that the CQM data can be reliably used for CMS\u2019s  quality measurement activities as well as providers\u2019 quality improvement  activities. For example, CMS plans to use CQMs collected and submitted  via EHRs by certain professionals in 2014 to determine which providers  will be subject to payment modifications under the Value Based Payment  Modifier program in 2016. For hospitals, CMS officials told us that as part  of their approach to validating data, they plan to use electronically  submitted CQMs to develop monitoring processes to help inform them  about the consistency and reliability of the data reported. Also for  hospitals, CMS officials told us that they expect to introduce a process  that is as robust as the one that is currently used for the IQR program  under which a CMS contractor conducts an independent analysis to verify  that the data submitted accurately reflect the information in the medical  record. CMS officials told us that the agency\u2019s plans for validating CQM  data are preliminary, but the agency has stated that it intends to develop  and propose a strategy for hospital data in 2014 as part of the agency\u2019s  annual rulemaking process. While the IQR program may provide a model  for validating data collected by hospitals using certified EHRs, no  comparable model or process exists that could be considered when  developing a validation strategy for data collected by professionals using  certified EHRs. Until HHS establishes and implements a comprehensive  strategy to ensure the reliability of CQMs collected using certified EHRs, it  will be unclear whether the department\u2019s plans are sufficient to address  the concerns, and therefore it will be uncertain when the CQM data can  be reliably used to help assess provider performance, improve quality,  and adjust provider payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measures for the EHR Programs Do Not Assess Outcomes Such As Improved Quality, Efficiency, and Patient Safety", "paragraphs": ["HHS, CMS, and ONC have established some performance measures for  the EHR programs that are tied to strategic goals, but have not  established performance measures for the goals most relevant to the  intended outcomes of the EHR programs\u2014that is, goals related to  improving health care quality, efficiency, and patient safety.

(See app. V,  table 9 for a list of the department- and agency-level strategic goals for  this category.) Outcome measures would enable the agencies to measure  whether the EHR programs\u2019 intended effects are being achieved, rather  than just the number of providers that satisfied the requirements  necessary to demonstrate meaningful use.

However, meaningful use is not sufficient to achieve these outcomes on  its own. The plan notes that the EHR programs are an HIT investment  made in lockstep with various other reform efforts such as patient- centered medical homes and that EHRs will contribute to improvements  in health care quality, efficiency, and patient safety when used in support  of these other reform efforts. Therefore, outcome measures\u2014and the  subsequent use of the information they provide\u2014could be beneficial to  evaluating how the EHR programs interact with other reform efforts.  Furthermore, ONC has acknowledged the need to develop performance  measures to track patient safety, in part due to concerns that EHRs could  have some unintended consequences that cause patient harm. However,  ONC has not yet developed these potential measures.", "Without performance measures linked to the goals of improved health  care quality, efficiency, and patient safety, CMS and ONC are limited in  their abilities to determine the effectiveness of the EHR programs in  improving outcomes.

CMS  and ONC officials have indicated that they do not expect to observe  progress toward achieving the intended outcomes of improved health  care quality, efficiency, and patient safety until at least Stage 3 of the  EHR programs, which is not expected until 2017. However, establishing  outcome-oriented performance measures before results are expected is a  valuable practice to ensure that the agencies can make program  adjustments as needed and are prepared to monitor outcomes and to  establish baseline values, which can be useful for developing  performance targets and assessing progress toward goals.

This early measure of implementation still  leaves substantial room to further increase meaningful use among certain  providers. Implementation of the subsequent stages, which will  increasingly emphasize the use of more advanced features of EHRs, will  place more demands on providers through more stringent requirements,  but could also increase the potential for achieving better outcomes.

A provider may claim  exemptions from reporting some measures if the provider meets  certain criteria specific to the individual measures. For example, the  measure may not be relevant to the provider\u2019s patient populations or  clinical practices, the provider may have conducted too few actions to  be measured, or the provider may not have been able to perform the  action. The agency allows providers to claim exemptions from  reporting certain meaningful use measures to help ensure that  providers with all types of patient populations and clinical practices  could potentially demonstrate meaningful use. For 2011 and 2012,  hospitals were permitted to claim exemptions from reporting 7  meaningful use measures and professionals from reporting 14  meaningful use measures.", "We determined the extent to which providers had few patients who  could be included in the calculation of at least one CQM.capture a small number of patients may be unreliable measures of  quality because relatively small changes in the number of patients  who experienced the care processes or outcomes targeted by the  measure can generate large shifts in the calculated percentage for the  measure. CMS has recognized in other programs that including a  small number of patients in the calculation of a CQM is a reliability  issue. For example, on the agency\u2019s Hospital Compare website, which  publicly reports CQMs by hospital, CMS indicates whether the number  of patients included in a particular measure calculation was based on  fewer than 25 patients and was thus too small to reliably tell how well  the hospital was performing. For our analysis, we identified CQMs as  unreliable if fewer than 7 patients met inclusion criteria for the  calculation the provider reported for a 90-day reporting period\u2014that  is, during the provider\u2019s first year demonstrating meaningful use. For  providers whose second year demonstrating meaningful use was  2012, the reporting period is a full year.
