For example, in fiscal year 2015 USMS spent 86 percent of its $1.4 billion in prisoner operation costs on housing. While total prisoner costs and prisoner populations decreased since fiscal year 2012, per prisoner costs increased. USMS officials attributed the increase in part to lower than expected prisoner populations, resulting in USMS not filling guaranteed bed space at certain facilities. Also, prisoner costs generally were higher in districts with larger populations and limited use of federal facilities, for which USMS does not pay. Both population and costs were highest in 5 districts along the southwest border (see figure).", "USMS has implemented actions that it reports have continued to save prisoner-related costs from fiscal years 2010 through 2015, such as the alternatives to pre-trial detention program to reduce prisoners in USMS's custody. However, for actions with identified savings over this time period, GAO found that about $654 million of USMS's estimated $858 million in total savings is not reliable. For example, USMS identified $375 million in savings from the alternatives to pre-trial detention program for fiscal years 2010 through 2015, but did not verify the data or methodology used to develop the estimate or provide documentation supporting its reported savings for fiscal years 2012 onward. By developing reliable methods for estimating costs and validating savings, USMS would be better positioned to assess the effectiveness of its cost savings efforts.", "USMS has designed systems to identify opportunities for cost efficiencies, including savings. For example, the agency requires districts to conduct annual self-assessments of their procedures to identify any deficiencies which could lead to cost savings.

Developing a mechanism to do so would better position USMS to identify deficiencies or develop corrective actions that could result in additional cost savings opportunities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USMS develop reliable methods for estimating cost savings and validating reported savings achieved, and establish a mechanism to aggregate and analyze the results of annual district self- assessments.

We selected this time period because we  believe that 6 years is sufficient time to identify trends in prisoner  operations costs. We focused our review on the USMS Federal Prisoner  Detention appropriation (FPD) because it pays for about 85 percent of  total USMS prisoner operations costs. We also obtained and analyzed  data for USMS\u2019s financial and operational activities related to prisoner  operations from fiscal years 2010 through 2015, including obtaining  underlying cost data for housing, medical, and transportation costs, which  we then aggregated at the district level.", "We have assessed the reliability of these data and, though we found  some inconsistencies, determined them reliable for the purposes of  identifying and describing the primary cost drivers and the districts\u2019  relative prisoner operation costs from the FPD.

The inconsistencies we identified included  receiving different total costs for state and local prison facility usage,  missing fewer than 5 days of population counts at private facilities, and  missing or inconsistent facility designations. The largest discrepancy  between our calculated costs and USMS reported total costs appeared in  fiscal year 2012 at less than 2 percent. In addition, we interviewed  officials from the Prisoner Operations Division (POD) in headquarters to  obtain USMS\u2019s views on identified cost drivers and trends.

We  chose this time period to align with our review of USMS\u2019s prisoner  operations cost trends. To determine the extent to which USMS\u2019s  estimated savings are reliable, we analyzed USMS documents and data,  where available, such as documentation of the methodology and resulting  dollar figures from each initiative\u2019s savings estimate. We compared each  of USMS\u2019s cost savings estimates against Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of  Federal Programs and best practices outlined in Assessing the Reliability  of Computer-Processed Data to determine the extent to which the  estimates were sufficiently comprehensive, accurate, consistent, and  transparent. For each savings estimate for which we were able to obtain  documentation of assumptions and methodologies, we assessed whether  major assumptions were reasonable by conducting or evaluating  sensitivity analyses, and reviewed estimates to ensure that assumptions  were consistently and accurately applied.

To address how USMS identifies  additional cost savings opportunities, we analyzed elements of USMS\u2019s  internal control system related to achieving operational efficiencies and  interviewed cognizant USMS officials responsible for programming and  internal controls to determine whether USMS has designed a  management structure and processes to routinely assess its  administrative and operational activities for possible corrective actions.

For instance, USMS makes agreements with facilities  based on future-year forecasts of ADP, including providing monthly  minimum guaranteed costs for guaranteed space at certain facilities,  where there is an anticipated need for additional prisoner housing in the  future. In years when ADP did not meet forecasted amounts, USMS paid  guaranteed minimum amounts for fewer prisoners than projected, leading  to higher costs per prisoner. Additionally, USMS officials stated that in  some circumstances, USMS continued to use some of these facilities  even though it might not have been the most cost effective approach.  USMS officials stated that they continue to use state and local  government facilities in some districts to maintain relationships with law  enforcement. This helps ensure that USMS can rely on these jurisdictions  in future years for both prisoner operations and other operations requiring  state and local cooperation, such as leveraging state and local law  enforcement officials and resources to help capture fugitives. Specifically,  the USMS officials explained that, if USMS does not help the jurisdictions  to maintain their prisoner infrastructure, then some facilities in these  jurisdictions would likely close.

As figure 7 shows, this is in  large degree because these 4 districts\u2014the Southern District of New  York, the District of Puerto Rico, the Southern District of Florida, and the  Central District of California\u2014rely heavily on federal facilities operated  and paid for by BOP, not USMS, placing between 73 and 87 percent of  the ADP in a BOP facility in a given year. The remaining 6 districts,  however, rely less heavily on federal facilities\u2014for which USMS does not  pay\u2014and more heavily on a mixture of IGA, and private infrastructure to  house its prisoners.", "Moreover, 5 of the 6 districts with the highest ADP that rely more heavily  on state and local or private facilities are also located along the southwest  border. USMS officials stated that bed space in locations with the  highest ADP\u2014such as along the southwest border\u2014often overtake the  federal, state, and local facilities\u2019 capacity. In response, USMS has  entered into contracts with private facilities to meet the demand.  According to USMS officials, while private facilities appear to be more  expensive overall, most are located in districts where the costs of bed  space are already more expensive than average because the demand  outstripped capacity. Thus, paying for private facility capacity requires  paying higher costs.", "In addition to identifying the 10 districts with the highest ADP for fiscal  year 2015, we also identified the 10 districts with the highest costs per  day\u2014that is, prisoner housing, medical, and transportation costs directly  attributable to each district divided by the average daily detention  population\u2014which are listed in table 1.", "Similar to our analysis of the districts with highest ADP, districts with the  highest costs per day is likely affected by whether they can use a BOP  facility to offset housing costs. In particular, as table 1 shows, of the 10  districts with the highest costs per day, none rely on BOP facilities to  house more than 4 percent of their prisoner populations. Further, only 2 of  the 10 districts rely on private facilities to house more than 10 percent of  their prisoner populations. USMS officials stated that other factors affect  the variation of costs. For instance, officials explained that variations in  the prevailing wage rates in the district impact housing costs greatly.  USMS officials stated that wage rates in northeast districts and Alaska  are higher than in other districts such as in the southeast districts.  Further, officials noted that real estate costs in different areas of the  country can greatly affect how much USMS must pay. For instance,  USMS officials stated that districts with large metropolitan areas, such as  Massachusetts and Maryland, pay higher real estate costs than in  locations that are more rural. Lastly, USMS officials stated that lower ADP  in districts in more remote locations results in higher costs per ADP  because there are some structural costs that then are shared among  fewer prisoners. For instance, Alaska and Maine rank among the lowest  ADPs on average, and the per day jail costs include higher indirect costs  such as maintenance of the prisoner facilities. Such variations may affect  jail costs per day among all the districts to some extent; therefore, it is  difficult to compare costs among the districts without considering such  pressures on cost."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USMS Has Taken Steps to Reduce Prison Costs, but Could Improve the Reliability of Its Cost Savings Estimates", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USMS Implemented Several Initiatives and Other Actions to Reduce Prison Operations Costs", "paragraphs": ["USMS has implemented a number of actions to manage costs and meet  its strategic goal of optimizing detention operations, which it estimates  have achieved costs savings in fiscal years 2010 through 2015.  Specifically, USMS automated its detention management services,  developed housing options intended to reduce costs, invested in  alternatives to pre-trial detention to help reduce housing and medical  expenditures, and improved its management of medical claims. Table 2  provides detail on the key cost saving initiatives that USMS has identified  and USMS\u2019s estimated total cost savings.", "In addition to the above initiatives, officials explained that USMS has  sought to avoid costs by increasing USMS\u2019s use of federal facilities.  Doing so allows USMS to decrease costs because, according to a USMS- BOP memorandum of understanding, BOP allocates and maintains  detention bed space to house USMS\u2019s prisoners, and USMS does not  incur housing related costs for the use of these federal spaces. USMS  officials explained that they have not developed a cost savings estimate  for the BOP bed space USMS uses because USMS does not consider its  use of BOP facilities as a cost saving action. Officials, however, noted  that USMS monitors unused federal bed space and calculates additional  costs USMS could avoid if districts were to use those unoccupied spaces.  For example, USMS estimated it could have avoided an additional $21.6  million in costs if districts had utilized the unused BOP-allocated spaces  in the Brooklyn federal detention facility in fiscal year 2015. However,  according to USMS officials, operational limitations such as a federal  facility\u2019s distance from assigned courthouses hinders USMS ability to fully  use all allocated spaces.", "From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, USMS increased the percentage of  its prisoner population that used BOP facilities from about 18 percent of  total ADP in fiscal year 2010 to about 19 percent in fiscal year 2015.  Further, our analysis shows that USMS avoided costs ranging from $321  million to $392 million for fiscal years 2010 through 2015, if USMS had to  pay for bed space it used at BOP federal facilities. In addition, our  analysis found that the Department of Justice potentially saved $73  million in fiscal year 2015 by having USMS use allocated space at BOP  facilities to house its prisoners instead of housing those prisoners at  private facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USMS Could Better Develop, Document, and Validate Some Estimates to Improve Reliability When Determining Cost Savings", "paragraphs": ["According to USMS\u2019s congressional budget justification and USMS  officials, the agency has realized approximately $858 million in total costs  savings through the cost savings initiatives identified in table 2. However,  based on our analysis of USMS\u2019s cost savings estimates, discussions  with USMS officials, and comparison of the estimates against Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and GAO guidance related to cost  estimation, we found that approximately $654 million of USMS\u2019s total cost  savings estimate has limited reliability because five of USMS\u2019s six cost  savings estimates were not sufficiently comprehensive, accurate,  consistent, or well-documented.", "Specifically, based on guidance from OMB and GAO guidance for  assessing the reliability of computer processed data, reliable cost  estimates\u2014such as USMS\u2019s $858 million estimate\u2014should be  comprehensive, accurate, consistent, and well-documented. In particular,  OMB guidance on conducting a cost-benefit analysis states that the  analysis should include a comprehensive estimate of different types of  benefits (such as cost savings) minus costs. OMB guidance further  states that the analysis should be explicit about the underlying  assumptions and key sources of uncertainty used to arrive at the  estimates of future benefits and costs. Key data, models used in the  analysis, and results of benefits and costs should be reported and well- documented to promote independent review and analysis.

Table 3 shows the extent to which USMS\u2019s estimates were  reliable and, if appropriate, limitations of the estimates, and details of our  analysis of the estimates by cost saving action follow. eIGA: Based on our analysis, USMS applied reasonable assumptions  and used a reasonable methodology to reliably estimate $204.3  million in savings from the implementation of eIGA. Specifically,  USMS calculated the difference in the \u201cproposed\u201d versus \u201cnegotiated\u201d  per diem rate for each intergovernmental agreement which was  negotiated using this system. Additionally, savings identified can be  solely attributed to the implementation of the system because, prior to  eIGA, USMS did not negotiate the per diem rate for housing  prisoners. ePMR: Based on our analysis, we found that USMS applied  reasonable assumptions, but its estimate of $935,000 in cost savings  during fiscal years 2011 through 2015 from the implementation of  ePMR is not comprehensive. Officials said that as a result of  implementing ePMR, USMS has avoided $187,000 in costs per year  by not having to hire additional staff to manage the increased number  of medical claims, which have increased since then. They based this  estimate on the number of cases USMS headquarters managed in  fiscal year 2011. However, we found that the number of medical  cases USMS headquarters managed has increased since fiscal year  2011. As a result, USMS would have needed approximately 6  additional staff to manage the average number of medical claims in  fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Further, USMS costs avoided over  the five fiscal years would equal approximately $2.7 million, not  $935,000.", "We found that USMS underestimated its ePMR costs savings  because it excluded efficiencies and savings realized in subsequent  years. OMB guidance recommends agencies include a  comprehensive analysis of benefits and costs. A savings estimate  that includes savings realized in all 5 fiscal years could help USMS  identify the full range of the program\u2019s effect. eDesignate: Based on our analysis, the cost savings estimate of  $222 million for the implementation of eDesignate is not  comprehensive because USMS may have double counted savings  associated with the use of the system over time and included savings  not attributable to the system. Specifically, USMS officials told us  that eDesignate reduced the post-sentencing processing time for  prisoners in USMS\u2019s custody, decreasing prisoner average detention  time, and, thereby, USMS\u2019s housing costs. Figure 8 illustrates the  processing of sentenced prisoners using eDesignate.", "To capture cost savings achieved after the use of eDesignate, USMS derived a baseline detention time using the average detention  time from fiscal years 2008 through 2010\u201473.4 days\u2014to which  post-implementation average detention time could be compared;  calculated the difference in average detention times between the  baseline and monthly average detention time from FY 2011  through 2015; and multiplied this difference by the average daily costs of housing its  prisoners.", "OMB guidance states that benefits and costs analysis should be  based on incremental benefits and costs. Specifically, all sunk costs  and benefits already realized should be ignored. However, our  analysis shows that USMS may have double counted the time  reductions and cost savings achieved over time by continuing to use  the same 73.4 days baseline to calculate change in detention time  and cost savings achieved each year after the implementation of  eDesignate. Specifically, as shown in table 4 the estimated amount of  cost savings is greater when USMS continues to measure against the  73.4 days baseline instead of revising the baseline each year to  account for reduced detention time achieved in the preceding years.  For instance, if USMS used the change in annual average detention  time to calculate costs savings for fiscal years 2011 through 2015, it  would have estimated approximately $52 million versus $222 million.  Thus, using this baseline may overstate the savings achieved from  reduced detention time. Further, USMS did not take into account any  other factors which might also have affected a change in average  detention time and, ultimately, savings estimates related to the  system. For example, officials said that a BOP contract closure at a  facility impacted USMS housing of its prisoners and resulted in the  high average detention time for fiscal year 2011.", "In addition to double counting savings in its cost estimating  methodology, USMS included savings not attributable to the  implementation of the eDesignate system. Specifically, USMS  calculated detention costs avoided for the total number of USMS\u2019s  prisoners instead of prisoners housed in non-BOP facilities. As  discussed above, USMS derived a costs savings estimate for  eDesignate by multiplying the reduction in prisoners\u2019 detention time by  the daily costs of housing the prisoners. However, USMS does not  incur costs for USMS prisoners housed in BOP facilities, so  calculating costs avoided for all prisoners in its savings estimate  resulted in an overestimation.", "USMS officials stated that they do not think that the $222 million in  savings is overestimated. They said that USMS did not need to adjust  the baseline to reflect incremental yearly changes in detention time  and costs savings because it was estimating the costs USMS would  have incurred without the implementation of eDesignate, not the  impact of the system on prisoner processing time. OMB guidance,  however, states that benefit-cost analyses should measure the  incremental benefits and costs by omitting costs or benefits already  realized. A baseline which adjusts to capture the actual change in  average detention time would better capture incremental benefits and  could help USMS identify events that affected detention time and  more accurately estimate eDesignate\u2019s effects and costs savings.", "Chesapeake Detention Facility: USMS\u2019s cost savings estimate of  $53.6 million for the Chesapeake Detention Facility includes $13.6  million in transportation and medical costs avoided and $40 million in  housing costs avoided as a result of USMS having guaranteed use of  the Chesapeake detention facility. Though USMS conducted  sensitivity analyses for its housing cost savings estimate, our analysis  found that the estimate has limited reliability because it is not  accurate.", "First, USMS may have overestimated the cost savings associated  with transportation and medical costs because it did not account for  the fixed costs for medical and transportation already included in its  payments for the Chesapeake Detention Facility. In particular, USMS  used the local average transportation costs for transporting USMS  prisoners and the average daily medical costs per prisoners to  estimate that it would have had to pay $13.6 million in transportation  and medical costs if such costs were not included in the agreement  with the facility. It identified the entire estimated transportation and  medical costs avoided as the savings.", "However, this estimate may overstate the cost savings because  USMS\u2019s methodology did not account for an estimate of how much of  the fixed costs it currently pays for the Chesapeake Detention Facility  are attributable to transportation and medical costs. As previously  noted, USMS pays a fixed cost for housing its prisoners at the  Chesapeake Detention Facility, which includes medical and  transportation services for USMS\u2019s prisoners housed at the facility. If  such costs were not included in the fixed costs USMS paid for the  facility, USMS may have been able to negotiate a lower cost.  However, USMS\u2019s methodology does not account for how the  negotiated fixed costs for the facility would have changed if medical  and transportation services were not included. Accounting for how the  fixed costs would have changed would provide a more accurate  estimate of the actual medical and transportation costs it did not have  to pay as a result of the agreement. For example, if the fixed costs  including medical and transportation USMS pays for the Chesapeake  Detention Facility are $20 million and USMS estimates that it could  have negotiated a fixed rate without medical and transportation of $18  million, then the estimate of fixed costs USMS currently pays that are  attributable to medical and transportation costs is $2 million. If this  were the case, then, after accounting for the $2 million currently  attributable to medical and transportation costs, the costs savings  would have equaled $11.6 million ($13.6 million less the $2 million)  versus the entire $13.6 million estimate of costs avoided.", "Second, USMS\u2019s housing cost savings estimate for the Chesapeake  Detention Facility is inaccurate because USMS inconsistently applied  the inflation rate in its $40 million savings estimate. Specifically,  USMS calculated savings using the difference between the cost of  operating Chesapeake and the costs of not having the guaranteed  use of the facility. To calculate the growth in costs over time for each  scenario, USMS assumed a 3 percent inflation rate, but applied the  rate inconsistently. Specifically, it applied a 3 percent inflation rate  once every three years for the change in costs to operate  Chesapeake, but applied a 3 percent inflation rate every year for the  change in housing costs if USMS did not have the guaranteed use of  the facility. As a result of this inconsistency, USMS generally  projected that the costs for operating the Chesapeake facility would  be lower when compared to the costs of housing their prisoners if they  did not have the guaranteed use of the facility, and this overestimated  costs savings achieved. Further, USMS assumed a 3 percent inflation  rate every 3 years instead of using the general inflation rate, as is  recommended by OMB guidance.", "We found that USMS inaccurately estimated the medical and  transportation costs avoided as a result of its guaranteed use of the  Chesapeake facility because USMS did not prioritize the development  of the estimate. Specifically, officials said USMS developed its  housing estimate to show that acquiring the guaranteed use of  Chesapeake was an economically sound housing decision, and any  additional savings were secondary. As such, USMS did not focus on  the medical and transportation costs that it avoided and developed the  estimate in response to our inquiry. Additionally, USMS officials  acknowledged that they mistakenly applied an inconsistent inflation  rate, potentially resulting in an overestimation. They noted, however,  that USMS assumed a 3 percent inflation rate instead of the general  inflation rate in its estimate because that is the average rate officials  have observed over time.", "Improved Management of Medical Claims: We found that the $2.4  million in costs savings related to the improved management of  medical claims and costs has limited reliability because it is not  accurate or comprehensive. USMS\u2019s reported savings is comprised of  three categories: (1) $1.4 million in savings from effectively managing  costs for prisoners receiving medical care; (2) $740,962 from denied  claims; and (3) $279,360 from medical transport costs avoided. We  found that USMS\u2019s costs savings related to effective management of  prisoners\u2019 medical care and denied claims may be inaccurate  because USMS used the upper bound of costs ranges and average  costs, respectively, to estimate the savings for each category. For  savings related to effective management of prisoner medical care, in  at least one quarter of its estimated savings, USMS reported a range  of cost savings rather than a single estimate. For example, USMS  estimated a range of $20,000 to $50,000 for costs avoided for a  surgery. Because USMS used the upper bound of each range to  estimate total costs avoided for the effective management of  prisoners\u2019 care, USMS may have overestimated its savings.", "Similarly, USMS savings for denied claims may be inaccurate  because it used average costs per approved claim instead of the  actual costs of denied claims to estimate costs avoided. Specifically,  USMS multiplied the number of denied claims by the average costs  per medical claim they had approved to determine total costs avoided.  However, we found that average costs per claim approved may not be  a good proxy for costs per denied claim. According to officials,  medical costs can vary widely according to each individual case. Such  variations in costs can affect the average costs per claim and thus  USMS\u2019s calculated cost savings. For instance, USMS calculated that  average costs per claim in two quarters in fiscal year 2015 ranged  from $220 per claim to $503 per claim for each quarter. Applying  these two different averages to 300 denied claims, we found that  there is a large difference in estimated savings\u2014approximately  $66,000 and $150,900, respectively, or over 1.25 times difference  between the low and high calculated savings. As a result, using  average costs per approved medical claim may not be representative  of the actual costs for each claim denied and may under- or over-state  actual savings.", "Additionally, a review of the documents USMS provided us shows that  USMS calculated savings for the actions that overlapped two of the  saving categories, thus potentially double counting some savings.  For example, USMS claimed approximately $90,000 in cost avoided  for effectively managing a prisoner medical case. However, this cost  avoidance resulted from a denied claim. As a result, this singular  action would also be counted as savings in the denied claims  category.", "USMS officials noted that it would be work intensive for USMS to  calculate costs avoided for denied claims by using actual costs given  the volume of medical claims they receive and the average cost per  claim can be quickly calculated and multiplied by the number of  prisoner medical claims denied to facilitate cost savings reporting. We  recognize that calculating actual costs may be challenging; however,  USMS already uses actual costs to estimate the costs savings related  to the effective management of prisoners\u2019 medical care. Thus, USMS  may use the same method to estimate savings for denied claims.  Further, data reliability guidance states estimates are accurate when  recorded data reflects the actual underlying information. A more  accurate and comprehensive savings estimate\u2014calculating both the  lower and upper bound of cost estimates, using actual costs for claims  denied, and ensuring that savings are not double counted\u2014could help  USMS better determine the full impact of its action on its rising  medical care costs.", "Alternatives to Pre-Trial Detention: We also found that USMS\u2019s  cost savings estimate of approximately $375 million from the  alternatives to pre-trial detention program\u2014for fiscal years 2010  through 2015\u2014had limited reliability because USMS lacked adequate  documentation to support the estimates, did not validate estimates,  and reported inconsistent savings estimates. As described earlier, the  Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) administers the  alternatives to pre-trial detention program which helps to divert  defendants from detention in USMS\u2019s custody. According to the  agreement between AOUSC and USMS, AOUSC is to provide USMS  with a report that includes the number of prisoners who otherwise  would have been detained, describes the types of services provided,  and includes the total expenditure from USMS\u2019s allocated funds.  USMS officials reported that AOUSC had provided such reports,  which also estimated the housing costs USMS avoided as a result of  the program.", "However, USMS officials stated that they have not received reports  with this information from AOUSC for fiscal years 2012 onward to  support or corroborate USMS\u2019s reported estimate of $67 million per  year in savings for fiscal years 2012 onward. Our review of the fiscal  years 2010 and 2011 reports that included estimates of housing costs  avoided that we received from USMS found that AOUSC aggregated  some of the data to determine USMS detention costs avoided as a  result of the program, but did not specify the methodology for  aggregating the data or the assumptions used to derive different  factors in the estimate, as recommended by OMB guidance.As  such, we cannot determine if the method for estimating USMS cost  savings is reasonable.", "Additionally, USMS officials said that USMS did not verify AOUSC\u2019s  calculation of fiscal years 2010 and 2011 savings. USMS, however,  reported savings for those and subsequent fiscal years in its  congressional budget justifications. USMS officials told us that USMS  extrapolated AOUSC\u2019s estimations from fiscal year 2011 to report on  more recent savings. Officials said that, generally, USMS gets a  savings of $10 for every dollar AOUSC expends from USMS-allocated  funds for the program. However, we found that since fiscal year 2011,  AOUSC expended less than $3 million of USMS-allocated funds, but  USMS continued to report a $67 million per year cost savings, which  was estimated based on AOUSC fiscal year 2011 expenditures of  approximately $3 million. Further, USMS reported different savings for  fiscal year 2011, $44 million in fiscal year 2011 versus the $67 million  it reported in its fiscal year 2013 and 2014 congressional budget  justification, indicating that the estimates are inaccurate. It is likely that  USMS\u2019s costs savings for the program have decreased from $67  million, given the decrease in use of allocated funds by AOUSC.", "AOUSC acknowledged that, since a change in its staff in 2012, the  reports it provided to USMS did not include information such as the  number of prisoners who otherwise would have been detained, which  would have been required to estimate USMS\u2019s cost avoided, but  instead provided detailed program expenditures to USMS for fiscal  years 2012 onward in order to seek reimbursement. Similarly, USMS  staff acknowledged that they had not sought reports from AOUSC that  would have allowed them to calculate costs avoided, and had not  verified any of AOUSC\u2019s prior calculations. Both AOUSC and USMS  officials stated that they intend to communicate with each other to  obtain the information detailed in the agreement, and USMS officials  indicated that they plan to validate the cost savings in the future.  However, USMS officials did not provide documentation or a  timeframe in which they will do so. Further, OMB guidance states that  it is potentially valuable for agencies to verify and determine whether  anticipated benefits and costs for the program have been realized.  This verification can be used to determine necessary corrections in  the program, and to improve future estimates of benefit and costs.  Also, by ensuring that it has complete and validated information  necessary to estimate costs avoided, documenting its methodology,  and assuring that its estimates are consistent over time, USMS would  be better able to report reliable costs avoided for the alternatives to  detention program.", "As described above, five of USMS\u2019s costs savings estimates have limited  reliability because the estimates were not sufficiently comprehensive,  accurate, consistent, or well-documented. By developing reliable methods  for estimating and validating cost savings\u2014such as ensuring estimates  are comprehensive, accurate, consistent, and adequately documented\u2014 USMS would be better positioned to assess the effectiveness of its cost  savings actions and inform decision makers\u2014including Congress\u2014about  these efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USMS Has Designed Systems to Identify Opportunities for Additional Cost Efficiencies, but Could Improve its Monitoring of Internal Control", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USMS has Systems to Help Identify Opportunities for Cost Efficiencies and Savings", "paragraphs": ["USMS has several systems it uses to help it identify cost savings  opportunities, including:  Strategic Plan. USMS\u2019s 2012-2016 Strategic Plan helps guide the  agency in fulfilling its mission and achieving its strategic goals. One such  strategic objective is to provide for the safe, secure, humane, and cost- effective containment of its prisoners, and one of the performance goals it  uses to achieve this objective is to hold detention and transportation costs  at or below inflation. According to the strategic plan, one of the ways it  seeks to meet this goal is by enabling effective and equitable allocation of  district resources for transportation expenditures. For example, according  to USMS POD officials, they have implemented a process as a result of  guidance in the strategic plan which allows them to reallocate resources  at the district level for guard and transportation costs when unexpected  costs are incurred by the districts. USMS initially allocates money each  fiscal year across the 94 USMS districts, but in addition it sets aside  separate funding to cover unexpected costs such as transporting ill  prisoners outside of facilities where they are housed for further medical  care. While USMS can anticipate that these events will occur, it cannot  foresee which districts will incur these costs. Districts\u2019 requests for  additional funding beyond their fiscal year allocations are submitted via a  supplemental funding request that is reviewed by POD, which then grants  the request and provides the additional funding to the district. In addition,  POD is currently developing a policy which will allow it to determine a  methodology to more effectively and equitably distribute transportation  resources across the districts. This initiative is expected to be rolled out in  October 2017, according to USMS officials.", "USMS guidance to districts. USMS\u2019s Policy Directive 9.2 establishes  how USMS districts will house prisoners in different types of facilities.  Specifically, it states that districts must first use a BOP federal facility  where there is space available, as USMS does not have to pay for these  spaces. In 2007, USMS signed a memorandum of understanding in which  BOP allocated a certain amount of bed space to USMS prisoners at more  than a dozen of its federal facilities. In fiscal year 2015, BOP housed  approximately 10,000, or 19 percent, of USMS\u2019s prisoners in BOP  facilities.", "Next, USMS districts must, according to the directive, use space available  in state and local facilities for which USMS has established IGAs and a  per diem amount to pay for each prisoner. Third, the guidance directs  districts to use private facilities. In addition to this guidance, however,  POD officials noted that they guide districts to consider private facilities  with space where USMS has a \u201cguaranteed minimum\u201d number of spaces  it is paying for, before the districts consider state and local facilities (the  IGAs). This is because, if USMS exceeds the guaranteed minimum in the  contract, the contractor provides a dramatically reduced per diem cost per  detainee above the guaranteed minimum contract amount. The officials  noted that fewer than 30 of USMS\u2019s districts use private facilities, and that  private facilities account for the smallest percentage of facilities that  USMS uses to house its prisoners. Our analysis confirmed this  assessment, finding that there were only 21 districts using private  facilities from fiscal years 2010 through 2015 to house at least a half of 1  ADP during each fiscal year.", "However, our analysis of USMS detention data also found that some  districts appeared to select private detention space over less costly  federal spaces, in seeming contradiction with USMS guidance. For  example, several districts that have access to one federal facility place a  large number of prisoners in other private facilities at a higher cost to their  districts. POD officials stated that based on the number of factors U.S.  Marshals must consider in placing prisoners in available bed spaces, it is  not always feasible to use the available federal detention spaces. POD  officials also told us that they provide additional guidance to U.S.  Marshals in those districts that have access to or are the home district for  private facilities. For example, according to the officials, the U.S. Marshal  in each district must consider issues like the security risk the prisoner  poses, the prisoner\u2019s medical condition, the need to separate defendants  on a particular case, and the need to keep prisoners close to the  courthouse where they are making their appearances. In addition, even if  USMS presents a prisoner to a BOP federal facility, BOP has the right to  refuse to accept a prisoner at one of its facilities. According to BOP, this  is only done in cases where the facility cannot accommodate a particular  prisoner due to medical or security issues. Overall, BOP officials told us  they try to accommodate USMS, even in facilities where USMS has  exceeded its allocation at a particular facility. Thus, while some districts  make placement decisions that do not comport with the policy directive as  written, these occurrences are infrequent, and are practiced by a minority  of districts that have both private and federal prison spaces available to  them, and are following additional guidance provided to them by POD in  making their determinations on where to place specific prisoners.", "Scorecards. POD tracks district utilization of federal and private bed  spaces through quarterly scorecards. According to USMS officials, they  encourage districts to utilize federal and private bed space, and the  quarterly scorecard system is their way of checking on the district\u2019s  performance in cost-efficient bed space allocation. These scorecards  reflect which private and federal facilities are being underutilized, and at  what percent or rate. The scorecard lists each federal and private facility,  the USMS allocation or number of bed spaces for each facility, and the  actual amount of ADP in that facility (USMS\u2019s use). Scorecards are color  coded green, yellow, and red based on whether the district is meeting the  USMS allocated amount of ADP in the facility. If a facility on the score  card is under its allocation, or \u201cin the red,\u201d POD does an assessment of  which facilities that district is using to house prisoners. While POD  officials stated they cannot dictate to a U.S. Marshal which facility to use  for a specific prisoner, they noted that if they find, for example, that a  district is using an IGA or a higher priced facility rather than a facility with  guaranteed minimum bed spaces, then POD officials call the district to  provide coaching on utilizing allocated bed space.", "In addition to monitoring utilization levels at detention facilities, USMS  also calculates a cost avoidance amount based on the amount of space it  should be using at these facilities, and the amount of space currently  being occupied by its prisoners. According to USMS officials, it performs  calculations to determine its potential cost avoidance numbers for private  and federal facilities as part of its ongoing monitoring and prisoner  reassignment efforts.", "USMS officials noted that their current monitoring and prisoner  reassignment efforts are ad hoc, but the agency is currently working to  formalize its use of the scorecards and its facility utilization review  process. USMS officials stated that they are currently working to formalize  the scorecard system and monitoring, and expect to be able to begin  monthly reviews in June 2016.", "Internal control. We reviewed the elements of USMS\u2019s internal control  system that are designed to specifically provide USMS with opportunities  to identify cost efficiencies and generally found that its internal control  processes align with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular  No. A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility for Internal Control, which  defines management\u2019s responsibility for internal control in federal  agencies.

In addition, each district is to test its internal control  over the efficiency of its operations through a standardized, annual self- assessment process. However, agency officials reported that USMS does  not have a way to aggregate or analyze the results of these self- assessments, which are the only reviews available for each district each  year.", "According to USMS officials, their current process includes tools such as  Sharepoint that are not able to aggregate the self-assessment data, or  run any type of data analytics. They also stated that they completed a  business process analysis in fiscal year 2015 that may help them compile  the findings of the reviews, but they are still unable to aggregate the  results. The officials said that they recognize the need for an integrated  system that would allow them to compile the self-assessments, corrective  action plans, and compliance reviews. Officials also stated that currently,  they have four different systems in which they have to manually input  information. They stated that integrating these into one overall system  would increase productivity, accountability, and USMS\u2019s overall  compliance rate. In addition, according to these officials, having a data  analysis capability would allow USMS to detect deficiency trends and  patterns, which could increase and enhance its reporting capabilities. For  example, USMS could report on a quarterly basis which would enable it to  more closely monitor district compliance rates.", "Because USMS cannot aggregate or analyze the annual SAG self- assessment results, which it relies on for those districts not being  assessed during USMS\u2019s district review cycle, it cannot identify whether  the same control deficiencies are occurring across districts or in the same  districts over time, hindering its ability to promptly resolve these issues or  to identify agency-wide deficiencies and develop corrective actions in key  risk areas. For example, one control activity that is to be tested regularly  is whether the district reviews purchase cardholder statements to ensure  that only authorized goods and services are purchased, and that no  purchase exceeds a set threshold. With no ability to aggregate self- assessment results to identify whether a deficiency in an area such as  this is occurring across many districts in a given year, or across the same  district over a number of years, USMS may not be able to promptly  resolve inaccurate purchases, potentially resulting in issuing payments  that are higher or lower than they should be.", "A 2012 DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit of USMS also  similarly commented on USMS\u2019s on-site review timeline, finding that  USMS had not ensured that district and division procurement officials  were complying with federal, DOJ, and USMS policies, and that these  noncompliance problems resulted from an inability to effectively manage  and oversee those procurement activities at the district and division  level. As such, the OIG recommended that USMS strengthen its  inspection and review of certain activities by shortening the length  between on-site reviews of operations in the district and division offices.  USMS officials told us that they are continuing to work on implementing  the recommendation to ensure that they are performing their on-site  reviews closer to a 3 to 4 year cycle, which is standard among other  agencies. USMS has already improved its on-site compliance review  cycle from past years. Currently, officials stated that USMS reviews each  district every 6 to 7 years as compared to every 12 years in 2012, and it  increased the number of on-site reviews from 11 to 14 per year in 2012 to  18 per year now.

(2) What recent actions has USMS taken to reduce its prisoner operations  costs and how much has been saved?  (3) To what extent does USMS have systems in place to identify  additional opportunities to save costs?", "To identify costs and trends, we reviewed USMS\u2019s congressional budget  justifications covering fiscal years 2010 through 2015 to identify USMS- reported cost drivers. We selected this time period because we believe  that 6 years is sufficient time to identify trends in prisoner operations  costs, and GAO last reported on USMS prisoner costs in fiscal year  2010. We focused our review on the USMS Federal Prisoner Detention  (FPD) appropriation, which pays for about 85 percent of total prisoner- related costs. We obtained underlying data from USMS and aggregated  it at the district level. In particular, we obtained operational data for  USMS\u2019s prisoner activities from fiscal years 2010 through 2015,  specifically obtaining detention population counts per year for all prisoner  facilities by USMS district and daily detention population counts for  private and fixed rate facilities. We also obtained financial data that  pertained to housing, medical, and transportation costs, which we then  aggregated at the district level. This included the housing costs for each  facility, including per diem agreements for applicable state and locally- managed facilities and contract rates for facilities with guaranteed  minimum terms. While USMS districts do not manage private prison  facility contracts, we prorated the cost of private prison usage by district  by determining the proportion of the total annual average daily detention  population in private facilities associated with the district and dividing the  total private facility costs by that proportion.", "To determine medical costs, we obtained district-level medical services  information, medical guard services costs per district, and medical-related  transportation costs per district, which we summed to obtain district level  costs. To determine transportation costs, we obtained and summed costs  per district for in-district transportation guard support and costs for other  contract-rate guards. We also obtained Justice Prisoner and Alien  Transportation System (JPATS) air and ground transportation cost  information from USMS for JPATS\u2019s USMS prisoner operations, and  attributed ground transportation costs to the respective district  responsible for the prisoners moved. However, we were unable to  determine the costs of JPATS air support by district, as the agency does  not collect information or manage the JPATS air program to attribute such  costs by district.", "We assessed the reliability of these data and, and we found some  inconsistencies with the data. This reliability assessment included  conducting checks for completeness and logical consistency, obtaining  documentation on systems end-user capabilities and data control,  interviewing data users and managers responsible for maintaining data,  and comparing data to previous USMS reported data. The  inconsistencies we identified included inconsistencies in reported costs by  facility managed by state and local facilities and calculated costs based  on the reported per diem costs and the average daily population  attributed to the facilities. Further, we identified missing or inconsistent  facility designations that led to differing costs by facility. However, we  were able to address these inconsistencies and determined that they did  not greatly impact cost data for district prisoner operations. We also found  detention population data were missing for less than five days for each  fixed-rate facility (including private facilities and two state and local fixed- rate facilities). We found that the missing data did not severely impact our  calculation of costs and were able to account for the missing data in our  cost calculation. Because of these inconsistencies, USMS deobligations  in prisoner operations-related funding in later years, and differences due  to rounding, USMS-reported costs and annual average daily population  differ slightly from the calculated costs and populations in this report. We  found these differences to be minimal, affecting total costs by less than 2  percent in fiscal year 2012 and less than 1 percent in all other years  except for in fiscal year 2015, where USMS had made obligations for  costs to be incurred in fiscal year 2016. However, these obligations have  been removed from the data as they were not in the scope of the review.  The result was a difference in total costs of less than 1 percent in fiscal  year 2015. Therefore, we found the data to be reliable for the purposes of  identifying and describing the primary cost drivers and the districts\u2019  relative prisoner operation costs from the FPD.", "In addition, we interviewed USMS Prisoner Operations officials to obtain  USMS\u2019s views on identified cost drivers and trends. We corroborated  USMS headquarters officials\u2019 views by conducting interviews with USMS  officials in selected districts. Specifically, we conducted interviews with 3  different USMS districts\u2014the Southern District of California, the Northern  District of Georgia, and the District of Maryland\u2014to obtain field office  views on the costs and trends occurring over the past 6 years. We chose  these districts because of geographical disparity, size of prison  populations, and unique actions taken or ancillary missions conducted at  the district. Specifically, the Southern District of California has on average  one of the largest prison populations of any district and works with  numerous types of facilities to house prisoners. The Northern District of  Georgia has one large private facility and also serves as a transportation  center in the southeast for neighboring districts to transfer prisoners to  different facilities throughout the country. The District of Maryland is the  only district to have a state-owned facility currently participating in the  capital improvement program, a program where USMS provides funding  for improvements to state and local facility infrastructure. While the  information we obtained from our site visits is not generalizable to all  USMS districts, it provides insights into costs and trends in prisoner  operations.", "To determine the recent actions USMS has taken to reduce its prisoner  operations costs, we reviewed USMS\u2019s congressional budget  justifications and interviewed officials to compile a list of prisoner-related  actions that had monetized cost savings for fiscal years 2010 through  2015. We limited our analysis to those identified initiatives or actions that  had any monetized cost savings associated with them for fiscal years  2010 through 2015. We chose this time period to align our review of  USMS\u2019s costs savings efforts with our review of USMS\u2019s prisoners  operations cost trends for those 6 years. To determine the extent to which  USMS\u2019s estimated savings are reliable, we analyzed USMS documents  and data, where available, such as documentation of the methodology  and resulting dollar figures from each initiative\u2019s savings estimate, and  housing costs data. We compared each of USMS\u2019s cost savings  estimates against guidance for developing and documenting reliable cost  savings estimates, including the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal  Programs, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, and  GAO\u2019s guidance for Assessing the Reliability of Computer-Processed  Data to determine the extent to which the estimates were sufficiently  comprehensive, accurate, consistent, and documented. Additionally, for  each well-documented savings estimate, we assessed whether major  assumptions were reasonable by conducting or evaluating sensitivity  analyses. We also reviewed estimates to ensure that reasonable  assumptions were consistently and accurately applied. Additionally, we  used USMS\u2019s housing data on facilities\u2019 per diem costs per prisoner and  average daily population to determine the percentage of USMS prisoners  housed in federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) facilities for fiscal years 2010  through 2015\u2014for which USMS does not pay\u2014and to monetize any  potential cost savings resulting from USMS housing some of its prisoners  in BOP facilities.", "To monetize potential costs savings, we developed two estimates: (1) an  estimate of USMS\u2019s potential costs avoided by using BOP facilities for  fiscal years 2010 through 2015; and (2) an estimate of the potential cost  savings to the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ)\u2014of which both USMS and  BOP are component agencies\u2014in fiscal year 2015 due to USMS housing  its prisoners in BOP facilities versus in potentially more costly non-federal  facilities. To estimate the costs avoided by USMS, we used BOP- identified daily per capita costs for housing prisoners to calculate USMS\u2019s  potential costs avoided by housing its prisoners in BOP facilities from  fiscal years 2010 through 2015. To develop this cost avoidance estimate,  we assumed that USMS would pay BOP to house USMS prisoners at  BOP\u2019s daily per capita cost. These daily per capita costs are determined  and published by BOP for each type of federal facility on an annual basis.  We classified, confirmed, and applied the respective BOP daily per capita  rates to each BOP facility in which USMS prisoners were housed. Then,  we multiplied the total number of prisoners USMS housed in these BOP  facilities by the appropriate daily per capita cost, using USMS\u2019s data on  its average daily population for these facilities. Finally, we summed total  costs for each facility for fiscal years 2010 through 2015 to determine the  total costs avoided for each of these fiscal years.", "To estimate the potential cost savings to DOJ, we used USMS\u2019s fiscal  year 2015 prisoner population and costs data and BOP\u2019s per capita costs  to compare the costs of housing USMS\u2019s prisoners in BOP facilities  versus the costs to house those prisoners in private or state and local  facilities. We made the following assumptions: (1) if USMS were to pay  for housing its prisoners at BOP facilities, USMS\u2019 rate would be the daily  per capita cost per prisoner, as published by BOP, (2) the existing private  or state and local facilities would meet the demand of housing USMS  prisoners housed in BOP facilities if USMS did not have the use of BOP  facilities, and (3) the current private or state and local facilities would  meet USMS\u2019s housing demand at the same costs per day as they did in  fiscal year 2015. To develop the estimate, we first identified the USMS  districts that primarily used BOP facilities in fiscal year 2015. These 22  districts housed at least 2.5 percent of their total average daily population  in BOP facilities. We then determined the costs these districts would have  paid to BOP to house their prisoners, using BOP facilities\u2019 total daily per  capita rates and the districts average daily population for each BOP  facility. We then determined the difference in costs (i.e., potential cost  savings) between these districts housing their prisoners in BOP facilities  and these districts housing those same prisoners in private or state and  local facilities. Because USMS has the potential to use either private  facilities or state and local facilities to house its prisoners, we developed  two estimates to compare with the costs of housing prisoners in BOP  facilities\u2014one assuming prisoners were housed in private facilities, and  one assuming prisoners were housed in state and local facilities.", "To determine the costs to house the prisoners in private facilities, we  identified the private facilities that each district used in fiscal year 2015,  determined the private facilities\u2019 effective per diem costs, and derived a  weighted private facility per diem cost for each district. The weighted per  diem cost took into account USMS\u2019s average daily population for each  facility compared to USMS\u2019s total average daily population for private  facilities in each district. We applied weighted per diem costs for each  district to the average daily population the districts placed in BOP  facilities. We then summed the estimated total costs for using BOP  facilities and the estimated total costs of housing these prisoners in  private facilities for these districts, and compared the two to determine  cost savings, if any. We repeated the above methodology for state and  local facilities. Further, we interviewed agency officials to corroborate  initiatives we had identified as well as to identify any other unreported  cost savings actions. We also interviewed officials who estimated the  savings to explain the methodologies, clarify any discrepancies, and  provide any additional information in support of the estimates.", "To determine the extent to which USMS has systems designed to identify  additional opportunities to save costs, we reviewed the processes and  tools at USMS from fiscal years 2010 through 2015 that identify,  implement, and promote cost-efficiency and savings initiatives throughout  its institutions, such as USMS\u2019s use of score cards to determine district  utilization of private and federal facilities, and the agency\u2019s strategic plan.  We also spoke with USMS officials to discuss how its districts implement  USMS policy directive guidance, and in what instances the districts may  deviate from the stated guidance, as well as USMS\u2019s oversight of district  adherence to and deviation from internal policy guidance. We chose this  time period to align with our review of USMS\u2019s prisoner operations cost  trends for those 6 years.", "With respect to identifying additional opportunities to realize cost  efficiencies or reduce costs, using our financial analysis as context, we  analyzed elements of USMS\u2019s internal control system related to the  control objective of achieving operational efficiencies and interviewed  relevant officials to assess whether USMS has designed a management  structure and processes to routinely assess its administrative and  operational activities for possible corrective action. We did not  independently test USMS\u2019s internal controls to determine whether they  mitigate all possible risks and are operating as intended. Specifically, we  reviewed USMS\u2019s mechanisms and processes leading to its internal  review of operational and administrative functions, including its process  for taking corrective action related to high-cost areas, such as  procurement and human resources, and compared these characteristics  with those called for in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government and in implementing the guidance in the OMB Circular No.  A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility for Internal Control, which defines  management\u2019s responsibility for internal control in federal agencies. We  interviewed relevant officials to discuss current actions USMS internal  control officials have taken and are taking to include processes to identify  and implement corrective actions in high cost areas, and agency  oversight of these actions.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2015 to May 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

According to USMS officials, USMS has historically managed medical  care through the districts, though USMS began a nationally managed  program to better control costs beginning in fiscal year 2013. USMS  medical costs generally fall into three categories: (1) health care services,  such as payments to health care providers, and for supplies and  equipment; (2) USMS medical program costs including system-wide costs  such as USMS-employed practitioner review of medical records and  nationally-managed contracts; and (3) transportation and guard services  for medical care requiring outside services. However, beginning in fiscal  year 2013, USMS\u2019s Prisoner Operations Division (POD) initiated a  nationally managed care contract to pay for districts\u2019 health services. By  fiscal year 2014, USMS was paying for a substantial portion of the  districts\u2019 health care services through the nationwide contract. As a result,  costs shifted from districts paying for individual health services to POD  paying for most medical costs through a nationally managed contract as a  medical program expenditure. However, medical guard and  transportation costs are still paid by the districts and not through a  nationally managed program. As illustrated in figure 9, while total medical  costs have grown from about $88 million to about $115 million, costs for  individual district-managed health services have decreased and  transportation and guard service costs have remained relatively the  same, increasing slightly from almost $20 million to about $22 million over  the 6-year time period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transportation Costs", "paragraphs": ["Transportation costs include all support costs related to moving prisoners  between prison facilities or for court appearances and other court ordered  movements.

Transportation support costs fall into two broad  categories: (1) in-district support for movements occurring within or  otherwise managed by district U.S. Marshals and (2) support provided by  the USMS Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) for  prisoner movements of more than 50 miles outside the originating district.  JPATS is a separate division of USMS that conducts major prisoner  movements for both USMS prisoners and for BOP inmates. JPATS can  move prisoners through both ground and air services and owns and  leases a number of aircraft for its prisoner movements. District U.S.  Marshals are responsible for managing and paying for in-district  transportation support, which generally constitute prison officers from the  facilities in which prisoners are housed. For JPATS support, POD has a  reimbursable agreement in place with JPATS to reimburse the division for  its transportation and labor costs. As illustrated in figure 10, the majority  of transportation costs are costs associated with JPATS air travel each  year.
