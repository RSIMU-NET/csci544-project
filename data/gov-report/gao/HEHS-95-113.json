Under JOBS, states are to assess the needs and skills of AFDC recipients, prepare them for employment through education and training as needed, and place them in jobs. We reported earlier that while states have made progress in implementing JOBS, only a small percentage of the almost 4.6 million adults on AFDC participated in work-preparation activities in fiscal year 1993. Moreover, little is known about the JOBS program\u2019s progress in moving parents into employment and reducing their dependence on welfare.", "To help the Congress as it considers welfare reform, the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Finance requested us to provide information on (1) examples of county or local programs that stressed job placement, subsidized employment, or work-experience positions for welfare recipients; (2) the extent to which county JOBS programs nationwide emphasized these employment-focused activities; and (3) factors that hinder program administrators\u2019 efforts to move welfare recipients into jobs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Through AFDC, the federal government and the states provide cash assistance to needy families with children who lack support from one or both parents because of death, absence, incapacity, or unemployment.

According to a Congressional Budget Office study, the growth in female-headed families, especially those headed by females who had never been married, accounted for about one-half of the sharp increase of 1.2 million in the number of AFDC families between 1989 and 1993.", "Forecasting AFDC Caseloads, With an Emphasis on Economic Factors, Congressional Budget Office Staff Memorandum (Washington, D.C.: 1993), pp. 1, 3. mothers receiving AFDC who had never been married has doubled, from 21 percent in 1976 to 52 percent in 1992. About 70 percent of families receiving benefits have 1 or 2 children.", "While most AFDC recipients are single mothers, these women are a diverse group, making use of the program in different ways. For example, one study has estimated the total time that those receiving AFDC at a point in time can be expected to receive benefits, as shown in figure 1.2. This analysis indicates that 9 percent of these recipients are using AFDC for only a short time\u20142 years or less. About 76 percent, however, are receiving AFDC benefits for a total of 5 years or more, when all moves on and off welfare are considered. According to these data, under a 5-year limit on receipt of cash assistance\u2014a measure included in the House welfare reform bill\u2014about three-fourths of those on AFDC may be expected to hit the time limit and need to support themselves through employment or other means.", "This prospect poses a formidable challenge for many AFDC recipients who have limited education, job skills, and work experience. About 45 percent of all AFDC recipients, for example, have less than a high school diploma.Surveys of several thousand AFDC recipients expected to participate in JOBS in selected sites showed that at least one-third had extremely low literacy skills and between one-fourth and more than one-half lacked prior work experience. Over one-fourth thought they could not prepare for work because they or their family members had health or emotional problems.Such recipients are at risk of long-term welfare dependence. We reported previously that states have made some progress in working with some of these recipients but that many remain unserved.", "The JOBS program, begun in 1989, was designed to improve upon the performance of previous welfare-to-work programs and help combat long-term welfare dependence. Research studies conducted up to then showed that employment training programs for welfare recipients could have a positive but generally modest effect on increased earnings and reduced welfare costs. They also showed that programs that emphasized low-cost services, such as job search, generally did not help welfare recipients get higher paying jobs than they would have without the programs or help the more disadvantaged. It was hoped that JOBS could improve upon previous programs\u2019 performance by reaching further into the AFDC caseload and providing more comprehensive services, including education and training, to help parents find jobs that would end their dependence on welfare.", "To this end, under JOBS, states are to (1) provide a broad range of education, training, and employment-related activities; (2) increase the number of AFDC recipients participating in these activities; (3) target resources to the hard-to-serve; and (4) provide support services, including child care, transportation, work-related, and other support services, such as mental health counseling, if deemed necessary."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current JOBS Participation", "paragraphs": ["To encourage states to work towards the federal goal of reducing welfare dependency, the Congress created minimum participation and targeting requirements that states must meet to receive their full share of federal funding.

Under the targeting requirements, states must spend 55 percent of their JOBS funds on designated target groups.", "The Congress also expected that performance standards based on outcomes, such as increased employment and earnings and reduced welfare dependency, would be established after the initial implementation of the program. Outcome-related performance standards have not yet been established. (For more information on the current status of these performance standards, see p. 42.)", "While most states have met the minimum participation requirements, the number of AFDC recipients participating in JOBS remains limited. About one-half of the adults receiving AFDC have been exempted from JOBS, most often because they are caring for a young child. Of those considered nonexempt, states decide how many to serve in JOBS based on the availability of state resources. As shown in figure 1.3, the number participating in JOBS each month, while increasing, has remained limited for fiscal years 1991 through 1993. In 1993, about 11 percent of the 4.6 million adults receiving AFDC were active in JOBS activities each month.

Some programs set wage goals as high as $8 per hour, while others believe that a job at any wage level is an appropriate goal.", "To help AFDC recipients move towards self-sufficiency, states rely on two federal funding sources. First, about $1 billion of federal JOBS funds has been made available annually in recent years for allocation to the states. States must then commit their own funds to JOBS to match these federal funds. In fiscal year 1993, states used about 70 percent of the federal JOBS funds available to them. Second, the federal government has provided an uncapped source of funds to share with states the costs of providing child care assistance to AFDC recipients in education or training programs or who are employed. In fiscal year 1993, the federal government provided about $1.2 billion of the almost $2 billion spent by states on JOBS and AFDC child care.", "HHS oversees the JOBS program at the federal level and state AFDC agencies supervise it. At the local level, JOBS is administered either by the state AFDC office or by county officials. Before using JOBS funds to purchase services for participants, programs must make full use of the services and resources available in their communities without charge to AFDC recipients.

The programs in these places vary in their costs per participant and other features. Yet they all focus on work as the ultimate goal, with three of the programs\u2014in Riverside County, San Jose, and New York\u2014working closely with employers to move participants into paid employment, and the Athens and West Virginia programs supporting work- experience positions when regular employment was not available.", "Table 2.1 summarizes selected program features and highlights important differences among the programs. For example, the Riverside County program is administered by a welfare agency and involves all of the county\u2019s JOBS participants. While welfare agencies also operate the Athens and West Virginia programs, their work-experience programs involve only a portion of their JOBS participants. The other programs are not JOBS programs and are not operated by welfare agencies. A nonprofit organization operates the San Jose program, which serves welfare recipients among other individuals in the community. And a for-profit firm runs the New York City program under contract to the state welfare agency; it serves but a small fraction of the JOBS participants in the city.

A more detailed discussion of these programs follows."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Riverside County Program", "paragraphs": ["The Riverside County JOBS program stresses that its purpose is to place participants in jobs quickly. Researchers believe that this strong employment message may have been one of the key factors in producing results. Using an experimental design to evaluate JOBS programs in six California counties, researchers found that the Riverside County program increased the earnings of single AFDC parents by 49 percent and decreased welfare costs by 15 percent over 3 years. Results in the other five counties were about one-half that level. As shown in figure 2.1, the Riverside County program produced greater net gains than the other counties for both welfare recipients and government budgets, saving almost $3 for every $1 spent by the federal, state, and local governments. Moreover, long-term AFDC recipients, those with little education, and those more job-ready have benefited under Riverside\u2019s approach.", "Researchers who studied the six California counties believe that Riverside County\u2019s greater positive impacts may be due to a combination of program features. For example, the program had sufficient resources to make efforts to enroll all the AFDC recipients deemed mandatory for JOBS. In addition, it used the threat of reduced AFDC benefits for uncooperative participants to secure their participation in JOBS.", "In contrast with the other counties evaluated, Riverside also articulated a simple goal: participants are there to get a job and leave welfare as soon as possible. They are, therefore, encouraged to take any job offered, including low-wage jobs, part-time jobs, or jobs without benefits. To help participants get jobs, five full-time job developers provide direct access to employers and support the five JOBS offices that served about 2,000 active JOBS participants each month in 1993. The Riverside program also uses placement standards for its JOBS workers; case managers are expected to place at least 12 participants in employment each month.", "Stressing the importance of job search along with education in the basic skills of reading, writing, and math also appears to benefit Riverside. In Riverside and the other counties, new participants whose test results indicate that they need basic education have the option of entering the classroom immediately or attending 3 weeks of job search. However, Riverside\u2019s orientation results in proportionately more of its participants being in job search than is the case in most other California counties studied. Also, Riverside encourages those participants in education and training to find jobs quickly. Staff closely monitor these participants and expect those not making progress to look for work.", "Riverside\u2019s emphasis on short-term job search along with longer-term education may also account for its relatively low average cost of $3,000 per participant in 1993 dollars, compared with other California counties studied. Consistent with its emphasis on moving participants quickly into the work force, Riverside makes less use of basic, vocational, and postsecondary education than some other counties. For example, in Alameda County, which used education extensively, the 1993 average participant cost was $6,600.", "While the Riverside County results indicate that an emphasis on job placement, among other factors, is important, questions remain about what works best to help welfare recipients get jobs and earn enough to support their families. HHS has contracted with researchers to conduct experimental design studies to provide additional information on the cost effectiveness of higher-cost education and training programs compared with lower-cost programs that emphasize quick entry into jobs.", "While the Riverside program produced greater earnings increases and welfare savings than in the other counties, about 40 percent of its participants were still on AFDC 3 years after the study began, and many of those who did leave AFDC remained in poverty and possibly at risk of returning to welfare. Some of those that left AFDC may also have continued to receive other forms of public assistance, including Food Stamps and housing subsidies.", "The researchers also noted that it was not clear that Riverside\u2019s program could be replicated or, if replicated, could produce similar results in other localities nationwide\u2014for example, in inner cities where AFDC recipients may face greater barriers.

About 28 courses are offered, including child care provider, automated office skills, home health aide, commercial food service, and electronic assembly. Remedial education is integrated into the job skills training curriculum for participants who have basic skill deficiencies, rather than being offered separately.

CET\u2019s full-time job developers make contact with employers in the community and meet with participants who are nearing completion of training to help them find appropriate work. The job developers are assisted in their placement efforts by CET\u2019s vocational instructors, who maintain close contacts with local employers. CET also has an industrial advisory board, composed of employers, that meets monthly to provide advice on the types of training equipment to be used and other issues to ensure that the training offered meets the needs of employers.

America Works receives about $5,300 from the state\u2019s welfare agency when an AFDC recipient enrolled in America Works remains employed and off AFDC for at least 7 months. Unlike the Riverside and CET programs, the outcomes of the America Works program have not been compared with a comparison or control group to determine whether the effects were due to the program. Some of the America Works participants might have found jobs on their own, especially because many of them were motivated volunteers.", "While the program\u2019s design screens out those not motivated, the program does work with many long-term welfare recipients with low levels of education. The typical participant is an adult female head of household on AFDC an average of 5 years. Also, the typical participant in America Works has volunteered for the program, has a sporadic history of minimum-wage jobs, and can read and write well enough to complete a brief application. Applicants who need remedial basic education or English language training are referred to other community providers. About one-half of the participants have not completed high school.", "America Works officials believe that reaching out to employers and responding to their needs is a prime program goal.

In addition, they obtain workers at reduced wage and benefit costs initially, and with lower turnover and related costs.

While we identified about 18 percent of the programs that worked with all or almost all their participants to develop a sample budget demonstrating the benefits available to them when working, about 60 percent of the nation\u2019s JOBS programs reported that they do so for one-half or fewer of their participants.", "These findings are consistent with other studies showing that those on welfare, as well as welfare and JOBS caseworkers, may not be aware of or understand work incentives. One study of a sample of 30 women in Chicago concluded that the EITC may not provide an incentive to work because few recipients have a clear understanding of how it operates.Another study of welfare administrators found that many did not know that Medicaid coverage was available for certain children in families with incomes up to or, in some cases, beyond the federal poverty line."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Use of Work Activities", "paragraphs": ["Almost all JOBS programs encourage participants to engage in job search activities at some point in their enrollment in JOBS, but many job-ready participants do not become employed for a variety of reasons. For JOBS participants who cannot find regular employment, local JOBS programs have the option of using cash wage subsidies to encourage employers to hire them into on-the-job training or work-supplementation programs. Another option is to place participants in work-experience programs. For example, as discussed in chapter 2, West Virginia has used its community work-experience program to promote work among its welfare recipients when jobs were not available. Yet the use of work activities is limited, even though about 70 percent of the administrators reported that one-half or fewer of their job-ready participants became employed during their most recent program year. The distribution of counties according to their placement rates is shown in figure 3.2.", "The limited extent of work activities is seen in the following numbers: nationwide in mid-1994, of about 586,600 JOBS participants each month, about 59,000 were in work-experience programs, 3,000 were in on-the-job training, and 1,000 were in work-supplementation programs. As shown in figure 3.3, these work activities were little used compared with other JOBS activities. Moreover, more than 80 percent of the nation\u2019s counties have no experience operating work-supplementation programs and almost 50 percent have no experience in on-the-job training.", "This demonstrates that counties will face a major challenge in supporting the work programs called for in some welfare reform proposals. For example, H.R. 4 requires states to provide work activities for an increasing percentage of those receiving cash assistance or face penalties of up to 5 percent of the state\u2019s block grant. In 1996, states would have to involve 10 percent of all families in work activities, with the requirement rising to 50 percent by 2003. And the administration\u2019s proposal before the 103rd Congress called for those young mothers who do not find unsubsidized employment after 24 months of receiving AFDC to be placed in subsidized minimum-wage jobs. The House bill and the administration\u2019s proposal place a much greater emphasis on work activities than current law.", "Under both of these proposals, welfare agencies will need to work with many welfare recipients who cannot find jobs on their own. Attention will have to be paid to preparing these recipients for the workplace, because administrators we spoke with emphasized the importance of screening and selecting able and motivated participants to place with employers to maintain employer interest in participating in the programs. This is consistent with our survey results showing that in most counties the typical JOBS participant enrolled in on-the-job training or work supplementation has at least 1 year of previous work experience and high levels of motivation. Also, in most counties, participants in these work activities tended to be more educated than JOBS participants in general.", "While work activities are little used in JOBS, most administrators believe that they are effective tools that warrant expansion. Of the relatively small number of JOBS administrators currently using work supplementation, 70 percent rated it moderately or highly effective in moving AFDC recipients off welfare and 83 percent wanted to expand their use of it. Of those using on-the-job training, 72 percent thought it at least moderately effective in moving individuals off welfare and 88 percent expressed interest in expanding its use. Almost all counties used work experience, with 76 percent rating it as effective and 84 percent wishing to expand its use.", "In sites we visited, JOBS participants had been placed with a range of employers and other community organizations. They performed community service work with a county planning office, the Indian Health Service, and a community food bank. In addition, through the work-supplementation program, participants had found jobs at a car dealership, a large health care provider, and a small doctor\u2019s office. In one site, the work-supplementation program helped refugees receiving AFDC gain employment at worksites where they could improve their English-language skills. According to the program supervisor, some of the refugees had been in English as a Second Language classes for several years but had not progressed to employment.", "Of those program administrators not currently using on-the-job training, about 32 percent believed it to be moderately or highly effective in moving recipients off AFDC and about three-fourths supported expansion. At least one-half of the administrators without work-supplementation programs also wanted to develop or expand these programs, although they were less sure about the effectiveness of such programs.", "Evaluations of on-the-job training and work-supplementation programs have shown positive results in terms of increased employment and earnings for welfare recipients, but did not conclude that the programs produced welfare savings. As discussed in chapter 2, evaluations of work-experience programs have shown that they offer productive work for participants and benefits to taxpayers, but do not generally produce increased earnings, employment rates, or welfare savings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Internal and External Factors Hinder Strong Employment Focus", "paragraphs": ["While JOBS administrators acknowledged that they did not work enough with employers to help participants find jobs, they identified several administrative and programmatic factors that hindered their efforts.

For example, to operate work-supplementation programs, AFDC grant dollars must be diverted to employers to subsidize wages. Many administrators believe that it is difficult to develop and administer a tracking system to operate such a program. In addition, staff must market their programs to employers and sometimes visit worksites to maintain contact or monitor operations.", "Economies may be achieved if many participants are placed at a single worksite, but we found that generally only one or two participants are placed with each employer.", "Administrators believe that they need more staff to work with employers because current JOBS staff and resources are mainly devoted to participant intake and management of often heavy caseloads. According to HHS, JOBS caseloads range from 30 to 400 participants per worker.

For example, as a result of resource constraints, programs would often place participants in activities that were readily available or free of charge rather than create or purchase services that were deemed needed by participants.", "We also found that funding constraints limited the use of on-the-job training. About one-half of the JOBS administrators cited insufficient funds and one-third cited the high costs of on-the-job training compared with other JOBS activities as a major or moderate hindrance to its expansion.On-the-job training is sometimes more costly to a JOBS program than other activities because many of the educational or other activities in which participants are placed are funded by other providers or programs and do not require expenditures of JOBS funds. For example, a JOBS program may not pay for adult basic education or college courses funded by federal, state, or county providers.", "Funding constraints also hinder the use of work supplementation, even though this form of employer subsidy is funded by AFDC grants instead of JOBS funds. An official in Texas told us that in states with low AFDC grants, the amount of money that can be diverted to the employer is not sufficient for a wage subsidy. For example, the average AFDC grant in Texas equals $159 a month, providing few dollars to subsidize wages. In 1994, 31 state welfare agencies decided not to include work supplementation in the state JOBS plans they must submit to HHS for approval. As a result, the local programs in these states were barred from operating work-supplementation programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Performance Measurement System Does Not Promote Employment", "paragraphs": ["The current federal JOBS participation and targeting requirements provide little incentive for states to redirect scarce resources to increase their focus on moving AFDC recipients into employment. The JOBS performance measurement system is process-oriented, based on the numbers and types of participants enrolled in activities, and does not include outcome measures, such as the portion of participants who become employed and leave welfare. While the participation requirements have played an important role in encouraging states to serve more participants, including the hard-to-serve, the ultimate goal of JOBS is to increase employment and reduce welfare dependence. Yet states are not required by HHS to report the total number of JOBS participants who find jobs each year and are not held accountable for the number of JOBS participants who become employed.", "Some program administrators and researchers have noted that programs can meet federal participation requirements by placing participants in readily available JOBS activities more easily and with less cost to their programs than finding them unsubsidized jobs or creating subsidized employment. Because program administrators can meet federal requirements without redirecting scarce resources to focus more on employment, they have little incentive to do so. JOBS programs may, therefore, emphasize getting clients into program activities without also focusing on establishing links with employers to realize the ultimate goal of employment.", "For example, at one site we visited, a woman had successfully completed several different training programs.

Administrators cited as one contributing factor a federal displacement restriction. Under work-supplementation and work-experience programs, participants may only be placed in positions newly created by employers\u2014not positions that become vacant due to turnover. This prohibition is intended to protect workers from being displaced through layoffs and replaced by federally subsidized JOBS participants. About three-fourths of the administrators operating work-supplementation programs reported that this restriction hindered expansion of their programs and about 46 percent of all administrators said that they probably or definitely would like to use work supplementation for existing positions also.", "In addition, work-experience positions are restricted to sponsors who serve a public purpose, another restriction that about 72 percent of administrators would like to see changed, allowing them both more as well as a greater variety of employers with which to place participants to help them gain work experience. Like work-supplementation, work-experience positions are also subject to displacement restrictions. While most administrators did not believe that the displacement restriction was currently a factor hindering expansion, about one-half supported placing work-experience participants in existing positions. Administrators we spoke with thought that other workers and individuals could be protected without restricting work programs to new positions only.", "Local administrators also cited other reasons. For example, for on-the-job training, the JOBS program and employers must generally enter into contracts covering the employment of participants, maintain timekeeping and payroll records subject to audit, develop individual training plans, establish qualitative measures of success, and assess the progress of participants in acquiring jobs skills. Some employers may feel that the wage subsidy they receive\u2014up to one-half of participants\u2019 wages when training is completed\u2014does not adequately compensate them for any extra work they must do. In a work-experience program, while a participating employer gets an unpaid worker, the employer is not compensated for any supervision costs involved. Administrators we met cautioned that the number of available supervisors among employers places an upper limit on the expansion of work experience.", "Administrators also cited employer concerns about welfare recipients being unprepared for work. Employers\u2019 perceptions may be skewed by unfavorable stereotypes or unsuccessful prior experiences. One study of a welfare-to-work program in an inner-city neighborhood noted that many of the participants who found jobs had problems keeping them for various reasons, including chronic lateness and misunderstandings with supervisors.

More recently, we found that in 1993 the typical single mother with a low-wage job had more income than a comparable mother and family on AFDC, but was nevertheless still in poverty.", "Moreover, a low-wage worker may incur significant job-related costs, such as child care, which could make her family worse off financially than some AFDC families. In addition, employment or increased earnings may affect her receipt of other forms of assistance. For example, the previously cited survey of several thousand AFDC recipients found that 60 percent of the respondents in Atlanta lived in public housing projects or other subsidized housing. As a result, their incentive to find jobs may be affected because increased earnings may cause them to incur significantly increased housing costs.", "The belief and often the reality that a poor single mother can better provide for her family by being on welfare than by working at a low-wage job plays a critical role in discouraging AFDC recipients from looking for and accepting employment. As figure 3.4 shows, about three-fourths of the JOBS administrators cited the lack of jobs with sufficient wages and benefits as a moderate or major reason that their job-ready clients did not become employed. About 70 percent of administrators also noted that their participants did not become employed because of concerns about losing their AFDC benefits, Medicaid, or housing subsidies. By comparison, about one-half of administrators cited the lack of jobs as a major or moderate reason.", "One study found that 55 of 69 randomly selected current and former AFDC recipients interviewed in Tennessee and North Carolina said that they were not likely to accept a minimum-wage job that did not provide health insurance for them and their children.

These studies demonstrate that the supports available to low-wage workers, for example, the EITC, expanded Medicaid coverage, child support payments, and child care subsidies, play an important role in helping families get jobs and remain employed.

We continue to believe, based on all the evidence we gathered, that many JOBS programs nationwide do not have a strong employment focus.", "More specifically, ACF commented that the report does not recognize job search as an employment-focused activity and its extensive use in JOBS, thus, underrepresenting the employment efforts of JOBS programs. We acknowledge that programs can emphasize employment through their use of job-search activities for participants. As we had shown in figure 3.3, the participants enrolled in job search nationwide numbered 75,000 out of 586,600. In addition, we note that all programs use job search as an integral part of their programs and have added this information to the report.", "We also found, however, that while job search plays a role in all programs, its use varies considerably. Only about one-third of programs employ an early job search strategy that encourages participants to look for work upon enrollment in JOBS, in effect letting the local labor market decide who is job-ready and employable. Those who fail to find work initially are then placed in job search again after participating in education and training. On the other hand, most programs do not expect all participants to look for work upon enrollment, instead limiting job-search activities until participants have received the education and training that the program determines they need to become employed.", "We also note that the programs we highlighted for their strong job-placement efforts took steps beyond enrolling participants in job-search activities. These programs facilitate job-search activities by working closely with employers, through job-development efforts, to help participants find work. In addition, it is important that programs encourage their participants to accept employment by, for example, helping all participants understand the work incentives available to them. We found, however, that most programs did not strongly emphasize job-development efforts or inform all participants of important work incentives.", "In addition, ACF believes that we did not adequately recognize the extent of programs\u2019 connections with employers through their job development efforts. Our data show and the report acknowledges that almost all JOBS programs include some job-development activities, performed either by a program\u2019s own staff or through other organizations. We also found, though, that the extent of job development performed on behalf of JOBS participants, whether by the welfare agency itself or other organizations, is limited. For example, about 60 percent of program administrators reported that their program or its contractors arranged interviews for or marketed to employers only some or few of their job-ready participants. In addition, over one-half of the nation\u2019s program administrators believe that their program or its contractors did not do enough job development to meet their participants\u2019 needs.", "ACF also noted that JOBS programs can take many approaches to help their participants become employed. In addition, ACF stated that the relatively low use of subsidized employment and work experience does not necessarily indicate a lack of employment focus. We agree that there are many ways that programs can focus on employment, as we demonstrated with the examples of different approaches in chapter 2. We also agree that programs do not have to use subsidized employment or work experience to be considered employment-focused. The Riverside County program, for example, does not emphasize these options. However, we found that most programs reported placement rates for their job-ready participants of 50 percent or less. Yet programs were not widely using existing subsidized employment or work-experience options to foster work among the many participants unable or unwilling to find work.", "In addition to these issues, ACF expressed concern that our draft report promoted holding states accountable for the employment outcomes of their JOBS programs without noting the problems involved in such an approach. We acknowledge the challenges inherent in holding JOBS programs accountable for results. We maintain, however, that strong congressional interest in AFDC becoming more focused on helping recipients become employed, as well as requirements in the Government Performance Results Act that performance monitoring become more outcome-oriented governmentwide, indicate that more attention to outcome measures and goals is appropriate.", "ACF also suggested certain technical revisions to the draft, which we incorporated as appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
