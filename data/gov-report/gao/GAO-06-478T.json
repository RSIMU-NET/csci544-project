When considering complementary programs, projected investment costs for FCS are estimated to be on the order of $200 billion. FCS's cost is of concern given that developing and producing new weapon systems is among the largest investments the government makes, and FCS adds significantly to that total. Over the last five years, the Department of Defense (DOD) doubled its planned investments in such systems from $700 billion in 2001 to $1.4 trillion in 2006. At the same time, research and development costs on new weapons continue to grow on the order of 30 to 40 percent. FCS will be competing for significant funds at a time when Federal fiscal imbalances are exerting great pressures on discretionary spending. In the absence of more money being available, FCS and other programs must be executable within projected resources. Today, I would like to discuss (1) the business case needed for FCS to be successful and (2) related business arrangements that support that case."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There are a number of compelling aspects of the FCS program, and it is hard to argue with the program's goals. However, the elements of a sound business case for such an acquisition program--firm requirements, mature technologies, a knowledge-based acquisition strategy, a realistic cost estimate and sufficient funding--are not yet present. FCS began product development prematurely in 2003. Since then, the Army has made several changes to improve its approach for acquiring FCS. Yet, today, the program remains a long way from having the level of knowledge it should have had before starting product development. FCS has all the markers for risks that would be difficult to accept for any single system, much less a complex, multi-system effort. These challenges are even more daunting in the case of FCS not only because there are so many of them but because FCS represents a new concept of operations that is predicated on technological breakthroughs. Thus, technical problems, which accompany immaturity, not only pose traditional risks to cost, schedule, and performance; they pose risks to the new fighting concepts envisioned by the Army. Many decisions can be anticipated that will involve trade-offs the Government will make in the program. Facts of life, like technologies not working out, reductions in available funds, and changes in performance parameters, must be anticipated. It is important, therefore, that the business arrangements for carrying out the FCS program--primarily in the nature of the development contract and in the lead system integrator (LSI) approach-- preserve the government's ability to adjust course as dictated by these facts of life. At this point, the $8 billion to be spent on the program through fiscal year 2006 is a small portion of the $200 billion total. DOD needs to guard against letting the buildup in investment limit its decision making flexibility as essential knowledge regarding FCS becomes available. As the details of the Army's new FCS contract are worked out and its relationship with the LSI evolves, it will be important to ensure that the basis for making additional funding commitments is transparent. Accordingly, markers for gauging knowledge must be clear, incentives must be aligned with demonstrating such knowledge, and provisions must be made for the Army to change course if the program progresses differently than planned."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of the Army\u2019s  Future Combat System (FCS), a networked family of weapons and other  systems.

In essence, knowledge supplants risk  over time. This building of knowledge can be described as three levels or  knowledge points that should be attained over the course of a program:    First, at program start, the customer\u2019s needs should match the developer\u2019s  available resources\u2014mature technologies, time, and funding. An  indication of this match is the demonstrated maturity of the technologies  needed to meet customer needs.", "Second, about midway through development, the product\u2019s design should  be stable and demonstrate that it is capable of meeting performance  requirements.

We attended and/or  reviewed the results of the FCS System of Systems Functional Review, In- Process Reviews, Board of Directors Reviews, and multiple system  demonstrations. In our assessment of the FCS, we used the knowledge- based acquisition practices drawn from our large body of past work as  well as DOD\u2019s acquisition policy and the experiences of other programs.

Now,  the Army and its contractors are working to complete the definition of  system level requirements, and the challenge is in determining if those  requirements are technically feasible and affordable. Army officials say it  is almost certain that some FCS system-level requirements will have to be  modified, reduced, or eliminated; the only uncertainty is by how much. We  have previously reported that unstable requirements can lead to cost,  schedule, and performance shortfalls.

Some of FCS\u2019s critical technologies may not  reach a high level of maturity until the final major phase of acquisition, the  start of production. The Army considers a lower level of demonstration as  acceptable maturity, but even against this standard, only about one-third  of the technologies are mature. We have reported that going forward into  product development without demonstrating mature technologies  increases the risk of cost growth and schedule delays throughout the life  of the program. The Army is also facing challenges with several of the  complementary programs considered essential for meeting FCS\u2019s  requirements. Some are experiencing technology difficulties, and some  have not been fully funded. These difficulties underscore the gap between  requirements and available resources that must be closed if the FCS  business case is to be executable.", "Technology readiness levels (TRL) are measures pioneered by the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration and adopted by DOD to  determine whether technologies were sufficiently mature to be  incorporated into a weapon system. Our prior work has found TRLs to be  a valuable decision-making tool because they can presage the likely  consequences of incorporating a technology at a given level of maturity  into a product development. The maturity levels range from paper studies  (level 1), to prototypes tested in a realistic environment (level 7), to an  actual system proven in mission operations (level 9). Successful DOD  programs have shown that critical technologies should be mature to at  least a TRL 7 before the start of product development.", "In the case of the FCS program, the latest independent technology  assessment shows that none of the critical technologies are at TRL 7, and  only 18 of the 49 technologies currently rated have demonstrated TRL 6,  defined as prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. None of the  critical technologies may reach TRL 7 until the production decision in  fiscal year 2012, according to Army officials. Projected dates for FCS  technologies to reach TRL 6 have slipped significantly since the start of the  program. In the 2003 technology assessment, 87 percent of FCS\u2019s critical  technologies were projected to be mature to a TRL 6 by 2005.

The Army has taken some steps to  help manage the growing cost of FCS, including establishing cost ceilings  or targets for development and production; however, program officials  told us that setting cost limits may result in accepting lower capabilities.", "As FCS\u2019s higher costs are recognized, it remains unclear whether the Army  will have the ability to fully fund the planned annual procurement costs for  the FCS current program of record. FCS affordability depends on the  accuracy of the cost estimate, the overall level of development and  procurement funding available to the Army, and the level of competing  demands.", "At the start of product development, FCS program officials estimated that  the program would require about $20 billion in then-year dollars for  research, development, testing, and evaluation and about $72 billion to  procure the FCS systems to equip 15 brigade combat teams. At that time,  program officials could only derive the cost estimate on the basis of what  they knew then\u2014requirements were still undefined and technologies were  immature. The total FCS program is now expected to cost $160.7 billion in  then-year dollars, a 76 percent increase. Table 1 summarizes the growth of  the FCS cost estimate.", "According to the Army, the current cost estimate is more realistic, better  informed, and based on a more reasonable schedule. It accounts for the  restructure of the FCS program and its increased scope, the 4-year  extension to the product development schedule, the reintroduction of four  systems that had been previously deferred, and the addition of a spin-out  concept whereby mature FCS capabilities would be provided, as they  become available, to current Army forces. It also reflects a rate of  production reduced from an average of 2 brigade combat teams per year  to an average of 1.5 brigades per year. Instead of completing all 15  brigades by 2020, the Army would complete production in 2025. This cost  estimate has also benefited from progress made in defining system of  systems requirements.", "Figure 2 compares the funding profiles for the original program and for the  latest restructured program.", "The current funding profile is lower than the original through fiscal year  2013, but is substantially higher than the original after fiscal year 2013. It  still calls for making substantial investments before key knowledge has  been demonstrated. Stretching out FCS development by 4 years freed up  about $9 billion in funding through fiscal year 2011 for allocation to other  Army initiatives. Originally, FCS annual funding was not to exceed $10  billion in any one year. Now, the cost estimate is expected to exceed $10  billion in each of 9 years. While it is a more accurate reflection of program  costs than the original estimate, the latest estimate is still based on a low  level of knowledge about whether FCS will work as intended. The cost  estimate has not been independently validated, as called for by DOD\u2019s  acquisition policy. The Cost Analysis Improvement Group will not release  its updated independent estimate until spring 2006, after the planned  Defense Acquisition Board review of the FCS program.", "The latest cost estimate does not include all the costs that will be needed  to field FCS capabilities. For instance,    Costs for the 52 essential complementary programs are separate, and  some of those costs could be substantial. For example, the costs of the  Joint Tactical Radio System Clusters 1 and 5 programs were expected to  be about $32.6 billion (then-year dollars).", "Some complementary programs, such as the Mid-Range Munition and  Javelin Block II, are currently not funded for their full development. These  and other unfunded programs would have to compete for already tight  funding.", "Procurement of the spin-outs from the FCS program to current Army  forces is not yet entirely funded. Procuring the FCS items expected to be  spun out to current forces is expected to cost about $19 billion, and the  needed installation kits may add $4 billion. Adding these items brings the  total required FCS investment to the $200 billion range.", "Through fiscal year 2006, the Army will have budgeted over $8 billion for  FCS development. Through fiscal year 2008, when the preliminary design  review is held, the amount budgeted for FCS will total over $15 billion. By  the time the critical design review is held in 2010, about $22 billion will  have been budgeted. By the time of the production decision in 2012, about  $27 billion will have been budgeted.", "The affordability of the FCS program depends on several key assumptions.  First, the program must proceed without exceeding its currently projected  costs. Second, the Army\u2019s annual procurement budget\u2014not including  funds specifically allocated for the modularity initiative\u2014is expected to  grow from between $11 billion to $12 billion in fiscal year 2006 to at least  $20 billion by fiscal year 2011. The large annual procurement costs for FCS  are expected to begin in fiscal year 2012, which is beyond the current  Future Years Defense Plan period (fiscal years 2006-2011). FCS  procurement will represent about 60-70 percent of Army procurement  from fiscal years 2014 to 2022. This situation is typically called a funding  bow wave. As it prepares the next Defense Plan, the Army will face the  challenge of allocating sufficient funding to meet the increasing needs for  FCS procurement in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. If all the needed funding  cannot be identified, the Army will have to consider reducing the FCS  procurement rate or delaying or reducing items to be spun out to current  Army forces.

Although there is no complete consensus on the definition of LSI,  generally, it is a prime contractor with increased responsibilities. These  responsibilities may include greater involvement in requirements  development, design and source selection of major system and subsystem  subcontractors. The government has used the LSI approach on other  programs that require system-of-systems integration.

In this role,  Boeing is responsible for (1) engineering a system of systems solution, (2)  competitive selection of industry sources for development of the  individual systems and subsystems, and (3) integrating and testing these  systems to satisfy the requirements of the system of systems  specifications. Boeing is also responsible for the actual development of  two critical elements of the FCS information network\u2014the System of  Systems Common Operating Environment and the Warfighter-Machine  Interface.", "The Army participates in program decisions such as make/buy and  competitive selection decisions, and it may disapprove any action taken  under these processes. The decision structure of the program is made up  of several layers of Integrated Product Teams. These teams are co-chaired  by Army and LSI representatives. Government personnel participate in  each of the integrated product teams. This collaborative structure is  intended to force decision making to the lowest level in the program.  Decisions can be elevated to the program manager level, and ultimately  the Army has final decision authority. The teams also include  representation of the Army user community, whose extensive presence in  the program is unprecedented.", "The advantages of using an LSI approach on a program like FCS include  the ability of the contractor to know, understand, and integrate functions  across the various FCS platforms. Thus, the LSI has the ability to facilitate  movement of requirements and make trade-offs across platforms. This  contrasts with past practices of focusing on each platform individually.  However, the extent of contractor responsibility in so many aspects of the  FCS program management process, including responsibility for making  numerous cost and technical tradeoffs and for conducting at least some of  the subcontractor source selections, is also a potential risk. As an  example, many of the subcontractor source selections are for major  weapon systems that, in other circumstances, would have been conducted  by an Army evaluation team, an Army Contracting Officer and a senior- level Army source selection authority. These decisions, including  procurement decisions for major weapons systems, are now being made  by the LSI with Army involvement. This level of responsibility, as with  other LSI responsibilities in the program management process, requires  careful government oversight to ensure that the Army\u2019s interests are  adequately protected now and in the future.", "Thus far, the Army has been very involved in the management of the  program and in overseeing the LSI.
