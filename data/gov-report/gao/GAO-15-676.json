GAO reviewed FTA's National Transit Database data from 2004 and 2013 and applicable federal law, regulations, and grant documents; conducted six discussion groups with representatives of 36 rural and urban transit agencies; and interviewed FTA and GSA officials, national transit industry organizations, and transit bus manufacturers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the number of manufacturers of transit buses has declined in recent years, but bus production has remained constant. Transit agencies purchase over 5,000 buses per year\u2014about half are heavy-duty buses and half are smaller buses called \u201ccutaways\u201d because they consist of a bus body on top of a chassis built by another manufacturer. The number of firms that produce most heavy-duty transit buses declined from 10 in 2004 to 4 in 2013, the latest year data were available, due to business failures and consolidation. In contrast, the number of firms that produce most cutaways increased over the same time frame from 13 to 15. The number of buses procured annually by transit agencies from 2009\u20132013, using grant funds other than American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) funds, ranged from 4,670 to 5,652. Transit agencies and others used Recovery Act funds to purchase 7,544 more buses in 2009 and 2010.", "The amount of Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) grant funding that transit agencies used for bus procurement increased from $794 million in 2009 to $1.3 billion in 2013. Also, agencies spent $1.7 billion in funds from the Recovery Act on buses from 2009 to 2010. FTA oversees transit agencies by requiring them to certify their compliance with a range of federal requirements and by periodic reviews. FTA also provides bus procurement guidance and technical assistance. However, GAO found that some resources provided by FTA, such as its Best Practices Procurement Manual , reference obsolete FTA documents. Without updated guidance, transit agency officials may not be able to purchase buses as efficiently as possible because they may need to spend additional time researching the guidance or to repeat a required step in the procurement process.", "Transit agency officials GAO spoke with identified a range of challenges they face when procuring buses. Those challenges include difficulties in complying with federal procurement requirements. For example, officials reported that it is time consuming to comply with a requirement to certify that at least 60 percent of the bus's components are made in the U.S. because the agency must conduct pre- and post-award reviews of bus manufacturers. Transit agency officials in four of six discussion groups also identified the procurement process as difficult and resource-intensive, particularly for those transit agencies that do not purchase buses each year and may lack procurement capacity. Transit agency officials in four of six discussion groups stated these challenges could be addressed by allowing agencies access to General Services Administration's (GSA) sources of supply. Purchasing through GSA could allow agencies to decrease the time they spend on bus procurements since GSA would be responsible for ensuring that vehicles comply with federal procurement requirements. Further, purchasing through GSA could result in lower prices for buses, given GSA's ability to purchase vehicles well below the dealer invoice. According to FTA and GSA officials, both agencies have explored the feasibility of establishing a process to allow transit agencies to procure buses through GSA, but neither agency has developed a legislative proposal requesting that Congress grant authority to allow transit agencies to do so. In the past, nonfederal entities, such as state and local governments, have been authorized to purchase items through GSA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends FTA update its Best Practices Procurement Manual , assess its other related guidance, and update that guidance as needed.

Buses play a particularly important role in the provision of  paratransit services for people with disabilities. To support public  transportation, Congress, through grant programs managed by FTA  provides billions of dollars annually to transit agencies for operations and  capital investments, including bus procurement.

New buses are needed to replace aging existing buses or to expand an  agency\u2019s existing service. Transit agencies have raised concerns about  the difficulties of complying with federal procurement requirements for  buses and have sought alternative ways to buy buses. For example,  many agencies have purchased buses through buying cooperatives or by  acquiring the rights to procure buses under another transit agency\u2019s  existing contract, a process known as piggybacking.

We  allocated participants into homogeneous groups based on whether they  receive an urban or rural FTA grant, their location, and size of the transit  agency. To ensure we received input from urban transit agencies of  varying sizes, we established three size categories: large (with more than  100 buses); medium (with 50\u2013100 buses), and small (with less than 50  buses). We did not group rural agencies into size categories because we  selected all who volunteered and 97 percent of rural agencies have less  than 50 buses. We conducted two of the four urban group discussions  with small agencies due to the higher proportion of small agencies in the  total population of transit agencies, and we conducted one group  discussion each with medium and large urban-transit agencies. Based on  our findings from these discussion groups and a review of literature, we  summarized the challenges related to bus procurement into general  categories. While these challenges were consistently identified by both  urban and rural transit agencies with a mix of bus fleets, their views were  based on a self-selecting, non-representative sample of transit agencies,  and thus the results are not generalizable to all transit agencies.

For example, FTA  has established a minimum useful life for buses, in terms of years in  service or accumulation of miles, and requires that buses are maintained  and remain in use for at least their minimum life. To avoid the purchase of  unnecessary vehicles, FTA policy limits the size of each agency\u2019s bus  fleet to those the agency needs to provide its services. Thus, for each  new replacement bus purchased, FTA requires agencies to provide plans  for disposition of the vehicle to be replaced.", "While some transit agencies purchase buses frequently, most do not  make purchases every year and some go years between purchases.

We recruited discussion group  participants through mass e-mail solicitation and allocated participants  into homogeneous groups based on their location and size of the transit  agency. Our six discussion groups included the following:  two groups of officials from small, rural transit agencies; two groups of officials from small, urban transit agencies; one group of officials from medium, urban transit agencies; and one group of officials from large, urban transit agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Compliance with Federal Procurement Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Participants in all six discussion groups identified some aspect of FTA\u2019s  guidance, as well as some federal legal and regulatory requirements, as  posing challenges to procuring new buses. For example:  FTA guidance: Participants from four groups noted that some FTA guidance is outdated, as discussed in the previous section. Participants in three groups also cited that getting technical assistance from FTA was challenging. For example, a participant said that they contacted FTA officials about the applicability of a particular requirement but FTA officials would not provide a specific answer, leaving it to the transit agency to interpret. Participants in two rural groups said that they do not have the resources or experience to interpret these FTA requirements. While some participants appreciated the assistance from FTA regional staff, other participants in the large and small urban groups reported variation in the assistance received from FTA; some participants stated that FTA staff gave inconsistent advice or showed a lack of technical expertise. Participants in one group mentioned that FTA could be more proactive and provide more assistance to agencies during the procurement process.", "Requirements: Participants from two groups described instances where procurement requirements are seemingly unnecessary or not relevant. For example, participants in the discussion groups representing large and medium urban-transit agencies said that some FTA requirements do not reflect the reality of the transit bus market. According to these participants, FTA requires transit agencies to conduct a price analysis to ensure the price is reasonable, but this requirement seems unnecessary when there is only a single manufacturer that builds a specific type of bus. However, FTA does not require a price analysis when there is only a single manufacturer of a bus but does require a different type of analysis. This discrepancy illustrates that some transit agency officials are confused about FTA requirements. Participants in the medium urban group said  they find a lack of potential bidders when they attempt to procure  buses, and also have difficulty demonstrating that pricing is fair and  reasonable, which is required by federal regulations.", "Buy America: Participants from four groups told us that the Buy America certification requirements can be burdensome, complex, and costly. FTA requires transit agencies procuring buses with federal funds from FTA to certify compliance with Buy America requirements through pre-award and post-delivery reviews of bus manufacturers.Participants in two discussion groups from rural and medium urban transit agencies explained that their agencies needed consultants\u2019 help with required pre- and post-award audits for the Buy America certification.", "Contract Length: Participants in one small urban group told us that a federal requirement intended to encourage competition among manufacturers creates challenges. Specifically, the federal statutory provision prohibits transit agencies from entering into multiyear rolling- stock contracts with options to buy additional rolling stock or replacement parts for longer than 5 years if federal funds are used. Although FTA officials told us that the requirement is in place to ensure that the market is fair and open, participants told us that the restriction is burdensome; if they decide to procure new buses after the 5th year, they must initiate the procurement process all over again, which can be lengthy and costly.", "Joint Procurement and \u201cPiggybacking:\u201d While participants in some of the groups we spoke with said piggybacking in particular is a useful procurement tool, other participants cited challenges and limitations associated with piggybacking. For example, one small urban agency said that piggybacking was the only way they could procure a small quantity of buses\u2014such as one or two\u2014because they did not receive any bids in response to a request for proposal. Participants in three groups from rural, small, and medium urban-transit agencies said that  the opportunities for joint procurement and piggybacking may be  limited because there is no formal mechanism to identify mutually  beneficial opportunities for joint procurement or piggybacking and the  regulations regarding piggybacking are confusing. As a result, some  participants who had previously used piggybacking began to handle  their own procurements. Participants in two groups told us that transit  agencies are not generally aware of other transit agencies\u2019  procurement plans, and there is no entity to formally help facilitate  joint purchases. Some participants said they have learned of these  types of procurements through informal means, such as existing  relationships with other agencies or at industry conferences, and  through representatives of bus manufacturers. In addition, even if  agencies identify piggybacking opportunities, some participants found  the rules confusing. For example, officials in three discussion groups  (rural, small, and medium urban) were confused about whether FTA  allows agencies to participate in piggybacking options. FTA officials  told us that piggybacking options are allowed as long as an agency  unintentionally orders more buses than it requires. Transit agency  officials in two groups stated that piggybacking rules limit agencies\u2019  options related to the buses to be procured. These rules allow some  changes to the buses originally ordered that are within the general  scope of the contract\u2014such as seat fabric or exterior paint color\u2014but  prohibit changes outside the scope of the contract. One small urban  participant said these rules effectively prevent them from  piggybacking because the features his agency prefers to include in  their buses\u2014such as an extra wheel-chair securement location\u2014are  not features most other agencies include in contracts. Instead, the  participant said his agency prefers to conduct its own procurement so  it can get the features it needs.", "In addition to the challenges above, some transit agency officials in our  discussion groups cited challenges that specifically affect rural, urban  small and medium-sized agencies:", "Participants in four groups noted that the procurement process is difficult and resource intensive. Participants in four groups (rural, small, and medium urban) noted that smaller agencies tend to have few or no dedicated procurement staff and lack technical, engineering, or specification-writing expertise needed for bus procurement. Several participants noted that the procurement process can take from 6 months to a year. Further, small agencies said that they procure buses infrequently, such as every few years, so it is difficult for them to become familiar with the process. In addition, these procurements are often for 1\u20133 buses and sometimes generate few bids from manufacturers.", "Participants in three groups stated that procurement training opportunities through the NTI are not always designed to meet the needs of smaller agencies. Some participants told us that the material in the training courses is targeted to larger agencies, for example by assuming a level of support staff similar to what a larger transit agency would have. When these participants asked questions specific to their situations, they said the course instructors were not able to answer them. Additionally, participants in the rural group explained that with their limited staff resources, it was difficult to spare anyone to attend off-site training for multiple days."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Related to Transit Bus Industry Changes", "paragraphs": ["Participants in all six discussion groups cited the following challenges  stemming from changes in the transit bus industry:", "Participants in all six discussion groups said there is limited competition to produce heavy-duty buses. Specifically, participants told us that there are currently three heavy-duty bus manufacturers and one that makes 60 foot buses. According to participants in one small urban group, the limited number of heavy-duty bus manufacturers has led to a longer delivery time (18 months) and the price of new buses has increased faster than inflation.", "Furthermore, participants also noted a lack of vendors for vehicle components. Specifically, participants told us that there is currently only one engine manufacturer for heavy-duty buses that complies with Buy America requirements. Participants in four discussion groups stated that Buy America and DBE requirements and consolidation of the industry have contributed to the lack of available vehicle  component vendors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Participants in four discussion groups stated that it was a challenge to  secure funding for transit buses. Transit agencies may use federal, state,  and local funds to purchase or replace buses but must weigh these  purchases against other capital and operating needs. Transit agencies  also told us that the federal surface transportation authorizations and  appropriations process creates year-to-year uncertainty that can be a  challenge for long-term planning. Obtaining state or local funding to meet  federal local match requirements was identified as a challenge by  participants in three discussion groups. Constrained state and local  budgets can make securing these funds difficult. We have previously  found that some states provide limited or no state funds for rural transit, a  process that increases the pressure on rural transit agencies to secure  local funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transit Agencies\u2019 Access to Federal Sources of Supply Could Address Many Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Participants in all six discussion groups offered ideas about possible ways  that the federal government could address some of the procurement  challenges they identified (see table 5).", "Participants in four discussion groups from rural, urban-medium, and  urban small-transit agencies suggested that FTA develop a national  procurement schedule similar to that of the GSA\u2019s.  GSA establishes  long-term government-wide contracts for millions of products with  commercial firms and provides federal agencies and others with access  to these sources of supply.  According to GSA officials, GSA negotiates  volume discounted prices and its policies and procedures are designed to  ensure that vendors comply with federal procurement requirements.  Transit agencies are not permitted to purchase through GSA because  they are not federal agencies or other authorized users. In the past,  entities other than federal agencies have been authorized to purchase  items through GSA. For example, states and units of local government  have been authorized pursuant to statute to purchase equipment,  including vehicles, in support of counter-drug, homeland security, and  emergency response activities.  Purchasing through GSA could allow  for more streamlined procurement for transit agencies and potentially cost  savings because GSA would be responsible for ensuring that any bus  procured through GSA complies with federal and FTA requirements. As a  result, transit agency officials would not need to develop their own  specifications or procurement requirements and would not be required to  ensure the buses comply with the Buy America certification. In addition,  GSA officials noted that they are usually able to secure very good pricing  because the purchasing power of the federal government results in  volume discounts. For example, they said the price of vehicles they  procure averages 17 percent below the dealer invoice price. Officials said  these prices compare favorably to prices paid by other large capacity  vehicle purchasers, such as rental car companies. According to FTA and  GSA officials, both agencies have explored the feasibility of establishing a  process to allow transit agencies to procure buses through GSA and both  agencies support the concept. GSA officials said they have the capability  to provide a streamlined procurement process to transit agencies that  complies with federal and FTA requirements. However, GSA officials told  us that Congress would have to authorize transit agencies to purchase  through GSA. Neither agency has submitted a legislative proposal to  Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Buses are an important part of public transit. Transit agencies maintain a  fleet of buses to provide transit service. In order to do so, transit agencies  purchase buses to either replace their existing fleet or expand service. In  2013, transit agencies used over $1 billion of federal funding to purchase  buses. While some large agencies purchase buses each year and have a  dedicated procurement staff for doing so, other transit agencies purchase  buses only occasionally.  Moreover, participants in our discussion groups  explained that smaller agencies tend to have few or no dedicated  procurement staff and lack expertise needed for bus procurement. Thus,  they are challenged to knowledgably and efficiently complete all of the  steps required to procure buses with FTA funds. Therefore, FTA guidance  and assistance in helping transit agencies procure buses is important.  While this guidance is widely available on-line, some FTA guidance is out  of date and refers to incorrect regulations and information. As a result,  transit agencies may not be able to purchase buses as efficiently as  possible, as they may need to spend additional time researching the  guidance or they may have to repeat a required step in the procurement  process.", "While transit agencies face several challenges in procuring buses, many  of these challenges could be alleviated if agencies were allowed to  purchase buses through GSA. By purchasing through GSA, agencies  would know that they are getting a bus that complies with federal  procurement requirements. In addition, transit agency staff\u2014particularly  those at smaller agencies who may lack procurement expertise\u2014would  be able purchase buses more easily and efficiently.  Specified non-federal  entities have been authorized to purchase through GSA in the past.  Specifically, states and local governments have been authorized under  federal statute to purchase through GSA for emergency equipment and  homeland security-related items, among other things. Transit agencies  could experience cost savings if they were able to purchase buses  through GSA, as agencies will not need to spend as much time on the  procurement process. Allowing transit agencies to make such purchases  could also lead to cost savings because GSA staff have expertise in price  negotiation and they have procured vehicles that, given the volume of  purchases, are on average 17 percent below the invoice price. Ultimately,  the efficient purchasing of buses may also save money for the federal  government, as transit agencies may require fewer federal funds to  operate their transit programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that transit agencies have appropriate and current guidance to  assist them when procuring transit buses, we recommend that the  Administrator of FTA update its Best Practices Procurement Manual and  assess its other related guidance identified in this report and update that  guidance as needed.", "To provide a more efficient and cost-effective way for transit agencies to  procure transit buses while complying with federal procurement  requirements, we recommend that the Administrator of FTA, in  conjunction with the Administrator of the General Services Administration,  submit a legislative proposal to Congress that would authorize transit  agencies that are recipients of FTA grants to access GSA sources of  supply for the purchase of transit buses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Transportation and  the General Services Administration for review and comment prior to  finalizing the report.

We reviewed  data from the National Transit Database (NTD) for the years 2004 and  2013 to evaluate changes to transit agencies\u2019 bus fleets over time. We  chose those years because 2013 was the latest data available and 2004  represented data 10 years earlier, which we believe to be sufficient to  show any changes in the industry. We included vehicles used for fixed- route, demand-response, and deviated-fixed route services and excluded  vehicles used for other services\u2014commuter buses, inter-city buses,  trolley or specialty buses, vanpool vans, and automobiles\u2014because  these vehicles represent a small portion of all vehicles used. To assess  the reliability of data from NTD, we interviewed officials about data quality  control procedures and reviewed relevant documentation and determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We categorized buses generally and for the purposes of this report as  heavy-duty or cutaway. FTA also uses these categories as well as three  others, which we did not include for ease of reporting and because the  heavy-duty and cutaway categories encompassed over 95 percent of  transit buses, according to FTA in 2006.", "To identify bus manufacturers, the number of buses produced, and any  changes over time, we reviewed NTD urban vehicle inventory reports  from 2004 and 2013, the most recent year data are available. Transit  agencies receiving federal grant funding from FTA are required to report  operating information to NTD, including detailed information on their bus  fleet. For each year, we limited the data to reported vehicles that are 1)  used to provide bus or demand response transportation services; 2)  shown as bus and articulated bus vehicle types; and 3) within a 5-year  model range of the year of the data report (2004 to 2000 model years for  the 2004 data and 2013 to 2009 for the 2013 data). We further grouped  the data set by vehicle length: generally, vehicles 30 feet in length or  greater (heavy-duty buses) and vehicles less than 30 feet (cutaway  buses). For each group, we identified the number of vehicles from each  manufacturer and calculated an approximate market share by dividing  that number by the total number of vehicles.", "Within the data set, some records included missing data, particularly for  manufacturer\u2019s name and for model year. We excluded these records  from our analysis. The number of vehicles associated with missing data  records represented 11 percent of the total number of vehicles in the  2004 data and 10 percent in the 2013 data. We also manually reviewed  all records and identified some information that appeared to be incorrect  based on other data in the record. Most commonly, vehicles were  categorized as a vehicle type van when other evidence, such as the  manufacturer name, indicated they should be categorized as a bus. We  included these vehicles in our analysis. In more limited cases, vehicles  were categorized as a bus when other evidence indicated they should be  categorized as a van.

In order to include a  wide geographical distribution of participating agencies, we conducted all  six discussion groups remotely via WebEX. We established three size  categories to ensure we received input from a range of sizes of urban  agencies: large (more than 100 buses); medium (50\u2013100 buses), and  small (less than 50 buses). We did not group rural agencies into size  categories because 97 percent of these agencies have less than 50  buses.
