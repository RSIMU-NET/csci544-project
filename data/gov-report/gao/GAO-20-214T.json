Activities identified by state investigators included schemes in which recovery home operators recruited individuals with substance use disorder to specific recovery homes and treatment providers, and then billed those individuals' insurance for extensive and unnecessary drug testing for the purposes of profit. For example, officials from the Florida state attorney's office told GAO that, in some instances, substance use disorder treatment providers were paying $300 to $500 or more per week to recovery home operators for every individual the operators referred for treatment. Then, in one of these instances, the provider billed an individual's insurance for hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary drug testing over the course of several months. Further, these officials told GAO that as a result of these investigations at least 13 individuals were convicted and fined or sentenced to jail time.", "To increase oversight, officials from three of the five states\u2014Florida, Massachusetts, and Utah\u2014said they had established state certification or licensure programs for recovery homes in 2014 and 2015.

Officials explained that recovery  home operators establish these relationships, because they cannot  directly bill health insurance themselves due to the fact that recovery  homes are not considered eligible providers for the purposes of billing  health insurance. For example, treatment providers may form  relationships with recovery home operators who then recruit individuals  with SUD in order to refer or require residents to see the specific SUD  treatment providers.

In 2016, the state attorney for the 15th judicial circuit (Palm  Beach County) convened a task force composed of law enforcement  officials tasked with investigating and prosecuting individuals engaged in  fraud and abuse in the SUD treatment and recovery home industries. The  task force found that unscrupulous recovery home operators or  associated SUD treatment providers were luring individuals into recovery  homes using deceptive marketing practices. These practices included  online or other materials that willfully misdirected individuals or their  family members to recruiters with the goal of sending these individuals to  specific treatment providers so that the recruiters could receive payments  from those treatment providers for each referral. According to officials  from the Florida state attorney\u2019s office, these individuals\u2014often from out  of state\u2014were lured with promises of free airfare, rent, and other  amenities to recover in southern Florida\u2019s beach climate. Recruiters  brokered these individuals to SUD treatment providers, who then billed  their private insurance plans for extensive and medically unnecessary  urine drug testing and other services. Officials from the Florida state  attorney\u2019s office told us that SUD treatment providers were paying $300  to $500 or more per week to recovery home operators or their staff  members for every individual they referred for treatment. In addition,  these officials cited one case in which a SUD treatment provider billed an  individual\u2019s insurance for close to $700,000 for urine drug testing over a  7-month period. Officials from the state attorney\u2019s office noted that the  recovery homes that the task force investigated were not shared homes  in the traditional, supportive sense, but rather existed as \u201cwarehouses\u201d  intended to exploit vulnerable individuals.", "As a result of these investigations, as of December 2017, law  enforcement agencies had charged more than 40 individuals primarily  with patient brokering, with at least 13 of those charged being convicted  and fined or sentenced to jail time, according to the state attorney\u2019s office.

In other cases, the laboratories were paying kickbacks to  recovery homes for referrals for urine drug testing that was not medically  necessary. According to the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit official, as a  result of these investigations, the state settled with nine laboratories  between 2007 and 2015 for more than $40 million in restitution.

Officials  noted that they suspect that the alleged fraud was primarily being carried  out by SUD treatment providers and treatment facilities that also own  recovery homes. The officials said the department had not been able to  file charges against any treatment providers, because it had been unable  to collect the necessary evidence to do so. However, according to the  officials, the state enacted legislation in 2016 that gave insurers and state  regulatory agencies, such as the state\u2019s insurance department and  licensing office, the authority to review patient records and investigate  providers that bill insurers.

Florida enacted legislation in 2015 and Massachusetts enacted legislation  in 2014 that established voluntary certification programs for recovery  homes. Further, Florida established a two-part program for both recovery  homes and recovery home administrators (i.e., individuals acting as  recovery home managers or operators). According to officials from the  Florida state attorney\u2019s office and Massachusetts Medicaid Fraud Control  Unit, their states established these programs, in part, as a result of state  law enforcement investigations. Utah enacted legislation in 2014 to  establish a mandatory licensure program for recovery homes. According  to officials from the Utah substance abuse agency and the state licensing  office, Utah established its licensure program, in part, to protect residents\u2019  safety and prevent their exploitation and abuse.", "In our March 2018 report, we found that although state recovery home  programs in Florida and Massachusetts are voluntary, there are  incentives for homes to become certified under these states\u2019 programs,  as well as incentives to become licensed under Utah\u2019s programs.  Specifically, all three states require that certain providers refer patients  only to recovery homes certified or licensed by their state program;  therefore, uncertified and unlicensed homes in the three states are  ineligible to receive patient referrals from certain treatment providers.  Further, state officials told us that state agencies are taking steps to  ensure providers are making appropriate referrals. For example,  according to officials from the Florida substance abuse agency, treatment  providers may refer individuals to certified recovery homes managed by  certified recovery home administrators only and must keep referral  records.", "To become state-certified or licensed, recovery homes in Florida,  Massachusetts, and Utah must meet certain program requirements,  including training staff, submitting documentation (such as housing  policies and a code of ethics), and participating in onsite inspections to  demonstrate compliance with program standards. However, specific  requirements differ across the three states. For example, while all three  state programs require recovery home operators or staff to complete  training, the number of hours and training topics differ. In addition, for  recovery homes to be considered certified in Florida, they must have a  certified recovery home administrator. Similar to Florida\u2019s certification  program for the homes, individuals seeking administrator certification  must meet certain program requirements, such as receiving training on  recovery home operations and administration, as well as training on their  legal, professional, and ethical responsibilities. Features of the state- established oversight programs also differ across the three states,  including program type, type of home eligible for certification or licensure,  certifying or licensing body, and initial fees.", "As we noted in our March 2018 report, the state-established oversight  programs in Florida, Massachusetts, and Utah also include processes to  monitor certified or licensed recovery homes, and take action when  homes do not comply with program standards. For example, an official  from the Florida Association of Recovery Residences\u2014the organization  designated by the state to certify recovery homes\u2014told us that the entity  conducts random inspections to ensure that recovery homes maintain  compliance with program standards. State-established oversight  programs in the three states also have processes for investigating  grievances filed against certified or licensed recovery homes. Further,  officials from certifying or licensing bodies in all three states told us their  organizations may take a range of actions when they receive complaints  or identify homes that do not comply with program standards, from  issuing recommendations for bringing homes into compliance to revoking  certificates or licenses. According to officials from Florida\u2019s certifying  body, the entity has revoked certificates of recovery homes that have  acted egregiously or have been nonresponsive to corrective action plans.  Officials from the certifying and licensing bodies in Massachusetts and  Utah told us that they had not revoked certificates or licenses, but had  possibly assisted homes with coming into compliance with certification  standards or licensure requirements.", "Officials from Ohio and Texas told us that their states had not established  state oversight programs like those in Florida, Massachusetts, and Utah,  but said their states had provided technical assistance and other  resources to recovery homes in an effort to increase consistency,  accountability, and quality.", "Officials from the Ohio substance abuse agency told us that since  2013 the state has revised its regulatory code to define recovery  homes and minimum requirements for such homes. Officials also told  us that the agency did not have authority to establish a state  certification or licensure program for recovery homes. According to  these officials, the state legislature wanted to ensure that Ohio\u2019s  recovery homes community maintained its grassroots efforts and did  not want a certification or licensure program to serve as a roadblock  to establishing additional homes. However, officials from the Ohio  substance abuse agency told us that the agency encourages recovery  homes to seek certification by the state\u2019s NARR affiliate\u2014Ohio  Recovery Housing\u2014to demonstrate quality. In addition, these officials  told us that the state substance abuse agency also provided start-up  funds for Ohio Recovery Housing, as well as continued funding for the  affiliate to provide training and technical assistance, and to continue  certifying recovery homes. According to officials from Ohio Recovery  Housing, the NARR affiliate regularly provides the state\u2019s substance  abuse agency with a list of newly certified recovery homes, as well as  updates on previously certified homes as part of ongoing efforts to  develop a recovery home locator, under its contract with the agency.", "Officials from the Texas substance abuse agency told us that  establishing a voluntary certification program would be beneficial.
