The UPA initiative is intended to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of comprehensive, integrated, and innovative approaches to relieving congestion, including the use of tolling (congestion pricing), transit, technology, and telecommuting (4Ts). Congestion pricing involves charging drivers a fee that varies with the density of traffic. This report addresses congressional interest in (1) how well the department communicated UPA selection criteria, (2) whether it had discretion to allocate grant funds to UPA recipients and consider congestion pricing as a priority selection factor, and (3) how it is ensuring that UPA award conditions are met and results are assessed. GAO reviewed departmental documents, statutes and case law, and interviewed department officials and UPA applicants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although GAO did not assess the merits of the UPA initiative's design, it has reported on its support for integrated approaches to help reduce congestion. With minor exception, the department did a good job communicating the criteria it would use to select urban partners and how much funding was available, but it did not clearly communicate the relative priority of the criteria or extend the same outreach to all applicants. The department clearly communicated 10 of the 11 selection criteria--such as the political and technical feasibility of projects--that it used to decide which cities to select as urban partners, but it did not publicize which criteria, other than the 4Ts, were most important. In addition, over time, the department provided information indicating that about $852 million was available for these projects--a figure short of the actual $1.02 billion but sufficient to give applicants a rough idea of the program's size. Clearly communicating selection criteria, their relative priority, and the available funding allows applicants to make informed decisions when preparing their applications. GAO also found that the department told two semifinalists for being named urban partners how to revise their applications to make them more competitive, but did not do so for the other semifinalists. Both were ultimately selected as urban partners. However, in the absence of government-wide or departmental guidance, it is unclear how to assess the appropriateness of this assistance. The department acted within its authority to allocate about $848 million of its fiscal year 2007 appropriation under 10 grant programs to five UPA cities. Typically these funds have been awarded through congressional direction (earmarks) to thousands of jurisdictions; but the department's 2007 funds were not subject to such directives. In addition, the department had authority to consider congestion pricing as a priority selection factor when awarding funds because the underlying statutes either explicitly permit it or provide the department with the authority to do so. However, GAO found that the department likely did not comply with statutory requirements of the Transportation, Community, and System Preservation program by failing to require applicants to meet all five statutory factors in order to receive \"priority consideration,\" but this may not have affected the selection outcome. The department has developed a framework to ensure that UPA award conditions are met and the initiative's results will be evaluated. The department is monitoring urban partners' completion of award conditions, such as obtaining congestion-pricing authority, and has already acted when conditions have not been met, such as by taking away New York City's funding when it could not obtain congestion pricing authority from the state. In addition, the department plans to evaluate urban partners' strategies for, and results in, reducing congestion. The evaluation, to be conducted by To view the full product, including the scope Battelle Memorial Institute, is in its early stages."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Mobility on our nation\u2019s roads is essential for a strong economy. These  roads provide businesses with access to materials, markets, and people  and provide people with access to goods, services, jobs, and recreation.  According to the Department of Transportation (the department),  congestion is one of the single largest threats to our economic prosperity  and way of life. In addition, the department states that congestion and the  growing unreliability of the highway system impose severe costs on the  quality of life of millions of Americans. We have reported that the nation\u2019s  transportation infrastructure is under great strain and that congestion is  significant and expected to worsen. Furthermore, federal funds are often  tied to a single transportation mode, which may limit the use of these  funds to finance the greatest improvements in mobility. The department  also has recognized that these \u201cmodal funding silos\u201d present challenges in  combating congestion, and in May 2006 it issued a strategy to reduce  congestion that, among other things, called for    entering into urban partnership agreements (UPA) under which the  department would give priority consideration for funding from existing  programs to cities, designated as urban partners, that had developed and  were standing ready to quickly implement a comprehensive, integrated,  and innovative performance-oriented approach designed to reduce  congestion through the use of the \u201c4Ts\u201d\u2014tolling (more specifically,  congestion pricing), transit, technology, and telecommuting\u2014rather than  relying on unintegrated efforts to relieve congestion;   establishing a Corridors of the Future (Corridors) program as a model for  adopting a multistate approach to planning, developing, constructing,  operating, and maintaining nationally and regionally significant  transportation corridors that would be designated to reduce congestion  and increase freight system reliability; and reducing barriers to private-sector investment in the construction,  ownership, and operation of transportation infrastructure.", "In our prior work, we have supported integrated, performance-based  approaches to reducing congestion. In addition, we have reported that  public-private partnerships show promise\u2014but also risk\u2014as a strategy to  provide new infrastructure and funding for transportation needs.", "In February 2007, Congress enacted a continuing resolution for fiscal year  2007. The continuing resolution funded the department at 2006 levels but  did not include spending directives (earmarks) for the department\u2019s grant  programs. According to the department, the continuing resolution gave it  the opportunity to make funding decisions based on programmatic criteria  and merit, rather than devoting funds to projects specifically directed by  Congress that, in the department\u2019s view, may have had fewer  transportation benefits or that otherwise would have been ineligible for  funding. Given this flexibility, the department decided to further its 2006  congestion-reduction initiative by making available about $1 billion of its  2007 appropriation for its UPA initiative, through grants made under 13  existing highway, transit, and technology grant programs. This was a  major undertaking over a short time to develop an integrated approach  from separately existing programs. The department set aside the bulk of  these funds to support its UPA initiative and, in August 2007, conditionally  awarded about $848 million from 10 of the 13 programs to five cities:  Miami, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York City, New York; San  Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington.", "As part of an integrated approach to reducing congestion, many UPA  applicant cities proposed to implement a tolling (congestion-pricing)  project. To address the other three \u201cTs,\u201d urban partners coupled their  congestion pricing projects with transit, technology, and telecommuting  projects. Transit projects included expanded bus service (and sometimes  ferry service), including providing additional buses and bus stops, express  bus routes, and park-and-ride facilities. Technology uses included such  things as providing real-time traveler information on tolls being charged  and opportunities for rerouting traffic to alternative travel routes.  Telecommuting involved increasing the number of telecommuters.  Applying for the UPA initiative required no small effort on the part of  applicants because many public stakeholders were involved and some  cities faced political opposition to congestion-pricing projects. For  example, New York City was unable to obtain authority from the state  legislature to implement a congestion-pricing approach. In accordance  with the terms of the department\u2019s agreement with New York City, the  department therefore cancelled the city\u2019s UPA and in 2008 awarded the  funds to Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Seattle,  Washington. In addition to awarding funds to cities for integrated  approaches to reducing congestion that could be implemented quickly, the  department saw another major benefit of UPAs as providing an incentive  for state and local transportation stakeholders to work together toward  transportation solutions. Beyond breaking down stovepipes in devising  approaches to reduce congestion, UPAs, according to department officials,  helped break down stovepipes within the department as different  transportation administrations increased collaboration in addressing  congestion-reduction strategies, where before they may have acted  separately.", "In response to the department\u2019s dedication of about $1 billion to its  congestion-reduction initiatives and its focus on funding a small number of  cities through the UPA initiative, Congress, in the conference report for  the department\u2019s fiscal year 2008 appropriation and in a separate letter  from the Senate and House leadership responsible for transportation  matters, requested that we review certain aspects of the UPA initiative. To  do this, we examined (1) the department\u2019s communication and application  of the selection criteria and funding devoted to the UPA initiative, (2) the  department\u2019s authority to allocate substantial grant funds to support the  UPA initiative and to consider congestion pricing as a priority factor in  selecting urban partner awardees for underlying grant programs, and (3)  steps the department is taking to ensure that UPA award conditions are  being met and that results will be evaluated. These activities are the main  focus of this report. In addition, in response to your interests, we  examined how the department selected awardees for its Corridors of the  Future program, the department\u2019s efforts to promote public-private  partnerships, and the extent to which previous recipients of grants from  programs that funded the UPA initiative and Corridors were awarded  funds from those programs in fiscal year 2007. (See apps. I to III.) We did  not assess the merits of the UPA initiative or Corridors program design.", "To carry out our work, we reviewed the department\u2019s communication of  the criteria for selecting UPA awardees and the funding amounts to be  devoted to the initiative through notices in the Federal Register and UPA  initiative outreach materials, such as presentation slides and handouts. We  also discussed these activities with senior department leaders, department  staff who reviewed UPA applications, and 14 of the 26 UPA applicants.  We also reviewed all of the 26 UPA applications. In determining good  grants practices, we reviewed the department\u2019s, as well as other  government agencies\u2019, grant policies. Furthermore, we researched and  analyzed the department\u2019s legal authority to allocate substantial grant  funds to support the UPA initiative and to consider congestion pricing as a  selection factor for allocating individual grant funds to support UPAs, by  reviewing relevant statutes, case law, and department records, and by  obtaining the department\u2019s legal views. Finally, we reviewed documents  and interviewed department officials on their actions to monitor UPA  award conditions and plans to evaluate each urban partner\u2019s projects to  reduce congestion. Specifically, we reviewed urban partner term sheets  and grant or cooperative agreements that list the conditions to receive  federal funds. We conducted this performance audit from February 2008  through March 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. (See app. IV for  additional discussion of our scope and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In May 2006, the department announced its National Strategy to Reduce  Congestion on America\u2019s Transportation Network (the \u201ccongestion  initiative\u201d), a comprehensive national initiative to reduce congestion on  the nation\u2019s roads, rails, runways, and waterways. A major component of  this initiative is the UPA initiative, under which the department gives  selected cities special consideration for funding from existing programs.  To qualify for selection, a city had to develop and be ready to quickly  implement a comprehensive, integrated, and innovative approach to  reducing congestion through the use of the 4Ts.", "On December 8, 2006, the department issued a Federal Register notice  soliciting proposals by cities to enter into UPAs with the department.  According to the notice, the department planned to fund the agreements  through several existing grant programs and lending and credit support  programs. This cross-cutting approach was designed to enable the  department to fund the greatest improvements in mobility in a coordinated  manner across its modal operating administrations. The notice further  indicated that the department would support its urban partners with  regulatory flexibilities and dedicated expertise and personnel. Applicants  wishing to become urban partners had to submit their applications by  April 30, 2007. The notice stated that the department would consider  applications filed after this date to the extent practicable. In addition,  applicants had to apply to any underlying grant program from which they  sought funding. They could do so by submitting a single application that  covered each of the grant programs as long as the application was  responsive to the requirements of each program. To achieve this, the  department published several Federal Register notices between December  2006 and March 2007, requesting that UPA applicants apply to the  underlying programs.", "The Federal Register notice also set forth requirements for the UPA  application. Under the UPA initiative, the department and the urban  partner would agree to pursue the 4Ts to reduce traffic congestion. The  department sought projects with congestion pricing to help shift some  rush-hour traffic to off-peak times, coupled with new or expanded transit  services. In this way, buses could move more freely through previously  congested roadways and could provide more reliable service. To further  reduce congestion, the urban partner could use cutting-edge  technologies\u2014such as providing travelers with real-time transportation  information\u2014to improve transportation performance and secure  agreements from area employers to expand telecommuting programs. (See  fig. 1.) Finally, the department\u2019s solicitation stated that neither the  procedures nor the criteria identified in the notice would be binding on the  department.", "Aside from publishing the UPA initiative notice in the Federal Register, the  department took a number of steps intended to (1) generate interest in the  initiative, (2) encourage cities to develop fresh ideas, and (3) provide  information to potential applicants. First, before publishing the December  2006 Federal Register notice, department officials met separately with  officials from three urban areas\u2014Seattle; northern Virginia; and Portland,  Oregon\u2014and presented information on congestion pricing and UPAs.  Then, after publishing the notice, at the request of New York City,  department officials met with the New York state legislature; conducted  national workshops in Atlanta, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; and  Washington, D.C. that were open to any interested UPA applicant; made  presentations at transportation conferences; and held a Webinar for city  officials who could not attend the national workshops. In the workshops  and the Webinar, department officials discussed congestion pricing and  supporting strategies, political and public outreach techniques that might  be used to gain support for congestion-pricing initiatives, and potential  funding opportunities under UPA. According to the department, it  conducted a number of other outreach activities including (1) establishing  a Web page with information for such applicants, (2) giving speeches on  the UPA initiative, and (3) sending information on congestion pricing to e- mail listservs. In its Federal Register notice, the department stated that it  reserved the right to solicit, and was actively soliciting, by means other  than the notice certain cities the department had determined to be  candidates for UPA award consideration.", "The department received 26 UPA applications and created a multistep  review process to select PUPs (announced in June 2007) and then urban  partners (announced in August 2007). First, a review team, composed of  staff from several modal administrations, used several technical  criteria\u2014such as innovation, the comprehensiveness of the 4Ts, cost- effective use of federal dollars, and the feasibility and likelihood of  implementation\u2014to perform a technical review of the UPA applications  and rank them for the department\u2019s senior leaders. Second, the senior  leaders reviewed the review team\u2019s rankings in light of broader  department goals and recommended nine PUPs to the Secretary, which  according to department officials, the Secretary approved. The PUPs then  each presented their proposals, first to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary  and afterward to officials from the modal administrations involved in the  UPA initiative. Following these presentations, the department, in some  cases, asked for additional detail or clarification from the applicant. Third,  using this information, the review team created funding scenarios\u2014for  example, one scenario provided funding for New York City and four other  urban partners while another scenario did not provide funding for New  York City, but did do so for seven other urban partners. Finally, using UPA  applications and funding scenarios, the Secretary selected five urban  partners\u2014Miami, Minneapolis, New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle.  The Federal Register notice stated the department would select up to 10  urban partners.", "The urban partner designation did not include funds for the urban  partners, but did give them special consideration in obtaining department  resources such as funding from grant programs and administrative  flexibilities, including streamlined environmental reviews. Between  December 2006 and April 2007, the department issued several Federal  Register notices describing the amount of funding available to urban  partners. Initially, the Federal Register notice stated that up to $100  million, over 3 years, was available from 1 grant program, but this amount  was expanded to about $1 billion from 13 grant programs when the  President signed the 2007 Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution.  Unlike previous years, the department\u2019s appropriation was not subject to  congressional directives that funds be dedicated for particular  transportation projects. As a result, urban partners applied for and were  eventually awarded funds from 10 grant programs for 94 projects totaling  $848.1 million. (See table 1.) This report focuses on the 5 urban partners,  94 projects, and $848.1 million in awards announced in August 2007. As the  department negotiated with the prospective urban partners, the numbers  of urban partners, projects, and awards were reduced somewhat.", "The department awarded New York City $354.5 million (42 percent) of the  $848.1 million. San Francisco was awarded $158.7 million (19 percent),  Minneapolis $133.3 million (16 percent), Seattle $138.7 million (16  percent), and Miami $62.9 million (7 percent). In addition, although San  Diego was not selected as an urban partner, the department awarded it $15  million under the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Capital Investment  Grants (Bus and Bus Facilities) program and $3 million under the  Intelligent Transportation Systems-Operational Testing to Mitigate  Congestion (ITS-OTMC) program for a project element of its UPA  application. Departmental senior leaders and officials believed that San  Diego\u2019s project to demonstrate the safety and efficiency of cutting-edge  separation and braking technologies on narrow lanes was meritorious.", "Each urban partner proposed to implement a tolling project with  congestion pricing that would be supported by projects primarily from at  least two of the other three Ts\u2014transit and technology. (See table 2.)  According to department officials, telecommuting projects received less  emphasis from the urban partners and the department because it was  generally beyond the control of the city to influence many employers and  because they received telecommuting proposals in few applications.", "Each UPA was subject to several terms and conditions. One significant  condition was that no urban partner could expend federal funds until it  had obtained the legal authority necessary to implement congestion  pricing for the applicable highway or parking area. To date, three urban  partners have the necessary authority for congestion pricing\u2014Miami,  Minneapolis, and San Francisco\u2014and Seattle needs to obtain it by  September 2009. However, New York City failed to meet its April 2008  deadline for obtaining congestion pricing authority from the state  legislature. As a result, in accordance with the terms of the department\u2019s  UPA with New York City, the department cancelled New York City\u2019s  agreement and awarded about $364 million to Chicago and Los Angeles  through the department\u2019s Congestion Reduction Demonstration Program.", "As its name indicates, the Congestion Reduction Demonstration Program,  established in 2007, is a successor to the UPA initiative.  This program\u2019s  goals and selection criteria are similar to the UPA initiative\u2019s. For example,  the Federal Register notice solicited applications that would support  congestion-pricing, transit, and technology strategies to reduce  congestion. Like the UPA initiative, the Congestion Reduction  Demonstration Program allows the department to partner with applicants  to support congestion reduction using the department\u2019s discretionary  funds. In addition, in July 2008, the Secretary announced a new  administration plan to create a more sustainable way to pay for and build  roads and transit systems. This plan includes a proposal for creating a  Metropolitan Mobility Program. Among other things, this proposal  envisions financial support for innovative approaches to reduce traffic  congestion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Department Communicated Most Selection Information to Applicants, but Gave Two Applicants Assistance over Others", "paragraphs": ["The department clearly communicated 10 of the 11 criteria it used to select  urban partners, but it could have better communicated to applicants the  relative weights it would assign to the selection criteria and the amount of  funding available under the UPA initiative.

For example, an  Office of Management and Budget policy directive states that an agency\u2019s  funding announcements must clearly describe all criteria and if they vary  in importance, the relative priority, or weights, assigned to the criteria.  Similarly, the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s (FHWA) assistance  agreement procedures manual states that evaluation criteria must be  prepared before a funding announcement is published and should be  available to both applicants and reviewers. These procedures allow  applicants to make informed decisions when preparing their applications  and help ensure the selection process is as fair and equitable as possible.  Like the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidance, the FHWA manual  identifies good grants making practice but it does not strictly apply to the  UPA initiative, since four of the grant programs under the initiative were  not FHWA programs. The department does not have agency-wide guidance  that mirrors the Office of Management and Budget guidance.", "The UPA initiative was not funded like a traditional grant program, since  there was no UPA-specific funding. Instead, the department gave urban  partners special consideration when allocating funds from as many as 13  individual grant programs. However, we believe grant-making practices  such as those prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  guidance are relevant to the initiative because they can increase the  likelihood that the department will receive applications that best further  agency goals.", "The department used 11 criteria to select urban partners. (See fig. 2.) We  found that the department clearly communicated 10 of these to potential  applicants in the December 2006 Federal Register notice. For example,  this notice made it clear to applicants that the department wanted  applicants to incorporate the 4Ts and explained how the different parts of  the 4Ts strategy would interact to reduce congestion (synergy of 4Ts). This  notice also stated the department sought proposals that would affect the  most surface transportation travelers, include congestion pricing, be cost  effective, and demonstrate innovative technology applications. The notice  also made it clear the department sought proposals that were likely to be  implemented, and requested that applicants submit information on  political support for their proposal.", "The remaining criterion\u2014political boldness\u2014however, was not  communicated at all to applicants. As a result, the applicants we spoke  with had varying levels of awareness and understanding of this criterion.  Senior department officials considered the political boldness of a city\u2019s  projects when selecting urban partners. The department defined this  criterion as the level of boldness of the congestion-pricing component  relative to the level of political acceptance of congestion pricing in the  applicant\u2019s particular region. Senior department officials told us they  viewed projects that were politically bold positively, and took into  consideration that although a particular congestion-reduction strategy  might not be new nationally, it could be politically bold in the applicant\u2019s  region. This criterion was not stated in the Federal Register, on the  department\u2019s Web site, or in presentations. The department subsequently  told us that political boldness was the same as political and technical  feasibility. However, in our view, proposals can be politically feasible  without being bold and the department was looking for bold proposals.", "Nine of the 14 applicants we spoke with said they were not aware of this  selection criterion, while another 5 applicants told us they thought the  department implied it was seeking politically bold proposals.", "The department\u2019s March 2007 Federal Register notice indicated the  criteria could change.  It stated that neither the procedures nor the criteria  set out in the notice would be binding on the department. Our search for  language of this sort in Federal Register notices found that it is unique.  The department indicated it might have needed to change both the criteria  and the procedures to gain more participation in the initiative.", "The department\u2019s Federal Register notice announcing the selection  criteria for the UPA initiative also fell short of the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s policy guidance in that it did not communicate the relative  weights of the selection criteria, as the guidance directs. Department  officials and six of eight reviewers told us they viewed congestion pricing  measures as the most important criterion in selecting urban partners. The  department identified congestion pricing as the most important of the 4Ts  in a document posted on its Web site 4 weeks before applications were  due\u2014and about 16 weeks after the original Federal Register notice  appeared. Although some applicants we spoke with were aware of the  department\u2019s emphasis on congestion pricing in general, none knew the  relative weights of the selection criteria. Nine of the 14 applicants we  spoke with about the impact of the weighting information on their  applications said that having weighting information would have changed  their applications, while the remaining 5 said it would not. For example,  an official from San Diego noted that knowing the weights of the selection  criteria would have helped him to decide which projects to include and  exclude, and would have resulted in a more focused application.", "The department\u2019s incomplete communication to applicants of UPA  selection criteria and weights may have had little, if any, effect on the final  selection, since four of the five urban partners were rated high for  technical merit and the fifth one, while rated lower, was seen as innovative  because it would be the first in the country to convert high-occupancy  vehicle (HOV) lanes to high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes while  simultaneously increasing HOV eligibility from two to three occupants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Department Communicated Much of the Funding Availability as It Became Known", "paragraphs": ["Grant announcements should fully describe the funding opportunity to  give applicants a sense of the scope of the funding, and to assist them in  prioritizing and developing their proposed projects.

FHWA\u2019s procedures  manual reflects the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s directive to  include a description of the funding opportunity in the grant  announcement. Communicating the funding opportunity was important for  the UPA initiative, since the funding motivated cities to do the  comprehensive planning and serious consideration of congestion pricing  the department wanted cities to reflect in their applications.", "As stated previously, an awardee\u2019s selection as an urban partner meant the  department would give the awardee priority consideration when allocating  funding from as many as 13 individual grant programs. The original  December 2006 UPA initiative announcement indicated that up to $100  million was available to urban partners through the ITS-OTMC program.  (See fig. 3.) After more funds became available for the department\u2019s  discretionary use, the department decided sometime between February 15,  2007, and April 2007 to dedicate about $1 billion to the UPA initiative. As a  result, the department solicited applications for the 13 discretionary  programs through Federal Register notices over a period of 4 months  (December 2006 through March 2007).", "Although funding for UPA was available under 13 grant programs, the  department published the amount of funding available in the Federal  Register for 5 of these programs and distributed funding information for  12 at conferences and through its Web site. Between February 15, 2007,  and April 30, 2007 (the date when UPA applications were due), the  department communicated the amount of funding available for UPAs to  applicants in two ways: First, the department solicited applications for the  13 grant programs through Federal Register notices. (See table 3.) For 5 of  these grant programs, the department published the amount of funding  available in the notices. The amount available for UPAs through these 5  grant programs totaled $852 million and ultimately accounted for 77  percent of the funds awarded to urban partners. However, of this $852  million amount, $716 million (about 65 percent of the approximate $1.1  billion that was ultimately made available) was announced less than 6  weeks before the UPA application deadline. By the time this additional  funding was announced, applicants may have already substantially  completed their applications, and in some cases, obtained the approval of  their stakeholders. According to a department official, it took the  department several weeks to issue a Federal Register notice. For the  remaining 8 grant programs, the Federal Register notices contained no  information on the amount of funding available. A department official told  us he does not know why these Federal Register notices did not include  funding information.", "The department disagreed with our assessment that the applicants could  have benefited if funding information had been communicated more than  6 weeks before applications were due. The department indicated that it  typically provides 2 months for the submission of applications and cited  several grant programs in which this was the case. For example, the  department said 2 months was adequate time to file Bus and Bus Facilities  program applications. However, because of its complexity, the UPA  application could be expected to take longer to complete than applications  for more traditional grant programs, such as the Bus and Bus Facilities  program.", "Second, the department developed a funding handout that listed the  amounts available for UPAs through 12 of the 13 grant programs. These  amounts totaled almost $1.1 billion. The department updated this  document several times with new funding information and posted the  document on the department\u2019s Web site sometime between February 15,  2007, and April 2007. In addition, department officials handed out this  document at conferences.", "Applicants\u2019 understanding of the funding available under the UPA initiative  varied, and several applicants told us that if they had had more complete  funding information, they would have changed their applications. Of the 14  applicants we spoke with about funding, 6 told us they had the funding  handout, which included information on the availability of funding by  program (see table 3), while the other 8 said they did not have this  handout when they were developing their applications. Of the applicants  that did not have complete funding information, 6 told us they were aware  of the total funding available but not the amounts available for each  program, while 2 told us that they did not know the amount of funding  available under the initiative when they were applying to the program. Of  the 2 UPA applicants that said they did not know the amount of funding  available to the initiative, 1 applicant said it thought the total amount of  funding available was the $100 million initially identified under the ITS- OTMC program.

At this  time, department officials told us that, in some cases, they were also  contacting PUPs to have them submit new grant applications because  PUPs had submitted applications for more funding than was available  under some grant programs and because PUPs could submit applications  for the same uses under other, undersubscribed programs.", "However, in two cases, the department went beyond asking UPA  applicants to submit applications for the same projects under other  funding programs.

As a result, Miami  submitted a Bus and Bus Facilities application 4 weeks after the  application deadline and was awarded $19.5 million in these funds.

In the past, the department\u2019s discretion had been circumscribed  by congressional directives that earmarked most of its appropriations for  particular projects, but this changed for fiscal year 2007. The department\u2019s  fiscal year 2007 appropriation, enacted in the 2007 continuing resolution,  funded the department based on 2006 levels and authorities but removed  earmarks contained in the 2006 committee reports (the continuing  resolution stated that such earmarks shall have no legal effect). In  addition, the continuing resolution did not include congressional  directives that funds be dedicated or earmarked for particular projects and  stated that earmarks contained in 2006 committee reports shall have no  legal effect. The department interpreted this language as permitting it to  allocate its appropriations to various grant programs in order to fund its  UPA initiative.

The department then awarded grant funds under 10 of its grant  programs to the five urban partners. The impact of this sequential process  was to give congestion pricing priority as a selection factor not only for  the UPA initiative but for the individual grant programs as well.", "The specific terms of the authorizing statute for each grant determine  whether the department has the authority to give priority to congestion  pricing as a selection factor in making grant decisions.  According to  department officials, they considered congestion pricing as a priority or  priority consideration selection factor for only 9 of the 10 programs  (excluding the Alternative Analysis program). As a result our analysis  focused on the 9 remaining programs. We concluded that the authorizing  statutes for the 9 grant programs used to fund urban partners either  explicitly permit the consideration of congestion pricing or afford the  department discretion to consider congestion pricing as a factor because it  was rationally related to program objectives. (See table 4.) In particular, 2  of the 9 grant-authorizing statutes permit the Secretary to consider  congestion pricing as a selection factor by express mention: ITS-OTMC  and Value Pricing Pilot programs. The remaining 7 grant-authorizing  statutes (Bus and Bus Facilities; Ferry Boat Discretionary; Innovative  Bridge; Interstate Maintenance Discretionary; New Fixed Guideway  Facilities (specifically Very Small Starts); Public Lands Highway  Discretionary; and TCSP programs) grant the department discretion to use  congestion pricing as a priority consideration selection factor because  tolling has a rational connection to statutory objectives, such as mobility  and reduced congestion.", "Although we believe the department had authority to consider congestion  pricing as a selection factor, with respect to the Ferry Boat program, the  department\u2019s initial technical evaluation documentation suggested (albeit  incorrectly) that the department had exceeded its authority. This technical  evaluation documentation made it appear that the department had  overridden the statute by rejecting nonurban partners that lacked  congestion pricing but met one or more statutory priorities in favor of  urban partners that had congestion pricing but met no statutory priorities.  In making the final award decision, however the Secretary relied on  correct information showing the urban partners in fact met statutory  priorities. The Secretary therefore was within her discretion to apply  congestion pricing as a selection factor. Specifically:    Using congestion pricing as a priority selection factor, the department  awarded grants totaling $40.2 million under the Ferry Boat program to  New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle as urban partners. Under this  program, the department is authorized to award grants for the  construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities in accordance with  statutory eligibility criteria. The Ferry Boat grant statute lists three  permissible \u201cpriority\u201d selection factors for Ferry Boat program grants that  the department must apply. Priority is required for ferry systems that will  (1) provide critical access to areas not well served by other modes of  surface transportation, (2) carry the greatest number of passengers and  vehicles, or (3) carry the greatest number of passengers in passenger-only  service.", "Although the Ferry Boat statute does not explicitly identify congestion  pricing as a priority selection factor, the department believes it had  discretion to use congestion pricing to discriminate between grant  applicants. The department makes a connection between congestion  pricing and the second Ferry Boat statutory priority (carrying large  numbers of passengers and vehicles), which it believes reflects  congressional support for activities that increase mobility and reduce  congestion. We agree that the department had discretion to use congestion  pricing as a discriminating factor under the Ferry Boat statute, because  there is a rational connection between congestion pricing, mobility, and  congestion.", "The department could not, however, apply congestion pricing in a way that  would fail to comply with the statutory priority factors\u2014that is, it could  not reject nonurban partners that met statutory priorities simply because  they lacked congestion pricing in favor of urban partners that had  congestion pricing but did not meet statutory priorities. The department\u2019s  technical evaluation documentation incorrectly suggested that such a  situation occurred in the case of one grant, Seattle\u2019s High-Speed, Ultra- Low Wake Passenger-Only Ferry project. Although the department\u2019s  technical review team evaluator appeared to have determined that this  Seattle project failed to meet two statutory priority selection criteria\u2014 carrying large numbers of passengers and vehicles, and carrying a large  number of passengers in passenger-only service\u2014the department  nevertheless awarded the project $2 million based on Seattle\u2019s urban  partner designation, passing over nonurban partners the technical review  team had determined to have met one or more of the statutory priorities.  The technical review team evaluator apparently reached this conclusion  by incorrectly relying on the total number of passengers carried by  individual projects, not the total number of passengers carried by the ferry  system as a whole as required by statute. In fact, Seattle\u2019s ferry system  carries the greatest number of passengers of all ferry systems in the  country, and therefore was entitled to \u201cpriority.\u201d", "In addition, in one instance\u2014the TCSP program, under which the  department awarded $50.4 million in grants to urban partners\u2014we  concluded that although the department had discretion to use congestion  pricing as a discriminating priority factor, it likely did not apply statutory  \u201cpriority consideration\u201d factors correctly, in the way the statute requires.  However, \u201cpriority consideration\u201d entitles an applicant only to a bona fide  and careful review, not to guaranteed selection. Furthermore, based on  available information, it is not clear that the department\u2019s incorrect  evaluation approach affected the ultimate outcome of its selections. As a  result, we are not recommending that the department re-evaluate the more  than 500 grant applications it received for fiscal year 2007 for this  program. Specifically:    Using congestion pricing as a priority selection factor, the department  awarded three grants totaling $50.4 million under the TCSP program to  urban partner applicants\u2014Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Seattle. The  statute requires that the department give \u201cpriority consideration\u201d only to  applicants that meet five separate factors, none of which explicitly relates  to congestion pricing and all five of which must be satisfied. The statute  provides that priority consideration shall be given to applicants that (1)  have instituted preservation or development plans and programs; (2) have  instituted other policies to integrate TCSP practices; (3) have preservation  or development policies that include a mechanism for reducing potential  impacts of transportation activities on the environment; (4) demonstrate a  commitment to public and private involvement, including the involvement  of nontraditional partners in the project team; and (5) examine ways to  encourage private-sector investments.", "The department believes that the term \u201cpriority consideration\u201d does not  require the department to award grants to applicants that meet the above  criteria; instead, the department believes priority consideration entitles an  applicant only to precedential or careful deliberation or thought before  competing alternatives. We agree with the department that, unlike  \u201cpriority,\u201d \u201cpriority consideration\u201d does not guarantee an applicant  selection. However, the department\u2019s reading, as we understand it, is too  narrow. We believe \u201cpriority consideration\u201d entitles an applicant to special  attention and a careful and bona fide review, not just consideration earlier  in the evaluation process. Nonetheless, ultimately, the department had  discretion to grant awards to applicants that did not meet priority  consideration criteria, based on other factors, such as congestion pricing,  found to be rationally connected to statutory objectives.", "The remaining issue is whether, before the department applied congestion  pricing as a selection factor, it followed the statute and gave any  applicants qualifying for \u201cpriority consideration\u201d the bona fide review  Congress required. The answer is not clear. The statute lists five factors,  with the last two joined by the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d indicating all five factors  must be met in order for an applicant to receive priority consideration.  Department review team officials told us they rated grant applicants as  meeting statutory priority consideration criteria so long as just one factor  was met (essentially the reviewers treated the \u201cand\u201d in the statute as an  \u201cor\u201d). We disagree with the department\u2019s interpretation and believe the  \u201cand\u201d is used in its ordinary sense, requiring applicants to meet all five  factors. Once the department found that an applicant met one factor, it  terminated its evaluation. The effect of this error is unknown since, from  the current record, it is not possible to determine whether any applicant  met all five factors.", "Appendix V contains a complete analysis of these legal issues and our  conclusions about the department\u2019s compliance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Department Has a Framework to Ensure That Award Conditions Are Being Met and That Results Will Be Evaluated", "paragraphs": ["The department is tracking urban partners\u2019 progress in completing the  conditions of their awards, such as obtaining their authority to use  congestion pricing where needed.

Each term sheet describes the  congestion-reduction projects funded by the department, the amount of  funding to be obligated, and the responsibilities of the parties. A  department official told us that although not legally binding, the term  sheets formalize both the department\u2019s and the urban partners\u2019  understanding of project requirements and deadlines, and provide the  department with a mechanism to track urban partners\u2019 progress in meeting  the award conditions.", "Funding agreements. Each urban partner has proposed to implement  several projects to reduce congestion. These projects are tied to funding  agreements that establish the amounts of funding to be provided by the  department, the grant programs that serve as the sources of funding, and  the conditions that must be met to ensure obligation of federal funds. The  content of these funding agreements varies and is dependent on statutory  and contractual requirements associated with each funding source.", "Implementation matrix. The UPA initiative management team has  created an implementation matrix spreadsheet to track and update  progress in meeting requirements from the UPA term sheets and funding  agreements. For example, each urban partner\u2019s implementation matrix  spreadsheet tracks the following conditions contained in urban partner  funding agreements: (1) the completion of preconditions for obligating  federal funds, (2) UPA project funding sources, and (3) the dates federal  funds were (or were expected to be) obligated.

These items will be tracked by the UPA initiative management team.

In addition, the department has established a framework to ensure that  states will work together and that Corridor projects will come to fruition  and produce transportation benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In September 2006, the department issued a Federal Register notice  soliciting applications for Corridors, which is a major component of its  congestion-reduction initiative. This program is to accelerate the  development of multistate transportation corridors, for one or more  transportation modes, in need of investment to reduce congestion. The  department also encouraged participation by sending an e-mail to  transportation groups and by citing the program\u2019s benefits in speeches.  According to department officials, another purpose of the demonstration  program is to encourage states to work together, rather than acting  separately, to reduce congestion along major transportation corridors.", "The department solicited applications for Corridors in two phases. For  phase one, the department asked for proposals containing general  information about the proposed corridor, such as its location, purpose,  preliminary design features, and estimated capital costs. The department  received 38 proposals and established a review team comprising  representatives from the department\u2019s surface transportation  administrations, with expertise in finance, environment and planning, and  infrastructure. In accordance with the review team\u2019s recommendations,  the department announced it had selected eight potential corridors to  submit applications for phase two. The phase two applications were more  detailed than the phase one proposals and supplied information on the  corridor\u2019s physical description, congestion-reduction goals, mobility  improvements, economic benefits and support of commerce, value to  users, innovations in project delivery and finance, environmental  stewardship, finance plan, and proposed project timeline. Several state  officials told us that the process of completing proposals or applications  for Corridors fostered cooperation between states and began discussions  about multistate efforts to reduce congestion that would not have  happened otherwise.", "On September 14, 2007, relying on the recommendations of the review  team, the department announced its selection of six corridors: Interstate  95, Interstate 15, Interstate 5, Interstate 10, Interstate 70, and Interstate 69.  (See fig. 4.)", "Designation as a corridor did not include an award of funds, but did give  individual corridors priority access to department resources such as  funding from grant programs and administrative flexibilities, such as  environmental streamlining. Each corridor proposed a series of  improvement projects that collectively totaled about $106 billion and  individually ranged in cost from about $8.5 million to $63 billion. However,  because of funding limitations, the department strategically chose where  to best utilize funds and only selected one or two projects per corridor.  For example, Interstate 10 proposed about $6.7 billion in high-priority  projects in several areas: security, incident management, traveler  information systems, traffic management, multiagency coordination, and  capital projects. Following Interstate 10\u2019s designation as a corridor, the  department provided $8.6 million in funding for two projects within this  corridor. (See table 7.) In all, the department provided $66.2 million in  funding from five grant programs for 10 projects in the six corridors.", "The department is developing agreements for how the states along each  corridor will work together to develop their corridor. As of February 2009,  the department finalized agreements for three corridors. According to a  department official, the department is working to finalize the remaining  three agreements by the end of December 2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Department Selected Awardees for Corridors by Following Its Published Criteria", "paragraphs": ["Beyond the general information requested for phase I proposals, the  September 2006 Federal Register notice provided nine criteria for  reviewing phase two applications.

The September 2006 Federal Register  notice did not state a specific amount of funding available to corridors  through grant programs. However, the Federal Register notice did state  that (1) if a corridor was selected for participation in the Corridors  program, the department would work with the corridor to identify possible  funding sources and (2) the department would select up to five corridors  (although six were ultimately selected). The Federal Register notices  soliciting Corridors proposals and applications were issued before  February 15, 2007, when the President signed the department\u2019s fiscal year  2007 appropriation without any congressional directives that funds be  dedicated for particular projects. Therefore, department officials told us  that, at the time Corridors proposals and applications were solicited, the  department did not know to what extent funds would be available for  allocation to Corridors projects.", "Department officials told us that in April 2007, the department sent out an  e-mail to phase two applicants stating that $329 million, from eight Federal  Highway Administration (FHWA) grant programs, was available to  applicants that met the grant programs\u2019 respective statutory criteria and  emphasized the proposed projects\u2019 highway safety and congestion- reduction benefits. However, it was not clear in this document what  portion of the $329 million would be dedicated to Corridors. According to  the department, the level of funding that would be allocated to Corridors  was unknown at this time. In July 2007, the department set aside $66.2  million for Corridor designees and funded 10 projects. This sum  represented the amount remaining after funds were set aside for  congressionally directed activities, urban partnership agreements (UPA),  and other grant programs. Department officials told us that after  identifying the six corridors, they called each corridor to solicit projects  that could be funded.", "For 9 of the 10 funded Corridors projects, we found corresponding  projects listed in the respective Corridors applications. However, the  Corridors application for Interstate 10 did not include an Arizona project  to widen a section of this highway. Officials from the Florida and Texas  Departments of Transportation who served as the points of contact for the  Interstate 10 Corridors project told us they did not receive telephone calls  from the department soliciting projects for funding in the Interstate 10  corridor. Rather, these officials told us that Arizona received Corridors  funding for a project that was not listed in the Interstate 10 Corridors  application and therefore was not a priority for the corridor. According to  the department, it was not necessary for a project to be listed in a  Corridors application for the project to be funded. Instead, the department  said, it gave priority consideration in its funding decisions to parties  designated as corridors.

For example, in December 2007, under the  Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, the department  allocated $589 million for Virginia\u2019s Capital Beltway high-occupancy toll  lanes project, which will use congestion pricing to ensure reliable traffic  flow on one of the nation\u2019s most congested highways. In addition, in  March 2008, the department allocated $430 million for segments of Texas  state highway 130, which will form part of a new 91-mile tollway intended  to relieve congestion on Interstate 35.

For example, the  department allocated $980 million for private activity bonds to a group of  private companies that are planning to build a tunnel connecting the Port  of Miami on Dodge Island with Watson Island and Interstate 95 on the  Florida mainland. However, according to a department official, not all of  the $9.2 billion allocated in private activity bonds has been issued. In  addition, according to this official, the department is currently reviewing  applications for additional private activity bond allocations to other  public-private partnerships.", "Finally, the department plans to study projects that use methods of  procurement that integrate risk and streamline project development.  SAFETEA-LU established the Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program,  known as Penta-P, to evaluate the benefits of forming public-private  partnerships for new construction projects. In 2007, the department  executed agreements for three pilot projects: the first is a single contract  for the construction of two light rail lines in Houston, Texas, that will  ultimately serve the city\u2019s two main airports; the second is a contract in  Denver, Colorado, for two rail projects that will serve the Denver airport  and northwest Denver; and the third is a contract in Oakland, California,  for a transit system that will connect the Oakland International Airport  with the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District\u2019s Coliseum Station.  According to a department official, construction on the projects has not  begun. Denver is contemplating an innovative contract that increases risk  sharing between the private partner and the local, state, and federal  governments. In this agreement, the Denver Regional Transportation  District will ask its private partner to assume a degree of risk by  contributing equity capital to the project. This capital will be at risk until  the project is operating and collecting revenue. In addition, the  Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas, is contemplating  an innovative contract under which a \u201cfacility provider\u201d will share risk  with the vehicle provider, construction firm, and operator. Also, the  project\u2019s development will be streamlined, since the private partner will  coordinate all work with the contractor, vehicle provider, and operator. As  these projects proceed, the department will study how public-private  partnerships affect completion times, projections of project costs and  benefits, and project performance.

In  August 2007, the department awarded funds to five urban partners that  would make congestion pricing a key component of congestion mitigation.  Such a strategy could act to promote highway public-private partnerships,  since tolls provide a long-term revenue stream, key to attracting investors.

Each of the  grant statutes underlying these 9 programs either explicitly permitted  consideration of tolling or afforded the department discretion to consider  tolling because it was rationally related to program objectives. For 8 of  these 9 grant programs, it is clear that the department then applied  congestion pricing in this way, although in the Ferry Boat program, the  department\u2019s technical evaluation documentation initially suggested the  department had improperly supplanted statutory priorities with tolling by  allegedly awarding a $2 million grant to an urban partner that did not meet  any statutory priority criteria (but had congestion pricing) while passing  over a number of nonurban partners that met at least one priority criterion  (but lacked congestion pricing). The technical evaluation was incorrect,  however, and was not relied on by the Secretary in making the final grant  decision.

The department reviewers considered whether  applicants met priority consideration and other factors. Final selections  were made applying congestion pricing as a discriminating factor.", "In our view, the fact that Congress changed \u201cpriority\u201d to \u201cpriority  consideration\u201d means the department was not bound to select applicants  that met the \u201cpriority consideration\u201d factors. Because Congress retained  the phrase in the selection \u201ccriteria\u201d provision, we also believe it relates to  more than simply the timing of an applicant\u2019s consideration. Congress  singled out a class of candidates and mandated that the department give  them special attention and a careful and bona fide review. Ultimately,  however, the department had discretion to select applicants that were not  in the \u201cpriority consideration\u201d class, or to select among multiple applicants  that were all in the class, based on other factors rationally connected to  the objectives of the statute. Congestion pricing was a factor rationally  related to the TCSP statute, in the department\u2019s judgment, because the  stated purpose of the statute is to support development and  implementation of strategies to integrate transportation and community  plans for addressing, among other things, improving the efficiency of the  nation\u2019s transportation system\u2014which congestion pricing would help to  achieve. October 2008 DOT Letter at 10-11; see Pub. L. No. 109-59, \u00a7  1117(b)(1). We agree that the department could use congestion pricing as  a discriminating factor in selecting among otherwise qualified applicants.", "The remaining issue is whether, before the department applied congestion  pricing as a discriminating factor, it followed the statute and gave  applicants that qualified for priority consideration (if any) the bona fide  \u201chard look\u201d that Congress required. The answer to this is not  straightforward. Department officials told us they treated applications as  qualifying for priority consideration if a candidate met just one of the five  statutory criteria, and looked no further. As discussed below, we believe  the better view is that the statute requires all five to be met. Because of the  department\u2019s one-factor approach, however, it is not possible to determine  from the current record whether any of the applicants met all five factors.  Even if no urban partner had satisfied all five criteria but some other  applicants had done so, the outcome might not have changed. Because the  department had discretion, once it gave bona fide consideration to priority  consideration applicants, to make selections based on congestion pricing,  its announced key factor, it could well be that the same urban partners  would have been selected. It is also possible that having taken a hard look  at \u201ctrue\u201d priority consideration candidates, the department would have  selected applicants that were not urban partners instead. Given that the  department had ultimate discretion to select nonpriority-consideration  applicants, and that all TCSP grant funding has been obligated, we do not  recommend re-evaluating the more than 500 project applications and  possibly reawarding the fiscal year 2007 TCSP grants. Instead, the  department should ensure that all future TCSP discretionary grant awards  are carried out in accordance with the statute, that is, by giving priority  consideration only to applicants that meet all five of the factors, for the  reasons we now address.", "Literally read, the statute requires that an applicant satisfy all five factors  in order to qualify for priority consideration. The statute lists five factors,  with the last two joined by the word \u201cand.\u201d The usual meaning of the  word \u201cand\u201d is conjunctive\u2014\u201dand\u201d means \u201cand\u201d\u2014unless the context  dictates otherwise. The presumption is that \u201cand\u201d is used in its ordinary  sense. See, e.g., Reese Brothers v. United States, 447 F.3d 229 (3d Cir.  2006); Zorich v. Long Beach Fire Dep\u2019t and Ambulance Serv., 118 F.3d  682, 684 (9th Cir. 1997). Overall, we believe the TCSP program\u2019s context  does not dictate otherwise. Several of the five factors have subparts,  providing different ways in which an applicant can satisfy that factor, and  these are separated by the word \u201cor\u201d rather than \u201cand.\u201d This shows that  when Congress intended to provide alternatives, it did so. On the other  hand, the five factors appear to overlap to some extent, for example in  referring to environmental protection, arguably indicating that just one  factor must be met. At least initially, however, environmental protection  was one of the key aims of the TCSP program, and thus requiring that it  be addressed in more than one area may be warranted. In addition, the  second factor refers to applicants that \u201cave other policies to integrate  transportation, community, and system preservation practices,\u201d arguably  indicating this was intended as an alternative. In context, however, we  read this as simply a way to describe one in a list of five factors requiring  an applicant to have different types of plans, policies, and programs, to be  expected in a grant program focusing on planning rather than on  construction.", "The department states that because the five criteria are \u201cstated in a wide- sweeping manner\u201d and because of the \u201cbroad context of the entire TCSP  statute\u201d \u201cwith its inclusive purposes, wide eligibility requirements, and  extensive criteria for priority consideration . . . it was logical to conclude  that the applicants did not have to meet all five of the criteria . . ..\u201d October  2008 DOT Letter at 12-13. We believe these factors show the opposite.  Given the extraordinary breadth of the eligibility requirements, it is logical  that Congress would provide criteria for narrowing the pool, by specifying  which applicants deserve special consideration. Only having to meet one  of the criteria would undercut the very concept of \u201cpriority,\u201d because  virtually all applicants could satisfy one of these broad requirements.", "The provision\u2019s legislative history also supports the interpretation that all  factors must be met. As noted, when Congress made the TCSP program  permanent in 2005, it amended what were then two \u201cpriority\u201d criteria  provisions (one for planning grants, another for implementation grants). It  combined them into a single provision and changed the requirement from  the department having to give \u201cpriority\u201d to having to give only \u201cpriority  consideration.\u201d At the same time, Congress amended the \u201cpurposes\u201d  provision from a list of five purposes joined by the word \u201cand\u201d to a list of  roughly the same five purposes introduced by the term \u201cone or more of the  following.\u201d See Pub. L. No. 105-178, sec. 1221(c)(2) (1998 statute), Pub. L.  No. 109-59, sec. 1117(b) (2005 statute). Despite all of these changes,  Congress retained the \u201cand\u201d in the list of priority consideration factors.", "This suggests that \u201cand\u201d was intentional, not a drafting oversight. The fact  that Congress was amending the statute to require only priority  consideration rather than priority also supports this reading\u2014once the  department had this additional selection discretion, it would make the  provision be virtually meaningless if only one of the five factors had to be  met.", "The overall purpose of the program and the department\u2019s historic  descriptions of it also support the reading that all five factors must be met.  The TCSP program was established as a counterpoint to traditional  transportation grant programs that focus on new construction as a way to  improve mobility, without necessarily considering the effect on  surrounding communities and the environment. The TCSP program was  intended to encourage communities to think more strategically and to  integrate their transportation planning with community and regional  economic planning. As the department has noted on many occasions, the  TCSP program is intended to address the relationships among  transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices\u2014 the so-called land use/transportation link\u2014and to encourage the \u201cuse   transportation to build livable communities.\u201d Giving priority to applicants  that meet all five factors supports this purpose by rewarding those that  integrate the greatest number of activities. The department itself has  recognized this focus on integration in numerous descriptions of the TCSP  program, literally underlining the \u201cand\u201d between the final two priority  factors and emphasizing that it will give priority to applicants that meet all  five program purposes (which roughly mirrored the priority factors).", "Finally, the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d should be interpreted as a disjunctive \u201cor\u201d  only to avoid an incoherent reading of the statute or a reading that leads to  an irrational result. Sosa v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., 348 F.3d  979, 983 (11th Cir. 2003); OfficeMax v. United States, 428 F.3d 583, 589  (6th Cir. 2005). Reading these factors as conjunctive would not lead to  such a result, however, because an applicant can meet all five factors. The  department demonstrated this in recent discussions by outlining how it  believes the TCSP projects funded for Seattle, Minneapolis, and San  Francisco could have met all of the five factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Value Pricing Pilot Program", "paragraphs": ["Using congestion pricing as a priority selection factor, the department  awarded grants totaling $20 million under the Value Pricing Pilot program  to urban partners Minneapolis, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle.

The department states that it looked to the above New Starts  selection criteria for guidance in exercising this discretion, October 2008  DOT Letter at 5, and in the department\u2019s judgment, congestion-pricing  measures meet several of the New Starts selection factors. Congestion  pricing reduces congestion by creating a price incentive for motorists to  keep off the roads in the most congested times of day and to use public  transit alternatives. Less congestion, in turn, improves mobility, reduces  environmental pollution, and reduces fuel consumption.

In our view, an even stronger  nexus is that congestion pricing would help achieve some of the policies  of the national transportation system reflected in the federal aid highway  program: \u201c(i) national and interregional personal mobility (including  personal mobility in rural and urban areas) and reduced congestion;   (ii) flow of interstate . . . commerce and freight transportation . . ..\u201d Id. \u00a7  101(b)(3)(C)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interstate Maintenance Discretionary Program", "paragraphs": ["Using congestion pricing as a priority selection factor, the department  awarded grants totaling $50 million under the Interstate Maintenance  Discretionary grant program to urban partners Miami and Minneapolis.
