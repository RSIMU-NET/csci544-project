MCS is intended to enable the command staff to collect, store, process, display, and disseminate critical data to produce and communicate battle plans, orders, and enemy and friendly situational reports. It is a key component of the Army Tactical Command and Control System, which is also intended to enhance the coordination and control of combat forces through automated management of five key battlefield areas, including maneuver control. Given its role to communicate battle plans, orders, and enemy and friendly situation reports, MCS is also a key component of the Army\u2019s ongoing efforts to digitize (automate) its battlefield operations.", "In 1980, the Army fielded the first MCS system\u2014with limited command, control, and communications capabilities\u2014to VII Corps in Europe. In 1982, the Army awarded a 5-year contract to continue MCS development, and by 1986 MCS software had evolved to version 9, also fielded in Europe. In 1987, the Army performed post-deployment tests on version 9 in Germany. The results of those tests led the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity to conclude that MCS did not exhibit adequate readiness for field use and recommend that further fielding not occur until the system\u2019s problems were resolved. However, the Army awarded a second 5-year contract that resulted in version 10, which was fielded by April 1989 and remains in the field today. In November 1989, the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity reported that MCS had met only 30 percent of its required operational capabilities and again recommended that the system not be released for field use. In May 1990, operational testers again questioned the system\u2019s functional ability and effectiveness because it could not produce timely, accurate, and useful information in a battle environment.", "While earlier versions of MCS were being fielded and withdrawn, the development of software continued. In 1988, the Army awarded a contract for the development of version 11. By February 1993, the Army stopped development of version 11 software due to multiple program slips, serious design flaws, and cost growth concerns. The program was then reorganized with a plan approved by the Office of the Secretary of Defense in April 1993. Under the reorganized program, a group of contractors and government software experts have been working to develop the next version of MCS software\u2014version 12.01\u2014utilizing software segments that could be salvaged from the failed version 11 effort.", "In addition to software, the MCS system consists of computers procured under the Army\u2019s Common Hardware and Software (CHS) effort, which was undertaken to reverse the proliferation of program-unique computers and software. The Army planned to acquire 288 of the CHS computers in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 to support the MCS training base, and has already acquired 81. Those computers were used in a training base assessment to support a decision to acquire the remaining 207 computers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development Problems Continue", "paragraphs": ["Since its reorganization in 1993, MCS program experience indicates continuing problems in the system\u2019s development.

Program officials stated that the test date slipped initially because the CHS computers to be used were not yet available.", "During August and September 1996, version 12.01 underwent a system confidence demonstration to determine whether it was ready for the November 1996 initial operational test and evaluation. Because the software was not ready, further work and two additional system confidence demonstrations followed in August and September 1996. Both demonstrations indicated that the system was not ready for operational testing. Additionally, the software still had an open priority one software deficiency and priority three and four deficiencies that would have negatively impacted the conduct of the operational test.", "Both the Army\u2019s Operational Test and Evaluation Command and the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) had stated that there could be no open priority one or two software deficiencies before the operational test. They had also stated that there could not be any open priority three and four deficiencies that, in combination, were likely to have a detrimental effect on the system\u2019s performance. DOT&E staff told us that there were a number of open priority three and four software deficiencies that they believe would have had a detrimental effect. When MCS program officials realized that these deficiencies would not be resolved in time for the initial operational test, they downgraded the test 3 weeks before it was to occur to a limited user test, utilizing $8.5 million appropriated for the MCS operational test in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. That test was conducted in November 1996.

The results of those tests identified continuing problems as the number of builds proceeded. For example, a December 1995 performance test report on build 3.0 stated that, if the problems found during the test were not quickly corrected in build 3.1, then the risk to the program might be unmanageable. The follow-on April 1996 performance test report of build 3.1 stated that significant problems in system stability prevented proper testing of several requirements. The report further stated that messaging between battlefield functional areas was extremely difficult and problematic and that the system had other stability problems.", "A September 1996 performance test report stated that of 568 previously open deficiency reports from builds 5.1 through 5.2c, 165, almost 29 percent, still remained open. This report, the last published on an MCS performance test, reflected the state of the MCS software shortly before the downgraded limited user test, in which MCS failed to demonstrate either operational effectiveness or suitability. More recent performance tests of later builds have been done; however, separate reports on those test events have not been issued.

As a result, an operational assessment\u2014called the MCS customer test\u2014was conducted on version 12.01 in April 1996 to support the award of a $63.1 million contract for the development of MCS Block IV software\u2014MCS versions 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3.", "No pass/fail criteria were set for the customer test. However, DOT&E directed that four operational issues be tested. Those issues related to (1) the capacity of the system to store and process required types and amounts of data, including the ability of the staff users to frequently update the information database; (2) the capabilities of the MCS network to process and distribute current and accurate data using the existing communications systems; (3) the impact of computer server outages on continuity of operations; and (4) the system administration and control capabilities to initialize the system, become fully operational, and sustain operations.", "In its report on the customer test, the Army\u2019s Test and Experimentation Command stated that, at the time of the test, MCS was evolving from a prototype system to one ready for initial operational test and evaluation and, as such, possessed known limitations that were described to the system users during training. The Command reported that the test\u2019s major limitations included (1) software that did not contain the full functional capability planned for the initial operational test and evaluation; (2) a need to reboot the system after crashes caused by the use of the computer\u2019s alternate function key; (3) two changes in software versions during training; and (4) the fact that 65 percent of the system manager functions had not been implemented or trained. Table 1 provides more detail on the customer test results.", "In addition to these findings, the MCS test officer stated the following: \u201cSystem performance degraded over time causing message backlogs, loss of data, and numerous system reboots. Over a period of 12 operational hours the  slowed down and created message backlogs of up to 4 hours. To remain functional, the entire network of [MCS] systems must be shut down and reinitialized in proper sequence.\u201d \u201cThe staff users had great difficulty using ...  applications.\u201d \u201cThe software pertaining to system management functions was immature, incomplete and lacked documentation. This capability is critical to the effective use and operation of the [MCS] system.\u201d", "Even though the customer test did not involve pass/fail criteria, based on our review of the test report and the test officer\u2019s comments, we believe that only the third operational issue\u2014impact of computer server outages on continuity of operations\u2014was met. Despite the results of the customer test and the program\u2019s prior history, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology approved the Army\u2019s plan to award a concurrent contract for MCS Block IV software development\u2014MCS versions 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3.", "In September 1996, the Army awarded a contract for the development of MCS software versions 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3 to a different contractor than the developers of MCS version 12.01. At that time, version 12.01 was still scheduled to undergo its initial operational testing in November 1996. The start of the follow-on development could have been timed to occur after version 12.01 had completed that operational testing. At most, this action would have delayed the contract award 2 months, assuming that the initial operational test had occurred in November 1996 as scheduled. However, the contract was awarded before the initial operational test, and the planned 5 month concurrency in the development of versions 12.01 and 12.1 became 18 months when the operational test slipped to March 1998.", "The current program schedule indicates that (1) version 12.1 is expected to undergo its operational assessment/test about 1 year after the fielding of version 12.01 is started and (2) version 12.1 fielding is to be done 5 months after initial operational capability of version 12.01 is achieved. If the scheduled version 12.01 operational test and evaluation slips again and the version 12.1 contractor is able to maintain its development schedule, version 12.1 could become available before version 12.01."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army Requested Flexibility for Operational Testing of Follow-on Software", "paragraphs": ["By May 1997, the Army requested DOD approval of a revised acquisition program baseline that changes the planned follow-on operational test and evaluation of versions 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3 to operational assessments/operational tests. Program officials said that, although the name of the tests had changed, the planned scope of the tests had not. However, the officials said that the name change complies with guidance from DOT&E, which lists multiple levels of operational test and evaluation (from an abbreviated assessment to full operational test) and outlines a risk assessment methodology to be used to determine the level of testing to be performed. The officials further stated that the use of the generic term operational test/operational assessment permits possible changes to the level of testing for version 12.1 and follow-on software increments based on the risk assessment process.", "The contractors competing for the MCS Block IV (MCS versions 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3) development were given access to the government\u2019s 12.01 code and allowed to reuse as much of it as they chose. The Block IV developer is not required to reuse any of version 12.01. Rather, the Block IV contract requires the development of software to provide specific functions. Given that (1) version 12.01 software has not passed or even undergone an initial operational test and evaluation and (2) the MCS Block IV contractor building version 12.1 is not the contractor that is building version 12.01 and is only required to develop the version 12.1 to provide specified functions, we believe that the version 12.1 development effort should not be viewed as building upon a proven baseline. Instead, it should be viewed as a new effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continuation of Current Development Strategy Could Be Costly", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s current development plan for version 12.1 and beyond, as shown in figure 1, continues an approach of building a follow-on version of software on an incomplete and unstable baseline\u2014the uncompleted preceding version of software.", "Additionally, according to an official in the DOD\u2019s Office of the Director of Test, Systems Engineering, and Evaluation, the Army\u2019s development process allows requirements that are planned for one software version, which cannot be accomplished in that version\u2019s development as planned, to be deferred to a later version\u2019s development. As a result, this process makes judging program risk and total cost very difficult.", "The MCS program has previously demonstrated the problem of deferring requirements. For example, during MCS version 11 development, we reported that the Army had deferred seven MCS functions that were to have been developed by June 1992 and included in the software version to undergo operational testing. Even though the version 11 operational test had slipped twice, from May 1992 to September 1992 and then to May 1993, the Army continued to defer those functions, and the operational test was planned for less than the complete software package originally scheduled to be tested.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD said that they had made progress not reflected in that draft. Specifically, they noted that there were no priority one or two, and only 22 priority three software deficiencies open as of September 11, 1997, as compared with 10 priority one, 47 priority two, and 67 priority three deficiencies open on August 16, 1996. While we agree these results indicate that some known problems have been fixed, they provide no indication of the number or severity of still unknown problems. For example, MCS version 12.01 development showed enough progress entering the November 1996 scheduled initial operational test and evaluation to reach a commitment of resources and personnel. However, that test was later downgraded to a limited user test because of software immaturity. Successful completion of an initial operational test and evaluation should provide a more definitive indication of the MCS program\u2019s progress."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Buying Training Base Computers Before Operational Testing Is Questionable", "paragraphs": ["Before the slip of the MCS initial operational test and evaluation from November 1996 to March 1998, the Army planned to acquire 288 computers\u2014150 in fiscal year 1997 and 138 in fiscal year 1998\u2014for the MCS training base. These computers were to be acquired after a full-rate production decision at a total cost of about $34.8 million\u2014$19.1 million in fiscal year 1997 and $15.7 million in fiscal year 1998.", "After the initial operational test and evaluation slipped, DOD approved the Army\u2019s acquisition of a low-rate initial production of 81 computers in fiscal year 1997 for a training base operational assessment. The purpose of the assessment, which was performed from February to May 1997, was to judge the merits of allowing the Army to procure the remaining computers prior to successful completion of the slipped operational test. On the basis of the results of that assessment, the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology authorized the Army in July 1997 to proceed with its acquisition plans. The Acting Under Secretary noted that the DOT&E had reviewed the assessment and agreed that version 12.01 was adequate for use in the training base.", "The Acting Under Secretary also authorized the Army to move the training base computer funds from the MCS budget to the Army\u2019s automated data processing equipment program budget line. This action was necessary because, according to both Army and DOD officials, it was determined that the computers to be acquired do not meet the legislated reasons in 10 U.S.C. 2400 for low-rate initial production. That legislation allows the early acquisition of systems to (1) establish an initial production base, (2) permit an orderly increase in the production rate for the system that is sufficient to lead to full-rate production upon successful completion of operational test and evaluation, and (3) provide production-representative items for operational test and evaluation. Even though the Army now plans to acquire the computers under a different budget line, the intended use of the computers remains unchanged.", "MCS program officials said that the computers are needed in the MCS training base before operational testing to adequately support future fielding of MCS and the larger Army Battle Command System, of which the Army Tactical Command and Control System and MCS are key components. This rationale is the same one the Acting Under Secretary cited in his July 1997 memorandum. In that memorandum, he stated that the \u201crequirement to train Army-wide on commercial equipment is a recognized requirement not only for MCS but for a host of other digital . . . systems.\u201d The Acting Under Secretary further noted that the funds to be moved were for equipment needed to support integrated training of multiple systems throughout the Army and concluded that \u201ctraining on a digital system, even if it is not the system that is ultimately fielded, is important to the Army in order to assist in making the cultural change from current maneuver control practice to a digitized approach.\u201d", "MCS program officials stated that the MCS course curriculum needs to be developed and that equipping the training base before the completion of operational testing avoids a 2-year lag between the completion of operational testing and the graduation of trained students. The officials also commented that the computers could be used elsewhere, since they would be compatible with other Army programs.", "The legislated requirement that major systems, such as MCS, undergo initial operational test and evaluation before full-rate production serves to limit or avoid premature acquisitions. The Army has had previous experience acquiring ineffective MCS equipment, which is indicative of the need for adequate testing before systems are fielded. In July 1990, the Army began withdrawing over $100 million of militarized MCS hardware from the field due to both hardware and software deficiencies. Additionally, the Army subsequently decided not to deploy other MCS equipment it had procured for light divisions at a cost of about $29 million because the equipment was too bulky and heavy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["The MCS program\u2019s troubled development and acquisition history has continued since the program\u2019s 1993 reorganization. However, the Army awarded a new contract to develop future software versions and plans to procure computers without fully resolving the problems of earlier versions. This strategy does not minimize the possibility of future development problems and ensure that the Army will ultimately field a capable system. Also, since MCS software version 12.1 is being developed concurrently by a different contractor to functional specifications, it would be prudent to subject the version 12.1 software to the level of operational testing required to support a full-rate production decision, as planned for version 12.01. Accordingly, we believe a more appropriate strategy would require that future software versions be developed using only fully tested baselines, and that each version be judged against specific pre-established criteria.", "We recommend that you direct the Secretary of the Army to set specific required capabilities for each software version beyond version 12.01, test those versions against specific pass/fail criteria for those capabilities, and only award further development contracts once problems highlighted in that testing are resolved; perform a full operational test and evaluation of MCS software version 12.1 to ensure that it provides the full capabilities of version 12.01; and procure additional MCS computers only after an initial operational test and evaluation and a full-rate production decision have been completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD agreed with our recommendation that specific required capabilities for each MCS software version beyond version 12.01 are needed, that those versions should be tested against specific pass/fail criteria for those capabilities, and that the Army should not award further development contracts until problems highlighted in prior tests are resolved. DOD noted that the Army has already set specific required capabilities for those software versions and will test those versions against specific pass/fail criteria to ensure system maturity and determine that the system remains operationally effective and suitable. DOD further stated that it will not support the award of further development contracts until the Army has successfully resolved any problems identified during the testing of related, preceding versions.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation that the Army be directed to perform a full-operational test and evaluation of MCS software version 12.1 to ensure that it provides the full capabilities of version 12.01.
