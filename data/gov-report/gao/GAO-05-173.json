We reviewed the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) approach to improving its federal-aid highway project oversight efforts since we last reported on it in 2002, including (1) FHWA's oversight-related goals and performance measures, (2) FHWA's oversight improvement activities, (3) challenges FHWA faces in improving project oversight, and (4) best practices for project oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FHWA has made progress in improving its oversight efforts since 2002, but it lacks a comprehensive approach, including goals and measures that guide its activities; workforce plans that support these goals and measures; and data collection and analysis efforts that help identify problems and transfer lessons learned. FHWA's 2004 performance plan established, for the first time, performance goals and outcome measures to limit cost growth and schedule slippage on projects, but these goals and measures have not been effectively implemented because FHWA has not linked its day-to-day activities or the expectations set for its staff to them, nor is FHWA fully using them to identify problems and target its oversight. FHWA undertook activities in response to concerns raised about the adequacy of its oversight efforts that have both promising elements and limitations. For example, while FHWA now assigns a project oversight manager to each major project (generally projects costing $1 billion or more) and identified skills these managers should possess, it has not yet defined the role of these managers or established agencywide performance expectations for them. While FHWA issued guidance to improve cost estimating and began collecting information on cost increases, it still does not have the capability to track and measure cost growth on projects. Finally, although FHWA received direction to develop a more multidisciplinary workforce to conduct oversight, it has not fully incorporated this direction into its recruiting and training efforts. FHWA faces challenges to improving its oversight that are in large part rooted in the structure of the federal-aid highway program and in FHWA's organization and culture. As such, they may be difficult to surmount. For example, because the program does not link funding to states with the accomplishment of performance goals and outcome measures, it may be difficult for FHWA to define the role and purpose of its oversight. Also, FHWA's decentralized organization makes it difficult to achieve a consistent organizational vision. Human capital challenges affecting much of the federal government have affected FHWA, particularly in its need to transform its workforce to meet its evolving oversight mission. FHWA faces an increased oversight workload in the years ahead as the number of major projects grows and if provisions Congress is considering to increase FHWA's responsibilities become law. Questions exist about FHWA's ability to effectively absorb these new responsibilities, overcome underlying challenges, and improve its oversight. We identified selected best practices that could help FHWA develop a framework for a comprehensive approach to project oversight. These include establishing measurable goals to objectively and quantifiably assess progress, making oversight managers accountable for the effective implementation of these goals, providing professional training, and collecting and transferring lessons learned."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal-aid highway program provides over $25 billion a year to states  for highway and bridge projects, often paying 80 percent of these projects\u2019  costs. The program is federally financed and state administered; that is, the  federal government provides funding and oversees the program, while the  states largely choose and manage the projects. These projects can take  years of planning and environmental review, as well as the time spent in the  design and construction phases. With highway congestion projected to  worsen over the next 20 years and freight traffic expected to double,  widespread consensus exists on the need to maintain and improve the  nation\u2019s surface transportation infrastructure. In the longer term, broader  fiscal challenges face the nation, including federal and state budget deficits  and a fiscal crisis looming as the baby boom generation retires, causing  mandatory commitments to Social Security and Medicare to consume a  greater share of the nation\u2019s resources, squeezing funding available for  domestic discretionary programs. Thus, ensuring that states effectively  manage and control the cost and schedule performance of federally-aided  projects, and that federal funds are used efficiently and effectively, is  critical in light of these challenges.", "The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), under the Department of  Transportation (DOT), is responsible for overseeing the federal-aid  highway program through its headquarters in Washington, D.C., and  division offices located in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto  Rico. To carry out this role, FHWA reviews and approves the transportation  plans and environmental impact assessments that states periodically  prepare, reviews and approves states\u2019 property acquisition activities; and  enforces a variety of requirements, such as civil rights laws, that states  accept as a condition of federal aid. FHWA also oversees the design and  construction of federally-aided projects, but this oversight has evolved over  the years and currently focuses on two broad areas: (1) for selected  projects, direct review and approval of state design plans, contract awards,  and construction progress; and (2) reviews of state management processes,  also known as process reviews, to ensure that the states have adequate  controls to effectively manage federally-assisted projects. FHWA also  enforces requirements for \u201cmajor projects\u201d\u2014generally those projects  estimated to cost over $1 billion\u2014such as reviewing and approving annual  finance plans required by law for these projects.", "We and others have raised concerns regarding FHWA\u2019s oversight of the  federal-aid highway program. For example, from 1997 to 2002, we  highlighted several problems, including the lack of a link between FHWA\u2019s  oversight activities and its business goals; a lack of emphasis on FHWA\u2019s  part to ensuring that containing costs is an integral part of states\u2019 project  management; a lack of useful cost estimates, which typically have not been  reliable predictors of the total costs or financing needs of projects; and a  lack of information on the amount of and reasons for cost increases. In  particular, we have highlighted the challenges that major, multibillion- dollar projects pose. These projects are very costly and complex\u2014they  require large commitments of public resources that may take several years  to garner; can involve complicated financing arrangements; can be  technically challenging to construct; and involve a wide range of social,  environmental, land-use, and economic challenges before and during  construction. To keep the projects on schedule and within budget, federal  and state officials must carefully oversee their development, planning, and  construction.", "We also recognized actions Congress, DOT, and FHWA have taken to  improve FHWA\u2019s oversight in response to concerns raised about its efforts.  For example, in 1998, Congress required that states submit to the Secretary  of Transportation an annual finance plan for major projects, which was  intended to help provide an advance warning system for increased costs for  large transportation projects receiving federal funds. In 2001, FHWA took  steps to improve its oversight of these major projects by, among other  things, establishing a major projects team to coordinate and implement  oversight policies for major projects and designating project oversight  managers to oversee these projects. In addition, for its reviews of state  management processes, FHWA also began to conduct more risk  assessments to identify and prioritize risk areas and allocate resources.", "FHWA will face an increased oversight workload in the years ahead if  provisions Congress is considering become law and as the number of  federal-aid projects grows. In 2003, DOT proposed legislation for the  reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA- 21) that would increase FHWA\u2019s oversight responsibilities by requiring  FHWA to annually review states\u2019 financial management processes and to  periodically review how states plan and manage projects. The legislation  would also extend certain oversight requirements that currently pertain  only to major projects, to other large-dollar projects as well. This proposal  was largely adopted in bills that were separately approved by the House  and Senate in 2004, but which were not enacted before the adjournment of  the 108th Congress. In addition, during the course of our review, the number  of major projects FHWA is responsible for overseeing increased from 15 to  21, and that number is expected to nearly double to 40 in the next several  years.", "At your request, we reviewed FHWA\u2019s approach to improving its federal-aid  highway project oversight efforts since 2002, including (1) FHWA\u2019s  oversight-related performance goals and measures, (2) FHWA\u2019s oversight  improvement activities, (3) challenges FHWA faces in improving project  oversight, and (4) best practices for project oversight.", "To determine FHWA\u2019s approach to improving its oversight efforts since  2002, the last time we reported on this issue, we evaluated the agency\u2019s  strategic and performance plans, and supporting documents. Furthermore,  we documented and analyzed the status of FHWA\u2019s various project  oversight efforts. We interviewed officials at FHWA Headquarters and  selected FHWA division offices, state departments of transportation, and  others to document oversight implementation efforts and the challenges  FHWA faces in improving its project oversight. We also reviewed FHWA\u2019s  use of financial information from its Financial Management Information  System (FMIS) to track and analyze trends in cost growth on projects. We  did not independently assess the reliability of FMIS data as the  Department\u2019s Inspector General has reported on weaknesses in FHWA\u2019s  financial management and reporting processes, most recently in November  2004 as part of the annual audit of DOT\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  In addition, our work focused primarily on FHWA\u2019s use of FMIS data for  oversight purposes, rather than relying on FMIS data to support our  findings and conclusions.", "To provide information on project management best practices we  conducted a literature search to identify best practices related to project  oversight and evaluated their applicability to FHWA\u2019s oversight efforts. We  conducted our work from August 2003 through December 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government audit standards. Appendix  I provides the details of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal funding for highways is provided to the states mostly through a  series of formula grant programs collectively known as the federal-aid  highway program. Periodically, Congress enacts multiyear legislation that  authorizes the nation's surface transportation programs, including  highways, transit, highway safety, research, and motor carrier programs. In  1998 Congress enacted TEA-21, which authorized $172.4 billion for the  federal-aid highway program from fiscal years 1998 through 2003. The  program expired on September 30, 2003, and it has been extended by six  short-term extensions, the most recent extending the program until May 31,  2005. During the 108th Congress, both the House and Senate approved  separate legislation to reauthorize the federal-aid highway program;  however, the reauthorization legislation was not been enacted before the  adjournment of the 108th Congress. The bill approved by the House  authorized $226.3 billion for the federal-aid highway program for fiscal  years 2004 through 2009, an increase of about 31 percent over TEA-21,  while the bill approved by the Senate authorized $256.4 billion, an increase  of about 49 percent. Because both bills contained funding increases, it is  likely that the number of federal-aid highway projects will rise in the next  several years.", "FHWA administers the federal-aid highway program and distributes most  highway funds to the states through annual apportionments established by  statutory formulas contained in law. Once FHWA apportions these funds,  they are available to be obligated for construction, reconstruction, and  improvement of highways and bridges on eligible federal-aid highway  routes and for other purposes authorized in law. About 1 million of the  nation's 4 million miles of roads are eligible for federal aid; including the  161,000 mile National Highway System, of which the 47,000 mile Interstate  Highway System is a part. While FHWA administers the program, the  responsibility for choosing projects generally rests with state departments  of transportation and local planning organizations. The states have  considerable discretion in selecting specific highway projects and in  determining how to allocate available federal funds among the various  projects they have selected. For example, section 145 of title 23 of the  United States Code describes the federal-aid highway program as a  federally-assisted state program and provides that the federal authorization  of funds, as well as the availability of federal funds for expenditure, shall  not infringe on the states\u2019 sovereign right to determine the projects to be  federally financed.", "A highway or bridge construction or repair project usually has four stages:  (1) planning, (2) environmental review, (3) design and property acquisition,  and (4) construction. FHWA reviews and approves long-term and short- term state transportation plans and programs, environmental documents,  and the acquisition of property for all highway projects. However, its role  in overseeing the design and construction of projects varies. On selected  projects, FHWA exercises what is often considered \u201cfull\u201d oversight,  meaning that FHWA (1) prescribes design and construction standards, (2)  approves design plans and estimates, (3) approves the selection of the  contract award, (4) periodically inspects the progress of construction, and  (5) renders final acceptance on projects when they are completed.  However, relatively few projects are subject to this full FHWA oversight.  The last two authorizations, the Intermodal Surface Transportation  Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and TEA-21, devolved an increasing amount  of responsibility to the states. Under current law FHWA exercises full  oversight of certain high-cost interstate system projects, while states  oversee design and construction on other federal-aid projects.", "The stages of a highway or bridge project and the corresponding state role  and FHWA approval actions are shown in figure 1.", "The types of projects for which FHWA exercises full oversight as compared  with state oversight are shown in table 1.", "According to FHWA, the agency retains the responsibility to oversee all  federally-aided highway and bridge projects, including projects for which  FHWA does not exercise oversight over the design and construction  phases. FHWA conducts oversight of state transportation programs  through a variety of means, including process reviews\u2014reviews of state  management processes to ensure that states have adequate controls to  effectively manage federally-assisted projects. States and FHWA execute  stewardship and oversight agreements to define their respective oversight  responsibilities.", "TEA-21 contains an additional oversight requirement for so-called \u201cmajor  projects\u201d\u2014generally those estimated to cost at least $1 billion. Since TEA- 21 was enacted in 1998, states must submit finance plans to DOT annually  for such projects, based on detailed estimates of the costs to complete the  project and on reasonable assumptions about future increases in such  costs. FHWA developed guidance that requires states to include in these  finance plans a total cost estimate for the project, adjusted for inflation and  annually updated; estimates about future cost increases; a schedule for  completing the project; a description of construction financing sources and  revenues; a cash flow analysis; and a discussion of other factors, such as  how the project will affect the rest of the state\u2019s highway program. FHWA  approves these plans as a condition of federal aid. As of November 2004, 11  of the 21 current major projects had finance plans. Approved finance plans  will be required for the other projects prior to FHWA authorizing federal  funds for construction. FHWA forecasts that another 19 major projects,  estimated to cost from $34 billion to $60 billion, will be starting over the  next several years and will also require finance plans.", "Over the past several years, we and others have identified problems with  FHWA\u2019s oversight of major projects and other large highway and bridge  projects. For example, in 1997, we reported that the overall amount of and  reasons for cost increases on highway and bridge projects could not be  determined because data were not readily available from FHWA or the  states. We found, however, on many of the projects for which we could  obtain information, that costs had increased, sometimes significantly, and  that several factors accounted for the increases. In addition, initial cost  estimates were not reliable predictors of a project\u2019s total cost or financing  needs because they were developed at the environmental review stage, and  their purpose was to compare project alternatives, not to develop reliable  cost estimates. We further reported that cost containment was not an  explicit statutory or regulatory goal of FHWA\u2019s oversight; therefore, the  agency had done little to ensure that cost containment was an integral part  of the states\u2019 project management. In our May 2002 testimony before the  Highways, Transit, and Pipelines Subcommittee of your Committee, we  reported that FHWA had begun to improve its oversight by implementing  Congress\u2019 finance plan requirements for major projects and introducing  risk-based decision making into its oversight of states\u2019 processes on other  projects. However, we also reported that FHWA had not yet developed  performance goals or measurable outcomes linking its oversight activities  to its business goals, and that goals and strategies for containing costs  could improve accountability and make cost containment an integral part  of how states manage projects over time. Furthermore, we stated that  opportunities existed for improving the quality of cost estimating and  developing reliable and accurate information on the extent and nature of  projects\u2019 cost performance to help direct federal oversight efforts. Our  work identified several options for enhancing the oversight of major  projects. Reports by DOT\u2019s Office of Inspector General, as well as reviews  by state audit and evaluation agencies, have also shown that the escalating  costs and management of major projects continue to be a problem. For  example, the Inspector General has issued several reports on FHWA\u2019s  oversight and stewardship of major projects, such as the Central  Artery/Tunnel project in Massachusetts and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in  Virginia and Maryland. More recently, the Inspector General reported signs  of improvement in FHWA\u2019s stewardship over major projects but identified  improvements needed in eight areas, including developing more reliable  cost estimates, managing project schedules better, strengthening efforts to  prevent and detect fraud, and refocusing FHWA\u2019s efforts on project  management and financial oversight.", "Partly in response to concerns that we and others have raised, in addition  to the provisions Congress enacted in TEA-21, DOT also took further  action. In 2000 the Secretary of Transportation established a task force to  review oversight mechanisms and processes for major transportation  projects across DOT. Among other things, the task force recommended that  DOT improve the skills and qualifications of staff overseeing major projects  and conduct more rigorous financial reviews of such projects. Although  DOT did not formally implement the task force\u2019s recommendations, FHWA  responded to the task force report by establishing a major projects team in  Washington, D.C., to assist FHWA\u2019s division offices in reviewing financial  plans and overseeing major projects and by assigning project oversight  managers to each of the major projects. In addition, in 2003, DOT proposed  new legislation as part of its TEA-21 reauthorization proposal requiring that  (1) states submit a project management plan as well as an annual financial  plan for any project with an estimated total cost of $1 billion or more or any  other project at the discretion of the Secretary; (2) states develop financial  plans for any project receiving over $100 million in federal funds; (3) FHWA  perform annual reviews of state transportation programs\u2019 financial  management and periodic reviews of state project delivery systems for  planning and managing projects; and (4) DOT develop minimum standards  for estimating project costs and perform periodic reviews of state practices  for estimating costs and awarding contracts. This proposal was largely  adopted in bills that were separately approved by the House and the Senate  in 2004 but that were not enacted before the adjournment of the 108th  Congress.", "To meet the requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act  of 1993 (GPRA), DOT establishes goals and outcome measures for the  programs under its jurisdiction, including the federal-aid highway program,  through its strategic and performance plans. GPRA requires agencies to  complete strategic plans in which they define their missions, establish  outcome-oriented goals, and identify the strategies that will be needed to  achieve those goals. GPRA also requires agencies to prepare annual  performance plans to articulate goals for the upcoming fiscal year that are  aligned with their long-term strategic goals. The establishment of goals and  measures is a valuable tool for guiding an agency\u2019s strategies and resource  allocations and for establishing accountability for the outcomes of its day- to-day activities. As our prior work has shown, measuring performance  allows organizations to track the progress they are making toward their  goals and gives managers crucial information on which to base their  organizational and management decisions. When an agency\u2019s day-to-day  activities are linked to outcome measures, these measures can create  powerful incentives to influence organizational and individual behavior. In  prior work, we found that leading agencies that successfully link their  activities and resources also seek to establish clear hierarchies of  performance goals and measures. Under these hierarchies, an agency links  the goals and outcome measures for each organizational level to successive  levels and ultimately to the agency\u2019s strategic goals. Without this link,  managers and staff throughout the organization will lack straightforward  roadmaps showing how their daily activities can contribute to attaining  organization wide strategic goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Established Some Oversight Goals and Measures but Has Not Effectively Implemented Them", "paragraphs": ["FHWA established measurable, outcome-oriented goals and measures  related to cost and schedule performance for the first time in its 2004  performance plan, but FHWA has not effectively implemented these goals  and measures in order to improve oversight. Specifically, FHWA has not  linked its day-to-day oversight activities to its goals for major projects, and  it has not yet used its goals and measures for nonmajor projects to examine  the performance of states or particular projects. FHWA also uses estimates  developed relatively late in a project\u2019s development as its baseline for  measuring its performance on achieving cost and schedule goals; thus, it  does not task itself with controlling cost and schedule slippage during the  early stages of a project\u2019s development."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FHWA Recently Established Goals and Measures", "paragraphs": ["In December 2000, DOT issued a task force report concluding that a  significant effort was needed to improve the oversight of major projects  and recommending that DOT incorporate goals for its oversight efforts into  its performance plans as well as into the plans of FHWA. In 2002, we  reported that FHWA had not yet developed performance goals or  measurable outcomes linking its oversight activities to its business goals  and that goals and strategies for containing costs could improve  accountability and make cost containment an integral part of how states  manage projects over time.", "FHWA has made some improvements over the past several years in  developing goals and performance measures related to cost and schedule  performance of federal-aid highway projects. In its fiscal year 2002  performance plan, FHWA included a strategic goal of organizational  excellence that had among its many strategic objectives the aim to improve  organizational performance. Since that time, from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal  year 2005, FHWA\u2019s performance plans have specifically identified under the  organizational excellence heading a general oversight goal to improve  project oversight and stewardship so as to realize more cost efficient  federal-aid funds administration and project management and more  effective use of funds in terms of return on investment. In its fiscal year  2004 performance plan, DOT for the first time established goals and  outcome measures specifically related to achieving cost and schedule  targets for its transportation projects. FHWA incorporated these goals and  measures into its performance plan for highway projects, establishing, for  the first time, goals and measures for major projects that are outcome  oriented and measurable and clearly define containing project costs and  schedules as an integral part of FHWA\u2019s oversight mission. Figure 2 shows  the goals and associated measures articulated in FHWA\u2019s fiscal year 2004  performance plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Has Not Effectively Implemented its Goals and Measures", "paragraphs": ["While linking day-to-day activities to goals and measures is an important  element of implementing goals and measures by ensuring that they are  being used as a framework to guide the activities, we found no evidence  that FHWA has linked the day-to-day activities of its division offices to its  goal and measure for major projects. In our visits to the three division  offices that were overseeing a major project, we found a lack of  documented goals, strategies, or measures showing how the division  offices\u2019 activities supported and furthered the goals and measures  articulated in FHWA\u2019s 2004 performance plan. While each division office  had developed its own individual unit fiscal year 2004 performance plan,  there was no link in these plans between the division offices\u2019 activities and  FHWA\u2019s goal and measure for major projects: that is, to meet 95 percent of  schedule milestones and cost estimates for major projects or to miss them  by less than 10 percent. Furthermore, in these three division offices, the  project oversight managers were not specifically tasked, as part of their  duties and responsibilities, with implementing or furthering the articulated  cost and schedule performance goals for major projects.", "This absence of a link between activities and goals and measures was in  noticeable contrast to the link that the division offices had established  between their activities and the three areas of work that FHWA has  designated as its \u201cvital few\u201d priorities. FHWA\u2019s vital few priorities, which  consist of safety, congestion mitigation, and environmental stewardship  and streamlining, are areas that FHWA has determined are key priorities  and that it accordingly highlights in its performance plans as areas where  the agency has identified performance gaps that must be addressed if  FHWA is to be successful. Perhaps in line with this emphasis, FHWA has  developed a better link between its division offices\u2019 activities related to  these vital few priorities and its goals related to these vital few priorities.  For example, all seven of the division offices we visited had unit plans that  linked their activities to all three of FHWA\u2019s vital few priorities. This link  was established through listing specific unit-level activities and measures  that were designed to meet unit goals that mirrored the national  performance plan\u2019s goals for its vital few priorities. For example, for the  vital few priority of safety, FHWA\u2019s fiscal year 2004 performance plan set a  performance goal of reducing highway fatalities to no more than 1.38 per  100 million vehicle miles traveled. The fiscal year 2004 performance plan  for one division office tasked itself with five performance objectives to  address this national goal, including such objectives as improving accident  rates involving roadway departures, increasing the capability of FHWA and  state engineers in highway safety design, and reducing pedestrian  fatalities. One or more division-level performance measures and several  specific activities were identified for each of these five division objectives,  and performance expectations set for key division staff identified which of  these activities they were responsible for performing.", "In addition to not linking its activities to its goal for major projects, FHWA  has also not yet used its goals and outcome measures to help it identify and  correct problems on the vast majority of projects that are not considered  major projects. In 2004, FHWA did not develop numerical goals or outcome  measures related to nonmajor projects, nor did it assess the cost and  schedule performance of projects on a state-by-state or project-by-project  basis in order to gain a clear picture of whether certain states or projects  have more cost or schedule overruns than others in order to target its  oversight activities. Instead, FHWA officials told us that while FHWA\u2019s  major projects team recently started developing this state-by-state  information, FHWA relies on the division offices to monitor costs of  individual contracts and take action as appropriate. However, these  officials could not say with certainty whether their division offices were  carrying out this monitoring function, or what kinds of corrective measures  were being applied. FHWA officials also said that the agency relies on  FHWA\u2019s division offices to execute formal oversight agreements with the  states to ensure that they are working to control costs. However, none of  the oversight agreements of the seven division offices we visited reflected  an agreement between FHWA and the states to do this. As we concluded  our review, FHWA officials stated that in response to issues we raised,  FHWA would begin sharing information with its division offices and begin  discussing appropriate solutions or actions the divisions can take to  address incidences of cost growth.", "For fiscal year 2005, FHWA made its cost-related goal for nonmajor  projects more specific by adding the outcome measure that the total  percentage of cost growth for all construction projects over $10 million will  be less than 10 percent above the estimated cost when the project went to  construction. FHWA\u2019s preliminary information indicates that the agency is,  in the aggregate, meeting its goal; however, sharing information with its  division offices about variations in state contract costs could help FHWA  target its oversight efforts. For example, FHWA's information also shows  that about 1 in 5 of the 492 contracts approved for construction in fiscal  year 2003 exceeded the 10 percent threshold in fiscal year 2004. One  contract exceeded the threshold by 160 percent. Our analysis of FHWA\u2019s  information also shows that some states may be more effectively  controlling the costs of federal-aid highway contracts than others. For  example, in one state, 6 of 9 contacts over $10 million had exceeded the  threshold, while in another state, all of the contracts were under the  threshold. While opportunities exist for FHWA to use this information to  better target its oversight efforts, it faces challenges in doing so in light of  weaknesses recently reported by the DOT Inspector General\u2019s Office in its  financial management and reporting processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Does Not Measure its Performance over the Full Life of Projects", "paragraphs": ["FHWA uses cost and schedule estimates developed relatively late in a  project\u2019s development\u2014at the point at which the project is ready to go to  construction\u2014as a baseline for measuring its performance.

We have recognized that developing early  estimates is difficult; however, we have pointed out that using this late  estimate as a baseline for measuring cost growth provides a misleading  picture of actual cost growth. This is because cost estimates developed  much earlier in the project\u2014for example, at the environmental review  stage\u2014are used to make the public investment decision regarding the  project. By the time the project goes to construction, a public investment  decision effectively has been made, as substantial funds will have been  spent on designing the project and acquiring property, commitments will  have already been made to the public, and much of the increases in a  project\u2019s costs may have already occurred.", "Moreover, by measuring its performance only after construction begins,  FHWA is not tasking itself with or establishing any accountability for  controlling cost growth during the part of the process where it exercises  direct oversight responsibility. Rather, it has focused its goals on the phases  of the project where it exercises less oversight.

This core  competency framework defines the skills and supporting behaviors of  project oversight managers in areas such as project and financial  management, contract administration, and program laws, and it specifies  the desired proficiency level for each competency at each grade level.", "FHWA has also taken steps to provide guidance and tools for project  oversight managers, including an online resource manual and other  guidance on reviewing project management plans and finance plans. It also  made major projects team staff available to assist the project oversight  managers in completing their reviews of such plans, and it sponsored  annual meetings for project oversight managers to share experiences.  Additionally, FHWA identified external training opportunities to help  managers reach or improve their core competency skills. FHWA sent a  listing of these opportunities to project oversight managers via email and  invited these staff to enlist in courses that interested them. For the future,  FHWA\u2019s 2004 major projects team work plan summary envisions a variety  of additional activities to improve the effectiveness of project oversight  managers, including working with universities and training vendors to  establish a skill set development and certification program to ensure that  all project oversight managers acquire the same critical skills and to  establish a career path for them. According to FHWA, having a career path  would make the position of project oversight manager a more attractive  career option because it would provide opportunities to work with more  challenging projects and provide promotion opportunities so that managers  could advance within FHWA while staying in the project management  track.", "However, there are limitations with FHWA\u2019s efforts so far. While the core  competencies define the skills that project oversight managers are  expected to possess, they do not define what the managers should do to  oversee a major project. FHWA has not yet articulated the role of project  oversight managers or established agency wide performance expectations  for them. In prior work, we established that setting performance  expectations that are linked to goals is important, as a specific alignment  between performance expectations and organizational goals helps  individuals see the connection between their daily activities and  organizational goals.", "According to FHWA officials, project oversight managers are assigned to  the division offices, and each division office defines what its project  oversight manager does. At the three division offices we visited that had  major projects and project oversight managers, none had set performance  expectations for the project oversight manager that specifically tasked the  project oversight manager with achieving the goals and outcome measures  for the major projects. Project oversight managers and division officials  stressed the project oversight managers\u2019 close, hands-on involvement with  the state transportation agencies in the project, on an almost daily basis.  For example, project oversight managers and other division office staff  help state transportation agencies prepare finance and project  management plans, get involved in design, participate in community  outreach, and brief local political leaders on major projects. However, the  extent to which the activity of the project oversight managers supported  DOT\u2019s cost and schedule goals was not clear.", "Finally, without clear roles, responsibilities, and performance expectations  for project oversight managers that are clearly linked to FHWA\u2019s goals, it is  unclear what training is most needed to enable project oversight managers  to improve their performance and meet the agency\u2019s goals. Our guidance  for assessing training efforts cites the need for training efforts to be an  integral part of the strategic and performance planning process and to  focus on reaching the agency\u2019s goals, rather than being implemented ad  hoc.Currently, the training opportunities FHWA offers to project  oversight managers are identified by the major projects team and are  voluntary. There is no program of required courses\u2014staff can choose  which courses they would like to take, or take no courses at all. In March  2004, the head of FHWA\u2019s major projects team sent an e-mail to the  oversight managers advising them of available training. To date, three  project oversight managers and one other division office engineer have  each volunteered to take one or two courses.", "FHWA officials told us they eventually plan to establish a certification  program for project oversight managers and to introduce a project  oversight manager skills-set or career path to make project management a  more attractive career option by setting out opportunities for more  challenging projects, and providing promotion opportunities. However, as  of December 2004, FHWA does not have a time frame for implementing its  plans, and officials told us these activities would not be implemented  without additional resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Provided Guidance to States on Developing Cost Estimates but this Guidance is Voluntary and Covers Only Major Projects", "paragraphs": ["In another positive step since 2002, FHWA has provided guidance to state  transportation agencies to assist them in applying sound cost estimating  practices, including guidance in developing more realistic early cost  estimates. However, this guidance is voluntary and covers only major  projects, and we found evidence that there is some resistance by FHWA  officials to focusing on developing earlier cost estimates. In past work, we  have identified problems related to FHWA\u2019s lack of accurate cost estimates  for projects. For example, in 1997, we found that cost increases occurred  on projects, in part, because the initial cost estimates were not reliable  predictors of the total costs or financing needs. Rather, these estimates  were developed for the environmental review\u2014the purpose of which is to  compare project alternatives, not to develop reliable cost estimates. In  addition, each state used its own methods and included different types of  costs in developing its estimates, since FHWA had no standard  requirements for preparing cost estimates. Since that time, in 2003, FHWA  surveyed its division offices on cost estimating practices in their states and  found a variety of approaches to developing cost estimates, including  manually compiling estimates from historical data, using estimated  quantity or cost per mile calculations, or utilizing various externally or  internally developed software; one state reportedly lacked any formal  process. Similarly, the American Association of State Highway and  Transportation Officials (AASHTO) reported widely varying practices  among the states in developing cost estimates.", "In June 2004, FHWA issued guidance that articulated the importance of  developing realistic early cost estimates that would be more stable as a  project progresses. Specifically, FHWA\u2019s guidance stated that it is important  that care be taken to present an achievable estimate even in the early  stages of project development, because logical and reasonable cost  estimates are necessary to maintain public confidence and trust throughout  the life of a major project. Moreover, the guidance recognized that cost  increases over and above the early planning and environmental estimates  for major transportation projects have become of increasing concern to  congressional and political leaders, federal and state top managers, and  auditing agencies. In addition to recognizing the difficulty of developing  more accurate cost estimates early in the project, this guidance includes  such components as what should be included in an estimate, how it should  be approved, factors to include in contingencies, and other information.  This guidance may help states move towards more consistent and reliable  cost estimates during the earlier planning phases when decisions are being  made about whether or not to go forward with the project, as well as the  project\u2019s potential design and construction.", "FHWA also established help teams that travel to states that ask for  assistance in creating better estimates. For example, in March 2003 FHWA  was asked by the Kentucky and Indiana transportation departments for  help in reviewing the accuracy and reasonableness of the initial cost  estimate to complete the Ohio River Bridges project. This project includes  two new bridges over the Ohio River that would link eastern Louisville,  Kentucky, and Clark County, Indiana, with additional interchange  improvements. FHWA staff helped state officials identify the need for  revised cost estimates and more realistic completion dates based on such  factors as more realistic right-of-way costs, needed environmental  mitigation, revised contingencies, and updated inflation rates. A team of  federal and state staff working with consultants recommended that the  total cost estimate of the project be revised from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion  and that its expected completion date be revised from 2017 to 2020. State  officials accepted these recommendations.", "While these cost estimating guidance and assistance efforts represent a  positive step, it is too early to tell whether they will actually improve cost  estimating efforts in most states. Furthermore, there are indications that  there is some resistance among FHWA officials and states to emphasizing  the importance of more accurate early estimates in practice. For example,  some FHWA officials with whom we spoke said that costs cannot be  accurately estimated early because issues such as public opposition to a  project or unforeseen environmental mitigation procedures that are  determined necessary are likely to drive up the cost of a project. They said  early estimates should not be used as a basis for monitoring project costs.  Other FHWA officials believed that the estimate developed at the  conclusion of the design phase, as the project is ready for construction, is  the only realistic estimate to be used as a baseline. Some FHWA officials  told us that resolving concerns about cost estimates is more a matter of  managing public expectations, so that the public understands that early  estimates are not reliable and cannot be counted on, and that the actual  cost will exceed early estimates. AASHTO also believes that accurately  estimating costs at the early stages of a project can be a challenge.  According to a May 2004 AASHTO report, property acquisition needs and  environmental and regulatory requirements may not be fully known early  on, becoming clear only as the project progresses. Public input can  contribute to additional features being added to projects, known as \u201cscope  creep,\u201d and litigation can delay a project, adding to costs because of  inflation.", "We recognize that many challenges exist to developing more realistic early  estimates that more accurately reflect the expected cost of a project.  However, as we have also reported, relying on estimates prepared as a  project is ready to move to construction is too late in the process, as  substantial funds may have already been spent on designing the project and  acquiring property, and a public investment decision may, in effect, already  have been made. FHWA\u2019s guidance recognizes that steps can be taken to  take uncertainties into account when developing early cost estimates  through such means as developing contingencies. Some states have begun  taking action to improve the reliability of early cost estimates. For  example, Washington State\u2019s Cost Estimate Validation Process uses project  teams to identify risk factors, along with costs and mitigation strategies for  each factor. These results are then entered into a computer-based modeling  program that produces a range and a project cost estimate at the 90 percent  confidence level, rather than a single dollar cost estimate.", "DOT\u2019s proposed legislation for the reauthorization of TEA-21 in 2003  included provisions empowering the Secretary to develop minimum  standards for estimating project costs and to perform periodic reviews of  state practices for estimating project costs. These provisions were adopted  in bills that were separately approved by the House and the Senate in 2004  but that were not enacted before the adjournment of the 108th Congress.  According to FHWA officials, if these provisions are adopted, the  provisions may require them to move beyond voluntary guidance and issue  regulations covering states\u2019 practices for estimating costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Has Started to Collect Some Cost Information, but it still Lacks the Capability to Determine the Extent of and Reasons for Cost Growth on Projects", "paragraphs": ["FHWA has started to collect some cost information on some projects, but it  still lacks the capability to determine the extent of and reasons for cost  growth on projects so that it can better focus its oversight efforts. In 1997  we reported that cost growth occurred on projects, but the extent could  not be determined because FHWA\u2019s information system for highway  projects could not track total costs over the life of a project. In 2002, we  testified that this information was still not available and noted that recent  congressional attempts to gather complete and accurate information about  the extent of and the reasons for cost growth had met with limited  success. In response to these concerns and requests from Congress for  data, FHWA has begun to collect project cost data, but it has not  substantially improved its ability to monitor total costs on projects.", "FHWA has undertaken two efforts to collect information on the cost  performance of federally financed projects. First, it has started tracking  information on cost growth of major projects. The small number of these  projects allows the tracking to be done manually on a table containing cost  and schedule information for key aspects of each major project. Second,  FHWA has developed aggregated cost information on construction  contracts over $10 million on a state-by-state basis. FHWA has done this by  comparing the current estimated costs of all contracts over $10 million in  each state with the engineering estimate developed before the contract was  awarded. However, as mentioned earlier, the state-by-state information  FHWA has developed has not yet been used to measure performance or  target its oversight efforts.", "In spite of this progress, FHWA still does not have the capability to measure  the extent of and reasons for cost growth on projects. FHWA\u2019s principal  vehicle for tracking project costs is its financial management system. This  system is an accounting system, not a project information system, and it  tracks federal reimbursements by contract rather than by project. Because  one project can include many contracts over many years, and the system  does not automatically link contracts to projects, FHWA has little easily  accessible information to help it determine the total overall costs of each  project, other than the major projects it tracks individually outside of its  financial management system. In one case, FHWA division staff told us that  because FHWA\u2019s financial management system does not track costs by  project, the division developed its own spreadsheet to track project costs.", "Our recent work confirmed FHWA\u2019s continued difficulty with tracking cost  growth on projects. We randomly selected 14 contracts from 7 division  offices and asked FHWA\u2019s division offices to identify the project related to  each contract. We then requested consolidated cost information on the 14  projects. FHWA took an average of more than 3 months\u2014and up to 6  months\u2014to provide us this information for 12 of the 14 projects, and it was  unable to provide us complete cost information on the other 2 projects.  (See app. I for more details.) The primary reason for FHWA\u2019s difficulty in  providing us with this information was that FHWA and state staff could not  easily or electronically compile information on a project-by-project basis.  For example, one division office said it had to develop and run special  transaction reports and manually extract the information we wanted  because the support files for the information were at different locations,  including a state district office, state transportation agency offices, and  comptroller offices. Another told us it had to take the extra step of either  combining or separating contracts in order to compile information by  project, which resulted in more \u201chand work.\u201d Another said that files on  contracts for one project were kept in different locations depending on the  stage of the project that the contract was related to. As a result, quite a bit  of staff time was tied up as they attempted to get information from multiple  departments of the state transportation agency. FHWA\u2019s continued  difficulties in maintaining accurate and complete data to determine the  extent of cost growth on projects limit its ability to evaluate why cost  growth occurs, identify problems and solutions, target its oversight efforts,  and transfer lessons learned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Has Established Risk Assessments, but These Risk Assessments Are Not Always Used", "paragraphs": ["FHWA expects its division offices to use some form of risk assessment to  help guide its reviews of state management processes, also known as  process reviews. However, risk assessments are not always being used  consistently or effectively. As we reported in 2002, FHWA issued a policy in  June 2001 encouraging its division offices to prioritize the risks in the  transportation programs in their states and to direct their oversight efforts  based on these results. The policy did not require a specific risk assessment  approach but allowed division offices flexibility in developing an approach  with their state agencies. FHWA considered its establishment of risk  assessment practices at the division offices to be the first of a two-phased  approach that would lead to an overall risk management program for  FHWA, which was still under consideration within FHWA\u2019s leadership as of  November 2004.", "Each of the seven division offices we visited had developed a risk  assessment approach, and five out of seven of the offices were using these  risk assessments to guide their process reviews. However, at two division  offices, the results had not been used to direct their process reviews. Staff  at one division office we visited reported that although they had been doing  risk assessments for a few years, they did not use the results to target state  activities for review. Instead, they targeted state activities for review by  meeting with state officials to draw up an intuitive list of state operations  for process reviews. Similarly, another division office had drafted a risk  assessment approach, but it had not yet tried to use it. Division office staff  were skeptical that it would yield better results than their own more  intuitive approach to identifying which state program operations warranted  a process review.", "In addition, in November 2004 the DOT Inspector General reported that  FHWA's risk assessments were voluntary and did not provide a systematic  approach for assessing program risks throughout the agency. The Office of  Inspector General (OIG) reported that risks assessments varied  significantly in the scope and methodology used and how the assessment  results were rated and classified. As a result, some major programs were  not reviewed, and risk assessment results were not reliable or comparable  across states. To improve FHWA's process for managing risk, the OIG  recommended that FHWA require all division offices to conduct risk  assessments and that it issue guidance to division offices to ensure risk  assessments are conducted more strategically and with a disciplined  methodology. The OIG further recommended that FHWA analyze trends  within individual risk assessments to identify agency wide issues and  problems and establish a systematic follow-up process to ensure that  oversight attention is given to high-risk areas. FHWA was in the process of  reviewing and responding to the OIG\u2019s recommendations when we  concluded our review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Has Begun to Take Steps to Develop a Multidisciplinary Approach to Oversight, but its Efforts so Far Have Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["In February 2003, in the Conference Committee Report for the DOT fiscal  year 2003 continuing appropriations, the conferees expressed continuing  concern about FHWA\u2019s management of major projects, and in particular, a  concern that FHWA\u2019s traditional engineering focus had inhibited oversight  in such areas as financing, cost control, and schedule performance.  Accordingly, FHWA was directed to evaluate the range of disciplines and  skills within its staff and to develop a strategy for achieving a more  multidisciplinary approach towards its oversight activities, including  identifying staff with such skills as financing and cost estimation.", "However, FHWA\u2019s human capital plan does not incorporate strategies for  developing a workforce to support a more multidisciplinary oversight  approach. In prior work, we noted that the process of strategic workforce  planning addresses two critical needs: (1) aligning an organization\u2019s human  capital program with its current mission and programmatic goals; and (2)  developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining  staff to achieve programmatic goals. To some extent, FHWA\u2019s human  capital plan does this for the agency\u2019s current vital few priorities of safety,  congestion mitigation, and environmental stewardship. But the agency\u2019s  oversight mission is not truly incorporated into the plan. FHWA\u2019s human  capital plan acknowledges the congressional-committee direction FHWA  received to develop a more multidisciplinary approach to oversight. The  plan states that this approach will require the development or acquisition of  new skills, specifically in the areas of financing, funds accountability,  project-level cost control, schedule performance, process management,  and transportation planning. However, FHWA\u2019s human capital plan does not  relate these needed skills to the skills possessed by its present workforce,  nor does it address how these skills will be developed or acquired. Instead,  FHWA\u2019s human capital plan is essentially a plan for replacing individuals in  its current key occupations whom it expects to lose through attrition over a  5-year period.", "Additionally, strategies for developing a multidisciplinary approach were  not reflected in FHWA\u2019s guidance to its division offices for developing their  workforce plans. This year, FHWA required its division offices and other  units to prepare a workforce plan for the upcoming 3-to-5 year period  identifying anticipated skill gaps in their workforce. However, the guidance  FHWA provided did not mention the multidisciplinary skills that FHWA had  identified in its human capital plan. As we have pointed out in prior work,  when planning for the future, leading organizations go beyond simply  replacing individuals and engage in broad, integrated planning and  management efforts that focus on strengthening both current and future  organizational capacity. This is particularly important for FHWA, as its  traditional engineering focus has drawn congressional committee concern  that has led to direction to develop a multidisciplinary approach towards  its oversight activities.", "Similarly, FHWA\u2019s recruiting efforts do not incorporate strategies for  developing a more multidisciplinary approach to project oversight. Like its  human capital plan, FHWA\u2019s recruitment plan for 2003 through 2005 is  primarily a plan for hiring to fill the agency\u2019s traditional occupations. The  recruitment plan does not set any specific goals or objectives for acquiring  needed multidisciplinary skills that FHWA articulated in its human capital  plan, such as project level cost control, schedule performance, process  management, and transportation planning. Under the recruiting plan, the  development of a multidisciplinary approach is addressed through FHWA\u2019s  professional development program (PDP). FHWA\u2019s PDP, which historically  focused on engineers, is a 2-year program that provides developmental  assignments and on-the-job and classroom training for entry-level staff.  Officials told us that PDP staff are now being given assignments allowing  them to develop a broader range of skills at the start of their careers,  including assignments to division offices with major projects. They also  note that over recent years FHWA has been hiring fewer engineers for its  PDP programs and more staff from other backgrounds.", "The other principal component of FHWA\u2019s response to congressional  committee direction to develop a multidisciplinary approach to project  oversight is training, but the agency has made limited progress in  developing new courses to bring new skills to its workforce. Only two new  training courses were being developed specifically to address needed  skills\u2014a course on project cost estimation and a course on project  management for managers in division offices. As of November 2004, both  courses were being pilot tested. As we noted earlier, it is important for  training to be an integral part of an agency\u2019s performance planning process  to ensure that it contributes to reaching agency goals. However, in its fiscal  year 2005 performance plan, FHWA allows divisions the discretion to  decide whether or not to participate in multidisciplinary training for its  project oversight managers and professional development program staff. In  addition, as noted earlier, FHWA has identified and offered external  training courses to project oversight managers, but to date only a few  managers and other key division staff have expressed an interest. Even so,  FHWA human resources officials we spoke to told us they believed that the  congressional committee\u2019s direction to develop a multidisciplinary  approach to project oversight has been largely met through their already  existing training efforts. These efforts include making courses available on  risk assessment techniques, conducting process reviews, and implementing  financial management improvements.", "In addition to FHWA\u2019s limited progress in developing strategies for meeting  this congressional-committee direction, FHWA has not fully embraced the  need to develop a more multidisciplinary approach to oversight. FHWA  human resources officials we spoke to believed the concern that FHWA\u2019s  workforce is centered on engineering at the expense of other project  oversight skills is based on a misperception\u2014that is, not recognizing that  FHWA engineers take on many other tasks not strictly related to  engineering. Furthermore, two division office officials we spoke to in the  course of our work questioned the need for FHWA to focus on  multidisciplinary skills. One division administrator commented that  \u201cmultidisciplinary\u201d means that a person can do many things, and therefore  that division\u2019s staff was already multidisciplinary.

Furthermore, states are exempt from FHWA oversight on design and  construction of many projects. Although DOT has articulated goals and  outcome measures for the federal-aid highway program, such as improving  safety and reducing the growth of traffic congestion, FHWA must  implement and achieve these goals through a program over which it  exercises limited control. Our past work across government programs has  shown that in programs that have limited federal control, agencies face  challenges to ensure that federal funds are efficiently and effectively  used. We have also found that these challenges can be successfully  overcome, in some cases, by ensuring that the program has clear goals and  strong analytical data to measure program results. However, as stated  earlier, FHWA\u2019s efforts both to implement its goals and to collect and  analyze data on project costs have fallen short.", "Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that, as our August 2004 report  highlighted, the federal-aid highway program does not have the  mechanisms to link funding levels with the accomplishment of goals and  outcome measures that DOT has articulated. We have also reported that  although a variety of tools are available to help measure the potential  performance outcomes, such as those that measure the costs and benefits  of transportation projects, such potential outcomes often do not drive  investment decisions, as many political and other factors influence project  selections. For example, the law in one state requires that most highway  funds, including federal funds, be distributed equally across all of the  state's congressional districts. Consequently, the structure of the federal- aid highway program provides no way to measure how funding provided to  the states is being used to accomplish particular outcomes, such as  reducing congestion or improving safety, and little assurance that projects  most likely to accomplish goals and outcome measures articulated by DOT  will be funded. The absence of such a link may make it more difficult for  FHWA to define its role, the purpose of its oversight, and what its oversight  is designed to accomplish.", "In August 2004, we reported that policy makers may wish to consider  realigning the federal-aid highway program's design, structure, and funding  formulas to take into account the program\u2019s goals and to include greater  performance and outcome oriented features. We also said that such  consideration could include the appropriate roles of the federal and state  governments, including what type of administrative structure for  overseeing the federal-aid highway program would best ensure that the  performance goals are measured and accomplished.

This partnership approach recognizes that states  select, plan, and build projects, while FHWA ensures that federal laws and  other requirements are followed by maintaining a close, hands-on  involvement with state transportation agencies in delivering projects.  FHWA and state officials believe that over the years this partnership has  helped to build trust and respect between state transportation agencies and  FHWA and ensure that priorities such as safety and the environment are  addressed, and has resulted in projects being built more economically and  efficiently.", "However, there is a potential down side to this partnership approach. When  a project overseer becomes an active partner in a project, an arms-length,  independent perspective can be lost. In fact, FHWA\u2019s partnership approach  to project oversight has failed in the past. FHWA had an oversight manager  on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project in Boston, Massachusetts, a project  that experienced widely-reported cost increases, growing from around $2.3  billion in the mid-1980s to almost $15 billion by 2004. In March 2000, an  FHWA task force charged with reviewing FHWA\u2019s oversight of the project  found that FHWA had been caught unaware earlier that year when the state  revealed an estimated $1.4 billion cost increase. The task force attributed  this to FHWA\u2019s over reliance on trust between itself and the state, reporting  that FHWA\u2019s partnership approach failed to achieve independent and  critical oversight of the project.", "FHWA officials acknowledged that independence is critical to effective  oversight and also acknowledged the need to closely monitor the  performance and independence of their project oversight managers on an  ongoing basis. However balancing the role of overseer and partner can be  difficult. In one state we visited, the division\u2019s oversight manager for a  major project had business cards that identified him as a member of the  state\u2019s project team\u2014with the project\u2019s logo, Website, and e-mail address  printed on the card\u2014rather than as a federal employee. Only his position  title on the card, \u201cFHWA Project Administrator,\u201d identified him as an FHWA  employee, rather than as a state employee.

For example, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) uses competitively  selected engineering firms as oversight contractors to monitor major mass  transit projects costing over $100 million. During the project\u2019s design, the  contractor reviews the grantee\u2019s plan for managing the project and  determines whether the grantee has the technical capability to complete  the project. Once FTA approves the plan, the contractor monitors the  project to determine whether it is progressing on time, within budget, and  according to plan. In prior work, we noted that FTA\u2019s project management  oversight program benefited both the agency and the grantees carrying out  the projects. As another example, DOT established a Joint Program Office  to help carry out the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation  Act Program, which provides credit assistance to states and other project  sponsors for surface transportation projects.

Among the  challenges agencies face are the need to improve their ability to acquire,  develop, and retain talent, and the need to better and more fully integrate  these and other human capital efforts with agencies\u2019 missions and program  goals.", "For FHWA, this government wide challenge manifests itself in a number of  ways, including the need to transform its workforce and culture to meet its  evolving mission. FHWA\u2019s workforce partnered with the states to build the  Interstate Highway System from 1956 into the 1990s. FHWA needed  engineering skills to perform tasks, such as detailed reviews of design  plans and inspections of construction progress to ensure that national  uniformity in terms of design and safety was established throughout the  interstate system. These skills were especially important because,  according to FHWA and state officials, state transportation agencies did  not have the equivalent capability to do the job at that time. In recent years  Congress has recognized the increased capacity of state transportation  agencies and increasingly delegated approval authorities to the states,  including the authority over design and construction decisions for most  projects. As a consequence, FHWA\u2019s oversight role and mission have  evolved to include, for example, greater reliance on broad reviews of state  management processes.", "As FHWA\u2019s oversight role and mission evolves, FHWA faces the challenge  of transforming its workforce and culture to evolve with this role and  mission. In our discussions with FHWA field staff, we noted reluctance  among some FHWA staff to focus on these broader reviews that FHWA  increasingly relies on because they see these as less important than the  traditional tasks of reviewing design plans and inspecting the progress of  construction. Division office officials in two states we visited told us that  change has been an issue for its more tenured staff. For example, the  Administrator at one office had begun to hire staff with a variety of skills,  while officials at the other office saw a need for more specialists, including  staff with financial expertise. Officials also said some staff have resisted  doing process reviews because they see it as functioning as auditors rather  than as partners with the state in delivering projects, which is how they  prefer to be seen. Overcoming these challenges will become even more  important in the years ahead should proposed legislation increasing  FHWA\u2019s oversight responsibilities be enacted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA\u2019s Perception of Conflicting Legislative Direction on Oversight Role and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["In 2001, a FHWA task force concluded that changes in the agency\u2019 s  oversight role mandated by highway program authorizations enacted in  1991 and 1998 had resulted in internal confusion and wide variation in  interpretations by FHWA personnel covering the agency\u2019s roles and  responsibilities in overseeing projects. In 2002, we reported that FHWA  could not say whether it had resolved the internal confusion and variations  in interpretations of the agency\u2019s oversight role identified by the task  force.", "During our review we found that some confusion continues, as some of the  FHWA personnel we spoke to expressed the view that Congress has sent  mixed messages about the extent to which it would like to see FHWA  oversee projects. According to some division and headquarters FHWA  officials, federal laws over the years have required FHWA to withdraw from  direct oversight of most projects, while at the same time, legislation has  increased the oversight requirements for major projects, resulting in mixed  signals. Changes that were proposed by DOT and passed by the House and  the Senate in 2004 but not enacted before the adjournment of the 108th  Congress could, if reintroduced and enacted by the 109th Congress, help  clarify FHWA staff\u2019s perception of their oversight role by, for example,  mandating reviews of state financial system, developing cost estimating  standards, and cascading requirements for major projects to other projects.  Enactment of these provisions would also provide Congress the  opportunity to provide a more detailed explanation of and purposes for  these provisions regarding FHWA\u2019s role versus the states\u2019 role in overseeing  cost and schedule performance of federal-aid highway projects in the  legislative history accompanying the reauthorization bill.

From our review of these reports and analyses, we  identified four best practices that are particularly applicable to FHWA\u2019s  oversight efforts and that FHWA officials and decision makers can consider  to help effectively oversee large infrastructure projects and states\u2019 financial  and management processes. While some of these best practices are  beginning to be reflected in FHWA\u2019s activities, as a whole, they could  provide a framework for moving to a comprehensive approach to project  oversight.

If an  agency relies only on general goals to guide its efforts, the agency will not  have any way of determining whether it achieves those goals since it has  not first identified a way to quantify or measure the outcome. Once these  goals are established, agencies should communicate these goals down to  all levels of the agency. One way to ensure that the goals are communicated  effectively is to link the agency\u2019s day-to-day activities to these goals. Our  1998 report on leading practices in capital decision-making added that clear  communication of an organization\u2019s vision and goals is a prerequisite for  success.

Benchmarking  compares an internal agency process with those of private and public  organizations that are thought to be the best in their fields.

In 2000, we reported that agencies conducting program evaluations  improved their measurement of program performance or understanding of  performance and how it might be improved.

Agencies  can also evaluate the planning and procurement process to determine  whether a project accurately predicted the desired benefits 3 to 12 months  after it has become operational.

Most  significantly, FHWA has established, for the first time, goals and measures  that clearly make containing project costs and schedules an integral part of  how FHWA conducts its oversight.", "However, despite promising results, FHWA\u2019s efforts have also had  limitations. FHWA still lacks a comprehensive approach to ensuring that its  oversight of federal-aid highway projects supports the efficient and  effective use of federal funds. A comprehensive approach would avail itself  of best practices and would include (1) goals and outcome measures with  activities and performance expectations set for its staff that are linked to  these goals and measures; (2) an overall plan for FHWA\u2019s oversight  initiatives and activities that responds to past concerns raised about its  program and is tied to its goals and measures; (3) workforce planning  efforts that support the goals, measures, and overall plan; (4) centrally  defined roles and responsibilities for key staff, such as oversight managers  for major projects; and (5) the capability to track and measure costs over  the life of projects in order to identify problems, help target resources, and  transfer lessons learned. Without such a comprehensive approach, FHWA  cannot ensure that its varied activities are resulting in tangible  improvements in the quality of its oversight and in the performance of  federal-aid projects. Furthermore, without a comprehensive approach,  FHWA is not able to articulate what it wants its oversight to accomplish,  the composition of its workforce to accomplish it, and how it will measure  whether its efforts have or have not been successful. Thus, it is limited in  its ability to ensure that its oversight efforts are meeting its organizational  goals, that these efforts address concerns that have been raised, and that  they result in more effective and efficient use of federal funds.", "Although broader questions exist about the structure of the federal-aid  highway program and the role of FHWA, the agency will face considerable  increases in its oversight responsibilities in the years ahead, particularly if  the proposals made by DOT and considered by Congress become law.  Given the limitations present today, questions exist about the ability of  FHWA to effectively absorb these new responsibilities and to improve its  oversight of the federal-aid highway program in the years ahead.
