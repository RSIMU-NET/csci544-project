Most students were Department of Defense (DOD) command-sponsored, military or civilian dependents for whom DODDS is required by law to provide a free public education in overseas areas, and most were enrolled as space-required students. About 6 percent, or 5,489 students, were enrolled as space-available students\u2014that is, dependents who were not command sponsored and thus not eligible for space-required enrollment, but were allowed to enroll if space was available. About 3,000 of these space-available students paid tuition, while the other 2,500 attended tuition free.", "As part of our continuing review of DODDS, as directed by the Conference Report accompanying the 1994 Defense Authorization Act, we were asked to provide information on educating DOD dependents overseas. More specifically, we focused our efforts on (1) reviewing legislation that establishes eligibility and authorizes funding for students to enroll in DODDS as space-available, (2) identifying the number of students enrolled as space-available and their locations, and (3) explaining the circumstances surrounding high space-available enrollments in some schools. To do this work, we reviewed the law and DOD regulations pertaining to eligibility criteria and funding for enrolling students in DODDS on a space-available basis and analyzed statistical data on DODDS\u2019 total student enrollments for school year 1994-95. We also interviewed officials at DODDS headquarters, two regional offices, and nine district offices, and visited selected schools to clarify policies and procedures for enrolling students on a space-available basis in those schools.

DODDS is a support organization within DOD whose mission is to educate every child authorized transportation overseas by DOD regardless of location or needs of the child. Due to the downsizing of the military overseas, DODDS enrollments have decreased from 160,000 for school year 1990-91 to 88,569 for school year 1994-95, and the number of DODDS schools decreased from 270 to 191. DODDS elementary and secondary schools are located in 14 countries worldwide and are administered by three regions and 12 district offices.", "The DODDS schools we visited were, indeed, American schools overseas. The facilities, resources, teachers, and curriculum were what one would find in a typical American school in the states. In addition, because the schools were located on military bases, they were very much a part of the community in which they were located. Students who were overseas on unaccompanied tours could not live in base housing and therefore the school was a link to the base\u2014and American\u2014community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligibility and Funding for Space-Available Students", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense has authority, granted by Public Law 95-561, to allow classes or categories of students, other than space-required students, to enroll in DODDS. The Secretary may also establish priorities among such classes, waive the tuition, and issue other regulations as deemed necessary. No limit has been established for the number of space-available children who can be enrolled in DODDS, and no regulatory criteria have been established on how space-available is to be determined. However, the July 29, 1985, Conference Report instructed DOD not to include the cost of educating tuition-free, space-available students in its budget requests."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility Categories and Priorities Have Been Defined", "paragraphs": ["Section 1402 of Public Law 95-561, which created DODDS, defines a dependent as any minor who has not completed secondary school; who is the child, stepchild, adopted child, ward, or spouse of a sponsor, or who is a resident in the household of a sponsor who legally stands in place of parents to the minor; and who receives one-half or more of his or her support from this sponsor. DOD regulations define \u201cspace-available\u201d as student accommodations that may be made available in DODDS schools if the Director of DODDS or a designee determines that a school has adequate staff and other resources to permit the enrollment of nonspace-required students.", "DOD regulations establish categories of space-available students. All space-available children fall into the two broad categories of tuition-paying or tuition-free. Tuition-paying students can be either federally connected, such as dependents of State Department or other U.S. government agency sponsors, or nonfederally connected, including dependents of retired military or foreign national sponsors. Ninety-six percent of tuition-free, space-available students are the dependents of DOD military or civilian sponsors who are not authorized government transportation and housing overseas for their dependents. The remaining 4 percent fall into the category of special cases and include students whose sponsors died while on active duty. The designation \u201ctuition-free\u201d for the class of students with sponsors on unaccompanied tours was made by the Director of DODDS in 1982. DODDS classified and prioritized space-available students within the categories specified in the regulations as shown:", "Tuition-paying, federally connected: Sponsors employed by U.S. government agencies, interests, and foreign services.", "Tuition-paying, nonfederally connected: Sponsors are U.S. citizens, foreign nationals, or retired military.", "Tuition-free: Sponsors are DOD military or civilians overseas, but their dependents are not authorized overseas.", "For a more detailed explanation of these classifications, see appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Admissions Policies and Practices", "paragraphs": ["Neither the statute nor regulations address the issue of how available space is to be determined in schools. Our interviews showed that, in practice, the school principal usually determines whether space is available, using pupil-teacher ratios by grade level as criteria. With the exception of those in Korea, the schools we visited were generally able to meet the demand for space-available enrollments. Military drawdowns in Europe have enabled the schools to easily accommodate those few students who applied for admission. DODDS schools in Japan and Okinawa were often already overcrowded with space-required students, but the demand for space-available enrollment was also low. We were told the high cost of living in these areas often prohibits service personnel from bringing their families unless they have approved housing. In addition, the military services\u2019 policies are to send members to these locations on accompanied tours, which classifies their children as space-required in the schools. Also, other private schools are available in these areas.", "In Korea, however, the situation is different. The military commanders there told us that because many tours require the service members to be stationed in dangerous locations without accommodations for dependents, about 90 percent of the U.S. military personnel in Korea are on unaccompanied tours. Nevertheless, because the cost of living is very low, it is feasible for a service member to support dependents on the local economy. This occurs more commonly in those families where the spouse is a Korean national. In addition, private schools in Korea are expensive, and Korean law prohibits American dependents from attending Korean public schools. As a result, many of these children, for whom there is no available space in DODDS schools, do not attend any school.", "In Korea, three of the six DODDS schools have space-available, tuition-free enrollments ranging from 180 to 220 students\u201414 to 34 percent of total school enrollments. DODDS officials told us they enrolled as many students as possible in Korea because these children are without practical alternatives. Currently, there is no count of children on unaccompanied tours, but base officials estimate there are hundreds and possibly thousands. Because of the large number of children in Korea on unaccompanied tours who are not attending any school at all, military commanders told us that dealing with serious behavior problems such as vandalism, theft, and drug abuse takes up an increasing amount of the post commanders\u2019 time. Although the commander must take over these discipline problems from the Korean police, the commander has no direct authority over the civilian dependents\u2014post commander authority lies only over the military sponsor. In addition to the problems that occur in Korea, the commanders feel a social responsibility because children sent back to the United States who have missed several years of school will likely have problems in the future. For example, the command found one 14-year-old dependent who had not attended school for 7 years. The sponsor was subsequently ordered to return to the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounting for Space-Available Students in the Budgeting Process", "paragraphs": ["The July 1985 Conference Report instructed DOD to treat differently the two classes of space-available students in its budgeting process. This report states that DOD is allowed to take into account the cost of additional teachers, supplies, and other resources, except for construction of facilities, for tuition-paying students in its request for funds. DOD may not, however, take into account the extra costs for educating the tuition-free, space-available children. Since there is no limit to the number of space-available children who may be enrolled in the schools, this budgeting process would allow for as many space-available, tuition-paying children as would apply, without authorizing new facilities, but would limit the number of tuition-free students to a true space-available criterion. In fact, however, DOD does take into account the extra costs for educating space-available, tuition-free students in requesting funds, because it estimates its costs on the basis of the total student population of the previous year, including the space-available, tuition-free students. Requiring these students to pay tuition would produce a savings of between $21 million and $23 million. However, some solution to the difficult situation in Korea would have to be achieved in conjunction with enforcing such a requirement. Otherwise, realizing these savings would most likely keep even more children from attending school."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Enrollments by Category", "paragraphs": ["According to the DODDS Student Information Management System (SIMS), for school year 1994-95 DODDS enrolled 88,569 students in 191 schools in 14 countries worldwide.

The Panama Region, however, has 22.3 percent space-available enrollment primarily due to a higher number of tuition-free dependents of DOD civilians. However, as stated earlier, in 1999, the schools in Panama will be turned over to Panama for operation, according to the terms of the Panama Treaty.

DODDS provided the following explanations.", "Bahrain: The Bahrain school was established by DOD in the late 1970s. It has 958 students, of which 726 are space-available (75.8 percent). Bahrain was and still is a strategic area for U.S. military in the Persian Gulf region. In exchange for the rights for the U.S. Navy to port its ships in Bahrain, the Bahrain government asked DOD to establish and operate an American school for dependents of Bahrain government officials. The establishment of the school was cleared through both the State Department and DOD.", "Bonn: The Bonn elementary school has a total enrollment of 163 students, of which 82.2 percent (134 students) are space-available, and the high school has 259 students, of which 78.8 percent (204 students) are space-available. These schools were established before DODDS was created, when the DOD schools were still the responsibility of the individual military services. The State Department asked DOD to establish the schools for the large numbers of State Department dependents located in Bonn, formerly the capital of West Germany, when Germany was a divided nation. The schools have remained open, despite the military drawdown in the area, to continue educating State Department and other U.S. government agencies\u2019 dependents remaining in Bonn since Germany\u2019s reunification.", "Ankara: Because the military is gradually moving out of the area, the ratio between space-required and space-available students has changed greatly in Ankara in the past few years. As of September 1994, the enrollment was 190 students, of which 65 percent (124 students) were space-available. Currently, the State Department relies on the DODDS school because there are no alternative English-speaking schools available.", "In addition to these four schools, seven schools\u2014three in the European Region and four in the Pacific Region\u2014have space-available enrollments of 18 to 36 percent. Nearly two-thirds of these students are tuition-paying, which allows DODDS to include them in the budget process, thus allowing them space. Almost all of the remaining tuition-free students are in schools in Korea, where, as we discussed, DODDS attempts to enroll as many students as possible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Space-available enrollments in DODDS schools are generally very low and do not present a problem for the school systems. However, in Korea a problem exists at several levels\u2014at the program, military command, and social levels. In trying to attend to the education of dependents on unaccompanied tours, DODDS has enrolled a relatively large number of these children.", "First, at the program level, DODDS has not followed the stipulations of Conference Report 99-235, which prohibit DOD from requesting funds for teachers and resources to educate space-available, tuition-free students. However, the situation is not straightforward. If DODDS does not include these students in its budget, more students will probably do without an education in Korea because DODDS will receive less funding.", "Second, at the local military command level, the many children who do not attend school may require increased time and resources to address growing behavior problems. The command does not have the authority to keep noncommand-sponsored dependents out of Korea because it only has authority over the actions of the sponsor, not the civilian dependents. Finally, on a social level, leaving children uneducated raises a social and ethical dilemma for DODDS and the military. Sending children back to the United States after they have missed years of schooling places them at an educational disadvantage when they do return to school.", "Alternative solutions exist, however, such as (1) allowing DODDS to request resources in special situations, such as that in Korea, for space-available, tuition-free students, or (2) having the military take strong measures to discourage noncommand-sponsored dependents in areas such as Korea.
