For many years, GAO and others have reported on inaccuracies in agencies' reporting of A&AS obligations. This report follows up on GAO's past work, pursuant to the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization Act. GAO assessed (1) whether reported A&AS obligations are accurate or used for management purposes and (2) the extent to which A&AS contracts are used for recurring services and for longer than 5 years and the contract types and vehicles used. GAO analyzed legislative history and reviewed 334 randomly selected contract files across 10 agencies, the results of which are generalizable to locations visited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agencies' reported A&AS obligations are inaccurate to the point of being meaningless and are not used for management purposes. GAO found a range of factors that contribute to significant inaccuracies in these data. Almost 20 percent of the 334 contract actions GAO reviewed were erroneously identified as A&AS, including services such as fitness center maintenance and telecommunications cabling installation. Agency officials frequently cited the broad nature of the A&AS definition as a problem. Agencies GAO reviewed generally encountered challenges in tying reported A&AS obligations to their corresponding contracts because of the lack of integration of procurement and budget data systems. Agency and OMB officials unanimously told GAO they do not use reported A&AS obligations for management or other purposes. Acquisition officials said they oversee their A&AS contracts, as they do their other professional services contracts, with established contract management procedures. Reflecting the lack of a clear distinction between A&AS and general professional services contracts, DOD retracted its A&AS directive and replaced it with general service contracting guidance in 2004. Even as far back as 1996, a code to specifically designate A&AS contracts was removed from the Federal Procurement Data System, the government's procurement information system. Agencies frequently awarded contracts for A&AS on a recurring basis and to the same contractor. Overall 63 percent of the A&AS contract actions were issued on other than a sole-source basis. Most task order contracts reviewed met the A&AS statutory period of performance limit of 5 years; but 2 exceeded and 10 had the potential (if options were exercised) to exceed this limit. Agencies used various contract types and vehicles to procure A&AS. Almost half of the actions GAO reviewed were time-and-materials, and over 40 percent were under interagency vehicles, primarily orders under the General Services Administration's schedule contracts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, the federal government spends billions of dollars to procure  goods and services from private contractors, with a growing proportion  related to services. Advisory and assistance services (A&AS), previously  referred to as consultant services are contracted services intended to be  used by federal agencies to acquire three broad areas of services:  management and professional support; studies, analyses, and evaluations;  and engineering and technical services. Since 1994, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) has been required by law to collect and  report obligations for A&AS in the President\u2019s budget. However,  Congress\u2019s initial intent behind this requirement is not clear.", "Our past work and that of other organizations have highlighted long- standing challenges agencies face in identifying and reporting their A&AS  spending. For example, a 1988 OMB report on the government\u2019s use of  consulting services concluded that the definitions were overly broad and  complex and subject to varying interpretations. In 1990, we reported that  agencies had no common understanding of how to interpret the definition  of what is now called A&AS. In 1996, the President\u2019s Council on Integrity  and Efficiency reported that, governmentwide, agency inspectors general  found inaccuracies in reporting on their A&AS contracts because of  unclear guidance on what constituted such services and how they should  be reported. Similarly, in 2001, we reported that the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) persistent deficiencies in accurately reporting its  obligations under these contracts were due in part to unclear definitions,  lack of consistency in identifying and reporting, and inadequate  accounting systems used to track such expenditures.", "The ordering period for A&AS task order contracts has been limited to 5  years, but in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2007, Congress authorized agencies to extend this period up to  10 years if certain determinations were made. Before agencies could take  advantage of the 10-year ordering period authority, DOD and the Office of  Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) had to submit a report to certain  congressional committees by April 1, 2007.  On March 21, 2008, the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Technology, submitted letters  to Congress stating that the department was unable to comply with the  required submission date for the report because the federal procurement  data system does not identify A&AS, requiring a slow and cumbersome  manual data call across DOD.  The letters note that the lack of the waiver  authority has had no impact on DOD\u2019s acquisition of services. The  Director, Defense Procurement, Acquisition Policy, and Strategic Sourcing  has also notified DOD components that, because the required submission  date for the report to Congress was not met, no waivers may be issued to  extend task order contracts for A&AS.  Similarly, on March 26, 2008, the  Administrator of OFPP submitted letters to Congress stating that it was  unable to comply with the required submission date for the report because  it could not identify the requested information on A&AS contracts from  the federal procurement data system and the federal budget data system.   OFPP added that it was unable to collect the requested information from  surveying civilian agencies.  OFPP notified agencies that because the  information was not available to report to Congress, they cannot issue  waivers to extend task order contracts for A&AS.  The Act also directed us  to report on the federal government\u2019s use of contracts for A&AS. We  provided briefings to congressional committees on our work to meet that  mandate in the fall of 2007 and agreed to issue a follow-on report on  agencies\u2019 reporting and use of A&AS. For DOD and selected civilian  agencies, we (1) assessed whether reported obligations for A&AS were  accurate or used for management purposes and (2) identified the extent to  which they are used for recurring services and periods greater than 5 years  as well as the contract types and vehicles used.", "To perform our work, we reviewed the legislative history of contracted  consulting services and A&AS, analyzed relevant public laws, pertinent  sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and federal A&AS  budget reporting requirements in OMB\u2019s Circular A-11, Preparation,  Submission, and Execution of the Budget. We also examined our related  prior work, inspectors general audit reports, and reports from other  organizations. Because contracts for A&AS are not identified as such in  the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), the  federal government\u2019s procurement information system, we queried OMB\u2019s  MAX A-11 budget data system to determine the scope of agencies for our  review. We identified the seven federal departments with the largest  average reported A&AS obligations for fiscal years 2002 to 2006 (the  departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland  Security, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Treasury, and Veterans  Affairs (VA)). Based on our analysis of the reported obligations and  discussions with agency officials, we narrowed our scope to the  departments that could provide us with a list of the A&AS contracts that  comprised their reported obligations in fiscal year 2006. HUD and VA were  unable to do so, so we excluded them from our detailed contract file  review. Next, we narrowed our scope to the major agencies or  components (within the 5 departments) that had the largest reported  overall obligations on service contracts, based on FPDS-NG data, and that  could provide us with a list of A&AS contracts for fiscal year 2006. This  step led to the Department of the Army\u2019s dropping out of our file review  sample, as it could not identify A&AS contracts. In all, we conducted in- depth reviews of 334 randomly selected contract actions out of the 6,373  contracts that the 10 major agencies within our review identified as  A&AS. The results of our agency-specific contract file reviews are  generalizable to the particular agency location where we reviewed  contract files. Table 1 shows the agencies included in our review.", "We also interviewed agency officials on their management policies for and  use of A&AS and obtained agency-specific service contracting guidance  from agency procurement, program, and budget officials. We conducted  this performance audit from January 2007 to February 2008 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

These provisions limit the ordering period of A&AS task  order contracts to periods of no more than 5 years, but authorize the use  of a 6-month sole-source extension in certain circumstances. Both  provisions also indicate a preference for multiple awards. Also, in 1995,  the FAR was amended to include the broad statutory definition of A&AS  and to include certain examples of A&AS for which agencies may contract  when essential to their mission. These include obtaining outside points of  view to avoid too limited judgment on critical issues and obtaining the  opinions, special knowledge, or skills of noted experts. The FAR also  includes services for which A&AS are not to be used, such as to    perform work of a policy, decision-making, or managerial nature that is  the direct responsibility of agency officials;    bypass or undermine personnel ceilings, pay limitations, or competitive  employment procedures;    contract on a preferential basis to former government employees; or    obtain professional or technical advice that is readily available within  the agency or another federal agency.", "An additional limitation pertaining to A&AS is that agencies are not to hire  contractors to conduct evaluations or analyses of any aspect of a proposal  submitted for an initial contract award unless the agency makes a written  determination that government personnel (from the requesting agency or  from any other agency) with adequate training and capabilities to perform  the required proposal evaluation are not readily available.", "Table 2 portrays a time line of key events related to A&AS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Relevant Service Contracting Policies and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is increasingly relying on private entities to  provide a wide range of services; federal spending on services represented  over 60 percent of total contract spending governmentwide in 2006.

An organizational conflict of interest occurs under a service  contract when the objectivity of a government contractor is impaired  or the contractor has an unfair advantage over others.

Officials added that given the extensive scope  of the definition, making distinctions between what constitutes having a  contractor provide an advisory or consultative-type service versus directly  performing established services to assist an agency is often difficult. For  example, the definitions cover functions ranging from contracts for  consultants to provide very specific \u201cexpert opinions\u201d to more generic  contracts for \u201cassistance\u201d in areas such as management and professional  support and engineering and technical services.", "We found misidentified contracts in seven of the 10 agencies where we  performed contract file reviews.

As such, we could not definitively determine  whether the agency misidentified the contract actions.", "Over the years, certain activities have been excluded from civilian and  defense reporting of A&AS, exclusions that further complicates agency  efforts to identify such contracts for budget reporting. These exclusions  are set forth in the FAR, OMB Circular A-11, and in DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation. However, the Circular A-11 exclusions are more  extensive than those in the FAR, and DOD has 14 exclusions, such as  initial training supporting weapons system procurement.  See appendix III  for a full list of civilian and defense exclusions to A&AS reporting. Further,  DOD canceled its A&AS directive in 2004, which listed these 14 exclusions,  but did not make conforming changes to its financial management  regulation\u2014which still lists them.

It  reported its fiscal year 2006 obligations for A&AS based on what it  reported for fiscal year 2005 because officials did not want to conduct the  manually intensive data call to obtain needed information. Air Force  officials said they reduced their reported fiscal year 2005 data based on  broader budget reductions made by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

That the reporting has not provided Congress with accurate or  meaningful information has been identified as a problem for over 20 years.  From an agency perspective, the broad definition of A&AS serves little  utility for management or accountability purposes, as such contracts are  not clearly distinguishable from other professional support service  contracts either in policy or practice. The broad definition of A&AS,  coupled with the fact that reported obligations are not being used for  management or oversight purposes, calls into question the need to  continue the requirement as it currently stands. Further, while OMB\u2019s  consideration of re-implementing a field in FPDS-NG for A&AS contracts  may help provide agency procurement officials and others with additional  insight on their obligations, this action will be only marginally beneficial  without an overarching clarification of the current broad definition of  A&AS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To address the long-standing problems agencies face in reporting A&AS  obligations, Congress should consider re-evaluating the need for agencies  to report A&AS funding separately to OMB, recognizing that contracts for  A&AS are not managed any differently than other contracts for  professional management support. If insights into A&AS contracts are  desired, Congress should consider clarifying the statutory definition of  A&AS to more explicitly address congressional concerns related to these  types of contracts and require the Administrator of  OFPP to reinstate data  collection on contracts for A&AS in FPDS-NG using the revised definition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the  Department of the Treasury, which agreed with our findings.

To establish the agencies to include in the contract  file review, we first obtained lists of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act  department level obligations reported to the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB)\u2014as reflected in OMB\u2019s MAX A-11 data entry system\u2014from  fiscal years 2002 through 2006. We identified the 7 departments that had  the highest average reported A&AS obligations during this 5-year period:    Department of Defense    Department of Energy    Department of Health and Human Services    Department of Homeland Security    Department of Housing and Urban Development    Department of the Treasury    Department of Veterans Affairs  From that point, through analysis of department data and discussions with  agency officials, we identified those departments that were able to provide  us with a list of the fiscal year 2006 contracts that comprised their  reported 2006 A&AS obligations to OMB. Two departments\u2014Housing and  Urban Development and Veterans Affairs\u2013could not provide us with such a  list and therefore were not part of our contract file review. Next, through  analysis of agency data on overall service contracts, as captured in the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and  further discussions with agency officials, we identified the major agencies  or components within the 5 remaining departments that could provide us  with a list of contracts comprising these reported obligations. The  Department of the Army dropped out of our file review sample at this  point, as it could not provide us with a list of A&AS contracts. Table 5  shows the locations where we did our work, including those where we  could not perform a file review.", "For our onsite file review, we generated a statistical random sample of 334  contract actions out of the 6,373 contracts that the 10 major agencies  within our review identified as A&AS.  We performed the file reviews  using an electronic data collection instrument and onsite source  verification. For instances where the contract file review results warranted  follow-up with the agency, we requested and received additional  information from agency officials, which we analyzed and incorporated  into our final results where appropriate. The results of our agency-specific  contract file reviews are generalizable to the particular agency location  where we reviewed contract files. Table 6 depicts the number of contract  actions we reviewed at each agency.", "To assess whether reported A&AS obligations are accurate or used for  management purposes, we analyzed pertinent sections of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation and OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation,  Submission, and Execution of the Budget, requirements for contracted  A&AS. We reviewed prior GAO, inspectors general, and other audit agency  reports. We also collected and reviewed existing agency-specific service  contracting guidance, reviewed obligation data from the OMB MAX A-11  data entry system, and performed our contract file reviews at selected  agencies. We conducted a detailed review of congressional and other  actions regarding consulting services and A&AS over time. We also  interviewed agency procurement and budget officials to discern their  processes and procedures for reporting A&AS obligations to OMB and  discussed the accuracy and usefulness of reported A&AS obligations with  officials from OMB and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. Because  the focus of this report was the government\u2019s budget reporting of A&AS  obligations, we did not address compliance with various A&AS-related  provisions, such as the requirement for multiple awards for A&AS task  order contracts (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304b(e) and 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253i(e) and those in 7  U.S.C. \u00a7 2207a, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2399(e), or 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 419. We also did not  assess compliance with a requirement under federal appropriations law  that agencies must confirm that their reported obligations were certified  by officials designated by the agency head.", "We relied on OMB\u2019s MAX database system to analyze A&AS obligations  because FPDS-NG, which is used to collect, develop, and disseminate  procurement data from executive agencies, does not distinguish A&AS  contract actions and their associated obligations. Because there was no  direct denotation for A&AS contract actions within FPDS-NG, we  attempted to identify federal product and service codes that relate to  A&AS using the database system, but found, through outreach with agency  officials, a wide range of product and service codes\u2014from six to over  400\u2014that were identified as having the potential to include A&AS contract  actions (that is, while these product and service codes may involve A&AS,  they also may not). Because of the wide range of product and service  codes that could potentially include A&AS, we were unable to determine,  through an analysis of contract actions reported in FPDS-NG, the extent to  which A&AS contract actions may have been underreported.", "To assess the extent to which agencies use A&AS to meet recurring  requirements and the regularity with which the recurring contract actions  are awarded to the same contractor for the follow-on work, we analyzed  data obtained from our contract file reviews and held discussions with  agency officials. For our review, we considered a \u201crecurring contract  action\u201d to be an action for which there was evidence that a contract action  for similar services existed immediately prior to the contract action we  reviewed. Likewise, we considered \u201csame contractor\u201d as a contractor that  had been issued or awarded a contract action for the same or similar  A&AS immediately prior to the action we reviewed. Where we could not  determine through our file review the status of prior contract actions or  could not identify the prior contractor, we asked agency officials for  additional information, which we incorporated into our final results where  appropriate.", "Similar to our activities related to recurring contract actions, we reviewed  information from agency interviews and contract file review data to assess  the frequency with which task order contracts for A&AS exceeded or had  the potential to exceed a 5-year period of performance. In particular, our  contract file review enabled us to document the length of contracts and to  evaluate the extent to which the statutory period of performance  limitations for A&AS were met. \u201cPeriod of performance\u201d is the total  potential length of a task order contract with all options or award terms  exercised by the agency. Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304b and 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253i limit  the total period of performance for A&AS task order contracts to 5 years,  with the possibility of an extension of no longer than 6 months for  continuation of services when extenuating circumstances exist. For any  contract actions identified as exceeding or having the potential to exceed  the 5-year period of performance limitation, we requested and received  agencies\u2019 explanations for exceeding 5 years and incorporated their  responses into our final results.", "To evaluate what contract types and vehicles are used by agencies to  acquire A&AS, we analyzed our contract file review data and information  from our interviews with agency officials. In particular, our contract file  review findings enabled us to analyze the contract types used by agencies  to procure A&AS, the degree of interagency contracting for A&AS, and the  level of competition for A&AS contract actions. To determine whether or  not the action was issued or awarded using competition, we assessed  whether the agency contracting officials had prepared a justification and  approval for a sole-source action or whether documentation supporting a  competitive process was in the contract file. Our interviews with agency  officials provided additional information concerning agency-specific A&AS  contracting practices that affect the contract type, interagency use, and  extent of competition.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2007 to February 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
