CMS oversight of Part D sponsors' fraud and abuse programs has been limited. To date, CMS's activities have been limited to the review and approval of sponsors' fraud and abuse program plans submitted as part of the initial Part D applications. For example, CMS officials reported that they worked with sponsors to help them develop fraud and abuse program plans that met the agency's compliance plan requirements and recommendations specific to fraud and abuse. However, CMS has not conducted oversight to assess Part D sponsors' implementation of fraud and abuse programs.

CMS contracts with  private companies\u2014such as health insurance companies and pharmacy  benefit managers\u2014to serve as Part D sponsors and administer the Part D  prescription drug benefit plans. About 24 million individuals were  enrolled in Medicare Part D as of January 2007 and estimated benefit  expenditures were $39 billion in calendar year 2007. We and others have  reported that the size, nature, and complexity of the Part D program make  it a particular risk for fraud, waste, and abuse. The Medicare program as a  whole, including Part D, is vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Due in  part to this vulnerability, we have designated Medicare as a high risk  program since 1990.", "To protect beneficiaries and the fiscal integrity of the Medicare program,  the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA), which established the Part D program, requires all Part D  sponsors to have programs to safeguard Part D from fraud, waste, and  abuse. Accordingly, on January 28, 2005, CMS issued regulations  requiring that sponsors have a comprehensive compliance plan that  includes a program to control fraud, waste, and abuse. These regulations  established required elements within comprehensive compliance plans. In  April 2006, CMS issued guidance through its Part D Prescription Drug  Benefit Manual; chapter 9 of the Manual contained further interpretation  and guidelines that include recommended measures for how Part D  sponsors should address fraud, waste, and abuse for Part D in each of the  required compliance plan elements. In order to fulfill statutory and  regulatory requirements regarding programs to control fraud, waste, and  abuse, Part D sponsors must develop and implement a compliance plan  detailing their fraud and abuse program. The compliance plan, which must  be approved by CMS, articulates policies, processes, and procedures for  Part D sponsors to detect, correct, and prevent fraud, waste and abuse.  Implementation of a compliance plan includes conducting the activities  described in the plan and developing comprehensive written procedures  for activities referenced in the plan.", "CMS\u2019s required compliance plan elements and the related recommended  measures for a fraud and abuse program specific to Part D include the  following:  1.  A sponsor\u2019s compliance plan must include written policies,  procedures, and standards of conduct.  2.  A sponsor\u2019s compliance plan must designate a compliance officer and  a compliance committee that are accountable to senior management.  3.  A sponsor\u2019s compliance plan must include effective training and  education pertaining to fraud, waste, and abuse for the organization\u2019s  employees and contractors. A Part D sponsor may contract some of its  Part D responsibilities to a third party; however, the Part D sponsor is  ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with required  elements, including those pertaining to education and training.  Contractors include first-tier, downstream, and related entities.  4.  A sponsor\u2019s compliance plan must include effective lines of  communication that should include a confidential or anonymous  mechanism, such as a hotline, to receive compliance questions and  reports of fraud, waste, or abuse.  5.  A sponsor\u2019s compliance plan must have well-publicized disciplinary  guidelines through which sponsors must enforce standards.  6.  A sponsor\u2019s compliance plan must include effective internal  monitoring and auditing procedures which should include the  development and implementation of procedures that are intended to  protect Part D from fraud, waste, and abuse, including monitoring and  auditing of contractors.  7.

Specifically, this report examines (1) the extent to which certain Part D  sponsors implemented programs to control fraud, waste, and abuse and  (2) the extent of CMS\u2019s oversight of Part D sponsors\u2019 programs to control  fraud, waste, and abuse.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and CMS  guidance to determine the required elements of a comprehensive  compliance plan and recommended measures for a comprehensive fraud  and abuse program.

We  also interviewed industry representatives who were subject-matter experts  to learn more about fraud and abuse programs. In addition, to examine the  extent to which certain Part D sponsors have implemented programs to  control fraud, waste, and abuse, we conducted on-site reviews at five   Part D sponsors. We selected these five sponsors for our review because  they each offered a Part D prescription drug plan that provided nationwide  coverage, varied in enrollment size, and the plans collectively provided  coverage for a sizeable proportion of Part D beneficiaries. (The five  national prescription drug plans selected for our review from these  sponsors represented about 35 percent of total Medicare Part D  enrollment as of April 2007.) Our sample is not generalizable to the entire  Part D sponsor population. Four of the five sponsors we reviewed were  private health insurance companies and one was a pharmacy benefit  manager. During our on-site reviews, we reviewed these sponsors  compliance plans and examined the extent to which the sponsors\u2019  implemented CMS\u2019s seven required compliance plan elements and selected  recommended measures for detecting, correcting and preventing fraud,  waste, and abuse in Part D. We selected recommended measures for our  review based on a variety of factors, such as measures that we judged  were the most helpful to fulfilling the purpose of the requirements.

CBC  noted that it did not have the resources to audit every plan, across every  program attribute, every 3 years as originally stated in its 2005 Oversight  Strategy. CBC reported that it would identify the minimal level of effort  needed to meet its oversight responsibilities and ensure that Medicare  stakeholders remained confident in the program.

In 2007, these CBC program audits  assessed Part D sponsors\u2019 compliance with selected program areas, but  the CBC audits did not assess sponsors\u2019 implementation of fraud and  abuse programs. Moreover, CBC does not plan to audit sponsors\u2019  implementation of fraud and abuse programs in 2008. In June 2007, CBC  conducted a self-assessment survey of Part D sponsors regarding the  implementation of their fraud and abuse programs.

These five national prescription drug plans (PDP) selected  for our review from these five sponsors represented about 35 percent of  total Medicare Part D enrollment as of April 2007. Our sample is not  generalizable to the entire Part D sponsor population. Four of the five  sponsors we reviewed were private health insurance companies and one  was a pharmacy benefit manager.", "For these on-site reviews, we developed a data collection instrument  based on: (1) the required compliance plan elements and certain  recommended measures for fraud and abuse programs outlined in  regulations and chapter 9 of the Part D Prescription Drug Benefit Manual  and (2) additional input provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS). CMS\u2019s regulations provided the core required elements of  a compliance plan and established a framework for fraud and abuse  programs. CMS\u2019s chapter 9 guidance provided several recommendations  for how sponsors should implement a program within that framework to  control fraud, waste, and abuse as part of an effective Part D compliance  plan. Our data collection instrument did not include all of CMS\u2019s  recommended measures. We selected recommended measures for  inclusion in our data collection instrument based on a variety of factors,  such as measures that we judged were the most helpful to fulfilling the  purpose of the requirements, measures that were recommended by the  OIG and subject-matter experts for compliance program evaluations,  including government officials from Veterans\u2019 Affairs (VA) and an industry  representative, measures that helped tailor a fraud and abuse program to  Part D, and measures that indicated that a required component or  procedure had been implemented. For example, CMS required procedures  for internal monitoring and auditing, but provided a variety of  recommendations on the types of internal monitoring and auditing that  could be implemented. We selected the recommendations we considered  to be the most helpful to fulfilling the requirements, such as the  recommendation to conduct an audit, rather than the recommendation  regarding the size, scope, and structure of the internal audit department.", "This study extends beyond a previous report from the Office of the  Inspector General (OIG), which reviewed Part D sponsors\u2019 compliance  plans to assess whether the plans addressed all of the requirements and  selected recommendations. The OIG limited its assessment to a document  review of the compliance plans submitted to CMS and did not assess the  extent to which the compliance plans had been implemented. However,  we assessed the implementation of the compliance plans by reviewing  documentary evidence on-site to examine how sponsors addressed fraud,  waste, and abuse specific to Medicare Part D for each of the required  elements of each Part D sponsor\u2019s compliance plan. This included the  compliance plan and any additional documents, such as procedures, that  were referenced in the compliance plan.", "To complete our data collection instrument, we used documentary  evidence to verify implementation of each element. We requested at least  one document pertaining to each of the required elements and selected  recommended measures. For example, we asked the sponsors to provide a  copy of the required auditing procedures and evidence that the Part D  sponsor had implemented the auditing procedures as recommended by  providing a copy of the findings from at least one audit related to Part D  that had been conducted. Our determination of whether sponsors met the  criteria for a requirement or recommendation was based on the  document\u2019s applicability to Part D and the specific element under review,  not the extensiveness of the document\u2019s content. For example, some  evidence we accepted contained one section referencing the requirement  or recommendation, while other documents were more detailed. All the  policies and procedures in the documents we reviewed were implemented  by sponsors and in use at the time of our on-site reviews.
