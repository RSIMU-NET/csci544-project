The AFF was established to receive the proceeds of forfeiture and holds more than $1 billion in assets. DOJ uses the proceeds from forfeitures primarily to cover the costs of forfeiture activities. DOJ also shares forfeiture proceeds with state and local agencies that participate in joint investigations through its equitable sharing program. GAO was asked to review (1) AFF\u0092s revenues and expenditures from fiscal years 2003 through 2011 and DOJ\u0092s processes for carrying over funds for the next fiscal year, and (2) the extent to which DOJ has established controls to help ensure that the equitable sharing program is implemented in accordance with established guidance. GAO analyzed data on AFF revenues, expenditures, and balances; interviewed DOJ officials; and analyzed a sample of 25 equitable sharing determinations, which included 5 determinations from each relevant DOJ agency. GAO\u0092s analysis of the samples was not generalizable, but provided insight into DOJ\u0092s decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Annual revenues into the Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF) from forfeited assets increased from $500 million in 2003 to $1.8 billion in 2011, in part due to an increase in prosecutions of fraud and financial crimes cases. Expenditures in support of forfeiture activities such as equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement agencies and payments to victims also increased over the same 9-year period, growing from $458 million in 2003 to $1.3 billion in 2011. The Department of Justice (DOJ) uses the difference between revenues and expenditures in any year to help cover anticipated expenses in the next fiscal year. Because the AFF uses fund revenues to pay for the expenses associated with forfeiture activities, DOJ carries over funds at the end of each fiscal year to ensure it has sufficient resources to cover expenses that may not be covered by the next year\u0092s revenues. When determining the amounts to carry over, DOJ reviews historical data on past program expenditures, analyzes known future expenses such as salaries and contracts, and estimates the costs of any potential new expenditures. However, DOJ has not documented the process for determining the amount of funds needed to cover anticipated expenditures in the next fiscal year in its annual budget justifications. Providing more transparent information as part of the AFF\u0092s annual budget process would better inform Congress\u0092 oversight of the AFF. Further, after DOJ obligates funds needed to cover program expenses, any remaining AFF funds identified at the end of a fiscal year may be declared an excess unobligated balance. DOJ has the authority to use these balances for any of the department\u0092s authorized purposes. Per Office of Management and Budget guidance, in recent years, DOJ used these excess unobligated balances to help cover rescissions. Rescissions cancel the availability of DOJ\u0092s previously enacted budget authority, making the funds involved no longer available for obligation. For example, in fiscal year 2011, DOJ used excess unobligated balances to help cover a $495 million AFF program rescission.", "DOJ has established guidelines for making equitable sharing determinations, but controls to ensure consistency and transparency could be improved. For example, DOJ agencies responsible for making equitable sharing determinations may make adjustments to sharing percentages when work hours alone do not reflect the relative value of an agency\u0092s contribution to an investigation. If a state or local law enforcement agency contributed a helicopter or a drug-sniffing dog to an investigation, its sharing percentage might be adjusted upward from what it would be based on work hours alone. However, DOJ\u0092s guidance does not include information regarding how decisions about these adjustments to sharing determinations should be made. This is particularly important given that these determinations represent DOJ\u0092s overall assessment of each agency\u0092s unique contributions and are a key component of how DOJ determines how much to award to each agency. Furthermore, key information that serves as the basis for equitable sharing determinations\u0097such as the work hours contributed by each of the participating agencies in an investigation\u0097is not subject to review by approving authorities. Developing guidance regarding how these decisions are to be made, documenting the basis for these decisions, and subjecting them to review and approval would help ensure the consistency and transparency of equitable sharing determinations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, among other things, DOJ clearly document how it determines the amount of funds that will need to be carried over for the next fiscal year, develop guidance on how components should make adjustments to equitable sharing determinations, and ensure that the basis for equitable sharing determinations is documented and subjected to review and approval.

A primary goal of  the program is preventing and reducing crime through the seizure and  forfeiture of assets that were used in or acquired as a result of criminal  activity. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 established the  Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF) within DOJ to receive the proceeds of  forfeitures and the AFF currently holds more than $1 billion in assets.  Revenues generated from forfeitures are used to fund program-related  expenses including payments to victims and lienholders, the costs of  storing and maintaining forfeited assets, and certain law enforcement  activities, such as the payment of awards for information leading to asset  forfeiture. After funds have been obligated for program expenses in the  current fiscal year, any unobligated funds that remain in the AFF at the  end of the fiscal year are then carried forward to the next fiscal year.  Specifically, at the end of each fiscal year, DOJ carries over funds to  ensure it has resources to cover expenses that may not be covered by  the next year\u2019s anticipated revenues.

Across all fiscal years,  forfeited cash income constituted 76 percent or more of the AFF\u2019s  revenue sources. Forfeited cash income includes cash/currency, as well  as financial instruments such as money orders, bank accounts, brokerage  accounts, and shares of stock.

By way of comparison, equitable sharing in fiscal year 2010  provided a total of $388 million in equitable sharing payments to state and  local law enforcement agencies. According to state and local law  enforcement officials we met with, because most of their departmental  budgets go toward personnel costs, the equitable sharing program is  extremely important because it helps fund equipment, training, and other  programs that they may otherwise not be able to afford. For example, one  local law enforcement agency stated that salaries make up 96 percent of  its annual budget. As a result, equitable sharing dollars allow them to  purchase equipment they could not otherwise buy with the limited  available annual budget.

This percentage decrease began in fiscal year 2006, when another  expenditure category\u2014payments to third parties including lienholders and  victims\u2014increased from 10 to 44 percent of total expenditures. DOJ  officials attribute the shift among these major expense categories in part  to the increase in the prosecution of fraud cases with significant numbers  of victims. Moreover, because large-case deposits are generally the result  of fraud and financial crime cases, they typically have a greater proportion  of payments to victims than equitable sharing, a fact that may also  contribute to the overall percentage decrease in equitable sharing. For  example, in fiscal year 2007, as a result of a non-prosecution agreement  with Adelphia Communications, over $700 million in cash and stocks was  forfeited and liquidated. In fiscal year 2012, the net proceeds from these  forfeitures, which totaled approximately $728 million, were returned to  victims.", "In addition to equitable sharing and third-party payments to victims and  lienholders, the AFF is used to pay for a variety of program operations  expenses.

Of these resources, DOJ obligated  $1.45 billion in fiscal year 2010 and carried over $975 million into  fiscal year 2011 to maintain solvency and reserves and to cover the  proposed fiscal year 2011 rescission.", "While DOJ had obligated $1.45 billion for the three main expenditure  categories; equitable sharing, third-party interests, and all other  program operations expenses, DOJ\u2019s actual expenditures in fiscal  year 2010 totaled $1.29 billion. The difference of $0.16 billion in fiscal  year 2010 represents funds that had been obligated, but had not yet  been spent. According to DOJ officials, there may be a lag between  the funds obligated in a fiscal year and the actual expenditures, and  therefore, it is not uncommon for the total obligations to be higher than  the expenditures in a given fiscal year. Table 2 shows the total funds  available for use in fiscal year 2010.", "In order to identify the funds that will need to be carried over to cover  anticipated expenses for the coming year, DOJ officials stated that they  use reports generated from its asset-tracking system to identify pending  equitable sharing and third-party payments. These reports provide DOJ  with information to determine carry over funds needed for the  disbursements that must be paid in the next fiscal year. In addition, DOJ  carries over funds needed to ensure the Asset Forfeiture Program\u2019s  solvency at the start of the next fiscal year. According to DOJ officials,  they consider a number of factors when calculating the funds needed to  maintain solvency, such as historical data including information on the  costs of past contracts, salary costs, and other expenses; known future  expenses including salaries and contracts; and the costs of any potential  new expenditures.", "DOJ officials explained the general factors they consider when carrying  over funds needed to cover anticipated expenditures in the next fiscal  year, but they do not specify in the AFF\u2019s Congressional Budget  Justifications how they determine the total amounts carried over each  year. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Justifications do not include  information on how DOJ calculated the amounts carried over nor do they  explain the significant variations from one year to the next in the amount  of funds carried over for solvency. For example, in fiscal year 2007, DOJ  carried over $188 million based on its estimates of what it needed to  cover solvency. The amount carried over to cover solvency then  increased to $402 million in fiscal year 2009 and decreased to $169  million by fiscal year 2011. Figure 4 shows the variation in carryover  funds retained in the AFF at the end of each fiscal year to cover solvency,  equitable sharing, and third-party payments from fiscal years 2003  through 2011.", "DOJ officials stated that a number of cost drivers may change the funds  needed for solvency from year to year. These cost drivers include salaries  for government employees, information systems costs, asset  management and disposal contracts, and contracts for administrative  support staff, among other things. According to DOJ, these categories  comprise recurring operational costs of the Asset Forfeiture Program.  While these expenses are generally funded by AFF revenues, DOJ  carries over funds to ensure it has sufficient resources that may not be  covered by the next year\u2019s revenues. Moreover, additional funds may  need to be carried over to account for any number of program  uncertainties. For example, the AFF could be responsible for making  payments related to pending judicial actions, in the event that DOJ were  to lose a forfeiture case in court. Therefore, DOJ may carry over more  funds from one fiscal year to the next in order to cover these types of  liabilities. DOJ officials stated that they estimate needed carryover funds  by reviewing the cost drivers, as well as by assessing the risk that  revenues may be less than projected. DOJ officials further noted that  planning for AFF carryover and the actual carryover can differ due to the  unpredictable dynamics of the fund. According to DOJ officials, there is  no documented process used to determine the amount of funds that are  carried over at the end of each fiscal year.", "Our prior work has emphasized the importance of transparency in federal  agencies\u2019 budget presentations to help provide Congress the necessary   The information to make appropriation decisions and conduct oversight. department provides a yearly budget justification to Congress that details  the estimated revenues, expenses, and carryover requirements for the  upcoming fiscal year as well as AFF-related performance information.  Officials further noted that the Congressional Justification includes  discussions of the various categories of fund expenses, but does not  include a detailed discussion of the process used to estimate the amounts  carried over. Without a clearly documented and transparent process that  demonstrates how DOJ determines the amounts that will be carried over  each year, it is difficult to determine whether DOJ\u2019s conclusions regarding  the amounts that need to be carried over each year are well founded.  Providing more transparent information as part of the AFF\u2019s annual  budget process would better inform Congress\u2019 oversight of the AFF, by  making it easier to evaluate whether the funds carried over to maintain  Asset Forfeiture Program solvency and cover pending equitable sharing  and third-party payments adequately reflect the AFF\u2019s needed resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Since 2003, DOJ Has Retained Excess Balances in the AFF to Cover Yearly Proposed Rescissions, and These Rescissions Have Since Accumulated to Over Half a Billion Dollars", "paragraphs": ["After revenues needed to cover expenses in the current and upcoming  fiscal years have been carried over, DOJ reserves funds to cover  rescissions.

While these Super Surplus balances may  be used at DOJ\u2019s discretion for a variety of purposes, in recent years,  these balances have been used as a means to supplement the funds  reserved to cover yearly rescissions proposed in the President\u2019s budget,  and later passed by Congress and enacted into law. Figure 5 provides a  description of the process for identifying Super Surplus balances in any  given fiscal year.", "Rescissions are legislative actions to reduce an agency\u2019s budgetary  resources. For example, in fiscal year 2010, $387 million was rescinded  from the AFF, and in fiscal year 2011, the enacted rescission totaled $495  million. Rescinded funds are generally taken from an agency and  returned to the Treasury before they are obligated. However, per Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, rescinded funds from the AFF  have not been returned to the Treasury. Instead, DOJ has treated the  funds as unavailable for obligation for the remainder of the fiscal year for  which the rescission was enacted. At the beginning of each new fiscal  year, DOJ would have made the rescinded funds available for obligation  again, also in response to OMB guidance, had a new rescission not been  enacted. With the enactment of a new rescission for the subsequent fiscal  year, however, DOJ has continued to treat the rescinded funds as  unavailable for obligation. For example, the $387 million that was  rescinded from the AFF in fiscal year 2010 was treated as unavailable for  obligation in fiscal year 2010, and was then used again to cover part of  the enacted $495 million rescission in fiscal year 2011. To make up the  difference needed to meet the $495 million rescission in fiscal year 2011,  DOJ used unobligated balances in the amount of $233 million.

This could ultimately decrease the size of the federal deficit, provided the  decreased spending from the rescission is not offset by increased  spending elsewhere.

DOJ agencies currently make adjustments to sharing  percentages based on a number of qualitative factors regarding the  additional assistance or contributions state or local law enforcement  agencies may have made during an investigation. According to DOJ\u2019s  written guidelines, DOJ agencies must take these factors into account  when determining whether to adjust an equitable sharing percentage  beyond a strict work hour allocation. For example, according to DOJ  guidelines, the deciding authority should consider such factors as the  inherent importance of the activity, the length of the investigation, whether  an agency originated the information leading to the seizure, or whether an  agency provided unique and indispensable assistance, among others. In  addition, DOJ\u2019s Equitable Sharing Guidelines state that each agency may  use judgment when determining how these qualitative factors should be  used to adjust sharing percentages.", "In the course of our review, DOJ officials provided examples of these  qualitative factors. For example, if a state or local law enforcement  agency provided a helicopter, drug-sniffing dog, or a criminal informant to  an investigation, DOJ would consider these contributions to be unique or  indispensible assistance. In one case we reviewed, a local law  enforcement agency that participated in a joint investigation with federal  agents would have received 7.4 percent in equitable sharing based on the  work hours it contributed to the investigation. However, the agency also  provided information obtained from a confidential source that led to the  seizure and provided a helicopter for aerial surveillance. As a result, its  final sharing determination was adjusted upward from 7.4 percent to 12  percent. If the net proceeds of the forfeiture are $1.6 million once all  investigative and forfeiture-related expenses have been paid, the  resulting equitable sharing payment made to the law enforcement agency  will increase from $118,400 to $192,000.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for  significant events to be clearly documented in directives, policies, or  manuals to help ensure operations are carried out as intended. AFMLS  officials report that they have established \u201crules of thumb\u201d based on  historical knowledge or precedent when applying these qualitative factors  to equitable sharing adjustments that are subject to their review, but have  not issued guidance to the DOJ agencies. Further, headquarters officials  for each of the DOJ agencies emphasized that they follow the guidelines  issued by DOJ when making adjustments to sharing percentages.  However, as previously discussed, these guidelines outline the qualitative  factors that may be considered when making adjustments to sharing  percentages, but they do not include any additional information regarding  how qualitative factors should be used to adjust sharing percentages. As  a result, agency headquarters officials stated that field office staff use  their own judgment when determining how qualitative factors should be  used to adjust sharing percentages. AFMLS officials state that  adjustments to equitable sharing percentages based on qualitative factors  should be made on a case-by-case basis because each investigation is  unique and the facts and circumstances of each case must be considered  in totality before making adjustments to sharing determinations. While we  recognize the inherently subjective nature of evaluating each agency\u2019s  unique contributions to a case based on facts and circumstances,  additional guidance regarding how to apply the qualitative factors could  help to improve transparency and better ensure consistency with which  these qualitative factors are applied over time or across cases. This is  particularly important given that these determinations represent DOJ\u2019s  overall assessment of each agency\u2019s unique contributions to an  investigation and are a key component of how DOJ makes decisions  about how much to award each agency.", "DOJ\u2019s written guidance also requires the DOJ agencies that are  responsible for making equitable sharing determinations to use work  hours as the primary basis for calculating sharing percentages; however,  agencies do not consistently document the work hours each agency  contributed to the investigation. According to DOJ officials, the work hours  contributed by each of the local, state, and federal law enforcement  agencies involved in the investigation should be added together by the  DOJ agency leading the investigation to arrive at a total. Each law  enforcement agency\u2019s individual work hours are then divided by the total  in order to determine each agency\u2019s equitable sharing percentage. DOJ\u2019s  guidance states that every agency participating in the investigation should  report work hours on either the application for equitable sharing or on the  equitable sharing decision form. While state and local law enforcement  agencies record their work hours on their applications for equitable  sharing, we found that the DOJ agencies did not consistently record their  own hours or the total hours contributed by all participating agencies. Of  the 25 equitable sharing determinations we reviewed, 5 included  supplemental memos provided by the DOJ agencies detailing the work  hours provided by all of the agencies involved in the investigation.

According to DOJ  agency headquarters officials responsible for reviewing and approving  equitable sharing determinations, they rely on agents in the field to  calculate sharing percentages and as a result, they do not verify the work  hours contributed by each agency involved in the investigation.

In the 25 equitable sharing determinations we reviewed,  state and local law enforcement agencies often reported basic information  regarding their agency\u2019s role in a particular investigation in their  applications for equitable sharing, but DOJ\u2019s rationale for making  adjustments to sharing percentages was not consistently documented in  each investigation. Specifically, agencies did not consistently document  whether they believed the state or local law enforcement agency made  additional contributions that warranted departures from standard sharing  percentages. Of the 25 determinations we reviewed, 5 included  supplemental memos provided by the DOJ agencies indicating whether  adjustments from standard sharing percentages were warranted. In 3 of  these 5 AFMLS determinations, adjustments to sharing percentages were  made based on the additional contributions of the state and local law  enforcement agencies involved in the investigation and the memos  detailed the rationale for making the adjustment in each case. However,  these memos are not required under existing DOJ guidance and were  provided in only those investigations subject to AFMLS review. For the  remaining 20 investigations, DOJ did not document this information.  Moreover, because work hours were not documented in these cases, it  was not possible to determine whether further adjustments were made  based on additional contributions made by each of the agencies involved  in the investigation.", "According to DOJ agency headquarters officials responsible for reviewing  and approving equitable sharing determinations, they rely on agents in  the field to calculate sharing percentages and, as a result, they do not  attempt to verify the adjustments that are made based on each agency\u2019s  additional contributions to the investigation. Specifically, agency  headquarters officials reported that the field is responsible for confirming  state and local law enforcement\u2019s contributions to a case through a  variety of means including face-to-face meetings, telephone  conversations, and e-mails. For example, one agency official noted that  although the rationale for making adjustments to sharing percentages is  not included in the documents provided to headquarters for review and  approval, the field office is most familiar with the investigation and the  contributions that each state and local law enforcement agency may have  made in a given case. Therefore, headquarters considers the field office  to be the best source of information for how qualitative factors should be  taken into account when adjusting sharing percentages. Agency  headquarters officials further noted that it is rare for them to question  equitable sharing recommendations made by the field or to ask for more  information regarding the rationale for adjustments to sharing  percentages. While the field office may have firsthand knowledge of the  contributions of state and local law enforcement agencies in a given  investigation, in the absence of the rationale for adjustments to sharing  percentages being documented, there is limited transparency over how  and why agencies make adjustments to sharing determinations when  work hours alone do not accurately represent an agency\u2019s contribution to  an investigation.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  transactions should be promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and  value to management in controlling operations and making decisions.  This applies to the entire process or life cycle of a transaction or event  from the initiation and authorization through its final classification in  summary records. In addition, control activities help to ensure that all  transactions are completely and accurately recorded. In the absence of  consistently documenting work hours and the rationale for making  adjustments to sharing percentages, it is unclear how the equitable  sharing deciding authorities could evaluate the nature and value of the  contributions of each of the agencies involved in the investigation.  Establishing a mechanism to ensure that this information is documented  by all DOJ agencies responsible for making equitable sharing  determinations could enhance the transparency of equitable sharing  decisions.", "In the absence of documenting work hours or the rationale for making  adjustments to sharing percentages, deciding authorities have limited  means to verify the basis for equitable sharing decisions. Agency  headquarters officials responsible for reviewing and approving equitable  sharing determinations report that they review equitable sharing  applications and decision forms to ensure that they are complete and that  sharing determinations appear reasonable. However, headquarters  officials for each of the DOJ agencies reported that they rely on field  office staff to ensure that equitable sharing percentages were calculated  correctly based on the work hours and the qualitative factors that each  federal, state, and local law enforcement agency contributed to the  investigation. However, because the information that serves as the basis  for equitable sharing recommendations\u2014including work hours and the  qualitative factors used to make adjustments to sharing percentages\u2014are  not subject to review by agency headquarters officials, DOJ does not  have reasonable assurance that the equitable sharing determinations are  made in accordance with the established guidance. According to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, controls should  generally be designed to ensure that ongoing monitoring occurs in the  course of normal operations. Such monitoring should be performed  continually and ingrained in the agency\u2019s operations. This could include  regular management and supervisory activities, comparisons,  reconciliations, or other actions. Developing a mechanism to verify the  work hours and qualitative factors that serve as the basis for equitable  sharing determinations could improve DOJ\u2019s visibility over equitable  sharing determinations and help promote confidence in the integrity of the  equitable sharing program. Agency headquarters officials have reported  that altogether, DEA, ATF, and FBI reviewed a total of 52,034 equitable  sharing requests in fiscal year 2011, and 113 of these requests went to  AFMLS for review and approval. As a result, agency headquarters  officials note that they have limited resources to verify the basis for each  and every equitable sharing determination. We recognize that in the face  of these limited resources, it may not be practical for agency  headquarters officials to review all of the information used in support of all  equitable sharing determinations.

Examples of impermissible uses of equitable sharing funds  include payments to cover the costs of salaries or benefits and non-law  enforcement education and training. DOJ\u2019s guidelines also state that  agencies should use federal sharing monies prudently and in such a  manner as to avoid any appearance of extravagance, waste, or  impropriety. For example, tickets to social events, hospitality suites at  conferences, or meals outside of the per diem are all considered  impermissible uses of shared funds.", "DOJ\u2019s guidelines further state that equitable sharing funds must be used  to increase or supplement the resources of the receiving state or local law  enforcement agency and should not be used to replace or supplant the  appropriated resources of the recipient. This means that equitable sharing  funds must serve only to supplement funds they would normally receive  and must not be used as a substitute for funds or equipment that would  otherwise be provided by the law enforcement agency. For example, if  city officials were to cut the police department\u2019s budget by $100,000 as a  result of the police department\u2019s receiving $100,000 in equitable sharing  funds, DOJ would consider this to be an example of improper  supplantation, which is not an allowable use of equitable sharing funds.", "In addition to establishing requirements governing the permissible uses of  equitably shared funds and property, DOJ has also established  bookkeeping, internal controls, reporting, and audit requirements that  state and local law enforcement agencies must follow in order to  participate in the equitable sharing program.

As a result, AFMLS reported  conducting risk assessments in order to select agencies for compliance  reviews. In addition to monitoring news briefs regarding the potential  misuse of funds among equitable sharing participants, some of the issues  that AFMLS considers as part of these risk assessments include the  amount of each agency\u2019s equitable sharing expenditures, whether a state  or local law enforcement agency has reported spending a significant  amount of money in a sensitive area, and whether a small law  enforcement agency that may be unfamiliar with the equitable sharing  program suddenly received a large equitable sharing payment. The 11  compliance reviews completed in 2011 revealed that participants do not  consistently follow requirements to properly account for equitable sharing  receipts and expenditures, do not consistently comply with the allowable   AFMLS reports it currently  uses of equitable sharing funds, and do not consistently complete Single  Audits as required. AFMLS identified one or more areas for corrective  action in 9 of the 11 compliance reviews.

The significant amounts of money  involved as well as the sensitive nature of asset forfeiture mean it is  imperative to be vigilant in maintaining the transparency of the program.  Since the Asset Forfeiture Program\u2019s operations are supported by annual  revenues, DOJ faces a challenging task estimating future revenues and  expenditures each year.

Agencies may either receive a portion of the proceeds resulting  from the sale of the forfeited asset or may request that a forfeited asset  such as a vehicle be put into official use. Any property other than  contraband or firearms may be transferred to a state or local agency for  official use provided that it is used for law enforcement purposes. State  and local law enforcement can receive equitable sharing payments after  working on a joint case with one or more federal law enforcement  partners or after participating in a case carried out by a federal law  enforcement task force. Approximately 83 percent of all equitable sharing  determinations are the result of joint investigations.", "State and local law enforcement agencies can also qualify for equitable  sharing by requesting that federal partners adopt a case initiated at the  state or local level. An adoptive forfeiture occurs when local police  officials effectively hand a case over to federal law enforcement officials  provided that the property in question is forfeitable under federal law.  According to DOJ officials, many state and local law enforcement  agencies will make seizures pursuant to their state laws. However, they  may reach out to federal law enforcement agencies to adopt a forfeiture if  they don\u2019t have a state or local statute that allows them to carry out a  forfeiture. For example, in a particular case, there may be large amounts  of cash involved but no drugs found or seized. Federal statute allows for  the forfeiture of assets based on illegal activity even if there are no drugs  seized, whereas the state or local statute might not allow for this type of  forfeiture. Alternatively, state and local law enforcement agencies may  request that DOJ adopt a forfeiture in those cases where federal  coordination or expertise is needed in the case. Our analysis shows a  slight decrease in adoptive versus non-adoptive equitable sharing  payments since 2003. In 2003, adoptions made up about 23 percent of all  equitable sharing payments, while in 2010, adoptions made up about 17  percent of all equitable sharing payments. According to DOJ, as more  states have established their own forfeiture laws, they may rely less on  DOJ to adopt forfeiture cases and may instead pursue forfeitures under  state law when appropriate. Figure 7 shows the equitable sharing  payments made to each state in fiscal year 2011.", "Directions: Place mouse over each state name for the total equitable sharing payments made to that  state in fiscal year 2011.", "Ill.", "Our analysis shows a strong positive association between the equitable  sharing payments made to each state and the state\u2019s total population.  However, our analysis found no correlation between per capita equitable  sharing payments and arrest rates, once we corrected for population size.  It is important to note that a number of other factors may influence the  amount of equitable sharing payments a state receives in a given year.  For example, if a state or local law enforcement agency participated in a  joint investigation that resulted in a very large forfeiture, the agency might  receive a significant amount of equitable sharing dollars, even if no  arrests were made in conjunction with the case. Alternately, an agency  may work several cases that generate multiple arrests, but no forfeitures,  so no equitable sharing payments would be made. Finally, differences in  equitable sharing between states may be influenced by whether state and  local law enforcement agencies decide to pursue forfeitures under their  state laws versus those cases where federal involvement may be  warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Assets Forfeiture Fund Expenditure Categories", "paragraphs": ["1.  Third-Party Payments:  Third-party payments are payments to satisfy third-party interests,  including lienholders and other innocent parties, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \u00a7 524(c)(1)(D); payments in connection with the remission and  mitigation of forfeitures, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c)(1)(E).  2.  Equitable Sharing Payments:  These funds are reserved until the receipt of the final forfeiture orders  that result in distributions to the participants. Equitable sharing  payments represent the transfer of portions of federally forfeited cash  and proceeds from the sale of forfeited property to state and local law  enforcement agencies and foreign governments that directly assisted  in targeting or seizing the property. Most task force cases, for  example, result in property forfeitures whose proceeds are shared  among the participating agencies.", "All other program operations expenses  3.  Asset Management and Disposal:  According to DOJ, the primary purpose of the Assets Forfeiture Fund  (AFF) is to ensure an adequate and appropriate source of funding for  the management and disposal of forfeited assets. Also, funding is  required for the assessment, containment, removal, and destruction of  hazardous materials seized for forfeiture, and hazardous waste  contaminated property seized for forfeiture. The United States  Marshals Service (USMS) has primary responsibility for the storage  and maintenance of assets, while the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms  and Explosives (ATF) are responsible for the disposal of toxic and  hazardous substances.  4.  Case-Related Expenses:  Case-related expenses are expenses associated with the prosecution  of a forfeiture case or execution of a forfeiture judgment, such as  advertising, travel and subsistence, court and deposition reporting,  courtroom exhibit services, and expert witness costs. In appropriate  cases, the services of foreign counsel may be necessary.  5.  Special Contract Services:  The AFF uses contract personnel to manage the paperwork  associated with forfeiture, including data entry, data analysis, word  processing, file control, file review, quality control, case file  preparation, and other process support functions.  6.  Investigative Expenses Leading to Seizure:  Investigative expenses are those normally incurred in the  identification, location, and seizure of property subject to forfeiture.  These include payments to reimburse any federal agency participating  in the AFF for investigative costs leading to seizures.  7.  Contracts to Identify Assets:  Investigative agencies use these funds for subscription services to  nationwide public record data systems, and for acquisition of  specialized assistance, such as reconstruction of seized financial  records. According to DOJ, these resources are used to identify  assets during the investigative stage of the case, where such  research will enhance effective use of the asset forfeiture sanction.  DOJ officials note that if the government can improve upon the  identification of ill-gotten assets, the nature of the criminal wrongdoing  can be better demonstrated and reinforced before the jury. Such  evidence results in greater penalties for criminals who may have  avoided such penalties in the past by successfully concealing such  assets.  8.  Awards for Information Leading to a Forfeiture:  The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, amended the  Justice Fund statute to treat payments of awards based on the  amount of the forfeiture the same as other costs of forfeiture.  Therefore, the amount available each year for expenses for awards  no longer had to be specified in annual appropriations acts.  9.  Automated Data Processing:  Recurring costs include telecommunications support, system and  equipment maintenance, user support and help desk, software  maintenance, user training, equipment, and data center charges in  support of the Consolidated Asset Tracking System (CATS). All asset  forfeiture activity for each asset is recorded in CATS. According to  DOJ, CATS enables access for more than 1,000 locations to a central  database to perform full asset forfeiture life-cycle tasks more  efficiently. The system provides current information to field personnel  on the status of cases, integrates financial analysis capabilities into  the inventory management process, provides the estimation of  program income and expenses, and provides the capability for agency  and department managers to review and assess program activity.  10. Training and Printing:  This category funds expenses for training personnel on aspects of the  federal forfeiture program as well as other training necessary to  maintain the competency of federal and contractor personnel  dedicated to performing federal forfeiture functions. Printing costs  reflect the continuing need to provide current legal advice and  support. Expenses include updating and distributing manuals and  pamphlets directly related to forfeiture issues, policies, and  procedures.  11. Other Program Management:  This category includes several types of expenses in support of the  overall management of the Asset Forfeiture Program, including  management analysis, performance assessment, problem analysis,  requirements analyses, policy development, and other special  projects designed to improve program performance. This funding is to  provide travel and per diem funds for temporary duty assignments  needed to correct program deficiencies. Other activities funded under  this heading include the annual audit of the financial statements of the  Assets Forfeiture Fund and the Seized Asset Deposit Fund by an  independent accounting firm and special assessments and reviews.  This category also finances the Asset Forfeiture Money Laundering  Section (AFMLS), Asset Forfeiture Management Staff (AFMS), and,  since 2001, USMS headquarters administrative personnel and non- personnel costs associated with the forfeiture program. In addition,  the AFF funds Deputy U.S. Marshal salaries to enhance the legal and  fiduciary responsibilities that are inherent in the seizure of personal  and real property during the pendency of a forfeiture action.  12. Storage, Protection, and Destruction of Controlled Substances:  These expenses are incurred to store, protect, or destroy controlled  substances.  13. Joint Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Operations:  Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c)(1)(l), the AFF has authority to pay for  \u201covertime, travel, fuel, training, equipment, and other similar costs of  state or local law enforcement officers that are incurred in a joint law  enforcement operation with a federal law enforcement agency  participating in the Fund.\u201d  14. Awards for Information and Purchase of Evidence  Awards payable from the AFF directly support law enforcement efforts  by encouraging the cooperation and assistance of informants. The  AFF may also be used to purchase evidence of violations of drug  laws, Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), and  criminal money laundering laws. According to DOJ, payment of  awards to sources of information creates motivation for individuals to  assist the government in the investigation of criminal activity and the  seizure of assets.  15. Equipping of Conveyances:  This category provides funding to equip vehicles, vessels, or aircraft  for law enforcement functions, but not to acquire them. Purchased  equipment must be affixed to and used integrally with the  conveyance. This funding is used for emergency and communications  equipment, voice privacy and surveillance equipment, armoring, and  engine upgrades and avionic equipment for aircraft. According to  DOJ, it is only through AFF resources that many of these surveillance  vehicles are available to the field districts that need them. DEA uses  various surveillance techniques, including stationary and mobile  platforms to conduct surveillance and gather intelligence, the  cornerstone of cases against most major drug violators. In addition,  evidence obtained through the use of such surveillance often provides  the audio and video documentation necessary for conviction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Results of Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section Compliance Reviews Completed as of December 2011", "paragraphs": ["DOJ\u2019s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section completed a total  of 11 compliance reviews of equitable sharing participants in 2011.
