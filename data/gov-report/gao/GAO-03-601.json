The Fund has developed comprehensive oversight systems for monitoring and evaluating grant performance and ensuring financial accountability and has issued guidance for procurement; however, the oversight systems face challenges at the country level and some procurement issues have not been finalized. The Fund's ability to approve and finance additional grants is threatened by a lack of sufficient resources. Pledges made through the end of 2003 are insufficient to cover more than a small number of additional grants and without significant new pledges, the Fund will be unable to support all of the already approved grants beyond their initial 2-year agreements. Improvements in the Fund's grant-making processes have enhanced its ability to achieve its key objectives, but challenges remain. These challenges include ensuring that grants add to and complement existing spending on HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria and that recipients have the capacity to effectively use grants."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["By the end of 2002, more than 40 million people worldwide were living with  human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  (HIV/AIDS), with 5 million newly infected that year.

According to UNAIDS, in 2002 AIDS caused 3 million deaths,  and 5 million people became infected. More than 70 percent, or 28.5  million, of the 40 million people with HIV/AIDS worldwide live in sub- Saharan Africa. However, according to a report by the National Intelligence  Council, HIV infections in just five populous countries\u2014China, India,  Nigeria, Russia, and Ethiopia\u2014will surpass total infections in central and  southern Africa by the end of the decade. In addition, Thailand, a  developing country that had successfully countered the growth of AIDS in  the 1990s, is now facing a resurgent epidemic. According to WHO, after  HIV/AIDS, TB is the world\u2019s leading infectious cause of adult mortality,  resulting in as many as 2 million deaths per year.  Like HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis primarily affects the most economically active segment of the  population, with 75 percent of the annual deaths occurring in those  between the ages 15 and 54. Conversely, malaria, which causes more than 1  million deaths and at least 300 million cases of acute illness each year, is a  leading cause of death in young children. The disease exerts its heaviest  toll in Africa, where about 90 percent of malaria deaths occur.", "The Fund was formally launched in January 2002.  The Fund is a grant- making organization with the purpose of attracting, managing, and  disbursing funds that will increase existing resources and make a  sustainable and significant contribution to the reduction of infections,  illness, and death. The Fund aims for an integrated and balanced approach,  covering prevention, treatment, care, and support, and seeks to establish  efficient and effective disbursement mechanisms. During its first full year  of operation, the Fund successfully completed two proposal rounds and  began distributing grant money.", "Over the course of these two proposal rounds, the Fund approved grants to  153 proposals in 81 countries across the major regions of the world (see fig.  2).

The voting members consist of  seven government representatives from developing countries, seven  government representatives from donor countries, and one  representative each from a developing country nongovernmental  organization (NGO), a developed country NGO, the private sector, and  private foundations. The five nonvoting members consist of a  representative from WHO, the World Bank (as trustee, see below),  UNAIDS, a person representing communities living with HIV/AIDS, TB,  or malaria, and one Swiss citizen appointed by the board. The board  makes all funding decisions; sets Fund policies, strategies, and  operational guidelines; and selects the executive director of the  secretariat. The board chair and vice chair rotate between beneficiary  and donor country representatives. In January 2003, the U.S. Secretary  of Health and Human Services was elected to serve as chairman,  replacing the outgoing chairman from Uganda. Figure 4 illustrates the  current structure of the Fund\u2019s board.", "The board plans to meet three times per year and strives to make decisions  by consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, any voting member can  call for a vote. Successful motions require approval from a two-thirds  majority of those present, representing both donor and recipient voting  groups, which means that the current voting structure may make it difficult  to reach a decision.  For example, the only time the board brought an issue  to a vote a decision was not reached because the members could not get a  sufficient number of affirmative votes.", "The board has established four committees: (1) Governance and  Partnership, (2) Resource Mobilization and Communications, (3) Portfolio  Management and Procurement, and (4) Monitoring and Evaluation,  Finance, and Audit. The committees respond to issues raised by the board  and identify options for addressing them. For example, the Portfolio  Management and Procurement Committee has developed a proposal  appeals process.

The board  reviews and approves the secretariat\u2019s business plan and budget. In  January 2003, the board approved a $38.7 million budget for 2003 for the  secretariat (see table 1).", "The Technical Review Panel (TRP) reviews and evaluates eligible  proposals submitted to the Fund. It currently consists of 22 independent  experts: 7 members with cross-cutting expertise in development,  including health systems development, economics, public policy, and  finance; 7 members with expertise in HIV/AIDS; 4 members with  expertise in malaria; and 4 members with expertise in TB. There are  two U.S. members on the TRP, an expert on TB and an expert with  cross-cutting expertise in health and development issues. The TRP is  supported by a WHO/UNAIDS working group that reviews the accuracy  of baseline data on disease prevalence, poverty, and other indicators  provided in the proposals. The working group also reviews the accuracy  and relevance of the information provided by applicants on their ability  to effectively use additional funds. The TRP makes recommendations to  the board for final decisions on proposal selection. According to  officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, health and  development experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  and USAID conducted an informal review of approved proposals and  largely concurred with the TRP\u2019s recommendations.", "As the Fund\u2019s trustee, the World Bank receives money from donors,  holds the money in an interest-bearing account, and disburses it  according to the Fund\u2019s written instructions.", "At the country level, governance and oversight structures include a  Country Coordinating Mechanism, a principal recipient, subrecipients, and  a Local Fund Agent.", "The country coordinating mechanism (CCM) is meant to provide a  forum for stakeholders to work together to identify needs and develop  and submit proposals to the Fund and follow the progress of grant  projects during implementation. According to the Fund, CCM  membership should include high-level government representatives as  well as representatives of NGOs, civil society, multilateral and bilateral  agencies, and the private sector. Further, all eligible partners in the CCM  should be entitled to receive Fund money based on their stated role in  implementing the proposal.", "The principal recipient, which is a member of the CCM, is responsible  for receiving and implementing the grant. A principal recipient can be a  government agency, an NGO, a private organization, or, if alternatives  are not available, a multilateral development organization. Of the 69  grant agreements resulting from the first round of proposals approved  by the Fund, 41 (59 percent) are with principal recipients that are  government agencies, 17 (25 percent) are with NGOs, and 9 (13 percent)  are with the U.N. Development Program.  (See app. II for more detailed  information.)  The principal recipient is responsible for making sure that  funds are properly accounted for as well as for monitoring and  evaluating the grant\u2019s effectiveness in accordance with indicators  mutually agreed to by the Fund and the grantee. In some cases, there  may be multiple principal recipients for a single grant. The principal  recipient typically works with other entities, or subrecipients, to carry  out grant activities.", "Subrecipients are entities, such as NGOs, with the expertise necessary  to perform the work and can be other CCM members. The principal  recipient is responsible for supervising any subrecipients and  distributing Fund money to them.", "The local fund agent (LFA) is the Fund\u2019s representative in each  recipient country and is responsible for financial and program oversight  of grant recipients. This oversight role includes an assessment of  recipients prior to their receiving money from the Fund. The assessment  covers recipients\u2019 ability to maintain adequate financial controls,  procure goods and services, and carry out program activities. The Fund  selects one LFA in each country. As of April 1, 2003, the Fund has  contracted with four organizations to fill this role: two private sector  firms, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers; one private foundation that  was formerly a public corporation, Crown Agents; and one multilateral  entity, the U.N.

This has  resulted in confusion over the intended structure and purpose of the CCM.  While our sample of only four countries is not necessarily representative of  all grant recipients, several NGOs reported similar observations to the  board. The Fund has posted general guidelines for CCMs on its Web site as  well as in its calls for proposals. These guidelines encourage CCMs to hold  regular meetings; engage all relevant participants, including  representatives of civil society, in substantive discussions; ensure that  information is disseminated to all interested parties; and be involved in the  implementation of projects after proposals are developed and submitted to  the Fund. However, many CCMs had difficulties following these guidelines.", "The role of the CCM in developing proposals and participating in their  implementation after approval is not clear, according to a report by an  international HIV/AIDS organization that assessed the participation of  NGOs in the CCM process and according to CCM members in several  countries. For example, many NGOs are not aware that they can participate  in both the development and implementation of proposals. Furthermore,  they are demanding clearer information on the selection of CCM members  and the entities to which CCMs are accountable. An NGO participant told  us that after a meeting in March 2002, the CCM did not convene again for  about 6 months because it had received no guidance from the Fund on how  to proceed.  A number of members of another CCM said that they did not  get a chance to vet or, in some cases, read proposals before endorsing  them. In addition, after the proposals were submitted, members of this  CCM were not informed of important events in a timely manner. A donor  participating in this CCM stated that, with regard to a grant proposal for  more than $200 million that was submitted in the second round and has  since been approved, no one knows who will be responsible for  implementing it when the money arrives.", "A number of the CCM members with whom we met were concerned over  the level of involvement of all relevant parties. According to information  compiled by the Fund\u2019s Governance and Partnership Committee for the  board\u2019s January 2003 meeting, all CCMs that submitted second-round  proposals are chaired by a government official (79 percent from the  health ministry). In addition, at least a quarter of the CCMs lack  representation from one or more of the following groups:  people living  with one of the three diseases, the private sector, academic institutions, or  religious organizations. In one country, for example, donors said that NGOs  need to develop a stronger and more active voice on the CCM. An update  on the Fund for nongovernmental organizations and civil society, prepared  by the International Council of AIDS Service Organizations, expressed  similar views regarding CCMs in countries that we did not visit. However,  the update also included evidence that CCMs are enhancing the  involvement of NGOs in national health policies in some countries. In  addition to members of civil society, key government ministries and donors  are often not included as members in current CCMs. The Governance and  Partnership Committee recognized this point in the document prepared for  the January 2003 board meeting, stating, \u201cOf concern is the relatively low  participation from Ministries of Finance (37 percent), given the need to  ensure consistency with Global Fund grant processes and overall fiscal and  monetary policies of recipient countries.\u201d The committee also noted that  although the World Bank is a significant source of resources for many  recipients, it is a member of only 14 percent of CCMs. In one country we  visited, for example, where neither the Ministry of Finance nor the World  Bank were members of the CCM, a dispute over where the Fund money  should be deposited delayed the signing of the country\u2019s first grant  agreement.", "Dissemination of information is also a problem, according to the  international HIV/AIDS organization report and CCM members with whom  we met. The report stated that many NGOs are not receiving essential  information from the Fund because the CCM chairs receiving this  information are not passing it on to all stakeholders. In one country, several  CCM members told us that the CCM is not functioning well because the  flow of information is tightly controlled by the chair. Many members of this  CCM, for example, were unaware that a nongovernmental organization had  also submitted a proposal to the Fund. As of April 1, 2003, more than 1  year after the proposal was submitted, the CCM had yet to review and  endorse or reject it, as required by the Fund. As a result, the Fund has  dropped this proposal from its list of those approved in the first round.", "Of the four countries we visited, even the country with the most functional  CCM experienced some difficulties. This country had received substantial  support from a Fund staff member, who spent 6 weeks in the country  helping the CCM clarify the Fund\u2019s principles regarding CCMs and how its  proposal will be implemented. This support, together with the active  leadership of the CCM chair, was widely credited with the relative success  of the CCM.  Members of this CCM said it had become a transparent,  multisectoral, participatory, and consensus-driven forum that has held  frequent meetings. However, CCM members were still unclear as to their  role after the grant is disbursed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Fund Is Taking Steps to Address Problems Associated with CCMs", "paragraphs": ["According to the Fund, it does not have sufficient resources to provide the  same level of support for every country as it did in the country cited above.

While trying to remain flexible and attentive to differing  situations in each country and avoid an overly prescriptive, \u201ccookie- cutter\u201d  approach, the Fund\u2019s Governance and Partnership Committee proposed to  the board in January 2003 specific guidelines for CCMs that address many of the issues raised above. The committee also proposed that the  secretariat work with it to develop a handbook for CCMs that contains  these principles. Although the board did not reach a decision on this  proposal in January 2003, as of April 1, 2003, the agreements between the  Fund and grant recipients contained language describing the nature and  duties of CCMs. This language states that CCMs are to have a role in  monitoring the implementation of Fund grants; that they should promote  \u201cparticipation of multiple constituencies, including Host Country  governmental entities, donors, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based  organizations and the private sector\u201d; and that they should meet regularly  to develop plans and share information. According to U.S. government  officials who were involved in setting up the Fund and who attended the  January 2003 board meeting, the Fund may also consider other options to  enhance the functioning of CCMs, such as having those CCMs that have  been working relatively well share best practices with others or having a  member of the secretariat hold regional workshops for CCMs from several  countries. Starting in December 2002 through the spring of 2003, the Fund  held a series of regional workshops for CCM members and other  stakeholders in the Philippines, Myanmar, Senegal, and Cuba. Additional  workshops are scheduled to take place in South Africa, Ukraine, and Latin  America. According to the Fund, these workshops are providing a forum  for \u201copen dialogue,\u201d whereby the Fund can disseminate and clarify  information and receive feedback.

According to secretariat officials and one of the local fund agents we met  with, this dual approval process has delayed the approval of LFA contracts  by up to 8 weeks. The officials stated that this is significant because it has  lengthened the time required to get grant agreements completed and signed  by recipient countries. The WHO official responsible for approving the  Fund\u2019s administrative decisions said that it takes several weeks to vet key  actions, such as the LFA contracts, when they are added to his unit\u2019s  existing workload.", "In addition to creating delays, the relationship between the Fund and WHO  has led to frustration and uncertainties for Fund staff concerning the scope  of their responsibility and the authorities to whom they are accountable.  For example, although the board granted the executive director of the  Fund the authority to sign contracts with vendors and grantees, WHO must  be a party to all contracts since the executive director is technically a WHO  employee. According to officials from both the Fund and WHO, removing  the dual approval process would lessen delays and uncertainties over roles  and responsibilities.", "The board asked the secretariat to look into pursuing enhanced legal  benefits for the Fund from Swiss authorities.  An important objective for  this change is to allow the Fund to withdraw from the administrative  services agreement with the WHO while retaining tax and other  advantages.

The secretariat, the  LFA, and the principal recipient each has a role in this system. The  secretariat selects the LFAs, exercises quality control over their work, and  draws up grant agreements. Prior to selecting LFAs, the secretariat  considers their independence from principal recipients and other CCM  members in an effort to avoid potential conflicts of interest. It also  considers their expertise in overseeing financial management, disease  mitigation programs, and procurement, as well as their experience with  similar assignments. The LFAs, in turn, assess principal recipients for the  same capabilities. To ensure that the disbursement of funds will be  carefully controlled, the secretariat provides principal recipients with  limited amounts of money at a time, based on their documentation of  project results. In an effort to ensure clear definition of roles,  responsibilities and accountability, it developed guidelines for LFAs that  define their duties to assess and oversee principal recipients. For example,  the LFA\u2019s financial assessment of the principal recipient is to be completed  before the grant agreement is signed, and the secretariat is to receive and  validate a preliminary assessment before the LFA proceeds with the full  assessment. To minimize inefficiency, the preliminary assessment is to  draw on existing records of the principal recipient\u2019s performance with  other donors.", "The Fund has established requirements for principal recipients in the grant  agreement. Specifically, the agreement requires principal recipients to  maintain records of all costs they incur, and these records must be in  accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in their country  or as agreed to by the Fund. Principal recipients are to have an independent  auditor separate from the LFA and acceptable to the Fund that conducts  annual financial audits of project expenditures.

For example, the annual financial reports are to include the  cost per unit of public health products procured and the portion of funds  supporting various activities such as prevention, treatment, care,  administering the project, and enhancing local skills and infrastructure  through training and other activities. The reports are also to specify the  portion of funds used by local NGOs, international NGOs, government  agencies and other public sector organizations (e.g., U.N. agencies), the  private sector, and educational institutions.

Within 90 days after the agreement enters into force, the  principal recipient is required to submit a detailed plan for monitoring and  evaluation.  The principal recipient and the subrecipients are responsible  for selecting the appropriate indicators, establishing baselines, gathering  data, measuring progress, and preparing quarterly and annual reports. The  LFA is charged with making sure that the principal recipient monitors and  evaluates its projects and with reviewing the reports. If the LFA identifies  concerns, it is to discuss them with the principal recipient and the CCM and  may forward information to the Secretariat in Geneva.

The indicators  that the principal recipient will use to track the progress of individual  grants are expected to measure processes, outcomes, and impact. During  the first 2 years of 5-year projects, the quarterly and annual reports  submitted by the principal recipient to the LFA track steps taken in the  project implementation process. For example, a process indicator for  HIV/AIDS prevention activities could measure the dissemination of  information, such as the number of prevention brochures developed and  distributed to teenagers or other at-risk groups. Starting in the third year,  the principal recipient is expected to report on program outcomes.", "Following the HIV/AIDS prevention example, this would entail measuring  whether the information had any effect on the behavior of the targeted  population. In this example, the principal recipient would report on the  percentage of the young people or others receiving the brochures who  correctly identified ways of preventing HIV transmission and stated that  they had changed their behavior accordingly. Near the end of the project,  the principal recipient would report on its epidemiological impact by  measuring whether there has been a reduction in the incidence of disease  in the target group.", "Funds will be released to the principal recipient at intervals based on its  performance according to these indicators. The exact amounts to be  released will be calculated using its anticipated expenditures. In cases  where repeated reports demonstrate that progress is not being made, the  Fund, after consultation with the LFA and CCM, may choose to make  adjustments, including replacing the principal recipient or nonperforming  subrecipients. The key evaluation for the majority of the grants comes  after 2 years, when the Fund expects to begin seeing evidence that grant- supported activities are leading to desired outcomes. At that point, the  Fund will decide whether to continue to disburse money to grant  recipients.", "The board has agreed in principle that there should also be an independent  evaluation of the Fund\u2019s overall progress in meeting its key objective of  reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria by mobilizing and  leveraging additional resources. According to the Fund, this evaluation will  include an assessment of the performance of the board and the secretariat.

In addition, the board had not yet determined what portion of  its resources should be budgeted for this evaluation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LFAs Face Several Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In certain countries, the introduction of the local fund agent has been  marked by controversy and misconceptions, partly due to its newness, that  may delay the designation of LFAs and make it difficult for them to oversee  the implementation of grants. For example, the chair of the CCM in one of  the countries we visited, where the principal recipient is the Ministry of  Health, believed that another government ministry could serve as the LFA,  despite the Fund\u2019s explicit instructions that the LFA must be independent  from the grant recipient. In another country, key government and some  donor officials were upset over the Fund\u2019s decision to bypass existing  systems for handling donor funds. This situation contributed to resentment  of the LFA as the Fund\u2019s local representative and oversight mechanism.  A  number of stakeholders with whom we met assumed incorrectly that the  LFA was charging an exorbitant fee and deducting it from the grant. In fact,  LFA fees are funded through the secretariat, not deducted from each grant.  Payment for LFA services constitutes the single largest item in the  secretariat\u2019s budget, accounting for $16.4 million, or 42 percent of its  proposed 2003 budget. Overall, however, these fees represent only about 2  percent of estimated grant disbursements for the year, according to  secretariat officials.  Moreover, representatives from KPMG, one of the  entities designated by the Fund as an LFA, told us that they are charging the  Fund 50 percent less than they are charging other clients for similar  services.", "The Fund is aware of these problems and is attempting to address them.  According to a January 2003 report of the board\u2019s Monitoring, Evaluation,  Finance and Audit Committee, the oversight role of the LFA can create  resentment in a country if it is carried out without local participation in  problem analysis and resolution. The report cites the same example we  observed, stating that recent experience in that country showed that  existing local systems should be used as much as possible to avoid new and  unnecessary requirements that distract from, rather than support, the  Fund\u2019s goal of helping countries improve their capacity to fight disease. On  January 12, 2003, the Fund drew up guidelines on financial management  arrangements for principal recipients that offer several options, including  the use of credible, existing local systems.", "Finally, despite the Fund\u2019s having designated independence as a key factor  in the selection of LFAs, the limited number of trained personnel and  organizations in many recipient countries may impair independence,  resulting in potential conflicts of interest. Given the small pool of qualified  disease experts available for hire in some poor countries, subrecipients  recruited to implement grant activities will be competing with  subcontractors to the LFA for monitoring these disease-mitigation projects.  It is unclear whether there is sufficient expertise available to provide staff  for both of these functions. For example, in one of the countries we visited,  the NGO the LFA had hired to assess the the principal recipient\u2019s capacity  to carry out its grant activities will also be implementing a Fund project for  this principal recipient. Since effective evaluation assumes that the monitor  is independent of the implementer, achieving such independence may be a  challenge in such circumstances. Conceivably, there also may be situations  in which one U.N. organization, the U.N. Office for Project Services\u2014one  of the entities contracted by the Fund to serve as an LFA\u2014may be  overseeing another, the U.N. Development Program, serving as the  principal recipient. Fund officials have stated that they would try to avoid  this situation. The board\u2019s Monitoring, Evaluation, Finance and Audit  Committee is developing a conflict of interest policy for LFAs.  In the  meantime, the Fund has required one LFA with a potential conflict of  interest to include in its contract conflict of interest mitigation policies and  procedures to minimize this possibility.

For  example, the Fund anticipates that $194 million of grant money will be  spent on drugs in the first 2 years of second-round grants, based on the  proposals approved in that round. When other health products are  included, the total comes to $267 million, or almost half of anticipated  expenditures, for the first 2 years of round-1 grants, and $415 million,  representing a similar percentage of anticipated expenditures, for the first  2 years of round-2 grants (see fig. 5). Drugs and health products for round-2  grants are expected to grow to $1.17 billion over the full life of these  grants.", "Drug procurement is complex, as it requires strict standards for ensuring  and monitoring quality, controlling transport and storage, and tracking how  the products are used. For example, many grant recipients have plans to  purchase antiretrovirals, which block the replication of HIV and are  indispensable for treating patients living with the disease. These drugs have  strict dosing regimens, and patients must be closely monitored to ensure  that they are adhering to these regimens and do not develop adverse  reactions or resistant strains of the virus. The Fund estimates that close to  200,000 people will be treated with antiretrovirals during the first 2 years of  grants resulting from the first 2 proposal rounds and that close to 500,000 will be treated over the life of these grants.

In October 2002, the task force  provided a list of issues to the board that included    drug selection and the use of preventive, diagnostic, and related health   monitoring drug quality and compliance with country drug registration  processes for marketing and distribution;  procurement principles and responsibilities, including supplier  performance, obtaining the lowest price for quality goods, compliance  with national laws and international obligations, and domestic  production;  managing and assessing the chain of supply, including forecasting  demand, ensuring proper shipping and storage, and preventing drug  diversion;  payment issues, including direct payment and exemption from duties,  tariffs and taxes; and   ensuring that patients adhere to treatment while monitoring drug  resistance and adverse drug reactions.", "In the grant agreements, the Fund provides specific requirements for  principal recipients regarding many of these issues. The requirements are  meant to ensure the continuous availability of safe and effective drugs and  other health products at the lowest possible prices and to provide a  standard for the LFA to use in evaluating the procurement activities of the  principal recipient. For example, the requirements state that recipients  must comply with established quality standards when purchasing  medicines. The requirements also stipulate that no Fund money may be  used for procuring drugs or other health products until the Fund, through  the LFA, has verified that the principal recipient has the capacity to manage  (or oversee subrecipients\u2019 management of) procurement tasks, such as  purchasing, storing, and distributing these products in accordance with  Fund guidance, unless the Fund agrees otherwise. In one country, the Fund  issued additional procurement requirements to complement the grant  agreement, based on an assessment of the principal recipient\u2019s ability to  procure drugs and other goods.

For example, recipients are to award contracts on a  competitive basis to the extent possible and must clearly describe the  goods they are requesting when they ask for bids. They must pay no more  than a reasonable price for goods and services, keep records of all  transactions, and contract only with responsible suppliers who can  successfully deliver the goods and services and otherwise fulfill the  contract.", "The Fund encourages recipients to use international and regional  procurement mechanisms if doing so results in lower prices for quality  products. For example, in one country, the U.N. Development Program will  purchase vehicles for subrecipients because it has extensive experience  with the import process. Similarly, the health ministry of another country\u2014 the entity that will implement the grant\u2014may purchase antiretrovirals  through the Pan American Health Organization.  The Fund also encourages  recipients with procurement experience to use their existing procedures,  provided these procedures meet the requirements set forth in the grant  agreement.

The board has yet to reach a decision regarding the consequences  of noncompliance, that is, whether failure to comply would automatically  be considered a breach of the grant agreement and cause for termination of  the grant. As of April 1, 2003, the Fund has not included any language  concerning compliance with national laws and international obligations in  the grant agreement.  In the interim, however, Fund officials stated that the  Fund retains the option of using the more general termination clause in the  grant agreement in the event that a recipient is found by the appropriate  authorities to be in violation of national law or international obligations.", "Another issue on which no formal decision has been made is whether the  Fund, like the World Bank, should allow aid recipients to pay higher prices  for domestically produced medicines and other goods to develop local  manufacturing capacity. Documents prepared for the fourth board meeting  note that the benefits of paying higher prices for domestically produced  items are not clear and that it could be difficult for recipients to administer  such a pricing scheme. The documents also note that it may be beyond the  mandate of the Fund to support domestic efforts by approving higher  prices for them. This was the only issue that board members brought to a  vote, at the January 2003 meeting, and were unable to obtain the votes  necessary to reach a decision. According to the Fund, the fact that no  decision was reached means that the status quo\u2014that recipients are  encouraged to pay the lowest possible price for products of assured  quality\u2014remains. This policy is also likely to remain for the foreseeable  future, since, according to Fund officials, it is no longer on the agenda of  the Portfolio Management and Procurement Committee or the  Procurement and Supply Management Advisory Panel, the two bodies that  report to the board on issues pertaining to procurement.", "The board deferred to its June 2003 meeting the question of whether the  Fund should solicit or accept in-kind donations such as drugs on behalf of  grant recipients. The Portfolio Management and Procurement Committee  cautioned that the Fund needs to consider methods for ensuring the quality  of these products.", "While the Fund states in the grant agreements that Fund resources shall not  be used to pay taxes and duties on products purchased in the recipient  country, the Portfolio Management and Procurement Committee revisited  this issue in its report to the January 2003 board meeting.  Specifically, the  committee noted that this policy may be difficult for NGO recipients to  follow, as they have neither the authority to guarantee exemption nor the  cash reserves to cover costs when exemptions are not possible. The  committee implied that given these weaknesses, NGOs may be reluctant to  serve as principal recipients and indicated in its report that making sure  NGOs are included as principal recipients is more important than trying to  ensure that grant recipients don\u2019t pay taxes and duties. The committee also  raised a practical issue, noting that the Fund\u2019s current reporting  requirements do not provide it with the information necessary to determine  whether grantees are in fact using Fund money to pay these levies. At the  January 2003 board meeting, the Fund amended its policy on exempting  grant recipients from duties, tariffs, and taxes.

Among other things, these grants  seek to provide 500,000 people with AIDS medications and 500,000 AIDS  orphans and other vulnerable children with care and support. Although the  Fund approves grants that can be covered by pledges received, these  pledges need only be sufficient to finance the initial 2-year period of the  grant. Since the typical Fund-supported project lasts five years, this could  result in the Fund\u2019s inability to fulfill its longer-term obligation to programs  that are deemed successful at the 2-year evaluation. If all currently  approved proposals demonstrate acceptable performance after 2 years, the  Fund will require $2.2 billion more to assist these programs for an  additional 1 to 3 years. Currently, the Fund has $3.4 billion in total pledges  and nearly $3.7 billion in potential obligations from the first two proposal  rounds (see fig. 7). The Fund will only sign grant agreements based on  money received by the trustee, as opposed to pledges received.

However, ensuring adherence to this policy is difficult. According  to the secretariat, it monitors the sources of new pledges to assess whether  the pledges represent additional spending. Monitoring pledges is  problematic, however, because it can be difficult to determine how much  money was spent by a donor or multilateral institution specifically on  AIDS, TB, or malaria-related programs. According to a UNAIDS report,  pledges to the Fund from most of the G-7 countries, as well as from eight of the Development Assistance Committee governments, have thus far  been determined to add to baseline HIV/AIDS funding. Nonetheless, despite  its monitoring efforts, the Fund can only encourage, rather than require,  donors to contribute new spending rather than simply transfer funds from  related programs.", "It is also difficult for the Fund to ensure that the grants it awards will  augment existing spending at the country level. It has identified several  situations to be avoided, including allowing grants to replace budgetary  resources or other \u201cofficial development assistance,\u201d and it has taken  certain steps to ensure that the grants will in fact represent new and added  spending in the country. For example, the Fund has required all applicants  to include information in their proposals on how the funds requested would  complement and supplement existing spending and programs. In addition,  the Fund has reserved the right to terminate grants if it discovers that they  are substituting for, rather than supplementing, other resources. However,  the Fund does not have the ability to formally monitor whether grants  constitute additional spending once disbursed, and we anticipate that  doing so would be difficult. Even if the Fund succeeded in documenting  that all grant money was spent appropriately on the approved project and  that no previously allocated money for AIDS, TB, or malaria was  supplanted in the process, it still could not document the level of spending  on these diseases that would have occurred without the grant. Thus, it  could not show whether the grant in fact substituted for money that would  have been otherwise allocated. A report presented at the Fund\u2019s October  2002 board meeting proposed the development of a policy for monitoring  additionality.", "At present, lacking any formal system, the Fund may be unaware of, or  unprepared to address, situations in which its grants do not represent  additional, complementary spending. For example, an official from a  development agency that currently funds much of one country\u2019s TB  program stated that he believes the country lacks the capacity to increase  its program for TB, despite having received a TB grant in the first round.  The development agency therefore planned to transfer its current TB  funding to other health assistance projects in response to the Fund\u2019s TB  grant, raising questions of whether the grant will fulfill its purpose of  providing additional funding for TB. Similar concerns have been  expressed by other officials representing both Fund recipients and donors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring that Recipients Have the Capacity to Absorb New Funding", "paragraphs": ["Although the Fund has stated that proposals will be assessed based on  whether they have demonstrated how grants could be effectively absorbed  and used, Fund officials, donors, and others have raised concerns  regarding the actual capacity of recipients to absorb new aid.  While some  countries may have surplus labor and institutional capacity within their  health sectors, other countries may have difficulty rapidly expanding their  health sectors due to a shortage of skilled health workers or insufficient  infrastructure to deliver health services. While such capacity constraints  can be relieved over time with additional training and investment, in the  short run they could limit the effectiveness of expanded health spending.  For example, officials in one country told us that it has been slow in  disbursing its World Bank HIV/AIDS money because of difficulties in  establishing the necessary institutions to identify and distribute funds to  effective projects. In another country, government and NGO officials cited  a lack of administrative capacity in NGOs as a likely challenge to their  ability to absorb the Fund grant. The Fund is aware of these concerns and  is addressing them in a number of ways. Proposal applications must  describe the current national capacity\u2014the state of systems and services\u2014 available to respond to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. After the first round, the  Fund also added more members to the TRP to evaluate these issues in  proposals. In addition, the Fund requires LFAs to preassess principal  recipients to ensure that they are prepared to receive, disburse, and  monitor the money. On at least one occasion, the Fund decided to reduce  its initial grant disbursement to a recipient, based on concerns raised by  the LFA in the preassessment.", "The LFA preassessment does not address all potential constraints on a  country\u2019s ability to absorb new funds, notably across sectors or at the  macroeconomic level. While these capacity constraints could hinder the  effectiveness of the grant, they could also generate unintended side effects  beyond the scope of the funded project. Introducing more money into a  sector with insufficient capacity to utilize it could draw scarce resources  from other vital sectors, such as agriculture or education. For example, one  way to reduce temporary shortages of skilled health workers would be to  raise the salaries of those positions, relative to the rest of the economy.  Over time, this wage disparity will provide an incentive to increase the  number of graduates trained in the health field. However, in the short term,  it may encourage already skilled workers in other sectors to pursue higher  wages in the health sector, adversely affecting the sectors they leave. To the  extent that these other sectors are also priorities in economic  development, this could adversely affect a country\u2019s pursuit of poverty  reduction. The country coordinating mechanism model of proposal  development is intended to help avoid such problems by ensuring that  those with the most knowledge of a country\u2019s needs and capacities are  directly responsible for developing proposals. However, as discussed  earlier, many CCMs are facing challenges in operating effectively.", "The provision of large amounts of new foreign aid to countries from all  sources, including the Global Fund and bilateral and multilateral initiatives,  may also have unintended, detrimental macroeconomic implications. Large  increases in development assistance are considered critical to the  successful fight of the three diseases, as well as the achievement of long- term poverty reduction goals. Moreover, increasing the number of healthy  people in a country, such as through successful treatment, may increase its  productive capacity. However, increasing spending beyond a country\u2019s  productive capacity could result in problems, such as increased domestic inflation, that are not conducive to growth or poverty reduction.  While a  substantial share of Global Fund grant money is expected to fund imports  such as medicines\u2013-which likely have no adverse macroeconomic  implications\u2013-a significant amount will also be spent domestically on  nontraded items, such as salaries and construction expenses. Concerns  over potential macroeconomic difficulties prompted one government to  initially propose offsetting its Global Fund grant with reductions in other  health spending; however, upon further assessment the government  reconsidered and will not reduce other health spending. An International  Monetary Fund official stated that he believed that the Global Fund grants  are not generally large enough, as a share of a country\u2019s Gross Domestic  Product, to cause significant macroeconomic effects.  He added, however,  that country authorities should nonetheless monitor these grants in case  they do become significant and possibly destabilizing. The Global Fund  expects that the amount of money that it disburses will rise substantially in  the future, which\u2014along with large increases in other proposed   development assistance, such as through the U. S. Millennium Challenge  Account--\u2013could substantially increase total aid flows to certain countries  in a relatively short period of time.

In  addition, we traveled to Haiti and Tanzania, two \u201cfast-track\u201d countries  where grant agreements were about to be signed, and two countries less far  along in the process, Ethiopia and Honduras. In these four countries, we  met with a wide variety of CCM members, including high-level and other  government officials, multilateral and bilateral donors, faith-based and  other nongovernmental organizations, professional associations, and  private sector groups. In all four countries, we met with organizations  designated as the principal recipient in grant proposals. We also met with a  Fund official who was working with the CCM in Haiti. To understand the  Fund\u2019s administrative services agreement with the World Health  Organization (WHO) and its impact on the Fund\u2019s ability to quickly disburse  grants, we reviewed Fund documents pertaining to the agreement, met  with WHO and Fund officials in Geneva and spoke with a U.S. government  legal expert in Washington, D.C. We also met with a WHO official while he  was traveling in San Francisco.", "To assess the Fund\u2019s development of oversight systems to ensure financial  and program accountability, we reviewed Fund documents prepared for the  second, third, and fourth board meetings; requirements contained in the  grant agreements; and Fund working papers prepared after the fourth  board meeting that propose further clarifications and guidelines for  principal recipients and Local Fund Agents (LFAs). We also reviewed the  U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) Handbook of  indicators for programs on human immunodeficiency virus/acquired  immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and sexually transmitted  infections, Joint United Nations HIV/AIDS Program publications for  monitoring and evaluating national AIDS programs, and WHO coordinates  for charting progress against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We held  discussions with the secretariat in Geneva on fiduciary and financial  accountability and monitoring and evaluation of grant programs and  received presentations on these topics from the secretariat. In addition, we  discussed these issues with U.S. government officials from the  Departments of State and Health and Human Services and USAID, and with  officials from the World Bank. During our fieldwork in Haiti and Tanzania,  we met with representatives of the entities serving as local fund agents in  those countries (KPMG in Haiti and PricewaterhouseCoopers in Tanzania);  we also met with representatives from KPMG\u2019s Global Grants Program in  San Francisco. To further our understanding of the Fund\u2019s oversight  systems and the challenges to implementing them in recipient countries,  we met with the following groups in all four of the countries we visited:   government officials, multilateral and bilateral donors, nongovernmental  organizations, and others who will be involved in implementing Fund  grants or who had observations on the Fund\u2019s oversight systems.", "To assess the Fund's procurement guidelines, we reviewed the grant  agreements and data prepared by the Fund showing anticipated spending  on drugs and other items and met with Fund officials in Geneva. We also  interviewed a U.S. legal expert serving on the procurement and supply  management task force and reviewed documents prepared by taskforce  and the Portfolio Management and Procurement Committee at the request  of the board. To learn about the ability of grant recipients to procure goods  and services, we met with local fund agent representatives, a principal  recipient, and subrecipients.  We asked the principal recipient and  subrecipient representatives about their procurement practices, their  understanding of Fund guidance and their plans to procure medicines,  goods and services. In Washington, D.C., we met with staff from a public  health consulting firm who assessed one of the principal recipients. To  further our understanding of the procurement process, we also interviewed  representatives from several other consulting firms that assist developing  country governments and nongovernmental organizations with  procurement.", "To assess Fund efforts to mobilize resources, we analyzed pledges made to  the Fund from public and private sources as well as the Fund\u2019s  commitments to grants. We reviewed their expected future financial needs  to make new grants and finance already approved grants. In addition, we  contacted officials from the Fund to discuss their resource mobilization  efforts and strategies for dealing with a resource shortfall.", "To assess the Fund\u2019s grant-making process, we reviewed the objectives and  processes of their proposal review and approval processes. We reviewed  Fund documents, including proposal applications and guidelines from the  first and second proposal rounds. Additionally we tracked the Fund\u2019s  efforts at improving the grant-making process by reviewing documents  prepared for the Fund\u2019s first four board meetings. We also interviewed  representatives from the Fund and the technical review panel in Geneva  and Washington, D.C., and we asked government, donor, and  nongovernmental organization officials in the four recipient countries we  visited for their assessment of the proposal process and its challenges. To  assess the nature of the challenges identified and any efforts made by the  Fund to address them, we interviewed officials at the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund, and we conducted a review of relevant  economic literature. We also conducted research and reviewed data  available on global spending on HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria.", "For general background and additional perspectives on the Fund, we spoke  with representatives from the Gates Foundation, the Global AIDS Alliance,  and the Earth Institute at Columbia University.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; Geneva,  Switzerland; Ethiopia; Haiti; Honduras; and Tanzania, from April 2002  through April 2003, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Procurement Cycle", "paragraphs": ["The drug procurement cycle includes most of the decisions and actions  that health officials and caregivers must take to determine the specific drug  quantities obtained, prices paid, and quality of drugs received.
