For six states selected for variation in location and experience (AZ, DE, FL, KS, MN, and TX), GAO reviewed the contracts and rate certifications most recently approved by CMS, the terms and conditions set by CMS for the programs, and other payment documentation.

However, most of the selected states did not opt to link payments or penalties to MCO performance on MLTSS goals. These goals, which include enhancing the provision of community-based care, are developed by states and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for overseeing Medicaid.", "GAO found that CMS's oversight of state payment structures was limited. CMS expects states' MLTSS programs to enhance the provision of community-based care. However, GAO found CMS does not consistently require states to report on whether the payment structures\u2014including payment rates, incentive payments, and penalties\u2014are achieving MLTSS goals. For example, CMS required three of the selected states to report on the provision of community-based care, but did not require any such reporting from the other three states. According to federal internal control standards, federal agencies should use quality information to achieve agency objectives. Without requiring information on states' progress toward MLTSS goals, CMS will continue to pay billions of dollars to states without knowing if states have sufficient incentives for community-based care.", "In addition, GAO identified risks with CMS's oversight of the data used to set MLTSS rates, specifically the appropriateness and reliability of those data. Under federal regulations, MLTSS rates must be appropriate and adequate. To the extent that states use data that are not appropriate and reliable to set rates, the resulting rates could be too low, which could provide an incentive for MCOs to reduce care, or too high, which results in more federal spending than necessary.", "Appropriateness concerns: GAO found issues with the appropriateness of data used by two of the selected states. For example, one state used data from 2010 and 2011 to set rates for 2015. Beginning in July 2017, CMS will require rates to be based on the three most recent and complete years of data. Although CMS will allow exceptions, it has not specified criteria for what situations would warrant exceptions. Without specifying criteria, CMS's requirements may not sufficiently minimize the number of states using data of questionable appropriateness to set MLTSS rates.", "Reliability concerns: GAO and the HHS Office of Inspector General previously found evidence of reliability issues with managed care encounter data, which are the primary record of managed care services and a key source of data used to set MLTSS rates. In addition, GAO's review of state documentation indicated variation in selected states' procedures for validating the reliability of their encounter data, specifically the completeness and accuracy of the data. Beginning in July 2017, CMS will require states to validate encounter data, but CMS has not issued guidance with minimum standards for state procedures. Without minimum standards for state validation efforts, it is unclear that CMS's efforts will sufficiently minimize the risk of encounter data being incomplete or inaccurate ."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends CMS (1) require all states to report on progress toward achieving MLTSS program goals, (2) establish criteria for what situations would warrant exceptions to federal standards for data used to set rates, and (3) provide guidance with minimum standards for validating encounter data.

For many  beneficiaries, receiving care in the community is preferable, and services  such as personal care services and adult day care may allow them to  continue living in their homes. Increasing the availability of community- based care is also important to states\u2019 ability to comply with the Supreme  Court\u2019s 1999 decision in Olmstead v.

In MLTSS, managed care  organizations (MCO) are responsible for providing a specific set of  Medicaid-covered services to beneficiaries in return for a set payment per  beneficiary per month, referred to as a capitated rate. MLTSS can be a  strategy for states to expand the provision of community-based care,  which means increasing the proportion of beneficiaries that receive care  in the community versus an institution, and to deliver more integrated  services, potentially at a lower cost. At the same time, the use of  managed care assumes that the provision of appropriate services can be  achieved in a cost-effective manner for a population that is among the  most vulnerable and has particularly high health care needs. Beneficiaries  who receive MLTSS are limited in their ability to care for themselves due  to physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities or conditions.", "How states design their payment structures, including the structure for  rates, incentive payments, and penalties, affects whether states will  achieve program goals. MLTSS goals, including the goal to expand the  provision of community-based services, are determined by the states and  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency  in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for  overseeing the Medicaid program. CMS guidance sets expectations for  states seeking approval of their MLTSS programs. In particular, CMS  expects states to design their rates to enhance the provision of  community-based care. States are also required to set actuarially sound  rates; that is, rates that have been certified by an actuary as being  appropriate and adequate. In May 2016, CMS issued new rules for  Medicaid managed care that could affect how states set rates for MLTSS programs and how CMS oversees such programs. Rates that are too low  can raise concerns about quality and access, while rates that are too high  may mean that scarce Medicaid resources are diverted away from  providing services to beneficiaries.", "To better understand Medicaid MLTSS programs, you asked us to  provide information about states\u2019 payment structures and other financial  incentives, and CMS oversight of states\u2019 payment structures.

The state then submits a formal application to  CMS, and the subsequent federal review process may include  negotiations, including on the design of the payment structures.

Other states may choose to set a single rate  regardless of the beneficiary\u2019s setting of care, which is known as a  blended rate. States that use a blended rate intend for it to set a financial  incentive for MCOs to provide community-based care, because of the  generally lower cost of such care. (See fig. 3.) In addition, states can  also set incentives for MCOs\u2019 performance by linking it to certain  payments or penalties.

Specifically, for all  or part of 2015, four of the states\u2014Arizona, Delaware, Florida, and  Kansas\u2014used blended rates, where the state pays MCOs the same rate  per beneficiary regardless of the setting of care. Blended rates are  intended to set an incentive for community-based care, which generally  has lower costs. The fifth state\u2014Minnesota\u2014used a modified version of a  blended rate. The four states with blended rates made different  assumptions about the percentage of beneficiaries in community-based  care when setting rates. These assumptions affected the strength of the  financial incentive for community-based care. For example, for its rates  ending in 2015, Florida assumed each MCO\u2019s percentage of beneficiaries  receiving community-based care was 2 percentage points higher than the  MCO\u2019s actual distribution in the previous year. Thus, Florida\u2019s rate was  slightly lower than if the state used the MCO\u2019s actual distribution. The  aggregate effect of that lower rate can be significant. For example, for  one MCO with approximately 5,500 enrollees in Florida, we calculated  that the difference of 2 percentage points in calculating the blended rate  would result in approximately $475,000 less per month. The other three  states with blended rates did not use a fixed percentage increase in  setting the assumptions for the blended rates. For example, Arizona  officials said they tailored their assumptions to each MCO\u2019s past  experience and the state\u2019s expectations about the MCO\u2019s capacity, and  the assumptions could include making no increase.", "For our sixth selected state\u2014Texas\u2014it was unclear if the rate structure  set a financial incentive for community-based care. The state paid MCOs  higher rates for beneficiaries receiving institutional care than for  beneficiaries receiving community-based care. The higher institutional  rates could set an incentive for MCOs to move higher-cost beneficiaries  from the community to an institution. Texas officials said that MCOs\u2019  greater ability to control community-based utilization and payments to  providers gave them a financial incentive for community-based care. For  example, whereas Texas MCOs must pay nursing facilities a specified  rate, the MCOs may be able to negotiate lower rates with community- based providers, potentially lowering their costs compared to the rate  received for community-based care. CMS required the state to regularly  report to CMS on the proportion of beneficiaries in community-based care  to show whether or not there are changes in the proportion of such  beneficiaries.", "The selected states varied in their methods to account for the costs of  beneficiaries with particularly high costs. These methods may have  enhanced or reduced the incentives in the rate structure for community- based care.", "Beneficiaries with high-cost institutional care. In two of our  selected states, the state (and not the MCOs) was responsible for  covering certain costs of these beneficiaries. For example, Kansas  excluded from MCO responsibility the cost for beneficiaries with  intellectual or developmental disabilities in one of the state\u2019s public  institutions. Minnesota excluded from MCO responsibility the cost of  institutional care after 180 days. Instead, the states covered those  costs through FFS, which could weaken the incentive for MCOs to  manage those beneficiaries\u2019 care in such a way that keeps them from  reaching those points.", "Beneficiaries with high-cost community-based care. Three of our  selected states differed in how to cover certain costs of these  beneficiaries. For example, Florida reimbursed MCOs for a  percentage of costs of beneficiaries whose cost of community-based  care exceeded the cost of equivalent institutional care. Minnesota  paid higher rates for beneficiaries who needed more assistance with  activities of daily living and who were receiving community-based  care. These provisions could counter incentives for MCOs to shift  beneficiaries with a high cost of community-based care to institutions.  Conversely, for example, Arizona required that if a beneficiary was  projected to receive community-based care that exceeded the cost of  equivalent institutional care, the beneficiary had to agree to move to  institutional care or personally cover the additional costs of the  community-based care. This could weaken the incentive for MCOs to  manage care in such a way to reduce costs for beneficiaries at risk of  hitting the cost ceiling, because those beneficiaries\u2019 costs are likely  exceeding the rate paid to the MCO.", "Data from four of our selected states\u2014all of which had rate structures that  set incentives for community-based care\u2014indicated that the proportion of  beneficiaries receiving such care increased between 2013 and 2015. As  shown in table 1, state-reported data indicate that the percentage of  community-based beneficiaries in Arizona, Delaware, Kansas, and  Minnesota increased between 0.3 and 5.9 percentage points from 2013 to  2015. The two states with smaller increases included both an established  program (Arizona, increase of 1.2 percentage points) and a newer  program (Kansas, increase of 0.3 percentage points). The remaining two  of our six selected states, Florida and Texas, had increases in the  number of beneficiaries in community-based care, but, because of  significant changes to their programs between 2013 and 2015, there were  not comparable data to assess the difference in the percentage of  beneficiaries receiving community-based care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Selected States Did Not Link Payments to Performance on MLTSS Goals", "paragraphs": ["Most of our six selected states did not opt to link payments to MCOs\u2019  performance on MLTSS program goals, such as enhancing the provision  of community-based care and aiding beneficiaries in achieving  employment.

These measures included the rate of employment for  certain beneficiaries receiving community-based care and the number of  days of institutional care. In 2015, the state made 2 percent of the MCOs\u2019  payments\u2014$57.9 million for the three MCOs\u2014conditional on the MCOs\u2019  performance on these and other measures, but, as of June 2016, the  state had not yet determined the amounts to be returned to the MCOs  based on their performance in that year. The remaining five selected  states had no links between payments and MCOs\u2019 performance to  measures of outcomes on MLTSS program goals. Instead, they mostly  linked payments to measures of the outcomes or quality of care for  beneficiaries\u2019 physical and behavioral health, but not the outcomes of the  long-term services and supports provided. Officials from one state told  us that they do not link payment to performance on MLTSS goals,  because standardized measures for long-term services and supports are not available.

(See table 2.) For example, Florida could assess damages of  $500 per beneficiary dissatisfied with care management if the MCO failed  to achieve a satisfaction rate of 90 percent or higher. As another  example, Texas could assess damages of up to $500 per beneficiary per  day for late, inaccurate, or incomplete documentation of the MCOs\u2019  assessments of beneficiaries\u2019 needs. Data reported by our selected  states indicated that the frequency of states issuing financial penalties  varied, and when done were relatively small. In particular, three of our  selected states issued no financial penalties or sanctions in 2015 for any  reason.", "Our selected states also had different practices to monitor performance,  particularly MCO decisions for beneficiaries\u2019 service plans that detail the  level and type of care to be provided.

In addition, officials from five states told us they conduct audits or  other types of reviews of the service plans.

The reports have to cover at least nine  topic areas, such as the availability and accessibility of covered services  and the evaluation of MCO performance on quality measures. The  report must address MLTSS in covering these areas, but CMS did not  require separate reporting of information related to MLTSS, unless there  are factors in the delivery of MLTSS not addressed in the other areas.  The deadline for the first report is contingent on CMS issuing guidance on  the format and content of the reports. CMS officials said that they did not  anticipate that this guidance would direct states to include additional  MLTSS information, such as progress toward program goals. CMS  officials told us that they do not plan to do so because the requirements  should allow for state flexibility in reporting since these programs vary  among states. However, CMS could require reporting while still allowing  flexibility. For example, CMS could leverage performance measurement  information that it is requiring all states to identify for MCOs providing  MLTSS. Specifically, beginning in 2017, states must identify performance  measures for MCOs on quality of life, rebalancing, and community  integration activities, among other things. States must require MCOs to  measure and report on performance annually and submit the underlying  data that would allow the state to assess performance on the measures.

Without consistently  requiring information on state progress toward MLTSS goals, CMS will  continue to approve programs and pay billions of dollars to states without  knowing whether the payment structures are providing sufficient  incentives for MCOs to provide community-based care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Established New Rate-Setting Requirements, but Risks Remain Regarding the Use of Appropriate and Reliable Data", "paragraphs": ["CMS has established several new rate-setting requirements for states  related to the data used to set rates, including MLTSS rates. (See table  3.) These requirements focus on the appropriateness and reliability of the  data states use in rate setting, which are critical to whether the rates are  reasonable and adequate. In its annual rate development guide for 2016,  CMS increased the information it required states to provide during rate  review on the quality of the data used to set rates. CMS required states to  describe the steps taken by their actuary and others to validate the data  used to set rates. CMS specified that the information submitted needed to  address the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data. CMS  also specified that the state\u2019s actuary include their assessment of the  quality of the data. In addition, under the final rule, the agency will begin  to require states to meet additional standards for the appropriateness of  the data used to set rates beginning in July 2017. The rule requires that  states use base data that are no older than the three most recent and  complete years prior to the rate year. These new regulations also require  states to validate encounter data, which are the primary record of  managed care services and a key source of data for setting managed  care rates, and periodically audit those data, as well as financial data,  which states also may use in rate setting.", "It is unclear, however, whether CMS\u2019s implementation of the new  requirements will sufficiently minimize the risk of states using  inappropriate and unreliable data to set MLTSS rates. Under federal  regulations, in order to be actuarially sound, rates must be, among other  things, appropriate for the population to be covered and services to be  provided under a state\u2019s contract with an MCO, and adequate for the  MCO to meet requirements to ensure timely access to services, adequate  networks, and coordination and continuity of care. To the extent that  states are using data that are not appropriate or reliable, the data may not  be a good predictor of expected costs, which could result in rates that are  too high or too low. Rates that are too high have implications for MCOs  receiving more federal funding to care for beneficiaries than is necessary.  Rates that are too low may create incentives for MCOs to reduce the level  of care provided, affect the ability to attract providers, and affect the  stability of the market. We found evidence of concerns with the  appropriateness of data that states used to set rates and the reliability of  such data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appropriateness of Data", "paragraphs": ["In the rate certifications we reviewed and our interviews with state  officials, we found evidence of concerns with the appropriateness of data  used to set rates in two of our selected states:", "State did not use recent data to set rates. CMS approved rates for  calendar year 2015 for one of our selected states, Delaware, which  were developed using FFS data from 2010 and 2011. When reviewing  the state\u2019s rate methodology, CMS questioned why the state did not  use more recent data or a different type of data. The state explained  that credible data from a more recent time period were not available at  the time that the state developed its rates for calendar year 2015.  Delaware\u2019s MLTSS program\u2014established in 2012\u2014was relatively  new. In contrast, the other five states included 2013 or 2012  encounter data, as well as previous years of data in a couple of  cases, to set their rates for all or part of 2015.", "State did not rebase rates when newer data were available.", "Officials in Arizona, a state with an MLTSS program that has been in  place for over 20 years, told us that the state used the same years of  base data to set the rates paid to MCOs within the 5-year contract  period. Thus, by the fifth year, the base data used to set the rates  would be over 5 years old. CMS officials told us that they were  aware of Arizona\u2019s policy and that it was a concern that this state was  not rebasing\u2014using updated data to set rates\u2014more frequently. They  also said that they are aware of other states that rebase their rates  infrequently, which officials attributed to the states lacking more  recent, sufficiently reliable data for rate setting.", "CMS has not determined the extent to which it will allow these two  examples to continue under the new requirement that the data used to set  rates be no older than the three most recent and complete years. Under  the new rule, a state that cannot fulfill this requirement would need to  request from CMS an exception from the new data requirement. CMS  officials told us that there can be circumstances where it is acceptable for  states to use older data to set rates, such as during the first few years of  implementing MLTSS programs and when the state has limited managed  care experience. Similarly, CMS officials told us there may be instances  in which a state would not rebase every year and states are not required  to rebase annually. As of July 2016, CMS officials told us that they had  not determined what situations would warrant exceptions from the new  data requirements and did not know if they would issue guidance on the  requirement.

For  example, in 2015, the OIG reported that 8 of 38 states reviewed did  not report any encounter data for part of fiscal year 2011 to CMS by  the required deadline. The OIG also found that 11 states did not  report required encounter data for all of their MCOs or other managed  care entities, indicating a lack of completeness. Similarly, in 2015, we  reported reliability issues with the encounter data, from calendar year  2010, reported by 6 states.", "Rate setting documents indicated variation in data validation efforts  among our selected states. In the rate certifications we reviewed, one  of our selected states (Arizona) described steps taken by the state  Medicaid agency to validate the data used to set rates. Specifically,  the rate certification for Arizona stated that the state Medicaid agency  used encounter data validation studies, which included reviewing and  auditing the data for accuracy, timeliness, and completeness, and  compared the data to MCO financial statements. In the other five  states, the rate certifications did not describe any validation  procedures taken by the state Medicaid agency, which, under the  actuarial standards of practice, is responsible for the accuracy and  completeness of the data as the supplier of the data. Instead, the rate  certifications described other steps taken by the actuary to check  other aspects of the data, including reasonableness and consistency.  In three of these states, the rate certifications also described steps  taken by the actuary to compare the encounter data to other data  sources.", "While the new rule requires states to validate the completeness and  accuracy of encounter data, CMS has not issued guidance with minimum  standards for state data validation procedures and does not plan to do so.  CMS officials noted that they had previously issued information to states  on validation procedures, including a toolkit for states to use when  establishing their encounter data systems and a data validation protocol  that could be used as part of required external quality reviews (EQR).  CMS issued the encounter data toolkit, in part, because the agency  recognized the importance of encounter data for setting rates, and that  encounter data are only useful to the extent that they are complete and  accurate. In the toolkit, CMS suggested that states need to check the  data by conducting front-end edits of the data, as well as validating data  through reports and setting benchmarks. Similarly, the EQR protocol on  validating encounter data included detailed steps for a state to determine  the validity\u2014completeness and accuracy\u2014of encounter data reported by  MCOs. This protocol, however, is optional, and it is unclear whether it is  being used by states.", "Further, CMS may not receive complete information from states on their  validation efforts, and, therefore, would not be able to assess whether  state efforts are sufficient. CMS has required states to submit a  description of validation efforts for 2016 rates, and its guidance indicates  that this should include steps taken by the actuary and others, including  the state, MCOs, and external quality reviewers. However, CMS officials  said that they expect that the information provided will likely focus on the  work performed by the actuary, and may not include information on steps  the state performed to validate the data submitted by MCOs. The new  rule states that CMS will assess state encounter data submissions to  ensure that the data meet criteria for accuracy and completeness, which  may be another means for identifying certain weaknesses in states\u2019  validation efforts.", "States\u2019 validation procedures are a critical check of the reliability of data  for, among other purposes, setting rates. CMS has required states to set  certain standards for enrollee encounter data in the states\u2019 contracts with  their MCOs. However, required state validation checks are needed to  ensure that these are consistently implemented by MCOs.

Both states and CMS  have the goal of enhancing the provision of community-based care, which  many beneficiaries may prefer, and which can result in savings for states  and the federal government. Achieving these goals depends, in part, on  states establishing payment structures that align financial incentives for  MCOs with those goals, and setting rates that are adequate and  appropriate. CMS plays an important role in overseeing states\u2019 payment  structures, both by monitoring whether states\u2019 payment structures are  achieving Medicaid program goals, including enhancing the provision of  community-based care, and assessing whether states\u2019 rates comply with  actuarial soundness requirements.", "CMS\u2019s new requirements under the May 2016 rule have created an  opportunity for enhanced federal visibility over the effectiveness of  MLTSS programs, which serve some of the most vulnerable Medicaid  beneficiaries. For example, the requirements for annual reports on states\u2019  managed care programs and for states to identify MLTSS measures and  require MCOs to report on them, if connected during implementation,  could provide CMS with timely information on progress toward program  goals within a given state and nationally. Federal oversight is critical given  our findings that states were often not linking payment to MCO  performance on MLTSS goals. Without requiring all states to report on  progress toward program goals, CMS will continue to pay billions of  dollars for state programs without knowing whether they provide sufficient  financial incentives for providing community-based care, which has  implications both for beneficiaries and on federal costs.", "CMS has taken a number of important steps to improve state rate-setting  practices, including rates for MLTSS programs. Requirements under the  new 2016 managed care rule, particularly the new data standards and  validation requirements for encounter data, have the potential to better  ensure that states are using appropriate and reliable data to set the rates  paid to MCOs. However, CMS has not established criteria for what  situations would warrant exceptions to the data standards, and has no  plans to do so. Without clear criteria, states may continue to seek  approval for rates that are based on data of questionable  appropriateness, as was the case in Arizona and Delaware. With regard  to encounter data validation requirements, CMS does not plan to issue  any guidance or require minimum standards for state procedures, despite  a history of data reliability concerns and lack of state compliance with  reporting requirements. Without strong data, states and the federal  government risk paying rates that are too low, which could result in quality  and access concerns for beneficiaries, or rates that are too high, which  diverts limited Medicaid dollars to MCO profit and away from needed  care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve oversight of states\u2019 payment structures for MLTSS, we  recommend that the Administrator of CMS take the following three  actions:  1.
