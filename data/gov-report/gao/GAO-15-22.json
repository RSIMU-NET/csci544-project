To perform this work, GAO analyzed Navy and contractor data, and scheduling best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which the lead Ford-class ship, CVN 78, will be delivered by its current March 2016 delivery date and within the Navy's $12.9 billion estimate is dependent on the Navy's plan to defer work and costs to the post-delivery period. Lagging construction progress as well as ongoing issues with key technologies further exacerbate an already compressed schedule and create further cost and schedule risks. With the shipbuilder embarking on one of the most complex phases of construction with the greatest likelihood for cost growth, cost increases beyond the current $12.9 billion cost cap appear likely. In response, the Navy is deferring some work until after ship delivery to create a funding reserve to pay for any additional cost growth stemming from remaining construction risks. This strategy will result in the need for additional funding later, which the Navy plans to request through its post-delivery and outfitting budget account. However, this approach obscures visibility into the true cost of the ship and results in delivering a ship that is less complete than initially planned.", "CVN 78 will deploy without demonstrating full operational capabilities because it cannot achieve certain key requirements according to its current test schedule. Key requirements\u2014such as increasing aircraft launch and recovery rates\u2014will likely not be met before the ship is deployment ready and could limit ship operations. Further, CVN 78 will not meet a requirement that allows for increases to the size of the crew over the service life of the ship. In fact, the ship may not even be able to accommodate the likely need for additional crew to operate the ship without operational tradeoffs. Since GAO's last report in September 2013, post-delivery plans to test CVN 78's capabilities have become more compressed, further increasing the likelihood that CVN 78 will not deploy as scheduled or will deploy without fully tested systems.", "The Navy is implementing steps to achieve the $11.5 billion congressional cost cap for the second ship, CVN 79, but these are largely based on ambitious efficiency gains and reducing a significant amount of construction, installation, and testing\u2014work traditionally completed prior to ship delivery. Since GAO last reported in September 2013, the Navy extended CVN 79's construction preparation contract to allow additional time for the shipbuilder to reduce cost risks and incorporate lessons learned from construction of CVN 78. At the same time, the Navy continues to revise its acquisition strategy for CVN 79 in an effort to ensure that costs do not exceed the cost cap, by postponing installation of some systems until after ship delivery, and deferring an estimated $200 million - $250 million in previously planned capability upgrades of the ship's combat systems to be completed well after the ship is operational. Further, if CVN 79 construction costs should grow above the legislated cost cap, the Navy may choose to use funding intended for work to complete the ship after delivery to cover construction cost increases. As with CVN 78, the Navy could choose to request additional funding through post-delivery budget accounts not included in calculating the ship's end cost. Navy officials view this as an approach to managing the cost cap. However, doing so impairs accountability for actual ship costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider revising the cost cap legislation to improve accountability of Ford-class construction costs, by requiring that all work included in the initial ship cost estimate is counted against the cost cap.

This is a complex and iterative  process that requires sufficient time for discovering problems inherent  with the start-up and initial operation of a system, performing corrective  work, and retesting to ensure that the issues have been resolved.  However, as a result of previous schedule delays, the shipbuilder  compressed the shipboard test plan, resulting in a schedule that leaves  insufficient time for discovery and correction should problems arise.  Further, the construction delays discussed above directly affect the  builder\u2019s ability to test the ship\u2019s hull, mechanical, and electrical systems,  thus increasing the likelihood of additional testing delays.

The shipboard test  programs for EMALS and the advanced weapons elevators are currently  under way, while AAG and DBR testing is scheduled to commence in  fiscal year 2015. However, developmental testing for AAG, EMALS, and  DBR is taking place concurrently at separate land-based facilities (as well  as aboard the ship).

In addition, the  AAG contractor has to complete over 50 modifications to the systems  before shipboard testing can begin; these modifications are needed to  address issues identified during developmental testing at the land-based  test site. As we previously found, AAG experienced several failures  during land-based testing, which led to redesign and modification of  several subsystems, most notably the water twisters\u2014a device used to  absorb energy during an aircraft arrestment. CVN 78 program officials  expressed concerns that the rework cannot be completed on time to  support the current shipboard test schedule, and attribute the delays to  the immaturity of AAG when it was installed on the ship.", "The shipboard test program is further at risk because additional design  changes and modifications to the shipboard AAG units remain likely. This  is because the Navy will now be conducting land-based testing of AAG  even as shipboard testing is under way. As a result of issues discussed  above, the Navy further delayed the schedule for land-based testing (as  shown in figure 2) and changed the test strategy to better ensure that it  could meet the schedule for testing live aircraft aboard the ship. AAG\u2019s  previous land-based test plan was to sequentially test each aircraft type  planned for CVN 78 as a simulated load on a jet car track. After  completing jet car track testing for all aircraft types, the actual aircraft  were to be tested with the AAG system on a runway. This strategy  allowed for discovery of issues with each aircraft type prior to advancing  to the next stage of testing. However, earlier this year the AAG program  office changed its strategy so that each aircraft type will be tested  sequentially at the jet car track and runway sites. Once an aircraft  completes both types of testing, testers will re-configure the sites to test  the next type of aircraft, according to AAG program officials. Figure 3  shows the difference in AAG test strategies along with the overall ship  test schedule. The program office plans to complete this revised testing  approach with the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter first, as this aircraft will  be most in use aboard the carrier.", "While the Navy stated that this change was necessary to ensure that at  least one aircraft type would be available to certify the system for  shipboard testing, it further increases the potential for discovering issues  well past shipboard testing and even ship delivery.", "The shipbuilder began EMALS activation and shipboard testing activities  in August 2014, as planned.

To improve the likelihood of meeting  the March 2016 delivery date and to compensate for potential cost  growth, the Navy is (1) removing work from the scope of the construction  contract and (2) deferring purchase and installation of some mission- related systems provided by the government to the shipbuilder until after  ship delivery. Consequently, completion of CVN 78 may not occur until  years later than initially planned.", "According to the CVN 78 program office, this approach creates a funding  reserve to cover cost growth due to unknowns in the shipboard test  program, particularly given that many of the ship\u2019s systems are being  operated and tested for the first time in a maritime environment. However,  the value of the deferred work may not be adequate to fully fund all  remaining costs needed to produce an operational ship.

However, now the number of berthings  is fixed and the ship cannot accommodate additional manpower without  significant design changes. Further, the Navy requires new ship designs,  including CVN 78, to provide a habitability margin\u2014a percentage of extra  berths above the projected ship\u2019s force to accommodate potential  personnel growth throughout the service life of the ship. This margin  includes berths as well as support services for personnel aboard the ship,  such as food and sanitation facilities. Given current manning projections  and available accommodations, as shown in table 7, the Navy recognizes  that CVN 78 falls well short of meeting its required habitability margin.  This required margin is equivalent to 10 percent of the ship\u2019s force or 263  berths. As a result, the CVN 78 program office plans to request a waiver  for this requirement from the Chief of Naval Operations.", "In fact, the carrier currently has so few extra berths that it can only  accommodate a slight increase in personnel. And the Navy\u2019s estimated  accommodation needs do not take into account the likelihood that  additional personnel will be needed above and beyond the Navy\u2019s current  projected ship\u2019s force (2,628 sailors). In addition, spare berthing is also  used for personnel temporarily assigned to the ship, such as inspectors,  trainers, or visitors. If CVN 78 must enlarge its ship\u2019s force as well as  accommodate personnel temporarily assigned to the ship, it is likely that  no actual accommodations would be available. Consequently, CVN 78  must be \u201cmanning neutral,\u201d so that personnel coming aboard must be  matched by personnel debarking, in accordance with the ship\u2019s  operational needs and personnel specialties.", "This situation is further exacerbated because the Navy will need to  operate CVN 78 with a greater percentage of its crew than the Nimitz  class. According to the Navy\u2019s most recent (2011) analysis of manning  options for CVN 78, staffing the ship at less than 100 percent; that is, with  fewer personnel than the current projected total force of 4,533, had an  adverse effect on quality of life at sea because the crew had to perform  additional duties or remain on duty for longer periods. This manning  analysis also found that reducing staffing to 85 percent\u2014which is typical  for a Nimitz-class ship\u2014compromised ship operations. The analysis  concluded that careful management of personnel specializations will be  needed and recommended cross-training personnel in key departments  to minimize the risk to ship operations.

If the Navy discovers significant issues  during testing, or events cause additional delays to testing, it will have to  choose whether deploy a ship without having fully tested systems or  delay deployment until testing is complete.", "To help manage this risk, the Navy plans to divide operational testing into  two phases. According to program officials, this approach will allow  developmental testing, deficiency correction, and integration testing to  continue on the mission-related systems installed after ship delivery and  on those systems that are not required to support the first phase of  operational testing. The first phase of operational testing will focus on  testing the ship\u2019s ability to accomplish basic tasks by stressing the ship\u2019s  crew, aviation facilities, and the combat and mission-related systems  installed prior to delivery under realistic peacetime operating conditions.  The second phase of operational testing incorporates embarked strike  groups and other detachments that support operations and tests CVN  78\u2019s ability to conduct major combat operations, particularly the tactical  employment of the air wing in simulated joint, allied, coalition, and strike  group environments. The goal is to stress CVN 78\u2019s aviation, combat and  mission-related systems, particularly those systems installed after ship  delivery.

Even if the Navy meets the current schedule, it will not  complete all necessary testing in the time remaining before the ship is  deployment ready. This issue will be further exacerbated if land-based or  shipboard testing discussed earlier reveals significant problems with the  ship\u2019s systems, as the time needed to address such issues may interfere  with the ship\u2019s integration and operational test phases. Navy officials  responsible for operational testing stated that they will only conduct  operational testing when shipboard systems are deemed ready. However,  neither the CVN 78 program office nor the Navy\u2019s operational test  personnel know how often system testing can be deferred before  affecting the schedule for operational testing on other systems,  particularly given the interoperation of systems on a carrier. For example,  the DBR supports ship combat systems and simultaneously conducts air  traffic control.

While performance to date has been  better than that of CVN 78, early indicators suggest that the Navy is  unlikely to realize anticipated efficiencies at the level necessary to meet  cost and labor hour reduction goals. In its May 2013 report to Congress  on CVN 79 program management and cost control measures, the Navy  stated that 15-25 percent fewer labor hours (about 7 million to 12 million  hours) will be needed to construct CVN 79 as compared to CVN 78.  Although the Navy and shipbuilder continue to look for labor hour  reduction opportunities, thus far, shipbuilder representatives have  identified improvements that they stated will save about 800,000 labor  hours. As we identified in September 2013, many of the proposed labor  hour reductions are attributed to lessons learned during construction of  CVN 78 and revising CVN 79\u2019s build plan to perform pre-outfitting work  earlier in the build process. This is because work completed earlier in the  build process, such as in a shop environment, is more efficient and less  costly than work done later on the ship where spaces are more difficult to  maneuver within. In addition, the shipbuilder\u2019s revised build plan  consolidates and increases the size of superlifts\u2014fabricated units and  block assemblies that are grouped together and lifted into the dry dock\u2014 to form larger sections of the ship. Other notable labor hour savings  initiatives involve increased use of new welding technologies and  improved cable installation techniques.", "Construction of CVN 79 is still in the initial stages, and most of the  projected cost savings and labor hour reduction opportunities are in  structural units and parts of the ship that are not yet under construction.  However, there are indications that achieving the anticipated 7 million to  12 million hour reduction goal will be challenging. As of the end of March  2014, the shipbuilder had completed fabrication of 205 structural units\u2014 about 18 percent of the ship\u2019s total\u2014with over a hundred more in various  stages of fabrication. Although the ship is still in the early stages of  construction, the cumulative labor hour reductions for the completed units  fell short of the Navy and shipbuilder\u2019s expected reduction by about 3.5  percent, as shown in figure 5. Program officials stated that while the  cumulative reduction has not yielded the expected results, a number of  the structural units were completed prior to the shipbuilder\u2019s  implementation of labor saving initiatives. They further added that  completed units, more representative of remaining work, have yielded  approximately a 16 percent reduction in labor hours for fitters and  welders.", "In addition, the shipbuilder\u2019s scheduling processes may further limit  insight into the effectiveness of these initiatives. We evaluated the  shipbuilder\u2019s processes and tools used to plan and schedule work against  GAO\u2019s best practices in scheduling. We identified scheduling practices  that may interfere with the shipbuilder\u2019s and Navy\u2019s ability to accurately  manage and monitor the construction schedule and the way in which the  shipbuilder allocates labor, equipment, and material resources. In  particular, the shipbuilder\u2019s enterprise resource management system  (which tracks use of labor and materials) and master construction  schedule (which tracks the time required to complete work packages) are  stand-alone, independent systems, which means that changes in one  system are not automatically updated in the other. Consequently, the  shipbuilder\u2014and subsequently the government\u2014lacks real time insight in  to whether resources are being used according to schedule. This lack of  insight limits management\u2019s ability to effectively respond to delays, thus  driving inefficiencies into the build process, and also limits the  shipbuilder\u2019s ability to take advantage of opportunities when work is  completed ahead of schedule. Although the shipyard is transitioning to a  new scheduling software program, the shipbuilder does not plan to revise  its existing scheduling and resource management process to enable  better insight for CVN 79. The legacy scheduling system the shipbuilder  employed did not allow for data to be exported to the government. The  new scheduling system has the ability to allow for increased Navy  oversight since the data are exportable, thus allowing, among other  things, the ability to independently examine the effects of schedule  slippage or realism of the shipbuilder\u2019s estimated labor needs. According  to program officials, the Navy intends to incorporate this data as a  deliverable item in the CVN 79 construction contract.", "Even with the shipbuilder\u2019s improvements, reducing construction of CVN  79 by approximately 7 million to 12 million labor hours as compared to  CVN 78 would be unprecedented in aircraft carrier construction. As  shown in table 8, with each successive aircraft carrier build, the number  of labor hours needed to complete construction has, at most, decreased  by 9.3 percent as compared to the previous ship (with CVN 69 compared  to CVN 68 accounting for the largest percentage decrease). Although  CVN 78 and CVN 79 are similar to CVN 68 and CVN 69 in that there is a  first-to-second ship of a class transition, in most instances sizeable labor  hour reductions only occurred as a result of constructing two aircraft  carriers though a single contract, rather than acquiring the ships  individually through separate construction contracts as is the case with  the Ford class."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy\u2019s Revised Acquisition Strategy May Create Near-Term Cost Savings but Leads to Uncertainties in Final Ship Costs", "paragraphs": ["The Navy planned to award the CVN 79 detail design and construction  contract in late fiscal year 2013, but subsequently delayed the award and  extended the construction preparation contract because negotiations with  the shipbuilder were taking longer than the Navy anticipated.

In the meantime, more work is now being completed  under the construction preparation contract, with almost 60 percent of the  ship\u2019s total structural units under the CP contract, as shown in table 9  below. According to program officials, this work accounts for about 20  percent of the ship\u2019s overall construction effort.", "By extending the CP contract, the program office expects that it will  reduce material costs by 10-20 percent from CVN 78 and prevent late  deliveries of items, such as valves, that led to significant material  shortfalls and out-of-sequence construction work and contributed to that  ship\u2019s cost growth, as we noted in our September 2013 report. Under the  Navy\u2019s material procurement strategy, approximately 95 percent of CVN  79\u2019s material to be procured by the shipbuilder was under contract as of  September 2014.", "In addition, the Navy recently completed an affordability and capability  review of CVN 79 in an effort to further reduce construction costs and  shipbuilding requirements to ensure that it could meet the $11.5 billion  cost cap\u2014which Navy officials stated was otherwise unachievable. In  response, the Navy plans to (1) institute cost savings measures by  reducing some work and equipment; (2) revise the acquisition strategy to  shift more work to post-delivery\u2014including installation of mission  systems\u2014while still meeting statutory requirements for deploying CVN  79; and (3) deliver the ship with the same baseline capability as CVN  78\u2014postponing a number of planned mission system upgrades and  modernizations until future maintenance periods. Program officials told us  they plan to seek approval to initiate these changes at CVN 79\u2019s  upcoming program review with the Office of the Secretary of Defense,  which is now scheduled for December 2014, in advance of the detail  design and construction contract award.", "Most notably, the Navy plans to depart from its planned installation of  DBR on CVN 79, in favor of an alternative radar system, which it expects  to provide a better technological solution at a lower cost. By seeking  competitively awarded offers, Navy officials anticipate realizing savings of  about $180 million for CVN 79. Final determination of CVN 79\u2019s radar  solution is not scheduled to occur until after March 2015, at least 3  months after the estimated detail design and construction contract award.  It is around this time that the program office anticipates it will solicit  proposals from prospective bidders. Program officials told us that they  intend to work within the current design parameters of the ship\u2019s island,  which they say would limit extensive redesign and reconfiguration work to  accommodate the new radar. While the extent of redesign work is  unknown, such a change will still result in additional ship construction  costs, which could offset the Navy\u2019s estimate of DBR savings.", "Other cost savings measures are wide ranging and include eliminating one of the four AAG units planned for the ship (Nimitz- class carriers have 3 operational arresting units); eliminating redundant equipment requirements such as the ship\u2019s  emergency power unit for the steering gear and spare low pressure  air compressors; and modifying test requirements for certain mechanical systems.", "In addition to these cost savings measures, the CVN 79 program office is  proposing a two-phased approach for ship construction and delivery.  Although the details of the Navy\u2019s revised acquisition strategy continue to  evolve, the basic premise is that delivery by the shipbuilder will consist of  only the hull, mechanical and electrical aspects of the ship (referred to as  phase I), followed by completion of remaining construction work and  installation of the warfare and communications systems during the post- delivery period (referred to as phase II). At ship delivery, CVN 79 will  have its full propulsion capability, as well as the core systems for safe  navigation and crew safety; and necessary equipment to demonstrate  flight deck operations, such as EMALS and AAG. All remaining  construction work, primarily consisting of the procurement and installation  of several warfare and communications systems, will be completed post- delivery. The program office currently plans to maintain the ship\u2019s 2023  delivery date, but as shown in figure 6, the revised strategy extends the  acquisition schedule and the ship\u2019s deployment ready date by about 15  months. Program officials stated that despite this delay in the schedule it  would still meet the statutorily required minimum number of operational  aircraft carriers because CVN 79 would still be deployment ready shortly  after USS Nimitz (CVN 68) is currently slated to retire in fiscal year 2025.", "As currently planned, the revised strategy, by design, will result in a less  capable and less complete ship at delivery. According to CVN 79 program  officials, reducing the shipbuilder\u2019s scope of work, along with a reduction  in some construction requirements, will lead to negotiating more favorable  pricing of the detail design and construction contract. In addition, they  noted that maintaining the current delivery schedule will deliberately allow  for a slower pace of construction, thus potentially requiring less use of  overtime or leased labor. Further, program officials state that delaying  installation of warfare and communications systems\u2014such as those  systems with high obsolescence risk\u2014can potentially limit procuring  equipment that has been surpassed by technology advances by the time  the ship begins phase II of the Navy\u2019s revised strategy. Finally, Navy  officials believe that adopting this approach will enable the program to  reduce costs by introducing additional competition for the ship\u2019s systems  and installation work after delivery.", "While the two-phased strategy may enable the program to initially stay  within the legislated cost cap, it will transfer the costs of a number of  known capability upgrades previously included in the CVN 79 baseline to  other (non-CVN 79 shipbuilding) accounts. As shown in table 10, the  program office plans to defer installation of a number of systems to future  maintenance periods.", "Based on current estimates, the value of the deferred systems is about  $200 million - $250 million. Moreover, this strategy will result in deferring  installation of systems and equipment needed to accommodate the  carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft (F-35C) until fiscal year  2027 at the earliest.", "Further, should construction costs grow above estimates, the Navy may  subsequently choose to use funding intended for phase II work to pay for  construction cost increases without increasing the cost cap. The Navy  would have this option because additional funding through post delivery  budget accounts are not included in calculating the ship\u2019s end cost,  similar to the aforementioned situation with CVN 78. According to Navy  officials, this approach allows the program to manage the cost cap  without seeking statutory authority."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Constructing and delivering an aircraft carrier is a complex undertaking.  The Ford-class program, in particular, has faced a steep challenge due to  the development, installation and integration of numerous technologies\u2014 coupled with optimistic budget and schedule. The Ford class is intended  to provide significant operational advantages over the Nimitz class.  However, with about 80 percent of the lead ship constructed, the program  continues to struggle with construction inefficiencies, development issues,  testing delays, and reliability shortfalls. These are issues that have been  mounting for a number of years. Now, as the program embarks on its  most challenging phase\u2014shipboard testing\u2014additional cost increases in  excess of the $2.3 billion since 2009 appear likely. To manage this risk,  the Navy is creating a cost buffer by deferring construction work and  installation of mission-related systems to the post-delivery period. This  strategy may provide a funding cushion in the near term, but it may not be  sufficient to cover all potential cost increases. After raising the cost cap  several times, the Navy is now managing the cost cap by reducing the  scope of the delivered ship and is considering paying for the deferred  scope through a budget account normally used for post-delivery activities.  This contradicts the purpose of the congressional cost cap, which is to  hold the Navy accountable for the total cost estimate for buying a  deployable ship.", "Further, after an investment of at least $12.9 billion, CVN 78 may not  achieve improved operational performance over the Nimitz class of  aircraft carriers as promised for some time to come. Reliability shortfalls  and development uncertainties in key Ford-class systems will prevent the  ship from demonstrating its required sortie generation rate before initial  deployments. Personnel accommodation restrictions resulting from the  ship\u2019s design has the potential of causing operational limitations that the  Navy will have to manage closely\u2014a constraint that does not exist in the  Nimitz class. We previously recommended re-assessing these  requirements; the Navy agreed that such an analysis is appropriate, but  one that it would not pursue until the conclusion of operational testing. As  we previously concluded, waiting until this point would be too late to make  effective tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and performance for follow-on  ships.", "As the Navy prepares to award the detail design and construction  contract for the next Ford-class ship, CVN 79, it is clear that achieving the  cost cap will be challenging. While the Navy and the shipbuilder are  working to reduce costs, the Navy\u2019s ability to achieve the congressional  cost cap relies, in part, on deferring planned capability improvements until  later maintenance periods. From an accountability and oversight  standpoint, it would be preferable to keep the scope of the delivered ship  constant\u2014an essential component of a baseline\u2014and raise the cost cap  accordingly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["The legislated cost cap for Ford-class aircraft carrier construction  provides a limit on procurement funds. However, the legislation also  provides for adjustments to the cost cap. To understand the true cost of  each Ford-class ship, Congress should consider revising the cost cap  legislation to ensure that all work included in the initial ship cost estimate  that is deferred to post-delivery and outfitting account is counted against  the cost cap. If warranted, the Navy would be required to seek statutory  authority to increase the cap."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are not making any new recommendations, but our recommendations  from our September 2013 report remain valid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment. In its written  comments, which are reprinted in appendix III, DOD agreed with much of  the report but disagreed with our position on cost cap compliance. In  particular, DOD disagreed that a change in cost cap legislation is  necessary because it believes all procurement funds are counted toward  the cost cap. While it is true that the current cost cap legislation does  require the inclusion of all procurement funds, up to this point the Navy  has not included funding for outfitting and post delivery costs in its end  cost estimates. Further, the current legislation allows the Navy to make  changes to the ships\u2019 outfitting and post-delivery budget accounts without  first seeking statutory authority. In the event that costs increase above the  Navy\u2019s current estimates, the Navy is considering deferring work until the  post-delivery period and funding it through the outfitting and post delivery  accounts, which would limit visibility into the ship\u2019s true end cost. Our  intention is not necessarily, as DOD states, to keep the post-delivery and  procurement accounts separate, but rather to create a stable cost  baseline for accountability and oversight purposes.", "DOD also disagreed with our conclusion that constructing CVN 79 within  the current cost cap might not be achievable, but agreed that it will be  challenging. DOD stated that the cost cap for CVN 79 is achievable  largely due to the Navy\u2019s two-phased acquisition approach, which is now  intended to deliver the next carrier with the same capabilities as CVN 78.  We agree that reducing the scope of CVN 79 prior to ship delivery should  also reduce the cost estimate in the near term. As we noted in our report,  however, the Navy initially included planned capability improvements in  CVN 79\u2019s baseline estimate. These improvements will now occur during a  later maintenance period, the costs of which are to be shifted to other  (non-CVN 79 shipbuilding) accounts at a later date. While the Navy\u2019s  approach to CVN 79\u2019s cost estimate may initially appear to meet the cost  cap, it serves to obscure the ship\u2019s true cost. As we concluded in the  report, from an accountability standpoint, it would be preferable to keep  the scope of CVN 79 constant and raise the cost cap accordingly, if  needed.", "In addition, DOD provided technical comments that were incorporated as  appropriate.

We also  visited the lead ship of the Ford-class carriers, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN  78), to observe construction progress and improve our understanding of  the installation progress of the critical technologies aboard CVN 78. We  evaluated Navy and contractor documents outlining cost and schedule  parameters for CVN 78 Navy budget submissions, contract performance  reports, quarterly performance reports, and program schedules and  briefings. In addition, we reviewed the shipbuilder\u2019s Earned Value  Management data and developed our own cost and labor hour estimates  at ship completion and compared this with data provided by the Navy and  shipbuilder. We also relied on our prior work evaluating the Ford-class  program and shipbuilding best practices to supplement the above  analyses.

We also conducted an analysis of the shipbuilder\u2019s  scheduling systems and processes that are used for constructing CVN 78  and assessed this against GAO\u2019s scheduling best practices. We  attempted to conduct a similar analysis of CVN 79\u2019s schedule. However,  the integrated master schedule used for construction\u2014that is maintained  by the shipbuilder\u2014was not up to date and did not reflect the status of  advanced construction work at the time of our analysis.
