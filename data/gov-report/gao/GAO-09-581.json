Since then, FDA, GAO, and others have raised concerns regarding FDA's ability to meet its oversight responsibilities. GAO was asked to review the resources supporting FDA's medical product oversight responsibilities. GAO examined trends in (1) FDA's funding and staffing resources for its medical product oversight responsibilities from fiscal years 1999 through 2008, and (2) FDA's medical product oversight responsibilities during this same period. GAO analyzed FDA data on the agency's resources and workload, reviewed relevant federal laws, and interviewed FDA officials. GAO also examined more-detailed data on FDA's fiscal year 2004 through 2008 resources and workload in four key areas, representing a range of FDA's oversight responsibilities, both before and after a medical product is marketed in the United States."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Funding and staffing resources for FDA's medical product programs increased between fiscal years 1999 and 2008, primarily as a result of increased user fees paid by industry, which are made available through appropriations acts to support the agency's processes for reviewing new medical products. Total funding increased from about $562 million in fiscal year 1999 to about $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2008, with user fee funding accounting for more than half of this increase. A large and growing portion of funding supported activities for which user fees are collected, resulting in a declining share of funding available for other activities. FDA officials said that this has seriously limited the agency's ability to fulfill its oversight responsibilities in some areas, particularly those not funded with user fees. FDA faced challenges fulfilling and managing its growing medical product oversight responsibilities, which agency officials attributed to resource constraints. FDA's statutory responsibilities grew during this period and a growing number of medical products subject to FDA oversight and establishments manufacturing these products for the U.S. market also added to the agency's workload. However, FDA could not provide data showing its workload and accomplishments in some areas, such as its review of reports identifying potential safety issues with specific medical products. Without such information, FDA cannot develop complete and reliable estimates of its resource needs. While FDA officials said that the funding amounts requested for and provided to FDA during the past 2 years will permit the agency to respond to its most urgent needs and priorities, officials also noted that they did not receive enough resources to meet some statutory requirements, such as biennially inspecting certain manufacturing establishments. Furthermore, officials said that the agency faces significant challenges fulfilling its mission to oversee the safety and effectiveness of medical products."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Twenty years ago, we reported that the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA), an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  was concerned that it lacked sufficient funding and staffing resources.

We concluded that,  while the agency was experiencing significant resource challenges, it  lacked a comprehensive and reliable basis to substantiate its estimates of  resource requirements. On several occasions since then, senior FDA  officials have testified before Congress and the agency issued a report  noting that the agency\u2019s funding and staffing resources do not enable it to  meet its growing oversight responsibilities.", "Lingering questions regarding the agency\u2019s resources have added to  concerns about FDA\u2019s ability to protect Americans from unsafe and  ineffective medical products. FDA\u2019s Science Board reported in November  2007 that the agency could not fulfill its growing responsibilities because it  did not have sufficient resources. In fiscal years 2007 and 2008, the HHS  Office of Inspector General listed FDA\u2019s oversight of drug and device  safety as one of the department\u2019s top management and performance  challenges in HHS\u2019 annual financial reports. And in January 2009, we  added FDA\u2019s oversight of medical products to our High-Risk Series, which  is intended to raise the priority and visibility of government programs that  are in need of broad-based transformation to address major economy,  efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.", "To enhance its ability to meet its mission, particularly to address  challenges related to the globalization of medical product development  and manufacturing, FDA requested an additional appropriation from  Congress in May 2008. This request was designed to supplement resources  for, among other things, FDA\u2019s three medical product programs\u2014the  drugs, biologics, and devices programs. In June 2008, the administration  officially amended its fiscal year 2009 budget request for FDA to include  an additional $100 million for these programs.", "Questions have been raised regarding the sufficiency of the resources  available to FDA to fulfill its medical product oversight responsibilities,  including recurring responsibilities required by statute, such as inspecting  certain manufacturing establishments at prescribed intervals. This report  examines (1) trends in FDA\u2019s funding and staffing resources for its  medical product programs from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2008,  and (2) trends in FDA\u2019s medical product oversight responsibilities from  fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2008.", "To examine trends in FDA\u2019s funding and staffing resources, we reviewed  funding and staffing data as reported in FDA\u2019s congressional budget  justifications for the agency\u2019s medical product programs from fiscal years  1999 through 2008. We compared changes in funding for FDA\u2019s medical  product programs to the 10-year inflation rate as measured by the gross  domestic product (GDP) price index for nondefense goods and services.  We reviewed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) data on HHS and  federal government funding for fiscal years 1999 through 2008 and  compared trends in HHS and federal government funding to trends in FDA  funding over this period. We reported staffing resources by the number of  full-time equivalent (FTE) staff; one FTE represents 40 hours of work per  week conducted by a federal government employee over the course of   1 year. FTEs do not include contractors and therefore provide a partial  measure of staffing resources. We reviewed HHS\u2019 online employee  directory as of March 2009 to obtain an estimate of the number of  contractors working with FDA\u2019s medical product programs. We also  interviewed FDA officials regarding trends in hiring, retention, and  retirement, and the effect of funding and staffing resource trends on the  agency\u2019s ability to meet its medical product oversight responsibilities. To  supplement our analysis of trends in FDA\u2019s resources from fiscal years  1999 through 2008, we obtained and reviewed more-detailed data on how  the agency used its funding and staffing resources for specific activities  within the three medical product programs during a shorter time period,  fiscal years 2004 through 2008. For these areas, we compared changes in  funding levels to the 5-year inflation rate as measured by the GDP price  index.", "To examine trends in FDA\u2019s medical product oversight responsibilities  from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2008, we reviewed changes in the  volume of work that FDA was responsible for conducting related to its  oversight of medical products. To determine if FDA\u2019s responsibilities  changed during this time period, we reviewed FDA documents and  Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports identifying laws that  affected FDA\u2019s medical product responsibilities and we also examined  those federal laws. We did not conduct a comprehensive search of all  federal laws. To review trends in the volume of FDA\u2019s work related to its  oversight responsibilities, we analyzed FDA data on the number of medical  product applications and other materials submitted to the agency for  review between fiscal years 1999 and 2008. We also reviewed FDA data on  the cumulative number of medical products approved or cleared for  marketing in the United States and the number of establishments  registered with the agency to produce marketed medical products\u2014a  proxy for the number of establishments subject to FDA oversight and  inspection\u2014in fiscal years 1999 and 2008.

We selected these four areas  to represent a broad range of the agency\u2019s medical product oversight  responsibilities, including FDA\u2019s oversight responsibilities both before and  after a product is marketed in the United States, and areas funded with  and without user fees. The four key areas we examined were FDA\u2019s   (1) review of generic drug, new drug, and new biologic applications,   (2) inspections of medical product research activities and manufacturing  establishments, (3) review of adverse event reports, and (4) examination  of advertising and promotional materials. For each key area, we  interviewed FDA officials and analyzed FDA data on the resources it used  to conduct its work during this period.", "To further examine trends in FDA\u2019s responsibilities, we examined the  extent to which the agency met selected statutory requirements and  performance goals that set expectations for FDA between fiscal years 2004  and 2008 in two of the four key areas we reviewed\u2014FDA\u2019s review of  generic drug, new drug, and new biologic applications, and inspections of  medical product research activities and manufacturing establishments.  Specifically, we reviewed FDA data on the timeliness of the agency\u2019s  review of generic drug applications compared with a statutory  requirement that the agency review these applications within a certain  time frame. We reviewed published FDA reports and FDA data on the  timeliness of the agency\u2019s review of new drug and new biologic  applications compared with certain performance goals. We also examined  FDA\u2019s estimated inspection frequency for six types of establishments\u2014 domestic drug manufacturing, foreign drug manufacturing, domestic blood  banks, domestic human tissue banks, domestic device manufacturing, and  foreign device manufacturing. We selected these six types of  establishments because they included inspections for drugs, biologics, and  devices, and because they also include establishment types with and  without statutory requirements regarding the frequency of inspections. We  provide FDA\u2019s estimated inspection frequency because, as we have noted  in prior reports, FDA does not know how many establishments are subject  to inspection, and therefore the percentage of those that have been  inspected cannot always be calculated with certainty. The results of our  review of these four key areas were used to provide detailed illustrations  that are neither representative of all agency activities nor generalizable to  the agency as a whole.", "To assess the reliability of FDA data on funding, staffing, and workload,  we discussed the data with the responsible agency officials, reviewed  related documentation, and examined the data for consistency.

The Prescription Drug User Fee  Act of 1992 (PDUFA) was enacted to expedite the review of applications  for new drugs and new biologics. PDUFA authorized FDA to collect user  fees from drug and biologic sponsors, typically manufacturers, to support  the process of reviewing new drug applications (NDA) and biologics  license applications (BLA). Likewise, the Medical Device User Fee and  Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) authorized FDA to collect user fees  from device sponsors to support the process of reviewing applications for  certain new devices. In both cases, FDA\u2019s authority to collect fees and  use the amounts collected must be provided in appropriations acts. Both  PDUFA and MDUFMA require FDA to apply all user fee funding to support  the agency\u2019s process for reviewing applications for certain new medical  products, and preclude the agency from using this funding for other  agency activities. In fiscal year 2008, agency activities not funded with user  fees included, for example, the agency\u2019s oversight of the safety of human  tissues, review of applications for generic drugs, inspections unrelated to  the agency\u2019s review of new medical products, and some postmarket safety  oversight activities. PDUFA and MDUFMA user fee funding only partially  covers FDA\u2019s costs for reviewing applications for certain new medical  products and associated activities.

The IND application provides FDA with extensive information about the  product, including safety and manufacturing information about the  product, and outlines the sponsor\u2019s plans for clinical trials. FDA assesses  this preliminary information to ensure that the product is reasonably safe  to begin studying in humans.

For example, sponsors must request approval for  a new drug or new biologic by submitting an NDA or BLA. FDA reviews  data included in these applications to determine whether the product is  safe and effective for its intended use. FDA also examines proposed  product labeling to ensure that it clearly states the condition and  population the product is intended to treat. After completing its  assessment of the information in the application and any subsequent  submissions of additional information, known as application  resubmissions, FDA determines whether to approve the product for  marketing.

The ANDA contains data showing, among other things, that the  generic drug is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, a drug  approved through the NDA process. Similar to its review of NDAs, FDA  reviews information submitted in the application, including proposed  product labeling. To request FDA approval of proposed changes to  product labeling, manufacturing, dosing, or usage after a generic drug is  approved, sponsors must submit an ANDA supplement.", "FDA is also responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of  devices. Devices are classified into one of three classes\u2014class I, II, or   III\u2014based on the level of risk posed to the patient or user and the controls  necessary to reasonably ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices  are those that pose the lowest risk, and class III devices are those that  pose the highest risk. Some devices are subject to one of two types of  FDA review before they may be marketed for sale in the United States.  Some class II devices are required to obtain FDA clearance through a  premarket notification process, whereby a sponsor must demonstrate to  FDA that the new device is substantially equivalent to a device that FDA  previously approved or cleared for marketing. In contrast, class III devices  are generally required to obtain FDA approval through a more stringent  premarket approval process, whereby a sponsor must provide evidence,  typically including clinical data, to demonstrate with reasonable assurance  that the new device is safe and effective.

These performance goals can be grouped into  three main categories\u2014those related to the speed at which the agency   (1) reviews applications and supplemental materials, (2) schedules and  holds meetings with sponsors, and (3) issues written guidance as  requested by sponsors. Multiple performance goals exist within each of  these broad categories.

FDA officials noted that they  do not have enough staff to adequately perform duties that do not receive  user fee funding, such as the agency\u2019s review of ANDAs, oversight of  product advertising and promotion, and inspections of establishments  manufacturing marketed products. As a result, FDA officials noted that the  agency\u2019s work in these areas is increasingly backlogged.", "In addition to their concerns about the adequacy of the agency\u2019s fiscal year  appropriations, FDA officials are also concerned about the agency\u2019s ability  to hire staff, particularly those in certain scientific occupations. For  example, FDA officials noted that the agency is facing challenges hiring  biologists, chemists, computer programmers, consumer safety officers,  engineers, epidemiologists, mathematical statisticians, medical officers,  and pharmacologists, among other occupations. FDA officials noted that  the lack of sufficient numbers of staff and extended vacancies in specific  occupations resulted in higher workloads and longer hours for current  staff, as well as postponed or reduced work in some areas.", "FDA officials also noted concerns about the agency\u2019s ability to retain staff,  particularly those in certain scientific occupations. FDA officials said that  a high percentage of staff from the medical product centers and ORA leave  their positions\u2014including those who move within FDA, leave the agency,  and retire. Specifically, FDA data show that between 2000 and 2007, the  average annual percent of staff who left their positions at CDER, CBER,  and CDRH ranged from 11 to 13 percent, and at ORA headquarters and  regional offices ranged from 6 to 23 percent. However, a portion of these  staff stayed within FDA and HHS. FDA officials told us that the loss of any  staff from their centers presents challenges as it takes time for the centers  to hire and train new staff.

(See fig. 5.)", "These 11 laws added many additional requirements and authorities to  FDA, increasing the agency\u2019s oversight responsibilities ranging from  premarket review of medical products to the agency\u2019s oversight of the  safety of marketed medical products. These additional oversight  responsibilities included an expansion in FDA\u2019s authority to regulate  devices, an increase in the amount of information that the agency needs to  review before deciding whether to approve new drugs and biologics, and  greater authority to monitor the safety of approved products. To  implement these new requirements and authorities, FDA, for example,  needed to issue new guidance for industry and new operating procedures  for staff, and established new committees that the agency needed to  consult with to fulfill its oversight responsibilities.", "One of the many new oversight responsibilities that FDA was charged with  was added by MDUFMA. In 2002, MDUFMA instituted a regulatory  oversight function for reprocessed single-use devices. MDUFMA required  manufacturers of certain devices to submit additional information to the  agency validating that reprocessed single-use devices are substantially  equivalent to current or previously marketed single-use devices. The law  also created a new application for the approval of reprocessed high-risk  devices. As a result of these new authorities, FDA created new guidance  documents and conducted presentations with industry and healthcare  professionals related to the agency\u2019s oversight of these products.  According to agency officials, the implementation of this expanded  authority resulted in a significant increase in FDA\u2019s workload, particularly  in 2002 when FDA officials estimated that about 17 FTEs were dedicated  to implementing this authority and developing guidance documents.", "Another law, the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA), increased  the amount of information that FDA must review to approve a new drug or  new biologic. FDA became responsible for reviewing more materials to  assess the products\u2019 safety and effectiveness for children, including  appropriate information to include on product labeling. Specifically, PREA  required sponsors to submit a pediatric assessment containing additional  information about the pediatric use of a drug or biologic at the time they  submit an application or supplement. As a result of the reviews of these  required pediatric assessments, FDA issued 86 PREA-related labeling  changes for drugs and biologics between December 2003 and December  2008.", "A more recent example of a law increasing FDA\u2019s medical product  responsibilities is the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of  2007 (FDAAA). FDAAA increased FDA\u2019s postmarket oversight  responsibilities for medical products by giving FDA authority to require  sponsors to conduct studies or clinical trials for approved drugs in cases  where FDA has identified new safety concerns. To require such a study,  FDA officials said that they document their rationale in a legally  enforceable contract with a sponsor. These contracts may outline specific  elements of the study design. FDA officials stated that the process of  developing such contracts results in additional work for the agency. From  the enactment of FDAAA in September 2007 through January 2009, FDA  required drug sponsors to conduct 45 postmarket studies for NDAs and  biologics sponsors to conduct 15 postmarket studies for BLAs, for drugs  and biologics approved before and after the implementation of FDAAA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Faced a Growing Workload", "paragraphs": ["FDA also faced a growing workload and was responsible for overseeing  increasing numbers of marketed products and establishments.

The number of drug, biologic, and device application  materials submitted to FDA grew 30 percent over this period, from 23,079  in fiscal year 1999 to 30,060 in fiscal year 2008. In particular, the number of  application supplements grew 48 percent (from 13,694 application  supplements in fiscal year 1999 to 20,329 application supplements in fiscal  year 2008). The number of medical product applications also increased  during this time period by 8 percent, or from 8,313 applications to 8,943  applications.

FDA officials, as well as FDA\u2019s Science  Board, reported that rapid advances in science and technology, including  the fields of genomics and nanotechnology, have increased the complexity  of the medical products submitted to FDA for premarket approval. FDA  officials told us that the agency seeks and provides training for its  reviewers so they can more effectively review the safety and effectiveness  of these increasingly complex products. However, agency officials said  that this training results in less time available for staff to perform their  routine duties. In addition, FDA officials also increasingly seek the advice  of scientific experts from outside the agency, including advisory  committee members, to assist in the review of applications for new drugs  and new biologics. Similarly, seeking the advice of experts requires  additional staff time to obtain and weigh these perspectives.", "In addition to facing a growing workload, the total number of medical  products and establishments FDA oversees also increased between fiscal  years 1999 and 2008. FDA is responsible for monitoring the safety of  marketed medical products, and as the number of these products and  manufacturing establishments has grown, so have the agency\u2019s oversight  responsibilities. The number of medical products approved or cleared for  marketing has grown 55 percent, or by 41,203 medical products, during  this time period. In addition, the total number of establishments registered  to produce medical products marketed for sale in the United States\u2014a  proxy for the number of establishments subject to FDA oversight and  inspection\u2014grew over this time period, due to increases in the number of  foreign establishments.
