In response, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted an indoor clean and test program from 2002 to 2003. In 2003, EPA's Inspector General (IG) recommended improvements to the program and identified lessons learned for EPA's preparedness for future disasters. In 2004, EPA formed an expert panel to, among other goals, guide EPA in developing a second voluntary program; EPA announced this program in 2006. As requested, GAO's report primarily addresses EPA's second program, including the (1) extent to which EPA incorporated IG and expert panel member recommendations and input; (2) factors, if any, limiting the expert panel's ability to meet its goals; (3) completeness of information EPA provided to the public; (4) way EPA estimated resources for the program; and (5) extent to which EPA has acted upon lessons learned regarding indoor contamination from disasters."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EPA has incorporated some recommendations and input from the IG and expert panel members into its second program, but its decision not to include other items may limit the overall effectiveness of this program. For example, while EPA agreed to test for more contaminants, it did not agree to evaluate risks in areas north of Canal Street and in Brooklyn. EPA reported that it does not have a basis for expanding the boundaries of its program because it cannot distinguish between normal urban, or background, dust and WTC dust. The expert panel's ability to meet its goals was limited by two factors: (1) EPA officials' belief that some panel goals were more appropriately addressed by other agencies, and (2) EPA's approach to managing the panel process. Furthermore, the majority of expert panel members believe the panel did not meet any of its goals, and that EPA's second program does not respond to the concerns of residents and workers affected by the disaster. EPA's second plan does not fully inform the public about the results of its first program. EPA concluded that a \"very small\" number of samples from its first program exceeded risk levels for airborne asbestos. However, EPA did not provide information such as how representative the samples were of the affected area. Residents who could have participated in this voluntary second program might have opted not to do so because of EPA's conclusion about its first program. EPA did not develop a comprehensive cost estimate to determine the resources needed to carry out its second program. EPA is implementing this program with $7 million remaining from its first program. While EPA has acted upon lessons learned following this disaster, some concerns remain about its preparedness to respond to indoor contamination following future disasters. Specifically, EPA has not developed protocols on how and when to collect data to determine the extent of indoor contamination, one of the concerns raised by panel members."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center  turned Lower Manhattan into a disaster site on a scale the nation had  never experienced. The World Trade Center was a complex of seven  buildings on 16 acres surrounding a 5-acre plaza. The twin towers were at  the center of the complex. Each tower had 110 floors, with approximately  43,200 square feet on each floor. As the towers collapsed, the area was  blanketed in a mixture of building debris and combustible materials that  coated building exteriors and streets, as well as the interiors of apartments  and offices, with dust. This complex mixture gave rise to another major  concern: that thousands of residents and workers in the area would now  be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos,  lead, glass fibers, and pulverized concrete.", "On the day of the attacks, the President signed a major disaster  declaration, which activated the Federal Response Plan. The Federal  Response Plan, now replaced by the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) National Response Plan, established the process and structure for  the federal government\u2019s assistance to state and local governments when  responding to any major disaster or emergency declared under the Robert  T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act).  In May 2002, after numerous cleanup, dust collection, and air monitoring  activities were conducted outdoors by the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), other federal agencies, New York City, and New York State,  New York City formally requested that FEMA provide the necessary  funding for the hiring of contractors to perform the cleaning and testing of  exterior and interior spaces in the vicinity of the World Trade Center  (WTC) site for asbestos that might be present.", "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which administered  the Federal Response Plan, provided such assistance, entering into an  interagency agreement with EPA in 2002 to develop EPA\u2019s first program.  This voluntary program allowed residents of Lower Manhattan living south  of Canal Street (representing over 20,000 residences) to elect to have their  home professionally cleaned, followed by testing, or to have their home  tested only. Approximately 20 percent of the eligible residences  participated in the program. As part of EPA\u2019s first program, the majority of  these residences were professionally cleaned before they were sampled  for airborne asbestos because their owners selected the clean and test  option rather than the test only option. Even though samples were  collected after cleaning in most cases, some residences (less than 1  percent) were still found to have levels of asbestos exceeding EPA\u2019s  cleanup benchmark.", "Owing to concerns by members of the affected community regarding its  first program, EPA developed a second program, which is the focus of our  current work. This second program was influenced by a variety of  individuals, including the EPA Inspector General and an expert panel that  EPA convened. In August 2003, EPA\u2019s Inspector General made  recommendations and provided additional input that addressed EPA\u2019s first  indoor WTC cleanup efforts, as well as EPA\u2019s preparedness for future  large-scale disasters resulting in indoor contamination. The Inspector  General reported that \u201cadditional actions can be taken to provide greater  assurances that the program is fully protective of human health.\u201d For  example, EPA\u2019s first program did not require that entire buildings be  systematically cleaned, and therefore, the Inspector General  recommended that EPA implement a program to verify that apartments  that had participated in the first program had not been recontaminated by  uncleaned apartments through heating, ventilation, and air conditioning  (HVAC) systems. With regard to preparedness, the Inspector General  identified lessons learned from the WTC disaster and recommended,  among other things, that EPA develop protocols for determining how  indoor environmental contamination would be handled in the event of a  future disaster.", "The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) indicated in  October 2003 that EPA would organize and lead an expert technical review  panel to address the concerns of the Inspector General and others. In  March 2004, EPA convened the World Trade Center Expert Technical  Review Panel, which met periodically through December 2005. The panel  included 18 individuals from academe and from city and federal health and  science agencies, such as the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS). It also included two representatives from the  Community-Labor Coalition (CLC)\u2014a network of community, tenant,  labor, and environmental organizations formed after September 11, 2001,  to advocate for appropriate health and safety efforts in the recovery from  the WTC attacks. The panel was chaired by an EPA official. The expert  panel\u2019s broader goal or purpose, as outlined at the first panel meeting by  the EPA chairman, was to advise EPA \u201con ongoing efforts to monitor the  situation for New York City residents and workers potentially affected by  the collapse of the WTC.\u201d This purpose included providing advice on the  development of EPA\u2019s second program plan. The panel chairman also  provided the following longer-term goals: (1) identify any remaining risks  using exposure and health surveillance information, (2) identify unmet  public health needs, and (3) determine steps to further minimize risks.  Expert panel members, including the CLC representatives, submitted  individual recommendations to EPA.", "After obtaining views from many sources, including the Inspector General,  members of the expert panel, and the CLC, EPA announced its plan for a  second program in December 2006. In this 2006 plan, EPA indicates that it  will test residences for the presence of contaminants and clean residences  if test results exceed EPA\u2019s cleanup benchmarks. The plan targets  residents and building owners in the same portion of Lower Manhattan as  its first program. The plan also provides the results of EPA\u2019s sampling  from its first program. EPA told us that 272 residents and 25 building  owners had enrolled in the second program, compared with 4,167  residents and 144 building owners that participated in the first program.", "In this context, you asked us to determine (1) the extent to which EPA  incorporated recommendations and additional input from the expert panel  members and its Inspector General in its second program; (2) what  factors, if any, limited the expert panel\u2019s ability to meet its goals; (3) the  completeness of information EPA provided to the public in its second  plan; (4) the way EPA estimated the resources needed to conduct the  second program; and (5) the extent to which EPA has acted upon lessons  learned to better prepare for indoor contamination that could result from  future large-scale disasters. In June 2007, we testified on some of these  issues before the Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health,  Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. In addition, owing  to concerns raised in the media about EPA\u2019s use of classification authority,  you asked that we determine the extent to which EPA has classified  information, and, if so, whether any classified information discusses the  environmental impact of the towers\u2019 collapse. Appendix I provides the  results of our analysis of EPA\u2019s classification of information under this  authority.", "In conducting our work, we reviewed, among other things, EPA\u2019s 2002- 2003 indoor program plan, EPA\u2019s planning leading to the December 2006  program plan, the 2003 EPA Inspector General report, all 13 summaries of  EPA\u2019s WTC Expert Technical Review Panel meetings and conference calls,  and funding data from EPA. We assessed the reliability of EPA\u2019s funding  data and determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. In addition, we interviewed officials from EPA  headquarters, including the Office of Research and Development and the  Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response; Region 2, which is  responsible for New York City, and EPA\u2019s National Homeland Security  Research Center, among others; FEMA Region 2; and the New York City  Department of Environmental Protection. We also attended a National  Institute of Standards and Technology technical seminar on WTC  materials and observed the disaster area with a FEMA official. In addition,  we conducted structured interviews with all 18 WTC Expert Technical  Review Panel members and both EPA panel chairmen. A more detailed  description of our scope and methodology is presented in appendix II. We  performed our work from June 2006 to September 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["On the day of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the  President\u2019s declaration of a major disaster under the Stafford Act activated  the Federal Response Plan (superseded by and incorporated into the  National Response Plan). The Federal Response Plan established the  process and structure for the federal government to provide assistance to  state and local governments when responding to major disasters and  emergencies declared under the Stafford Act. Under the Federal Response  Plan, FEMA coordinated this assistance through mission assignments and  interagency agreements, which assigned specific tasks to federal agencies  with the expertise necessary to complete them. The Congress authorized  $20 billion to respond to the attacks, of which $8.8 billion was provided  through FEMA, for the New York City area.", "Under the Federal Response Plan (and the National Response Plan today),  EPA served as coordinator during large-scale disasters for 1 of 15  emergency support functions (ESF)\u2014ESF 10, which addresses oil and  hazardous material releases. ESF 10 encompasses various phases of  hazardous material response, including assessment and cleanup. In the  first 6 months after the WTC disaster, EPA responded to FEMA mission  assignments to assist with the response efforts and, among other tasks,  provided wash stations for responders and disposed of waste from the  WTC site.", "There are an estimated 330 office buildings in Lower Manhattan below  Canal Street and roughly 900 residential buildings with approximately  20,000 apartments. In 2002, after initial efforts by the city of New York to  advise New York residents how to clean the World Trade Center dust in  their homes, FEMA and EPA entered into an interagency agreement to  address indoor spaces affected by the disaster. While EPA has responded  to hazardous material releases for decades, the WTC disaster was the first  large-scale emergency for which EPA provided testing and cleanup in  indoor spaces.", "WTC dust is a fine mixture of materials that resulted from the collapse and  subsequent burning of the twin towers and includes pulverized concrete,  asbestos, and glass fibers. WTC dust entered homes and offices through  open windows, was tracked in, or was picked up by air-conditioning  system intakes. Figures 1 and 2 show the dust generated by the WTC  disaster.", "The amount of dust in indoor spaces in and around Lower Manhattan  varied due to a variety of factors, including distance from the WTC site;  weather conditions, such as wind; and damage to individual buildings. In  the years since the disaster, the level of WTC dust in indoor spaces has  varied, depending upon the cleaning performed by residents and other  groups, including EPA and professional cleaning companies.", "In May 2002, EPA, New York City, and FEMA officials announced a  program, to be overseen by EPA, offering a cleanup of residences in Lower  Manhattan. Between September 2002 and May 2003, residences were  cleaned and tested, or tested only, for airborne asbestos. EPA analyzed  samples from 4,167 apartments in 453 buildings and 793 common areas in  144 buildings. This program cost $37.9 million\u2014$30.4 million for indoor  cleaning and testing by the New York City Department of Environmental  Protection and $7.5 million for EPA oversight and sample analysis. Figure  3 shows the area in Lower Manhattan eligible for participation in EPA\u2019s  program. Residents could choose either an aggressive or modified  aggressive testing method for providing samples of indoor air to EPA. For  the modified aggressive method, the contractor ran a 20-inch fan for the  duration of testing. For the aggressive method, a leaf blower was used, in  addition to the 20-inch fan, to direct a jet of air toward corners, walls,  fabric surfaces, and the ceiling to dislodge and resuspend dust. The  contractors HEPA vacuumed and wet-wiped hard surfaces, including  floors, ceilings, ledges, trims, furnishings, appliances, and equipment; and  they HEPA vacuumed soft surfaces, such as curtains, two times. In  addition, in cases where there were still significant amounts of WTC dust  and debris, contractors used asbestos abatement procedures such as the  use of personal protective equipment, including respirators and a properly  enclosed decontamination system; posting of warning signs; isolation  barriers to seal off openings; and disposal of all waste generated during  the cleaning in accordance with applicable rules and regulations for  asbestos-containing waste.", "The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Agency for Toxic Substances  and Disease Registry (ATSDR) collected samples from in and around 30  buildings in Lower Manhattan from November though December 2001. In  September 2002, these agencies released their assessment of the public\u2019s  exposure to contaminants in air and dust, recommended additional  monitoring of residential spaces in Lower Manhattan, and referred  residents to EPA\u2019s program.", "Before EPA finalized its second indoor program plan, several assessments  related to indoor contamination were conducted: an August 2003 EPA  Inspector General report; an expert technical review panel that EPA  conducted from March 2004 through December 2005; and three EPA  studies. The studies identified background levels of contamination in New  York City (\u201cbackground study\u201d); the WTC-related contaminants of  potential concern, and associated cleanup benchmarks (\u201cCOPC study\u201d);  and the efficacy of various cleaning methods in eliminating WTC-related  contaminants of concern (\u201ccleaning study\u201d).", "During the time EPA met with the WTC Expert Technical Review Panel,  some expert panel members encouraged EPA to develop a method for  differentiating between contaminants found in the New York City urban  environment and those found in WTC dust. This method would have  served as the basis for determining the extent of WTC-related  contamination, and EPA officials believed it would have enabled the  agency to limit its focus to contamination specific to the WTC disaster.  Early in the panel process, EPA formed a subpanel of these experts to  assist EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development in developing such a  methodology. In August 2005, EPA released its final report describing its  methodology, which was peer reviewed. In their October 2005 final report,  the peer reviewers criticized the reliability of EPA\u2019s method and provided  suggestions on improving EPA\u2019s approach. In a November 2005 letter, EPA  officials told expert panel members that in the absence of a valid method,  EPA could not definitively distinguish between WTC contaminants in dust  and levels of the same contaminants found in an urban environment. At  the same time, 2 weeks before the final panel meeting, the EPA chairman  informed the panel that it would be disbanded as of the final meeting and  that EPA would not be implementing a plan that included determining the  extent of WTC contamination. Experts that were a part of the subpanel  addressing this method reported that the peer-review comments could be  addressed and that EPA should perform additional sampling. Nonetheless,  EPA ultimately decided not to pursue developing this methodology. Figure  4 shows the chronology of events preceding the second program.", "In January 2006, EPA formally requested funds from FEMA. EPA and  FEMA signed an interagency agreement to conduct EPA\u2019s second program  in July 2006, and EPA announced the agency\u2019s second program to test  indoor spaces in Lower Manhattan in December 2006.

These contaminants, as well as two additional  ones\u2014dioxin and silica, were identified as WTC contaminants of potential  concern in a May 2003 report issued by EPA and other federal, New York  City, and New York state agencies. EPA did not include dioxin and silica  in the second program for several reasons. Regarding dioxin, EPA noted  that concentrations were elevated in the weeks following the disaster  when fires were still burning, but concentrations returned to predisaster  levels by December 2001. Furthermore, because \u201conly eight\u201d of 1,500  dioxin samples exceeded cleanup benchmarks during tests in 2002 and  2003, EPA decided not to sample for this contaminant in its second  program. Regarding silica, EPA noted that in 2002 an ATSDR/New York  City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene report stated that short- term exposure to silica is unlikely to cause adverse health effects and that  adverse health effects from chronic exposure are possible but unlikely if  recommended cleaning is conducted. EPA also explained that levels of  silica are likely to have been reduced by cleaning activities over the past 3  years.", "EPA also agreed to test for contaminants in dust. To do so, EPA developed  site-specific cleanup benchmarks for asbestos and man-made vitreous  fibers in dust over the course of nearly a year. In its second program plan,  EPA explains that these benchmarks are not risk based but rather are  based on, among other things, work by experts in the field as to what  constitutes contamination and how it compares with site-specific  background levels, and the benchmarks employed for cleanup at a  Superfund site with asbestos-contaminated residences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Is Not Assessing the Extent of WTC Contamination, and It Did Not Agree to Evaluate Risk in Workplaces", "paragraphs": ["Though EPA expanded the number of contaminants tested for in its  second program, it did not adopt recommendations and additional input  from the EPA Inspector General or the expert panel that addressed the  following issues:    Evaluating risks in geographic areas north of Canal Street and in  Brooklyn. EPA did not expand the scope of testing north of Canal Street,  or to Brooklyn, as advisory groups had advised. EPA reported it did not  expand the scope of testing because it could not differentiate between  normal urban dust and WTC dust; differentiating between the two would  have enabled EPA to determine the geographic extent of WTC  contamination. Some expert panel members had suggested that EPA  investigate whether it was feasible to develop a method for distinguishing  between normal urban dust and WTC dust. EPA initially agreed to do so.  Beginning in 2004\u2014almost 3 years after the disaster\u2014EPA conducted this  investigation into developing a WTC dust signature. However, EPA  officials told us that because so much time had passed since the terrorist  attack, it was difficult to distinguish between WTC dust and urban dust.  EPA ultimately abandoned this effort because peer reviewers questioned  its methodology; EPA decided not to explore alternative methods that  some of the peer reviewers had proposed. Instead, EPA will test only in an  area where visible contamination has been confirmed by aerial  photography conducted soon after the WTC attack, although aerial  photography does not reveal indoor contamination. Furthermore, EPA  officials told us that some WTC dust was found immediately after the  terrorist attacks in areas, including Brooklyn, that are outside the area  eligible for its first and second program.", "Testing in HVACs and inaccessible areas. In its November 2005 draft plan  for the second program, EPA had proposed collecting samples from a  number of locations in HVACs. In some buildings, HVACs are shared; in  others, each residence has its own system. In either case, contaminants in  the HVAC could recontaminate the residence unless the system is also  professionally cleaned. However, EPA\u2019s second program will not provide  for testing in HVACs under any circumstances but will offer cleaning in  HVACs if tests in common areas reveal that cleanup benchmarks for any of  four contaminants have been exceeded. EPA officials told us that EPA will  sample near HVAC outlets in common areas and will obtain dust samples  in proximity to these locations. EPA explained in the second plan that it  will not sample within HVACs because it is no longer assessing the extent  of contamination resulting from the WTC disaster and because it is  attempting to devote the maximum resources to testing requests.", "Similarly, EPA had proposed sampling for contaminants in \u201cinaccessible\u201d  locations, such as behind dishwashers and rarely moved furniture within  apartments and common areas. Again, because it was unable to  differentiate between normal urban dust and WTC dust, EPA stated that it  would not test in inaccessible locations in order to devote its resources to  as many requests as possible. EPA told us that 272 residents and 25  building owners had enrolled in the second program, compared with 4,167  residents and 144 building owners that participated in the first program.", "Evaluating risks to workers/workplaces. According to EPA, its second  program plan is \u201cthe result of ongoing efforts to respond to concerns of  residents and workers.\u201d Workers were concerned that workplaces in  Lower Manhattan experienced the same contamination as residences. In  its second program, EPA will test and clean common areas in commercial  buildings, but only if an individual owner or manager of the property  requests the service. EPA stated that employees who believe their working  conditions are unsafe as a result of WTC dust may file a complaint with  OSHA or request an evaluation by HHS\u2019s National Institute of  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Concerns remain, however,  because these other agencies do not have authority to conduct cleanup in  response to contaminant levels that exceed cleanup benchmarks. In  addition, OSHA\u2019s benchmarks are designed primarily to address airborne  contamination, while EPA\u2019s test and clean program is designed to address  contamination in building spaces, whether the contamination is airborne  or in settled dust. OSHA requires individual employers to adopt work  practices to reduce employee exposure to airborne contaminants, whereas  EPA\u2019s test and clean program is designed to remove contaminants from  affected spaces.", "Addressing whole buildings. Between March 2004 and December 2005,  when EPA met with expert panel members, officials discussed sampling a  representative number of each buildings\u2019 apartments in order to  \u201ccharacterize the building,\u201d which would have allowed EPA to  characterize areas in Lower Manhattan. This information would have been  used to inform decision-making regarding the extent of indoor  contamination. According to EPA officials, all residents from each building  would need to volunteer their individual apartments, and EPA would  select the units it then tested. The approach that EPA developed entailed  cleaning a building, including all units, common areas and HVACs, if there  was a high degree of certainty that the average concentration of at least  one contaminant, across all apartments tested, exceeded the benchmark,  and dust could be associated with the WTC. While this method addressed  the Inspector General recommendation that buildings be treated as a  system so that potentially contaminated apartments did not contaminate  previously cleaned apartments, EPA did not ultimately include this  particular methodology in its second program plan due to the lack of a  method to identify WTC dust. Instead, EPA will clean whole common  areas, such as lobbies, and HVACs in buildings. It will clean common areas  when at least one contaminant is found to exceed the cleanup benchmark  in that area. It will clean HVACs and common areas when there is a high  degree of certainty that the mean contaminant level for accessible areas,  infrequently accessed areas, or air samples in common areas exceeds one  contaminant benchmark."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Two Factors Limited the Expert Panel\u2019s Ability to Meet Its Goals", "paragraphs": ["The expert panel\u2019s ability to meet its goals was limited by two factors: (1)  EPA officials\u2019 belief that some panel goals were more appropriately  addressed by other agencies and (2) EPA\u2019s approach to managing the  panel process.

However, EPA officials believed that other federal agencies, such as HHS,  were better equipped to address the issue of public health. Therefore,  rather than having the expert panel members discuss and identify actions  to address this issue, EPA allowed time during panel meetings for public  health presentations.

However, EPA\u2019s approach to emergency  response does not differentiate between indoor and outdoor  contamination, and therefore it is difficult to determine how EPA\u2019s  preparedness actions have improved EPA\u2019s readiness to respond  specifically to indoor contamination. EPA\u2019s actions are consistent with  several Inspector General recommendations, as the following examples of  EPA\u2019s preparedness actions illustrate:    Clarified roles and responsibilities. EPA has completed response  policies, established various specialized response teams, and conducted  training. Though not specific to indoor contamination, EPA\u2019s June 2003  National Approach to Response policy outlines EPA roles and  responsibilities in the event of future large-scale disasters. Its October  2004 Homeland Security Strategy also notes that in the event of a national  incident, EPA has the lead responsibility for decontaminating affected  buildings and neighborhoods and for advising and assisting public health  authorities on when it is safe to return to these areas and on what the  safest disposal options for contaminants are. EPA\u2019s National  Decontamination Team provides general scientific support and technical  expertise for identifying technologies and methods for decontaminating  buildings and other infrastructure. EPA also expanded the capabilities of  its existing Environmental Response Team (ERT), which is responsible for  technological support and training through the establishment of an  additional ERT office in Las Vegas, Nevada. Along with the Radiological  Emergency Response Team and the National Decontamination Team,  these teams provide support during emergencies. In addition, EPA officials  noted that they have developed and delivered a training course on the  Incident Command System, to be used under the National Response Plan,  to 2,000 staff as well as senior managers in all regions to provide additional  guidance on roles and responsibilities. Finally, in its newly developed  Crisis Communication Plan, EPA outlines the responsibilities of agency  staff in providing the public with information during disasters. EPA  officials told us they have added 50 on-scene coordinators to their  emergency response staff to improve preparedness and response  capabilities.", "Shared information on likely targets and threats and developed  approaches to address them. EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development  (ORD) has several efforts to develop approaches to address future threats,  including research on building decontamination, and EPA\u2019s Office of Solid  Waste and Emergency Response has begun to establish a network of  environmental laboratories. In 2003, EPA created the National Homeland  Security Research Center (NHSRC), part of ORD, to develop expertise and  products to prevent, prepare for, and recover from public health and  environmental emergencies arising from terrorist threats and incidents. Its  research focuses on five areas: threat assessment, decontamination, water  infrastructure protection, response capability, and technology evaluation.  In November 2004, NHSRC reported on several threat scenarios for  buildings and water systems; these threat scenarios guide NHSRC\u2019s  research, which is focused heavily on chemical, biological, and  radiological (CBR) agents. EPA also participates on a number of  interagency workgroups, including policy coordination committees  formed by the White House Homeland Security Council; DHS work groups  addressing sampling and other issues; and FEMA work groups that  address various aspects of the National Response Plan. Although an  interagency team, including EPA, has developed tabletop exercises to  respond to nationally significant incidents, these exercises have not yet  included residential contamination. EPA has also developed standardized  analytical methods that environmental laboratories can use to analyze  biological and chemical samples during disasters caused by terrorist  attacks, and the agency has begun to establish a network of environmental  laboratories capable of analyzing CBR agents, which would benefit from  these methods.", "Improved health-related benchmarks for assessing health risks in  emergencies. According to EPA officials, EPA\u2019s Office of Prevention,  Pesticides and Toxic Substances is leading the agency\u2019s participation in  developing acute exposure guideline levels (AEGL), an international effort  aimed at describing the risk resulting from rare exposure to airborne  chemicals. The AEGLs focus on exposures of 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1  hour, 4 hours, and 8 hours. To date, AEGLs have not been developed under  emergency situations; however, EPA officials told us the availability of  methodologies such as those used to derive AEGLs make it possible to  develop emergency benchmarks quickly, if necessary. EPA is also  developing subchronic exposure guidance\u2014provisional advisory levels  (PAL)\u2014to bridge the gap between acute exposure durations addressed by  AEGLs and the chronic lifetime exposure guidance. EPA officials told us  that NHSRC is developing this guidance for contaminants in air and water,  and it will focus on exposure periods of 1 day, 30 days, and 2 years. EPA  officials noted that, to date, it has developed PALs for over 20 chemical  agents.

In addition, some expert panel members  questioned EPA\u2019s reliance on visual evidence, rather than sample data, as  the primary basis for its actions, as well as its use of the modified  aggressive sampling technique.", "Assessing extent of contamination. Some expert panel members  recommended that EPA reconsider its decision to abandon its efforts to  develop a method for differentiating between normal, urban dust, and  WTC dust, which would have allowed EPA to determine the extent of WTC  contamination. Several panel members encouraged EPA to continue to  refine the method and collect applicable sample data, saying that  collecting data now could provide critical information for future  responses. EPA was unable to develop a WTC dust signature that would  have allowed it to determine the extent of WTC contamination, in part,  because of the limited number of dust samples taken immediately after the  disaster, and the length of time that elapsed between the event and  development of the signature. EPA officials told us they would need to  identify contamination signatures in responding to future disasters.", "Developing cleanup benchmarks. Some expert panel members also  expressed concerns regarding the cleanup benchmarks that EPA  developed in response to the WTC disaster. Some expert panel members  agreed with the concept of dividing sampled spaces into categories, such  as accessible and inaccessible areas, with associated cleanup benchmarks;  however, these panel members disagreed with how EPA defined the  categories. For example, an expert panel member noted that children  access areas under beds, which were not considered \u201caccessible\u201d by EPA\u2019s  definitions, and workers such as telecommunications technicians and  housing inspectors access areas defined by EPA as \u201cinaccessible\u201d on a  daily basis. In addition, expert panel members disagreed with some  cleanup benchmarks that EPA developed for the various categories. For  example, two panel members asserted that EPA\u2019s proposed cleanup  benchmark for man-made vitreous fibers was not stringent enough. While  EPA then changed the benchmark for man-made vitreous fibers in  inaccessible areas from 100,000 fibers/cm to 50,000 fibers/cm  Using the modified aggressive sampling technique. Some expert panel  members questioned EPA\u2019s use of the modified aggressive sampling  technique. The number of samples exceeding cleanup benchmarks was  greater when the aggressive sampling technique was used. EPA\u2019s rationale  for departing from the technique specified by the Asbestos Hazard  Emergency Response Act (AHERA) is that the aggressive technique does  not appropriately represent conditions of human exposure in a residence.", "EPA has not identified in its protocols how these methodological concerns  can be overcome, such as how and when data collection will occur, in  order to facilitate determining the extent of contamination.

We believe that the report offers a balanced portrayal of EPA\u2019s  development of its second program, the WTC Expert Technical Review  Panel process, and EPA\u2019s actions to better prepare for future disasters.   In several cases we have clarified the language in the draft report to  address EPA concerns.  2.  In regard to EPA\u2019s comments about the transparency of the WTC  Expert Technical Review Panel process, we reported on the factors  that limited the panel\u2019s ability to meet its goals and not on the overall  transparency of the process. We stated that two factors limited the  panel\u2019s ability to meet its goals: (1) EPA officials\u2019 assertion that other  agencies were better equipped to address public health and (2) EPA\u2019s  approach for managing the panel process.  Regarding EPA\u2019s  management of the panel process, however, expert panel members told  us that EPA did not have a transparent process for adopting or  rejecting their recommendations, as we stated in the draft report.    3.  Regarding panel members\u2019 views on the responsiveness of EPA\u2019s  second program to concerns of residents and workers, we clarified our  report to note that the source of the views included all of the expert  panel members who responded to a follow-up inquiry regarding this  question.    4.  We disagree that the draft report provided panel member views in a  misleading manner.  However, we clarified the report language to  indicate that 9 of 18 panel members reported that the decision-making  process behind EPA\u2019s changes to its plan were not at all transparent.   In doing so, we reported the category with the largest number of  responses and, as indicated in the draft report, the full range of  responses can be found in appendix IV.  As stated in the draft report, in  order to determine the factors that affected the expert panel\u2019s ability to  meet its goals, we conducted structured interviews with all 18 expert  panel members. We analyzed these responses in order to describe the  panel process, including EPA\u2019s management of the panel process. We  reported the views that panel members provided to us during  structured interviews and included the full range of responses to these  questions in an appendix, as stated above.  Regarding comments  supporting inadequate time for decision making, panel members  requested at the final panel meeting that EPA allow time for additional  discussion. According to the December 2005 meeting summary, the  panel co-chair \u201csummarized that the overall sense of the panel  members is that there is a need for additional discussion.\u201d  5.  We acknowledge that EPA would have preferred for us to include more  detailed information in our discussion of the agency\u2019s second WTC  program, the WTC Expert Technical Review Panel process, and its  programs for responding to disasters.  However, the purpose of our  report was not to reiterate the technical details of EPA\u2019s efforts but to  summarize specific findings related to our key objectives.    6.  EPA asserts that it conducted extensive monitoring and modeling after  September 11, 2001, in order to determine the extent of contamination.  We acknowledge that appendix I in EPA\u2019s December 2006 plan states,  \u201cthe plumes resulting from the collapse of the towers and subsequent  fires were modeled by EPA\u201d and that \u201cEPA and many other agencies  collected and analyzed environmental samples after the September 11,  2001, attack on the WTC,\u201d and we incorporated these facts in the  report.  However, when we asked EPA to identify which samples were  taken indoors, EPA officials told us they did not have this information.   Furthermore, in the body of EPA\u2019s December 2006 program plan, EPA  acknowledges that it is no longer attempting to assess the extent of  WTC contamination.  We maintain that the challenge of identifying the  extent of WTC contamination in indoor spaces remains.    7.  We agree that neither EPA nor panel members suggested testing in  inaccessible areas as a means of determining the adequacy of its  cleanups.  However, our statement was intended to convey our belief  that if EPA had information about these areas, a more complete picture  of both the extent of contamination and the adequacy of overall efforts  directed toward cleaning and testing could be assessed.  8.  EPA takes issue with our assertion that EPA did not estimate the  resources needed to carry out its second program.  We believe that  EPA did not conduct a cost estimate that identified the resources  needed to effectively implement the second program.  As EPA stated in  comments, it provided information for potential contract costs for the  second program; however, we continue to believe that the information  was limited as it related to only one program component\u2014sampling\u2014 and it was unclear how the sampling costs related to an overall cost  estimate.  In EPA\u2019s comments, it states that cost data provided in its  interagency agreement constituted a cost estimate; however,  information on key assumptions such as estimated participation rates  as well as key program elements, including the cost of sampling, were  not included.  Further, the information provided in the interagency  agreement was not the basis for determining whether $7 million in  funding would be adequate for implementing the second program\u2014as  this amount had already been established as the remaining funds  FEMA set aside for EPA\u2019s use.  In contrast, for its first program, EPA  provided information in the interagency agreement with FEMA that  included details associated with individual cost elements, such as  sample analysis, equipment and supplies, and salary and travel costs.   For example, EPA provided detailed estimates for analytical services  based on key assumptions related to participation, samples per unit,  and the testing for specific contaminants.  EPA did not provide this  information in the second interagency agreement to support its  identification of resources needed for analytical activities.  We note  that the interagency agreement for EPA\u2019s first program identified over  $9 million for sampling and analysis of asbestos.  While the second  program is addressing three additional contaminants, the interagency  agreement has limited detail on the associated sampling and analysis  costs or how these relate to the total funding of $7 million.   9.  EPA asserts that table 1 in the draft report (figure 5 in the final report)  does not accurately characterize the IG recommendations and the  relationship between them and the CEQ charges.  As the draft report  stated, table 1 in the draft report (figure 5 in the final report) showed  key recommendations and additional input that the IG and panel  members provided to EPA.  We believe that the figure accurately  presents both recommendations such as those found in Chapter 6 of  the IG report, as well as input the IG provided in other sections of the  report that supports these specific recommendations.  The figure also  presents input provided by panel members, which we believe is not  documented comprehensively in other locations.   10. In EPA\u2019s comments, it notes that panel members were free to refocus  issues, and our draft report acknowledged that EPA adopted panel  members\u2019 input to address contamination, rather than  recontamination, of spaces.  On page 8 of its comments, EPA took  issue with our description of the panel\u2019s goals.  EPA provided the  charges identified by CEQ in its October 27, 2003, letter to the agency.   In our report, rather than present these charges, we instead reported  goals that EPA directly provided to the expert panel at its first meeting  on March 31, 2004.  We believe this is an accurate characterization of  the priorities EPA established for the panel.  11. In its comments, EPA states that the agency decided to implement a  voluntary program to test and clean residences and whole buildings.  In  fact, when requested by building owners, the December 2006 program  plan offers testing and cleaning in residential and commercial  buildings\u2019 common areas, but does not use the term \u201cwhole buildings.\u201d     12. EPA takes issue with our assessment that EPA failed to disclose the  limitations in testing results.  EPA refers to appendix I of its second  plan and notes that it contains an \u201cextensive discussion\u201d of the results  of the first program.  The appendix includes a discussion of EPA\u2019s  methodology, raw data such as the total number of samples taken, and  the results of sampling efforts but does not include a discussion of the  limitations that may have influenced these results.  EPA also notes that  discussion of its first program\u2019s test results were available in panel  meeting summaries and on EPA\u2019s WTC Web site; however, these  sources summarized presentations made to the panel and responses to  panel member comments but lacked the same discussion of limitations  as EPA\u2019s second program plan.  We continue to believe that EPA did  not include appropriate caveats that clearly articulated the limitations  in the results in its discussion, such as that 20 percent of eligible  residents participated and, therefore, the results may not have been  representative of all spaces.  Finally, GAO did not conclude that EPA  withheld data, as EPA suggested in its comments.    13. In EPA\u2019s comments, EPA disagrees with our assessment that EPA has  not demonstrated how it will overcome certain challenges identified by  expert panel members.  We acknowledge EPA\u2019s analytical capabilities  and the acute exposure guideline levels and other benchmarks that are  available to EPA.  We continue to believe that expert panel members  raised valid issues regarding EPA\u2019s second program following the WTC  disaster, including what cleanup benchmarks EPA used, what  contaminants EPA tested for, and EPA\u2019s reliance on visual evidence.   We believe these issues point to the need for protocols or interagency  agreements that clarify how EPA, along with other agencies, is to  address indoor contamination in the future.  Further, after reviewing  the summary that EPA provided on pages 24 and 25 of its comments of  the HVAC system evaluation process it employed, we continue to  believe that this process is primarily a visual assessment and that we  accurately portrayed panel member concerns with EPA\u2019s reliance on  visual evidence rather than sample data for HVAC evaluations.     14. We encourage EPA to complete and implement its Crisis  Communication Plan\u2019s companion resource guide, described in its  comments, in a timely fashion.  The public relies on EPA to provide  accurate and complete information about environmental hazards that  may affect them.  Assuring that environmental data are presented in  language that is easily understood and in easily accessible formats will  improve the public\u2019s ability to make informed decisions.  15. We note that EPA\u2019s comments indicated that since the WTC disaster,  EPA has developed more detailed cost estimates to help plan the  agency\u2019s Stafford Act activities and that the agency is working to  establish more specific reporting requirements.  In order to more fully  inform planning and to allow for the efficient allocation of disaster  funds, we encourage the agency to continue these efforts.   16. We recognized in our recommendation the role that DHS and other  federal agencies would play in developing protocols and  memorandums of understanding under the National Response Plan  that specifically address indoor contamination.  We acknowledge that  EPA plays a critical role under Emergency Support Function 10 for  addressing oil and hazardous waste releases.  It is encouraging that  EPA is pursuing a number of efforts related to chemical, biological, and  radiological incidents, including the development of protocols that  specifically address indoor contamination involving these types of  agents.  In addition to these areas, we believe that protocols specific to  indoor contamination, which define when the extent of contamination  is to be determined, as well as how and when indoor cleanups are to be  conducted, should be priorities.    17. We edited the sentence as suggested, but we note that the May 3, 2002,  letter from Christopher Ward, New York City Department of  Environmental Protection, to Brad Gair, FEMA, refers specifically to  asbestos.  It states, \u201cThe City of New York believes that it is in the  public\u2019s interest to remove this material from buildings in the vicinity  of the WTC site.  Samples collected during the inspections indicate that  asbestos  may be present in some of the debris.  The  removal of this material will assure that it will not become re-entrained  in the air in the future, thereby protecting against any adverse affects  on air quality or public health and safety.\u201d     18. We edited the sentence on residential sampling as suggested.    19. EPA is concerned that we provided additional detail beyond the  specific statement of IG recommendation 6-3.  We believe our  statement accurately characterizes the recommendation by taking into  consideration other information in the IG report.  Specifically,  preceding this recommendation, the IG provides details that support  this recommendation.  The IG states on page 51 of its August 2003  report that \u201cin the case of centralized HVAC systems, selective cleaning  does not ensure that cleaned apartments will not be recontaminated by  uncleaned apartments through the HVAC system.  Consequently, the  cleaning of contaminated buildings should proceed by treating the  building as a system.\u201d    20. We included this information in our final report.  21. EPA asserts that our discussions of EPA\u2019s efforts to develop a WTC  dust screening method are incorrect. We recognize that additional  development would have been necessary to improve the precision and  accuracy of the method and, in doing so, render the method usable as a  WTC dust screening tool.  Our draft report described the subpanel\u2019s  work to help EPA develop such a methodology and provided  information about the peer review of the methodology.  As indicated  on page 18 of its comments, EPA suggested that its method was never  intended to distinguish \u201cWTC contaminants in dust.\u201d  Our draft report  asserted that EPA was unable to develop a method for differentiating  between normal background dust and WTC dust and therefore EPA  was unable to determine the extent of WTC contamination.  We believe  the phrase \u201cWTC contaminants in dust\u201d is synonymous with dust  contaminated with \u201cWTC residue.\u201d      22. We included this information in our final report.   23. EPA disagrees with our statement that EPA did not begin examining  methods for differentiating between normal urban dust and WTC dust  until May 2004.  While multiagency workgroup and task force activities  were related, EPA initiated its specific effort to develop a method for  identifying a WTC dust signature after individual expert panel members  recommended that it do so at its May 12, 2004, meeting.  This decision  is documented in a September 8, 2006, letter from the EPA Region 2  Administrator to a Member of Congress that states, \u201cAs a result of  these  discussions, EPA decided to explore whether a WTC  signature exists in dust.\u201d  We continue to believe that our statement is  accurate.    24.  We disagree that our statement regarding workplaces is misleading.   Despite OSHA and NIOSH presentations made at panel meetings, we  continue to have concerns because these agencies do not have  authority to conduct cleanup in response to contaminant levels that  exceed EPA\u2019s site-specific cleanup benchmarks.  Furthermore, our  draft report stated that OSHA\u2019s standards are designed primarily to  address airborne contamination, while EPA\u2019s test and clean program  is designed to address contamination in building spaces, whether it is  airborne or in settled dust.  25.  We disagree with EPA\u2019s assertion that this statement creates the  impression that other agencies were not addressing health-related  issues.  Our comments were limited to the panel\u2019s ability to meet its  goals, one of which was to identify unmet public health needs.  While  EPA\u2019s facilitation of public health presentations may have provided  information about health issues, all but two expert panel members  told us that the panel did not successfully identify unmet public health  needs.  We did not address the quality of the WTC Health Registry or  other agencies\u2019 public health activities.    26.  The source of the office and residential building data is the May 12,  2004, panel meeting summary posted on EPA\u2019s Web site.  The  summary identifies a New York City Department of Buildings  database from which EPA drew this information.  27.  The draft report provided basic facts and background information  about EPA\u2019s first program that were derived from EPA\u2019s December  2006 program plan and other EPA reports in order to provide context  for the development of the second program.   28.  EPA takes issue with our draft regarding our characterization of the  availability of sample results from the New York City Department of  Health and Mental Hygiene and the Agency for Toxic Substances and  Disease Registry\u2019s study.  In fact, our draft report provided a footnote  pointing out the results of the study were made available to EPA in  February 2002.  29.  EPA said the dates we provided in a timeline of events did not  accurately portray when the results of agency studies were available  for its use.  We provided publication dates for three EPA studies in  our timeline to illustrate the range of activities that EPA engaged in  prior to its second program.  EPA also asserted that there was no  single date for reoccupation of residences.  In fact, our timeline  specifically includes the date, 9/17/2001, that New York City residents  began to reoccupy homes and Wall Street was reopened.  30.  As suggested, we replaced the term \u201ccleanup standards\u201d with \u201ccleanup  benchmarks\u201d and we expanded our discussion of how these  benchmarks were developed.    31.  EPA asserts that our statement is incorrect because it omits  discussion of cleaning in common areas.  We acknowledge that EPA  will clean in common areas under certain circumstances; however,  the context of this discussion was the panel members\u2019  recommendations that EPA clean in HVACs.    32.  We believe that the draft report correctly presents the IG  recommendation, what EPA considered, and the agency\u2019s rationale  for not electing to pursue a sampling approach that would have  addressed whole buildings; however, we clarified the report\u2019s  language to include more detail regarding EPA\u2019s proposed approach.   The July 26, 2004, panel meeting summary supports our description of  how EPA considered various approaches.  While EPA said that its  intent was not to characterize buildings but rather to use the  information from buildings \u201cto characterize areas,\u201d the meeting  summary includes a presentation by an EPA official on a sampling  approach that involved \u201c\u2026conducting air and dust sampling in several  units within the building to characterize the building.\u201d  Further, we  disagree with EPA\u2019s explanation of why its proposal to do so was  rejected by panel members and the public.  Panel members rejected  the aspect of the plan that would have limited the sampling to the  same residences that participated in EPA\u2019s first program, as panel  members wanted the plan to allow for sampling in residences that had  not participated previously. Thus, EPA\u2019s assertion in its comments  that the panel members rejected EPA\u2019s approach because it was  addressing whole buildings is not accurate.    33.  We clarified this statement in the report, noting that EPA did not  maintain a list of recommendations; however, we continue to believe  that the meeting summaries maintained by EPA did not constitute  comprehensive documentation of recommendations made by expert  panel members.   34.  We disagree that our discussion of overloaded samples is incorrect;  however, we clarified report language to indicate that sample results,  rather than samples, were discarded and that dust particles, rather  than fibers, obscured analysis.   In EPA\u2019s final report from its first  program, the agency states, \u201cthere were a number of outcomes that  resulted in inconclusive results. Filter overload was the most  common. Filter overload occurs when too many dust particles are  captured on the filter. The filter becomes obscured so technicians  examining it under a microscope cannot separate out individual  fibers. This causes an inconclusive result, which is discarded.\u201d  In its  second program plan, EPA does not present this information in its  description of its first program\u2019s test results.  We continue to believe  that this information would have provided additional context to the  public.   35.  EPA disagrees with our assessment that EPA guidance has not yet  addressed how the agency will determine the extent of contamination  resulting from disasters.  We acknowledge that EPA has built its  capacity to address contamination since the WTC disaster and that it  continues to work to develop additional sampling methods. In fact,  the draft report provided examples of research EPA is conducting,  benchmarks EPA is developing, and other preparedness activities that  EPA has undertaken.  However, we do not believe that existing  guidance or protocols have provided additional assurances that EPA  has addressed the challenges it faced from 2004 to 2005 when working  to develop a reliable screening method for WTC dust.   36.  As suggested, we edited the sentence regarding the Environmental  Response Team.   37.  As suggested, we edited the sentence regarding environmental  laboratory networks.   38.  As suggested, we edited the sentence regarding acute exposure  guideline levels.   39.  EPA noted matters for correction in an appendix that provides  background information on EPA\u2019s first and second programs.  We  edited the statement regarding EPA\u2019s role in the first program, as  suggested.  However, we note that in its final report on its first  program EPA states, \u201ccontractors cleaned and tested homes, under  the direction of the EPA.\u201d  In addition, our draft report included a  table note referring to the subset of 263 residences that EPA tested for  additional contaminants, and we have added detail regarding total  fibers.  For common areas, the draft report included the number of  samples taken from common areas, and it also notes that 144  buildings had common areas cleaned.  We clarified the appendix III  language regarding geographic extent to note that the appendix  provides program boundaries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Diane B.
