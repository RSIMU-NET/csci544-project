GAO analyzed, using various methods including regression analyses, the most recent available claims data from CMS and survey data from the American Hospital Association, in which hospitals report the types of financial arrangements they have with physicians."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Vertical consolidation is a financial arrangement that occurs when a hospital acquires a physician practice and/or hires physicians to work as salaried employees. The number of vertically consolidated hospitals and physicians increased from 2007 through 2013. Specifically, the number of vertically consolidated hospitals increased from about 1,400 to 1,700, while the number of vertically consolidated physicians nearly doubled from about 96,000 to 182,000. This growth occurred across all regions and hospital sizes, but was more rapid in recent years. After hospitals and physicians vertically consolidate, services performed in physician offices, such as evaluation & management (E/M) office visits, can be classified as being performed in hospital outpatient departments (HOPD). Medicare often pays providers at a higher rate when the same service is performed in an HOPD rather than in a physician office. For example, in 2013, the total Medicare payment rate for a mid-level E/M office visit for an established patient was $51 higher when the service was performed in an HOPD instead of a physician office.", "The percentage of E/M office visits\u2014as well as the number of E/M office visits per beneficiary\u2014performed in HOPDs, rather than in physician offices, was generally higher in counties with higher levels of vertical consolidation in 2007 through 2013. For example, the median percentage of E/M office visits performed in HOPDs in counties with the lowest levels of vertical consolidation was 4.1 percent in 2013. In contrast, this rate was 14.1 percent for counties with the highest levels of consolidation. GAO's findings suggest that Medicare will likely pay more than necessary for E/M office visits. Such excess payments are inconsistent with Medicare's role as an efficient purchaser of health care services. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that is responsible for the Medicare program\u2014lacks the statutory authority to equalize total payment rates between HOPDs and physician offices and achieve Medicare savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In order to prevent the shift of services from lower paid settings to the higher paid HOPD setting from increasing costs for the Medicare program and beneficiaries, Congress should consider directing the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to equalize payment rates between settings for E/M office visits\u2014and other services that the Secretary deems appropriate\u2014and to return the associated savings to the Medicare program.

In comparison,  the national economy grew by an average annual rate of 2.4 percent, and  total Medicare Part B spending grew by an average annual rate of 5.8  percent over the same period. Some policymakers have raised questions  about whether or to what extent the growth in spending on services  performed in HOPDs may be attributed to services that were typically  performed in physician offices shifting to HOPDs. Such a shift could  undermine Medicare\u2019s ability to be an efficient purchaser of health care  services, given that Medicare often pays providers at a higher rate\u2014 sometimes twice as much\u2014when the same service is performed in an  HOPD rather than in a physician office.", "This difference in Medicare payment rates, based on where a service is  performed, provides an incentive for hospitals to acquire physician  practices and/or hire physicians as salaried employees\u2014financial  arrangements health care experts commonly refer to as vertical  consolidation. Other factors, such as new payment polices that reward  coordination, may also incent vertical consolidation. After hospitals and  physicians vertically consolidate, the same services that were once  reimbursed at a lower total payment rate can be classified as HOPD  services and reimbursed by Medicare at a higher total payment rate. For  one common type of service that can be performed in both physician  offices and HOPDs\u2014evaluation & management (E/M) office visits\u2014 several organizations have estimated that equalizing payment rates  between physician offices and HOPDs would save Medicare billions of  dollars, with some estimates predicting savings of nearly $1 billion to $2  billion a year for the Medicare program and beneficiaries.", "You asked us to examine trends in vertical consolidation and its effects  on Medicare. In this report, we examine, for years 2007 through 2013,  1.  trends in vertical consolidation between hospitals and physicians  2.  the extent to which higher levels of vertical consolidation were  associated with more E/M office visits being performed in HOPDs  instead of physician offices.", "To examine trends in vertical consolidation between hospitals and  physicians from 2007 through 2013, we analyzed data from the American  Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database,TM in which hospitals  report the types of financial arrangements they have with physicians and  the number of physicians in those relationships. We limited our analysis  to hospitals that served Medicare beneficiaries during this period, which  we identified using Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR)  files. Additionally, based on a review of pertinent literature, we identified  and interviewed academic researchers and industry representatives  about the various types of hospital-physician relationships, possible data  sources to track vertical consolidation, and health care system policies  that could be driving consolidation.", "To examine the extent to which higher levels of vertical consolidation  were associated with more E/M office visits being performed in HOPDs  instead of physician offices, we first examined trends in the setting where  E/M office visits were performed. Specifically, we analyzed Medicare fee- for-service (FFS) claims from the Medicare Part B Carrier and Outpatient  claim files from 2007 through 2013 to identify where E/M office visits were  performed. To determine the extent to which higher levels of vertical  consolidation were associated with more E/M office visits being  performed in HOPDs rather than physician offices, we conducted two  analyses. First, we ranked counties into quintiles based on the level of  2013 vertical consolidation in each county. Specifically, the counties in  the lowest quintile were considered to have low levels of vertical  consolidation, and the next four quintiles were considered to have  medium-low, medium, medium-high, and high levels of vertical  consolidation, respectively. Within each quintile, we then calculated a  number of statistics, such as the median percentage and number of E/M  office visits per beneficiary performed in HOPDs. For each quintile, we  also calculated descriptive statistics, such as the median risk score, to  determine whether counties with higher levels of vertical consolidation  had sicker or healthier beneficiaries. Second, in order to ensure that the  relationship between consolidation and where E/M office visits were  performed was not spurious, we estimated panel-data regression models.  Our models controlled for county characteristics, such as whether a  county is urban or rural, and for health care market characteristics, such  as the level of competition among hospitals and physicians.", "Our analysis has some limitations. While the response rate for the AHA  Annual Survey DatabaseTM was generally high for each year\u2014on  average, about 76 percent of all hospitals responded\u2014and we made  efforts to identify potentially problematic responses, the data on vertical  consolidation was self-reported by hospitals. In addition, we were unable  to make our measure of vertical consolidation reflect the intensity of  vertical consolidation relationships\u2014that is, the number of vertically  consolidated physicians per hospital\u2014because of data limitations.", "We took several steps to ensure that the data used to produce this report  were sufficiently reliable. Specifically, we assessed the reliability of the  Medicare claims data we used and the AHA Annual Survey DatabaseTM  by interviewing officials responsible for overseeing and collecting these  data, including officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that is responsible for the Medicare  program. We also reviewed relevant documentation and examined the  data for obvious errors, such as missing values and values outside of  expected ranges. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report.

These services are predominantly performed  in two settings\u2014physician offices and HOPDs. Medicare FFS paid for  approximately 250 million E/M office visits in 2013.", "Under Medicare\u2019s payment policy, Medicare\u2019s total payment rate is higher  when an E/M office visit is provided in an HOPD rather than in a physician  office. When the service is provided in a physician office, Medicare  makes a single payment to the physician at Medicare\u2019s physician fee  schedule non-facility rate. When the service is provided in an HOPD,  Medicare makes two payments\u2014one payment at the physician fee  schedule facility rate and another payment to the hospital, typically at the  hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) rate. The total of  these two payment rates is higher than Medicare\u2019s total payment rate  when the service is provided in a physician office. For example, in 2013,  the total Medicare payment rate for a mid-level E/M office visit for an  established patient\u2014billed under Healthcare Common Procedure Coding  System (HCPCS) code 99213\u2014was $51 higher when the service was  performed in an HOPD instead of a physician office (see table 1).", "While CMS modified the manner in which Medicare pays for E/M office  visits after 2013, large differences in total payment rates continue to exist  for E/M office visits. Beginning in 2014, CMS made the OPPS payment  rate the same for all the HCPCS codes for E/M office visits. However, the  new uniform OPPS payment rate combined with the physician fee  schedule facility payment rate for E/M office visits provided in HOPDs  continues to exceed the payment rate for the same services performed in  physician offices. For example, in 2015, Medicare\u2019s total payment rate for  E/M office visits ranged from $58 to $86 higher when performed in an  HOPD compared to a physician office, depending on the specific HCPCS  code billed.", "Many other services, such as imaging and surgical services, are also  reimbursed at a higher rate by Medicare when performed in HOPDs  versus other settings. For example, Medicare\u2019s total payment rate for  magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine without dye (HCPCS  code 72148) was about $29 higher when performed in an HOPD  compared to a physician office in 2013. Furthermore, Medicare\u2019s total  payment rate for cataract surgery (HCPCS code 66984) was about $760  higher when performed in an HOPD compared to an ambulatory surgical  center in 2013.", "Some industry groups argue that higher payment rates for services  performed in HOPDs are justified because hospitals treat sicker patients,  incur higher costs due to the need to furnish emergency services, and  provide services that are unavailable elsewhere in the community for  vulnerable populations, such as those dually eligible for Medicare and  Medicaid. However, in separate reports, MedPAC and the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General have  recommended or suggested that Congress eliminate or reduce  differences in Medicare total payment rates across settings for various  services, including E/M office visits, imaging services, and surgical  services.

When hospitals and physicians vertically consolidate,  the hospital-owned practice must meet certain criteria to gain what is  known as provider-based status, which allows the hospital to bill the  HOPD rate, thereby increasing Medicare\u2019s total payment rate for the  same service. For example, the physician practice and hospital must be  financially and clinically integrated. Further, although exceptions exist,  physician practices are generally required to be within 35 miles of the  hospital to gain provider-based status. If a practice meets these  conditions, Medicare\u2019s total payment rate for the same service can be  substantially higher despite the fact that the practice\u2019s location, the  physicians who practice there, and the beneficiaries served could be the  same as before consolidation occurred."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Indicate an Increase in Vertical Consolidation between Hospitals and Physicians from 2007 through 2013", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of AHA survey data shows that from 2007 through 2013, the  number of vertically consolidated hospitals increased by 21 percent.

AHA\u2019s survey data show that the number of vertically consolidated  physicians increased across all regions of the country; in both urban and  rural areas; and among hospitals of different sizes. However, relatively  few hospitals accounted for a large number of vertically consolidated  physicians.

Some stated that the trend could partially be explained by  higher Medicare payment rates for services performed in HOPDs  compared to other settings, the desire among some hospitals to gain  market share, and changes in health care payment and delivery systems.  For example, accountable care organizations, bundled payment models,  and Medicare\u2019s Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program\u2014which  penalizes hospitals for high rates of readmissions\u2014provide incentives to  vertically consolidate in order to improve care for beneficiaries, maximize  payments, and minimize penalties. Researchers and industry  representatives whom we interviewed also mentioned that the increasing  challenges associated with managing a private physician practice,  including financial and regulatory burdens, could also explain some of the  increase in vertical consolidation.

While the response rate for the AHA  Annual Survey DatabaseTM was high for each year\u2014about 76 percent\u2014 the data on vertical consolidation was self-reported by hospitals. In the  process of examining the AHA Annual Survey Database,TM we identified  responses that we believe were likely duplicative. However, our ability to  identify and fix duplicative responses is limited because we were not able  to directly contact survey respondents based on our data licensing  agreement. Second, because the AHA Annual Survey DatabaseTM does  not contain identifying information for vertically consolidated physicians,  we used hospital inpatient markets to proxy vertically consolidated  physician markets. Although this is a limitation, we conducted a sensitivity  analysis with HOPD markets, and our results held. Further, we believe  there are several reasons why vertically consolidated physician markets  should substantially overlap with hospital inpatient markets. For example,  physician practices generally must be located within 35 miles of its parent  hospital to bill as an HOPD, and many payment reforms\u2014such as  accountable care organizations, bundled payments, and Medicare\u2019s  Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program\u2014reward hospitals for  managing their patients across inpatient and outpatient settings. Third,  vertically consolidated hospitals varied widely in terms of the number of  vertically consolidated physicians associated with them. While our  bivariate and regression analyses only consider a hospital vertically  consolidated if it has more than 10 vertically consolidated physicians, we  were unable to make our measure of vertical consolidation reflect the  intensity of vertical consolidation relationships\u2014that is, the number of  vertically consolidated physicians per hospital\u2014because of data  limitations. Finally, time lags may occur between vertical consolidation  and our measures of how often E/M office visits are performed in an  HOPD. A hospital can purchase physician practices and not convert them  to HOPDs immediately or ever.
