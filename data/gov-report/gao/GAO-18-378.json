Serious adverse medical events, called sentinel events, have specific follow-up requirements.

Among other objectives, this report reviews (1) the extent to which sentinel events and RCA reports are tracked and DHA ensures it has received complete information, and (2) the extent to which DHA ensures it has received MOS reports. GAO examined relevant policies; analyzed the most current available data on sentinel events from 2013 through 2016; and interviewed officials with DHA, the military services, and four MTFs selected for variety in military service, size, and geographic location."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the process for tracking the most serious adverse medical events, called sentinel events, and their root cause analysis (RCA) reports are fragmented, impeding the Defense Health Agency's (DHA) ability to ensure that it has received complete information. Unlike other adverse medical events, sentinel events\u2014which may result in severe harm or death\u2014have additional reporting requirements that must be met within specified time frames. For example, military treatment facility (MTF) officials must develop RCA reports, which identify causal factors and corrective actions for sentinel events. However, because the database that DHA uses to collect information on adverse medical events does not currently have the capability to track this information, the military services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) and DHA each maintain their own tracking records for sentinel events and RCA reports. Due to these fragmented tracking efforts, DHA reconciles its information on sentinel events and RCA reports through monthly emails to the military services\u2014a time-consuming, inefficient process. DHA officials emphasized that this process relies on the military services' cooperation because DHA does not currently have the authority to compel their responses. Moreover, despite DHA's reconciliation efforts, GAO identified discrepancies and missing information in DHA's tracking record. As a result, DHA lacks critical information about why a sentinel event may have occurred and what actions, if any, MTFs should take to prevent similar incidents in the future. Recently, DHA replaced its previous system of emails with a new tracker tool that can be accessed on the military health system website. However, the new tracker does not allow the military services to make edits, and as a result, any corrections or additional information must be submitted to DHA via email, which may perpetuate previous inefficiencies.", "GAO found that DHA cannot ensure that it is receiving all reports on the implementation of corrective actions identified in RCA reports as required by a March 2015 memo. DHA officials stated that MTFs could meet this requirement by submitting copies of their measures of success (MOS) reports, which may be required by the Joint Commission, a hospital accrediting organization. As of September 2017, DHA had received 27 MOS reports for the 319 sentinel events that were reported in 2016. However, DHA does not know how many reports it is missing because MOS reports are not required for every sentinel event, and DHA did not began reconciling its information for these reports until January 2018, when it implemented its new tracker tool. Furthermore, GAO found that the new tracker tool documents the aggregate number of MOS reports received and does not indicate whether individual sentinel events have an MOS report, impeding DHA's ability to identify which reports are missing. This issue is compounded by the fact that the military services either track MOS reports in different ways or not at all, and military service officials said that DHA's requirement for MOS report submission is not clear. DHA officials stated that they expect to clarify this requirement in their update to the patient safety policy. Because it is unable to ensure it has received all reports on the implementation of corrective actions, DHA could be missing important information that could be used to help inform broader, system-wide patient safety improvement efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) ensure DHA (1) improve tracking of sentinel events and RCA reports, and (2) clarify its requirements for submitting reports on the implementation of corrective actions and consistently track and reconcile individual reports.

DOD\u2019s Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Health Affairs sets policies\u2014including patient safety policies\u2014for the  MHS, and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) oversees the  implementation of these policies. The military services (Army, Navy, and  Air Force) and the National Capital Region (NCR) currently manage their  own hospitals and clinics, referred to as military treatment facilities (MTF).  In doing so, they develop policies that must align with DOD\u2019s policies,  including policies for reporting adverse medical events that occur in their  facilities.

The most serious  type of adverse medical event is called a sentinel event, which can result  in unexpected death or serious physical or psychological harm to the  patient. For every sentinel event, MTF officials are required to prepare a  root cause analysis (RCA) report, which is intended to identify the factors  that caused or contributed to the sentinel event, as well as corrective  actions needed to prevent future incidents. For most sentinel events, an  additional report\u2014a Measures of Success (MOS) report\u2014 may be  required by the Joint Commission, a hospital accrediting organization that  reviews sentinel events and assigns follow-up activities to accredited  MTFs for these events.

In August 2014, DOD released a review of the MHS that  addressed patient safety, among other issues. While DOD\u2019s review  found that the culture of safety within the system was comparable to that  found in the civilian sector, the report made a number of  recommendations that included the clarification of policy on the definitions  for sentinel events to reduce variation in interpretation.

The JPSR system is intended to provide ways to  facilitate the self-reporting, collection, and aggregation of adverse medical  event data across the MHS. The system includes prompts for information  about factors that may have contributed to the event, such as medication  or equipment, as well as the assignment of a severity category.", "From 2013 through 2016, the total number of reported adverse medical  events in the JPSR system increased from over 76,000 to about 108,000.  When analyzing adverse medical events, DHA groups the data into three  categories\u2014near miss, no harm, and harm. The highest increase was in  the near miss category (about 36,000 to 56,000) while the other two  categories increased to a lesser extent. According to an internal DHA  publication, a higher increase in near miss events alongside a decrease  in harm and no harm events is considered a positive trend because it  shows that more potential adverse medical events are being detected  before they reach the patient.

In  March 2015, DOD issued a memo that revised its previous definition of a  sentinel event, which was an unexpected occurrence involving death or  serious physical or psychological injury or risk. The revised definition  states that a sentinel event is a patient safety event (not primarily related  to the natural course of the patient\u2019s illness or underlying condition) that  results in death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm. The  revised definition also added a list of events outlined by the Joint  Commission and the National Quality Forum that go beyond those that  result in unexpected death or serious physical or psychological harm to  the patient. (See app. I for the revised definition of sentinel events.)", "From 2013 through 2016, DHA\u2019s data showed an increase in the total  number of reported sentinel events\u2014both medical and dental\u2014from 121  to 319. Medical sentinel events approximately doubled from 101 to 206,  while dental sentinel events increased more than fivefold from 20 to 113.  (See fig. 2.) The sharp increase in events in 2015 may have been  influenced by DHA\u2019s revised definition of sentinel events as well as the  Army\u2019s inclusion of dental events that meet sentinel event criteria. A  DHA internal publication also noted that a culture shift in patient safety  reporting could have contributed to this increase.", "As with all adverse medical events, MTF personnel must enter sentinel  events into the JPSR system; however, sentinel events have additional  reporting requirements that must be met within specified time frames. For  example, DHA policy requires MTF officials to report sentinel events to  their respective military service or NCR within 24 hours after they become  aware of the event. (See fig. 3, step 1.) MTFs also must report to and  comply with sentinel event reporting requirements established by the  Joint Commission. These requirements include the development and  submission of an RCA report for each sentinel event to identify the causal  and contributory factors associated with the event as well as the  corrective actions needed to prevent future incidents. The military  services and NCR submit copies of their RCA reports to DHA, which rates  the corrective actions included in each RCA report as stronger,  intermediate, or weaker based on an estimation of their effectiveness.  (See fig. 3, step 2.) DHA uses commercial process improvement software  called TapRooT to assist with the development of RCA reports, and DHA  requires all MTFs to use a methodology for its RCA reports that is  currently supported by this software.", "Additionally, once the Joint Commission approves an RCA report and its  associated corrective action plan, it may require the preparation of an  MOS report that assesses the corrective actions 4 months after an RCA  report is submitted to determine whether the implementation of corrective  actions and outcome measures was successful. Unlike RCA reports,  these reports are only required for selected sentinel events as determined  by the Joint Commission. DOD\u2019s March 2015 memo that revised the  definition of sentinel events contained an additional requirement for the  military services and NCR to submit copies of reports on the  implementation of corrective actions to DHA.

In January 2015, DHA  established an MHS-wide information technology system called the  Partnership for Improvement. The Partnership for Improvement collects  data from MTFs and assesses MTF performance on approximately 38  health care measures that were established by a committee of MHS  officials and designed to improve readiness, population health, and  quality of care as well as control costs. Three of these measures focus on  patient safety\u2014central line-associated bloodstream infection, unintended  retained foreign object, and wrong site surgery. To track these  measures, DHA officials told us that they created an associated  performance dashboard, including acceptable ranges for each measure,  to provide visibility into MHS, military service-, and NCR-level  performance. The dashboard is available to all MHS users on the system  website and allows MTF leaders and staff to review MTF-level  performance data. DHA officials conduct quarterly system-wide  performance assessments on these measures. DHA officials told us they  use the data on this dashboard to determine what is improving and where  to make changes. Officials from each of the military services, NCR, and  each of the MTFs we visited told us they are aware of the Partnership for  Improvement and its associated dashboard and that they review the data  to assess their performance.", "Publications on Patient Safety.

This monthly publication contains an  overview of adverse medical event and sentinel event data, trends  across the MHS, and short descriptions of sentinel events that have  been reported in the system in the same month. Additionally, this  publication may include reports of medical product deficiencies, or  materials that have been determined to be or are suspected of being  harmful, defective, deteriorated, or unsatisfactory because of  malfunction or design.", "Annual patient safety report. This yearly publication provides a  retrospective status update on MHS patient safety initiatives and in- depth adverse event and sentinel event trend analysis, system-wide  and by military service. Content includes trends in adverse events  reported in JPSR, sentinel events, and RCAs, including information on  weaker, intermediate, and stronger corrective actions.

The report also details online resources for MHS officials.", "Focused review. According to officials, focused review publications  are produced three times a year, and the topics are related to adverse  medical events and associated follow-up data provided to DHA as  determined by data and performance trends. For example, in  September 2016, the publication included an explanation of the basic  components of an RCA, including their associated corrective actions  and factors DHA considers when determining if they are stronger,  intermediate, or weaker. This publication included 2013 through 2016  system-wide data, such as the number of RCAs submitted, the most  common root cause categories, and the proportion of RCAs with  stronger, weaker, or no corrective actions. The publication also  included an example of a decrease in occurrences of wrong-site  surgery accompanied by an improvement in RCAs with stronger  corrective actions, common pitfalls in conducting high-quality RCAs,  and recommendations to conduct better RCAs.", "Patient safety alerts. DHA uses these publications to inform the  MHS about immediate hazards, and officials told us they produce  these publications on an as-needed basis. For example, a July 2016  report was focused on unintended retained foreign objects during  surgery, specifically, pieces of gloves. The publication described  recent occurrences of retained pieces of gloves, glove selection best  practices, tips for preventing unintended retention, and corrective  actions when retention occurs.", "Global Trigger Tool. The Global Trigger Tool is a new tool for collecting  adverse medical event data by selecting a sample of medical charts that  was implemented MHS-wide as of September 2017. Unlike traditional  methods to detect adverse events, the Global Trigger Tool does not focus  on voluntary reporting and tracking of adverse medical events. Instead, a  team of three reviewers managed by DHA uses the tool methodology to  retrospectively examine a random selection of patient medical charts at a  facility over time to identify \u201ctriggers\u201d (or clues) that may lead to an  adverse medical event. The 53 triggers include events such as a patient  fall or readmission to the emergency department within 48 hours of  treatment. If a trigger is discovered, the medical chart is further reviewed  to determine if an adverse event occurred. After the Global Trigger Tool  review is complete, the contractor is able to provide facility leaders with  rates of harmful adverse events per 1,000 patient days and per 100  admissions. Results from the tool are intended to aid MTFs in  understanding the true frequency of harm events and in identifying  systemic issues that contribute to patient safety events. All inpatient  MTFs across the MHS will use the tool, and implementation began in  2017. The Global Trigger Tool has just begun to provide data to the  MTFs, and DHA officials told us that 6 to 12 months of data is  recommended before the tool can be used to make improvements.", "Sentinel Event and Root Cause Analysis (SERCA) tool.

The SERCA  tool displays sentinel event and RCA data from DHA\u2019s internal tracking  record reported by the military services and NCR. It is intended to provide  quick, online access to sentinel event trends MHS-wide and at the military  service, NCR, and MTF levels. The SERCA tool is also intended to  facilitate sharing of lessons learned and best practices based on sentinel  events and RCAs in a single platform. DHA officials told us that  individuals with access to the system will be able to see a breakdown of  corrective actions submitted by other MTFs for a particular type of  sentinel event and whether these corrective actions were rated as  stronger, intermediate, or weaker by DHA. DHA officials told us that for  now, they will allow the military services and NCR to determine who has  access to the system. Officials from two military services and NCR told us  that they have access to this tool and are responsible for granting access  to their MTFs.

However, the current fragmented and inconsistent  tracking process across the military services and NCR has impeded the  efficiency of DHA\u2019s efforts to ensure DHA has complete information about  sentinel events and RCA reports. Furthermore, DHA cannot ensure that it  is receiving all reports on the implementation of corrective actions, such  as MOS reports, and does not know how many reports it is missing for a  number of reasons, including those related to policy, tracking, and  reconciliation efforts. Collectively, all of these information gaps impair  DHA\u2019s ability to fully understand the types of sentinel events that are  occurring in its MTFs, the corrective actions that have been implemented,  and whether these actions have been effective.
