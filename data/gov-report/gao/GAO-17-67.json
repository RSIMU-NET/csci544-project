SBA has published written and electronic materials about the disaster loan process, but applicants cannot easily access these materials from SBA's dedicated disaster loan web portal, contrary to federal guidelines for improving digital services. Also, SBA's materials provide inconsistent information on the process, required documents, and estimated processing time frames. Business loan applicants reported that they found the documentation requirements confusing and the application time frames unclear. PRA and an OMB directive on open government generally state that agencies should explain the collection and use of information and promote transparency by providing the public with information about government activities. Similarly, some Small Business Development Centers told GAO that loan applicants have expressed confusion over undefined financial terminology in SBA's loan application, particularly terminology in the required personal financial statement. Federal law requires agencies' forms be written using plain language that is appropriate for the intended audience. Improved integration of electronic resources and consistency of information in SBA's materials would help business disaster victims better access resources and understand the disaster loan process and expected time frames.

The Paperwork  Reduction Act requires an agency to establish a process to evaluate an  information collection. SBA\u2019s 2006 Forms Management Program, SOP 00  30 3, provides written operating procedures for the agency\u2019s Paperwork  Reduction Act clearance process. Figure 3 shows the overall process.  First, Records Management Division officials identify which SBA forms  will expire in 6 months, determine the program office responsible for each  form, and issue an expiration memorandum to the program office with a  timeline to complete the Paperwork Reduction Act clearance process.  The Records Management Division uses the Regulatory Information  Service Center and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs  Consolidated Information System, OMB\u2019s electronic system, to identify  which collections of information, such as loan application forms, will  expire in 6 months. Next, Records Management Division officials said  they solicit public comments and coordinate with the relevant program  offices as well as Office of General Counsel (OGC) and Office of  Inspector General (OIG) to evaluate the information collection. After the  internal reviews are completed, the Records Management Division  submits the Paperwork Reduction Act submission package to OMB  electronically and concurrently posts a 30-day Federal Register notice  seeking public comment on the proposed collection of information.", "Following this comment period, OMB notifies SBA whether it has  approved SBA\u2019s Paperwork Reduction Act submission package and, if  approved, provides the OMB control number and expiration date for the  approved forms.", "SBA\u2019s requirement that program offices complete and sign routing forms  aligns with Paperwork Reduction Act requirements that the head of an  agency certify that the information collection is necessary for the proper  performance of the agency\u2019s functions. The Records Management  Division coordinates the program office reviews. For example, ODA  oversees the renewal of Forms 5 and 1368. Two forms, OMB Form 83-I  and SBA\u2019s Form 58, document that program offices involved in the  collection of information have reviewed and approved the Paperwork  Reduction Act submission package. The first form is OMB Form 83-I,  which is OMB\u2019s Paperwork Reduction Act submission form that an  agency uses to certify that it is in compliance with the Paperwork  Reduction Act requirements by identifying the type and purpose of the  collection information being submitted to OMB. Form 83-I also includes a  supporting statement, which justifies the necessity of a collection of  information and use of statistical methods to reduce burden, if applicable.  The second form is SBA\u2019s Form 58, which is SBA\u2019s Record of Clearance  and Approval that tracks the completion of SBA\u2019s Paperwork Reduction  Act Clearance Process.

The Paperwork Reduction Act requires an  agency to establish an independent process that evaluates whether or not  the Paperwork Reduction Act submission package meets the act\u2019s  requirements. SBA Form 58 allows the involved program offices and  OGC to review the Paperwork Reduction Act submission package and  verify its compliance with the act\u2019s requirements. OGC officials stated that  they review OMB Form 83-I, supporting statements, and applicable  information collection instruments to ensure compliance with Paperwork  Reduction Act requirements.

OIG officials stated that they do not sign the SBA  Form 58 to preserve their independence and not create a perception that  the OIG endorses a program office\u2019s document. According to SBA, the  agency\u2019s policy to have both OGC and OIG review and have OGC sign- off on a Paperwork Reduction Act submission package helps the agency  not only to achieve its goal of getting OMB to approve the package prior  to the expiration of a disaster business loan form, but also to identify and  address risks or areas of noncompliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Internal Controls to Monitor Compliance with Form Renewal Process", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with applicable federal internal controls, SBA has a monitoring  system to identify and remedy deficiencies in the Paperwork Reduction  Act clearance process.

One of the  three SBDCs told us of instances where applicants thought they had  provided all the required documentation, but received subsequent  requests from SBA for additional documentation. In a 2014 report on  disaster assistance, we found in interviews with SBDCs and local  business organizations that SBA\u2019s follow-up requests for additional  documentation prolonged the application process and loan decision.  Furthermore, we observed that although the paper application form  includes a list of additional information that may be requested, the  Electronic Loan Application does not include a list of other information  an applicant may have to provide SBA in addition to the required  forms. Also, as of August 2016, the Electronic Loan Application did  not contain two disaster business loan forms: (1) SBA Form 159D \u2013  Fee Disclosure and Compensation, and (2) SBA Form 1368 \u2013  Additional Filing Requirements Economic Injury Disaster Loan, and  Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan. According to SBA  officials, SBA includes links to these two forms in follow-up letters sent  to disaster business loan applicants after they submit their loan  applications.", "Lack of information about the reasons for required documents.", "According to responses from SBA\u2019s survey of loan applicants  provided by SBA, one survey respondent said that the loan process  required too much information from applicants when SBA could  access the same information elsewhere. The applicant cited that she  should not have to locate copies of her tax return when SBA can use  her signed tax transcript form to obtain tax information from the IRS.  Further, according to one SBDC we interviewed, applicants it assisted  did not understand why SBA requires applicants to submit both a  current tax return and complete an IRS tax transcript authorization  form. SBA officials said that tax transcripts do not provide all the  information contained in a tax return. Therefore, they need information  from transcripts and returns to make loan decisions. However, the  reasons why are unclear to applicants because none of the available  resources provide this explanation.", "Consistent with comments provided by SBDCs, the loan application  process received the lowest satisfaction scores on the ACSI survey.  According to the ACSI survey results for 2012 through 2015, the loan  application process received business loan applicants\u2019 and recipients\u2019  lowest satisfaction scores of any SBA disaster loan program processes.  The SBA Disaster Loan Program processes surveyed in the ACSI are  application process, decision process, Customer Service Center, loan  closing, inspection process, SBA staff, and recovery center. In response  to questions about the application process, survey respondents were  least satisfied with the \u201camount of paperwork required to complete the  loan application\u201d and \u201cease of attaining the information required to fill out  the application.\u201d Moreover, based on the survey results, ACSI  recommended from 2012 to 2015 that SBA focus on improving the  application process as a means of increasing business loan applicants\u2019  and recipients\u2019 satisfaction with the process.", "In addition, SBDCs reported and surveys found that applicants\u2019  expectations about the time frames associated with the entire process  were unmet and available resources do not consistently inform applicants  about expected time frames.", "Unmet expectations about time frame to apply for and receive  loans. Two SBDCs we interviewed told us that business applicants  commonly complained about how long it took to go through the loan  process and that it took too long to receive their loans. Two other  SBDCs suggested that SBA could provide more information about the  loan process to better manage applicants\u2019 expectations. Specifically,  one SBDC suggested SBA could provide more information about  estimated time frames. Another SBDC said some of the applicants the  SBDC assisted expected a faster loan process, and many business  owners may start a loan application but never complete the  application because they cannot spare time away from their business  to collect all the required documents and to complete the loan  application forms. In addition, according to responses from SBA\u2019s  survey of loan applicants provided by SBA, one survey respondent  suggested that the business loan process should require fewer and  shorter application forms. Another respondent said that the business  loan process is too complicated and too time-consuming, and the  respondent withdrew the loan application as a result.", "Information about time frames not included in all resources. The  three-step process flier and the resource guide for businesses provide  estimates of expected time frames for the processing and closing  steps of the loan process. However, the Electronic Loan Application  and some other resources do not provide an applicant with any  estimated time frame of when the disaster business loan application  will be processed. The Electronic Loan Application does provide the  applicant with application status messages, such as \u201cprocessing  application.\u201d See appendix V for application status messages and  descriptions. According to SBA officials, SBA has updated its disaster  forecasting model and planning documents that enable SBA to better  estimate loan processing time frames based on the severity of a  disaster, the volume of expected loan applications, and other factors.", "According to the ACSI survey results for 2012 through 2015, loan  applicants and recipients surveyed consistently rated the loan decision  process with the second-lowest satisfaction scores. In response to  questions about the decision process, survey respondents were least  satisfied with the \u201ctimeliness of the decision.\u201d Based on the survey results,  ACSI recommended from 2012-2015 that SBA focus on improving the  loan decision process as a means of increasing applicants\u2019 and  recipients\u2019 satisfaction with the process.", "The Paperwork Reduction Act and OMB state that agencies should  explain the collection and use of personal information and promote  transparency with the public. In particular, the Paperwork Reduction Act  has a broad requirement that an agency explains to the person receiving  an information collection the reasons for collecting the information and the  agency\u2019s use of the collected information. Furthermore, according to  OMB\u2019s directive on open government, transparency promotes  accountability by providing the public with information about government  activities. However, SBA\u2019s paper and online resources do not provide  consistent information about the three-step loan process, required  documents and reasons for the requirements, and processing time  frames, which could be contributing to applicants\u2019 confusion. According to  SBA officials, SBA\u2019s customer service representatives working in disaster  areas provide applicants information about the loan process, including  explaining the three-step loan process and estimated time frames for  completing the process. SBA officials also added that they refer business  applicants to SBDCs for additional assistance in completing disaster loan  applications. However, as previously mentioned, we found that SBDCs  were not always well informed about information resources that explained  the disaster loan process. Further, business applicants who apply without  seeking assistance from SBA or SBDCs may see only SBA\u2019s fact sheet,  reference guide, loan-process flier, or application forms.

Although the loan forms include  instructions, the instructions do not define the financial terminology.  According to SBA officials, when applicants do not know how to create a  personal financial statement, the agency\u2019s customer service  representatives direct applicants to SBDCs for help. Two of the three  SBDCs said these difficulties arise among business owners who do not  have formal education or training in finance or related disciplines\u2014and  who are attempting applications during high-stress periods following  disasters.", "Federal statute requires agencies to use clear and understandable  terminology. Specifically, the Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires that  federal agencies use plain writing in every document that they issue.  Plain writing is defined as clear, well-organized writing that follows best  practices appropriate for the intended audience. According to SBA  officials, although the agency does not provide a glossary that defines  finance terminology in loan application forms, the online application portal  has a \u201ccontextual help\u201d feature that incorporates information from  application forms\u2019 instructions to help applicants complete disaster loan  forms. Additionally, as previously stated, SBA officials said that there are  other resources, such as SBA customer service representatives and local  SBDCs, available to assist business loan applicants and to explain the  loan forms and key terms. As mentioned earlier, promoting disaster  preparedness among businesses is one of the strategies in SBA\u2019s 2015  performance report and actions SBA has taken include holding disaster  preparedness webinars and conducting regional outreach.

In addition, without consistent information about the  loan process, explanation of documentation requirements, and expected  time frames in SBA\u2019s resource materials, loan applicants and resource  partners may continue to find the loan process confusing. Further, without  defining financial terminology in loan forms some applicants may not fully  understand the requirements of the application.

In instances where a county had the two highest number of loan  approvals, the county with the third highest number of approved disaster  business loans was selected. To select the eight SBDCs to interview, we  used the city and zip code of the counties with the highest number of  approved disaster business loans to identify the SBDCs located either  within or nearby these counties. If a county with the highest number of  approved disaster business loans did not have an SBDC located within it,  we then selected the SBDC closest to the zip code receiving the highest  number of disaster business loan approvals. If a county had multiple  SBDCs located within it, we then looked at the zip code affected by the  disaster in the county and selected the SBDC closest to the zip code  receiving the highest number of disaster business loan approvals.
