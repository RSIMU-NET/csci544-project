In addition, armed groups have profited from the exploitation of minerals. In 2010, Congress enacted Section 1502(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to address the exploitation of conflict minerals, which include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, and the extreme levels of violence in the DRC. As required by Section 1502(b), the SEC issued a rule in August 2012 that requires companies to disclose their use of conflict minerals and the origin of those minerals. The act requires GAO to report on the rule\u0092s effectiveness, among other issues, beginning in 2012 and annually thereafter.", "Initial company disclosure reports to SEC that would enable GAO to assess the effectiveness of the rule will not be due until May 2014.

Agency and industry officials as well as representatives from international organizations and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) stated that adoption of the rule as well as stakeholder-developed initiatives--which include the development of guidance documents, audit protocols, and in-region sourcing of conflict minerals--can support companies' efforts to conduct due diligence and to identify and responsibly source conflict minerals. For example, officials GAO interviewed explained that the Conflict-Free Smelter Program enables suppliers to source conflict minerals from smelters (companies that refine the ore of the conflict minerals into metals) that have been certified by an independent third-party auditor as obtaining their minerals from sources that did not benefit armed groups. However, officials GAO interviewed cited constraining factors such as lack of security, lack of infrastructure, and lack of capacity in the DRC that could affect the ability to expand on efforts to achieve conflict-free sourcing of minerals from eastern DRC and thereby potentially contribute to armed groups' benefiting from the conflict minerals trade. For example, officials GAO interviewed noted that there is a lack of infrastructure in place that would enable companies to set up or expand operations in the DRC. Limited transportation and poor roads in eastern DRC also make it difficult to get to mine sites. Moreover, according to officials, the remoteness of mines also makes it difficult for DRC officials to validate mines and ensure that the mines have not been compromised by illegal armed groups.", "Companies that are not required to file disclosures under SEC's conflict minerals rule may be affected by the rule. These companies may supply components or parts that contain conflict minerals to companies that report to SEC under the rule, many of which could be original equipment manufacturers and component parts manufacturers. Estimates provided by public commentators responding to the rule indicate that roughly 280,000 suppliers could provide products to roughly 6,000 companies that report to the SEC under the rule and may be asked to provide information on their use of conflict minerals and the origin of the minerals as part of the rule's due diligence requirements. GAO found little available aggregated information about companies that do not report to SEC under the rule. However, GAO found that for smelters and refiners there is some aggregated information, such as the types of conflict minerals they use and their location. For example, GAO found that over half of the 278 smelters and refiners of conflict minerals it identified were located in Asia, many processed tin, and most did not have a conflict minerals policy publicly available."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has long been the site of  one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.

The DRC  was colonized as a personal possession of Belgian King Leopold II in  1885 and administered by the Belgian government starting in 1907. It  achieved independence from Belgium in 1960. For almost 30 years of the  post-independence period, the DRC, then known as Zaire, was ruled by  an authoritarian regime under Mobutu Sese Seko. Following the 1994  genocide in Rwanda and the establishment of a new government there,  some perpetrators of the genocide and refugees fled to the neighboring  Kivu provinces of eastern DRC. A rebellion began there in 1996, pitting  the forces led by Laurent Kabila against the army of President Mobutu  Sese Seko. Kabila\u2019s forces, aided by Rwanda and Uganda, took the  capital city of Kinshasa in 1997 and renamed the country the Democratic  Republic of the Congo.

In 2001 Laurent  Kabila was assassinated and leadership shifted to his son Joseph Kabila,  while the civil war continued. Starting in 1999 the UN Security Council  authorized peacekeeping operations in the DRC which have been  operating as the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). Initially, the  operation\u2019s focus was on the ceasefire and disengagement of forces and  maintenance of liaison with all parties involved with the civil war but then  expanded to include the effective protection of civilians, humanitarian  personnel and human rights defenders under imminent threat of physical  violence. The presence of illegal armed groups, such as M23, has  continued to be an issue that MONUSCO has monitored in recent years.  In November 2012, M23 occupied the city of Goma, a provincial capital in  eastern DRC in the North Kivu province, and other cities in eastern DRC  and clashed with the Congolese national army. During this time, the UN  reported cases of sexual violence perpetrated by armed groups and  members of the Congolese national army against women and children.  While M23 eventually withdrew from the cities, the group\u2019s presence in  the region continues. In February 2013, the UN reported that eastern  DRC continues to be plagued by recurrent waves of conflict, chronic  humanitarian crises, and serious human rights violations, including sexual  and gender-based violence. The report added that contributing factors to  the cycles of violence have been the continuing presence of Congolese  and foreign armed groups taking advantage of security vacuums in the  eastern part of the country, the illegal exploitation of resources,  interference by neighboring countries, and the weak capacity of the  national army and police to effectively protect civilians and the national  territory and ensure law and order.

Examples of such initiatives include the ITRI Tin Supply Chain Initiative  (iTSCi) and the Conflict-Free Tin Initiative (CFTI). (See app. III for more  detailed information on these and selected other in-region sourcing  initiatives). The iTSCi initiative was developed by a tin industry  association known as ITRI. The initiative supports responsible sourcing of  tin, tantalum, and tungsten from Central Africa and was launched in  Rwanda in December 2010 and in the Katanga province of the DRC in  March 2011. iTSCi expanded its activities in the Maniema province of the  DRC in December 2012. We reported in 2012 that iTSCi is a traceability  and due diligence program that creates auditable and verifiable chains of  custody for tin, tantalum, and tungsten through (1) tagging and bagging of  materials and the collection of tagging data and (2) regular incident  reporting and continuous monitoring of mines and companies  participating in the program. In October 2012, the Dutch government, with  industry partners such as iTSCi, started the Conflict-Free Tin Initiative  focused on conflict-free tin sourcing from South Kivu in the DRC, a region  that is prone to insecurity and violence by illegal armed groups.

For example, iTSCi reported in February 2013  that the tin initiative in South Kivu had led to a number of immediate  benefits for the local population, which depends on mining as its source of  income. Specifically, the price paid to the miners for conflict-free minerals  mined at the site had more than doubled. iTSCi further reported that the  additional income had allowed the mining cooperatives to invest in basic  equipment such as electricity generators and to improve productivity and  working conditions.

The UN reported  that the DRC government has been unable to exercise authority in  eastern DRC, which has become more evident as illegal armed groups  clashed in the Kivu provinces late in 2012. State also reported that lack of  security has prevented the export of conflict-free minerals from certain  areas in eastern DRC. Industry and NGO officials who work on the  ground in the DRC pointed out that the threat from illegal armed groups  poses a challenge to the conflict-free minerals initiatives operating in  eastern DRC and the neighboring provinces. Although the mining sites  are constantly monitored, the monitoring activities could be suspended at  any time as the security situation evolves. For example, an NGO reported  that tagging was suspended for days in July 2012 at an iTSCi site in the  Katanga province because of the movement of armed groups in the  vicinity of the mine sites; however, there were no reported cases of armed  groups successfully taking control of the sites or directly exploiting  minerals to fund activities.", "In-region sourcing initiatives have operated in areas that have been  vetted by various stakeholders and have the support of government and  civil society actors.

However, the UNGoE reported a \u201cgenuine risk that military  actors would move their rackets to mining activities that were not closely  supervised.\u201d They further reported that the gold trade is linked to armed  groups and criminal networks in the Congolese armed forces. According  to the UNGoE, lack of security at gold mining sites throughout eastern  DRC remained widespread. Agency officials emphasized that armed  groups still existed in the DRC despite the initiatives in place and would  seek control of any significant revenue-producing activity in the region.", "Some industry officials cited concerns about sourcing from the DRC, even  through the in-region sourcing initiatives, because of the potential impact  on brand reputation and financial risk. For example, a representative of a  smelter indicated that if the company purchased minerals from a mine  that is part of a traceability scheme that is deemed conflict-free but then  illegal armed groups infiltrated and compromised the mine in the future,  the company would not be able to say with certainty that the minerals it  had purchased were conflict-free.", "Officials cited limited infrastructure as a factor that could affect the  creation or expansion of in-region sourcing initiatives. Officials from  UNGoE and industry representatives we interviewed noted a lack of  infrastructure in place that would enable companies to set up or expand  operations in the DRC. Limited transportation and poor roads in eastern  DRC also make it difficult to get to mine sites. For example, an agency  official in the DRC commented that mines may be a day\u2019s walk from a  main road. Also, an NGO reported that in selecting a potential pilot site for  a traceability scheme, accessibility to the site by road was a key criterion  and would involve using off-road vehicles due to the significant  deterioration of roads leading to the mine. Moreover, according to an  NGO representative, the remoteness of mines also makes it difficult for  DRC mine officials to validate mines and ensure that the mines have not  been compromised by armed groups. Furthermore, State officials  indicated that the lack of infrastructure prevents trade initiatives from  developing economies of scale and expanding.", "Officials we interviewed cited the lack of technical, economic, and political  capacity as another factor that may affect the creation or expansion of in- region sourcing initiatives focused on responsible sourcing in the DRC  and neighboring countries. In 2013, the OECD reported that while the  understanding of responsible sourcing is \u201chigh for those actors in the  DRC and Rwanda who have participated in such initiatives, the same is  not true for state agents\u201d in the country. The OECD report also pointed  out that Ugandan and Burundian government officials and other entities  lack technical understanding of due diligence requirements. Some NGO  officials stated that lack of capacity can impact the due diligence process  in the supply chain, especially if the numbers of trained mining agents is  insufficient. For example, some agency officials and an NGO reported  that the DRC does not have enough mine agents to certify the mines, of  which there may be over 2,000 in eastern DRC alone, or even to  negotiate and manage mining contracts. Moreover, an NGO official stated  that mines need to be reinspected every 6 to 12 months in order to  ensure proper due diligence in accordance with OECD and ICGLR  guidance; however, the NGO official stated that the DRC government  does not have the capacity to inspect at such frequency.", "Some agency officials and officials we interviewed from industry, NGOs,  and international organizations also commented that the DRC  government lacks capacity to mitigate corruption and smuggling. The lack  of capacity can impact due diligence and can contribute to illegal minerals  trade and cross-border smuggling. For example, the UN reported that  illegal trade of minerals undermines the exercise of due diligence in the  DRC and affects the credibility of due diligence-based certification and  traceability systems. According to some industry experts, mining agents may not be properly compensated, due to the lack of governance in  eastern DRC, and may look for other ways to earn money, which could  involve colluding with illegal armed groups.", "With regard to smuggling, the OECD reported that as long as there are no  traceability or certification schemes in place that cover the whole region,  and most notably, the Kivu provinces, Uganda, and Burundi, smuggling  and contamination of clean materials will continue to pose a threat to  formalization of the artisanal mining sector and due diligence initiatives.  According to a 2012 UNGoE report, several tons of gold worth hundreds  of millions of dollars are smuggled from the eastern DRC through  neighboring countries, where it is ultimately smelted and sold to jewelers  in markets, such as the United Arab Emirates. Representatives from  some industry associations that we interviewed stated that armed groups  and criminal elements have shifted efforts to gold mines because it is  relatively easy to smuggle gold because of its size. Furthermore, gold\u2019s  high value in the market makes it more viable for smuggling than tin,  tantalum, and tungsten."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Many Companies Not Required to Report to SEC under the Conflict Minerals Rule Will Likely Be Affected; Limited Aggregated Information about Them Exists", "paragraphs": ["Even companies that are not required to file disclosures under SEC\u2019s  conflict minerals rule will likely be affected by the rule.

SEC relied on estimates provided by a  commentator indicating that 278,000 suppliers\u2014most of which would be  companies that would not report to SEC under the rule\u2014could be  indirectly impacted by the rule. Moreover, the release contains an  estimate that each of the nearly 6,000 companies that could be directly  impacted by the rule has roughly 1,000 first-tier suppliers, on average.  These suppliers, including first-tier suppliers, could provide products that  contain conflict minerals to companies required to report to SEC under  the rule. Examples of these products include tin solder for joining metal,  tantalum capacitors for storing energy in cellular phones, tungsten  carbide for hardened cutting tools, or gold plating for wires to increase  durability and resistance to corrosion. The first-tier supplier has a direct  commercial relationship with the original equipment manufacturer,  meaning the first-tier supplier sells materials or component parts, which  have been aggregated by suppliers throughout the supply chain, to the  original equipment manufacturer for final assembly. According to an  industry official, in general, component parts manufacturers construct  individual parts\u2014such as capacitors, engine parts, circuit boards, and  other components\u2014and assemble them into more complex components.", "Estimate of the Number of Companies  Required to Report to SEC under the Rule  SEC estimates that 5,994 reporting issuers  (primarily companies that issue stock publicly  and are required to report to SEC) will be  affected by the rule and will need to determine  if their products contain conflict minerals.  According to SEC, reporting issuers are  domestic and foreign companies that file  forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F under the  Securities Exchange Act. According to SEC  and industry officials, these companies vary in  size and revenue, but in general, tend to be  larger, mature companies that can have a  diverse product line; their revenues can range  from the millions of dollars to hundreds of  billions; they are domestic and foreign  companies; and they may have operations in  several countries. According to SEC and  industry officials, some reporting issuers may  sell products to consumers.", "Using an electronics company as a model, processed metals move  through several suppliers that manufacture component parts after the  smelter\u2014first to circuit board and computer chip manufacturers, then to  cellular phone and other electronics manufacturers, and finally to the  brand-name electronics company, which is the original equipment  manufacturer that manufactures products recognizable to the consumer,  such as cellular phones, tablets, and laptop computers. Beyond the first- tier supplier, there are tier 2-, 3-, 4-, or higher-tiered suppliers that,  beginning with the raw materials from the smelter or refiner, manufacture  component parts that are assembled into more complex component parts  as they move from higher- to lower-tiered suppliers in the supply chain, to the first-tier supplier, and finally to the original equipment manufacturer.See figure 4 for a simplified version of the supply chain, and the tiered  structure of suppliers.", "While many companies will likely be directly or indirectly impacted by the  rule, some companies that use conflict minerals may not be, partly  because (1) the companies are not issuers that are required to file with  SEC under the Securities Exchange Act, and (2) these same companies  potentially do not sell components or parts to a company that will be  required to report to SEC under the rule. Industry and consulting firm  representatives have differing views on the number of companies that  purchase conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries but may  not be impacted by the rule.", "Suppliers that provide products that may contain conflict minerals to  companies required to report to SEC under the rule may provide  information on the minerals\u2019 origins to those reporting companies that  request it. The SEC release does not specify the steps and outcomes for  the reasonable country of origin inquiry, and indicates that such a  determination depends on each issuer\u2019s facts and circumstances.  However, in conducting a country of origin inquiry, issuers may inquire of  their suppliers the origin of any conflict minerals in the products.  According to the release, the issuer\u2019s inquiry must be reasonably  designed to determine whether any of its conflict minerals originated in  the DRC and adjoining countries, and must be performed in good faith. If,  after this inquiry, the issuer has a reason to believe that its conflict  minerals may have originated in the DRC and adjoining countries, the  issuer proceeds to exercising due diligence. Industry associations such  as the EICC and GeSI have created templates for companies to use  when contacting suppliers to inquire about the types and origins of conflict  minerals in a given product. For example, companies required to report  under the rule could submit the inquiries to their first-tier suppliers. Those  suppliers could either provide the reporting company with sufficient  information or initiate the inquiry process up the supply chain, such as by  distributing the inquiries to suppliers at the next tier\u2014tier 2 suppliers. The  tier 2 suppliers could inquire up the supply chain to additional suppliers,  until the inquiries arrive at the smelter. Smelters then could provide the  suppliers with information about the origin of the conflict minerals. Figure  5 illustrates the flow of information up the supply chain.", "As discussed earlier, smelters have various means to preclude untraced  minerals from entering their supply, such as participation in the iTSCi  initiative and the Conflict Free Smelters Program. According to smelting  industry representatives, these initiatives and certifications have reduced  the burden of responding to the multiple amounts of inquiries many  smelters have already received from suppliers.", "Officials from consulting firms and industry associations that we spoke  with told us that many companies that will respond under the rule have  started contacting their first-tier suppliers and providing them with country  of origin inquiries. According to these officials, several of these  companies that have submitted inquiries to their suppliers have  experienced challenges, which include identifying suppliers beyond the  first-tier suppliers, because for original equipment manufacturers,  suppliers beyond the first tier are less visible. As discussed earlier,  original equipment manufacturers purchase component parts primarily  from their first-tier suppliers and do not have direct commercial  relationships with suppliers in higher tiers of the supply chain. According  to industry representatives and agency officials, these challenges may  impact how companies file under the rule. For example, as previously  discussed, the SEC rule allows companies to disclose their products as  \u201cDRC conflict undeterminable.\u201d This provision allows companies to state  that the source of the conflict minerals in their products, and the likelihood  that the conflict minerals benefited or financed armed groups from the  DRC and adjoining countries, could not be determined after having  conducted due diligence to obtain that information from their suppliers.  For the reporting period beginning January 1, 2013, companies may use  this provision for 4 years for smaller reporting companies or 2 years for all  other reporting companies. Although the number of companies required  to report under the rule that may utilize the \u201cDRC conflict undeterminable\u201d  provision is unknown, SEC officials and representatives of industry  associations and consulting firms anticipate that many companies  required to report under the rule will utilize the provision based on the  results of their due diligence efforts.", "Representatives from industry and consulting firms that we interviewed  stated that the purchasing power of issuing companies under the rule  may influence their suppliers to provide information on the source of any  conflict minerals in their products when requested. According to an  industry representative, since companies that report to SEC under the  rule tend to be large, mature corporations with great purchasing power in  their respective industries, it would be difficult for suppliers to ignore their  request for information on the origin of conflict minerals in products the  suppliers provide to them. For example, jewelry industry representatives  told us that they have advised their members, which are primarily small,  independent jewelry companies not required to report to SEC under the  rule, to respond to any requests from customers seeking information on  the origin of conflict minerals in products they supply, because the risk of  not responding could result in a loss of business for those companies.", "Some information is publicly available about smelters and refiners, and  their involvement in the conflict minerals supply chain. According to SEC  officials, while smelters and refiners are not exempted from the SEC rule,  most of these suppliers will likely not be required to report to SEC under  the rule because of their filing status. Smelter and refiners are  considered the choke-point of the conflict minerals supply chain, as  previously discussed, and comprise a small portion of the overall number  of suppliers in the conflict minerals supply chain that may be impacted by  the SEC rule. While it is not possible to determine the universe of  suppliers that would not be required to report under the rule, smelters and  refiners are a more identifiable population for which there is some  aggregated information, such as the types of conflict minerals they use,   We found the following information on smelters and  and their location.refiners:", "Smelters and refiners constitute a small but important portion of  suppliers that likely will not file a conflict minerals report under the  SEC rule. Organizations have estimated the number of smelters and  refiners around the world to be nearly 500; however, the actual  number of smelters and refiners of conflict minerals is unknown. We  aggregated publicly available information on smelters and refiners  from lists compiled by the EICC and GeSI, the OECD, and the London  Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which provided information on  278 smelters and refiners. As we have previously discussed, roughly  278,000 suppliers could be affected by the rule, based on the  estimate provided to SEC. Of the 278 smelters of tin, tantalum,  tungsten, and refiners of gold that we were able to identify, the  majority (271) of these companies would likely not be required to  report under the rule.", "Over half of the smelters and refiners of the conflict minerals we  identified were located in three countries. Of the 278 smelters and  refiners of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold that we were able to  identify, more than half (156) were located in three countries: China  (82), Japan (39), and Indonesia (35). According to industry  representatives, participation in due diligence efforts of smelters and  refiners from these countries, particularly China and Indonesia, is  critical in assisting companies with fulfilling the reporting requirements  of the SEC rule. Several organizations, including an NGO, and  representatives from government and industry, are conducting  outreach to smelters to provide information on the SEC rule in an  effort to increase participation from smelters and refiners from these  countries. For more information on the location of smelters and  refiners we identified in our analysis, see figure 6.", "Many smelters and refiners of conflict minerals in our analysis  processed tin. Of the 278 smelters and refiners in our analysis, we  were able to identify 113 that processed tin, followed by gold (78),  tungsten (54), and tantalum (33). Furthermore, over half (64 of 113) of  the tin smelters in our analysis were located in China (30) or  Indonesia (34). In addition, over 67 percent of global production  comes from mines in China and Indonesia, according to U.S.  Geological Survey data. Tin and its derivatives have wide applications  and are used in manufacturing a variety of products, including tin  soldering for joining pipes, coatings for steel containers, and a wide  range of tin chemical applications, according to the U.S. Geological  Survey. According to industry and consulting firm representatives,  around 12 to 15 smelters process nearly 80 percent of the world\u2019s tin.", "Most smelters and refiners in our analysis did not have a conflict  minerals policy publicly available. Of the 278 smelters and refiners we  were able to identify, 63 had a conflict minerals policy publicly  available on their website. Of the 63 smelters with a conflict minerals  policy publicly available, 26 smelters had successfully completed a  Conflict Free Smelter Program audit and were designated as \u201cconflict- free\u201d by the EICC and GeSI, while several had reportedly followed  some sort of due diligence, such as the OECD Due Diligence  Guidance or the LMBA Responsible Gold Guidance. Other smelters  in our analysis had posted policies on their website stating that the  company only sources conflict minerals outside of the conflict areas of  the DRC and adjoining countries. We were unable to identify a  website for 86 of the 278 smelters in our analysis, and 129 of the 278  smelters had no conflict minerals policy publicly available on their  website.", "Some information is publicly available on companies that use conflict  minerals but are not required to report under the rule, as in the case of  many smelters and refiners we were able to identify.

For example, several of these companies provide  information publicly about their continued participation in initiatives that  source conflict minerals from the DRC, and have agreed to purchase  conflict minerals, such as tin and tantalum, from closely monitored  sources through initiatives such as iTSCi and the Solutions for Hope, as   However, according to agency and international  previously mentioned. organization officials, in some instances buyers from small firms, mainly  from East Asia, are on the ground in the DRC and adjoining countries,  and continue to purchase untraced minerals as well as minerals that have  been smuggled out of the DRC into adjoining countries.
