Under the largest program funded under the act, the Department of Education awards grants to state education agencies (SEA) mainly for further distribution to local education agencies (LEA). In school year 1995-96, $350 million of the $466 million appropriated for expenditure under the act was awarded to SEAs.

The act and its legislative history also indicate the importance of acknowledging local differences in defining measurable goals and objectives\u2014differences reflecting local needs\u2014and ways progress toward them will be assessed and reported. Under the act, SEAs and LEAs are accountable for progress toward the goals and objectives they set as well as for the federal dollars they spend. Increased accountability was a key issue raised in congressional deliberations about the act: critics of programs operated under the previous law claimed that some of the activities were inappropriate and would not contribute to accomplishing the goal of reducing student drug use.", "To address these concerns, you asked us to review the following: (1) accountability measures the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires at the federal, state, and local levels; (2) activities Education uses for overseeing state and local programs; (3) how SEAs ensure local programs\u2019 compliance with the act; and (4) how Safe and Drug-Free Schools funding is specifically used at the state and local levels. To determine required accountability measures, we reviewed the act and its legislative history. To assess Education\u2019s oversight measures, we reviewed documents at Department headquarters and followed up on allegations of impropriety in three states (Michigan, Virginia, and West Virginia), reviewing documentation and interviewing state and local officials involved in the alleged impropriety and its investigation and resolution (see app. I).

For example, the act authorizes federal aid for a wide range of activities within a broadly defined functional area; recipients have substantial discretion to identify problems, design programs, and allocate resources; federally imposed requirements are limited to those necessary to ensure that national goals are being accomplished; and federal aid is distributed on the basis of a statutory formula.

Education\u2019s statement of core strategies for achieving this objective make it clear that Safe and Drug- Free Schools will play a major role. In addition, the program is specifically cited in one of the six performance indicators that Education has chosen for assessing accomplishment of this objective. These indicators are to slow recently increasing rates of alcohol and drug use among school-aged achieve continuous decreases in criminal and violent incidents in schools by students between now and 2002; realize continuous improvement in the percentage of students reporting negative attitudes toward drug and alcohol use between now and 2002; improve prevention programs by having the majority of LEAs participating in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program use prevention programs based on Education\u2019s principles of effectiveness by 1999; ensure, by 1999, that all states collect data statewide on alcohol and drug use among students and violence in schools; and increase significantly by 2000 the number of teachers who are appropriately trained to address discipline problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal Laws and Regulations Also Set Accountability Requirements for Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program", "paragraphs": ["The Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, like other Education programs, is subject to other federal laws and generally applicable regulations in the use of its funds and program operations.

In particular, the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act authorizes states to submit a single application for several federal education programs rather than separate program-specific applications.

The Safe and Drug-Free Schools program is one of several substance abuse- and violence- prevention programs funded by the federal government. For example, in fiscal year 1995, 70 federal programs were authorized to provide either substance abuse-prevention or violence-prevention services or both to the youth they serve. Thirty-four of these programs could provide both types of prevention services. Education, which administers the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, along with the Departments of Health and Human Services and Justice, administered most of these programs, 48 in all, but the rest of the programs were disbursed among 10 other federal agencies or entities. For these 70 programs, the fiscal year 1995 appropriations for services to youth totaled at least $2.4 billion.", "Multiple programs dispersed among several agencies creates the potential for inefficient services and ineffective use of funds. Although we have not fully examined these multiple programs, the implications of having multiple, unintegrated substance abuse- and violence-prevention programs might be like those for employment training programs\u2014an area we have examined. In fiscal year 1995, we identified 163 federal employment training programs located in 15 departments and agencies. We recently concluded that consolidating these programs could probably reduce the cost of providing job training services because of the efficiencies achieved by eliminating duplicative administrative activities.

In particular, questions have been raised about the extent to which these funds can be used to support programs, such as comprehensive health education programs, of which drug prevention is just one part; the types of activities sponsored by schools, such as alcohol-free dances; and expenditures for materials, such as pencils and tee-shirts imprinted with drug- and violence-prevention messages (see app. I for the results of our examination of some allegations)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Act Requires Federal, State, and Local Actions to Ensure Accountability", "paragraphs": ["The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act establishes accountability mechanisms at the federal, state, and local levels.

We also chose the West Virginia program because it had been audited by the Inspector General (IG) of the Department of Education and was the subject of other Department of Education reviews, providing us with much information that could be reviewed in a relatively short time. Second, in reviewing the legislative history, we found that a floor debate in the House had mentioned a number of other allegations. One, the alleged misuse of funds in Virginia for training retreats held in a resort location in Maryland, had been the subject of investigations, giving us ample data to review. Therefore, we chose Virginia for a site visit. Finally, the use of Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act program funds in Michigan for a comprehensive health program had already prompted a large state-level investigation. We chose Michigan for a site visit because of the importance of this investigation.", "To determine what oversight was required and assess accountability activities at the state and local level, we surveyed the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico about their activities, receiving information from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.", "Although we did not verify the data the states supplied us, we did review supporting documentation they provided and used our site visits to Michigan, Virginia, and West Virginia to collect examples of how the law was being implemented and to observe accountability practices at the state and local level.
