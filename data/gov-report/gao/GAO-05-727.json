Generally airports and local transit agencies are heavily involved, especially if these projects are part of a local transit system. The federal government has not established specific goals or funding programs to develop intermodal capabilities at airports. However, it provides funding for projects fitting the criteria of other programs. The private sector may undertake a variety of roles. Most major U.S. airports have direct connections to local transit systems rather than to nationwide rail or bus systems. For example, 64 out of 72 airports have connections to local bus systems, and 27 airports have connections to local rail systems. At the same time, only 19 airports have connections to nationwide rail or bus systems. A number of airports have plans to enhance their connections to local rail and bus systems. U.S. and European transportation officials and experts cited the benefits for intermodal capabilities at airports to include increased transportation options, reduced road congestion, and reduced short-haul flights. The costs of intermodal projects using rail are typically significant. Barriers cited include the difficulty of securing needed funding, disincentives for airport support such as potential reductions in airport parking revenue, geographical and physical land constraints, limitations of the existing nationwide rail network, and inconveniences in comparison to using cars that limit consumer demand. Two differing strategies developed from our prior work would help public decision makers improve intermodal capabilities at airports. The first strategy would increase flexibility within current federal transportation programs to encourage a more systemwide approach to transportation planning and development. The second strategy would involve a fundamental shift in federal transportation policy's focus on local decision making by increasing the role of the federal government in order to develop more integrated air and rail networks and would be closer to the strategy followed in Europe. While the first strategy would most likely lead to a continued focus on the development of intermodal connections to local transit systems, the second strategy could develop more integrated air and rail networks, either nationwide or along particularly congested corridors. The second strategy would be costly, and high benefits, which would be difficult to achieve, would be needed to justify this investment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With the number of airplane passengers using U.S. airports expected to  grow from over 688 million in 2004 to almost 1 billion by the year 2015,  ground access to U.S. airports has become an important factor in the  development of our nation\u2019s transportation networks. Since most travelers  use cars, whether privately owned or taxis, to get to the airport, local cities  and communities will face increased congestion on their airport access  roads and highways. Moreover, increases in passenger air travel and the  difficulty of building new airport capacity will place greater strains on our  nation\u2019s airport runway and air space capacity. Increased road congestion  and the strain on airport capacity can both have a number of negative  economic and social effects, including wasting travelers\u2019 time and money,  degrading air quality, slowing commerce, and increasing energy  consumption. These effects are especially problematic in areas and  transportation corridors that are already heavily congested.", "While the U.S. passenger transportation system consists of a number of  different transportation modes, including mass transit, roads, aviation,  waterways, and railroads, U.S. transportation policy has generally  addressed the negative economic and social effects of congestion from the  standpoint of individual transportation modes and local government  involvement. Compared to the United States, European transportation  policy has increasingly focused on intermodal transportation\u2014that is, a  system that connects the separate transportation modes and allows a  passenger to complete a journey using more than one mode. This focus has  included improving the connections between airports and other  transportation modes\u2014particularly rail\u2014as a possible means to address  congestion and other issues without sacrificing economic growth. The  European experience in this area might provide important lessons for the  United States.", "To determine how the mobility of the American public might be improved  through enhanced rail, transit, and bus connections to airports and at what  costs, this report addresses the following questions: (1) What roles do  federal, state, and local governments and the private sector play in  developing intermodal capabilities at U.S. airports? (2) To what extent have  intermodal services and facilities been developed at selected U.S. airports?   (3) What benefits, costs, and barriers exist for developing additional  intermodal capabilities at U.S. airports? and (4) What transportation  strategies, including lessons learned from the European experience, may  help public decisionmakers improve intermodal capabilities at U.S.  airports?", "Throughout this report, we defined intermodal transportation as direct  connections for passengers traveling between airports and local public  transit systems and nationwide rail and bus systems. Because the ease of  transfer between modes is critical to how likely passengers are to use a bus  or rail system, we considered a direct connection to consist of a transfer  point (such as a bus stop or rail station) that is accessible from airport  terminals either by walking, an automated people mover, or direct shuttle.   To address the four questions, we obtained and analyzed information from  a variety of sources. We surveyed all large and medium and selected small  hub U.S. airports to obtain information on the extent intermodal services  and facilities have been developed. These 72 airports accounted for  approximately 90 percent of the enplanements for calendar year 2003.  We  conducted semi-structured interviews with key government transportation  officials, airport officials, and private sector transportation representatives  to obtain information for case studies of 16 U.S. airports located in the Los  Angeles and San Francisco areas and San Jose, California; Miami, Florida;  Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; the New York City  area; Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; the Washington, D.C., area;  and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We also met with officials from the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA),  Amtrak, the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Office of  Intermodalism, transportation experts, and industry associations. We  interviewed officials from the European Union, France, Germany,  Switzerland, and the Netherlands to obtain descriptive information on their  airport-rail connections. In addition, we obtained and analyzed information  from our past reports, as well as documents from DOT, the European  Union, and research organizations. We conducted our work from July 2004  through July 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Intermodal transportation refers to a system that  connects the separate transportation modes and allows a passenger to  complete a journey using more than one mode. An efficient intermodal  capability provides a passenger with convenient, seamless transfer  between modes; the ability to connect to an extended transportation  network; and high frequency of service among the different modes. As  shown in figure 1, an intermodal connection at an airport might involve a  passenger arriving at the airport by private shuttle service, flying to another  airport, and then transferring to local transit rail service to reach a final  destination. Opportunities also exist for using intermodal service to access  nationwide transportation systems, such as Amtrak.", "While intermodal refers to the use of any two modes of transportation and  therefore a trip that involves taking a private car or shuttle to the airport  followed by air travel could be considered intermodal, for the purposes of  this report, we are focusing on direct connections between airports and  public bus and rail systems. Because the ease of transfer between modes is  critical to how likely passengers are to use a bus or rail system, we  considered a direct connection to consist of a transfer point (such as a bus  stop or rail station) that is accessible from airport terminals either by  walking, an automated people mover, or direct shuttle.", "Historically, federal transportation policy has focused almost exclusively  on individual modes rather than intermodal connections. Federal  transportation funding programs are overseen by different agencies within  DOT\u2014FAA oversees aviation, FTA transit, Federal Railroad Administration  railways, and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) highways\u2014and no  specific federal funding programs have been established that target  intermodal projects for passengers at U.S. airports. In the United States, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA)  established an overall approach for surface transportation planning and  decision making that gave local and state governments greater control over  transportation decisions in their own regions than was done in the past.  The act also viewed different transportation modes as part of a larger  transportation network, but maintained separate funding for the individual  modes. ISTEA established specific planning guidelines for metropolitan  areas to prioritize the highway and transit needs of the entire region with  the goal of promoting an integrated transportation system. The  Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), enacted in 1998,  retained the basic policy and programs established by ISTEA and provided  state and local governments the flexibility to use highway funds to support  transit investments. DOT\u2019s Office of Intermodalism was established under  ISTEA; however, this office deals mainly with intermodal freight issues and  airports have had very limited involvement in that discussion.", "Federal policy for aviation is established through other legislation. The  planning and funding of U.S. airports is addressed under Vision 100- Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. This act authorizes funds for  airport development and capital improvements, and while it does  encourage the development of intermodal connections between airports  and other local surface transportation systems, the primary focus of  funding is on runway and terminal infrastructure. The planning for these  projects is usually undertaken by airports, with no federal requirements for  local and state surface transportation agency involvement as required by  ISTEA and TEA-21. The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 created Amtrak  to provide nationwide passenger rail service, and the federal government  has provided funding for both capital and operating expenditures to  Amtrak. Amtrak operates a 22,000 mile passenger rail system, primarily  over tracks owned by freight railroads. As of January 2002, there were 10  federally designated high-speed rail corridors nationwide. These  designated corridors are eligible for federal funds to upgrade rail  infrastructure to support high-speed rail service, although most upgrades  have not been completed and the amount of high-speed rail service in the  United States remains limited. The corridors are dispersed throughout the  country and include service between some of the largest U.S. cities. For  example, the Northeast Corridor provides service between Washington,  D.C., New York, and Boston, and the Pacific Northwest Corridor provides  service between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, Canada.", "In comparison to U.S. transportation policy, European Union policy and  some European governments have focused on developing high-speed train  service between major European cities as an alternative to air and car  travel. This effort has also included developing intermodal ground  connections between passenger high-speed rail systems and airports, an  example of which is shown in figure 2.", "Since 1992, the European Union has periodically published a common  transportation policy in response to increased ground and air congestion  that has resulted from the unequal growth of road and air traffic compared  with rail and maritime traffic. This growth in air traffic and the capacity  constraints at most key European airports have caused the European  Union to examine the potential of intermodal transportation. A key  component of the European Union's intermodality policy is improving the  connections between air and rail, thereby transforming competition  between those modes into complementary service using high-speed train  connections at European airports. While the European Union has  developed a common transportation policy and provides limited funding  for transportation networks that can connect to airports, the actual  implementation and development of transportation infrastructure remains  the responsibility of individual member nations. For example, a priority  European Union project is the construction of a high-speed rail network  across Europe that will connect key airports, such as Brussels, Frankfurt,  Cologne/Bonn, Paris Charles de Gaulle, and Amsterdam Schiphol. Although  this project crosses a number of member states and is one of the European  Union\u2019s priority projects, individual member states are responsible for  funding the majority of the infrastructure and overseeing the construction  of sections within their borders. For example, Belgium is responsible for  providing the infrastructure from Brussels to the borders of France,  Germany, and the Netherlands. In addition, in 2003, the European Union  established the Rail Air Intermodality Facilitation Forum with the objective  of developing recommendations to encourage the integration of rail and air  service regarding operations, ticket sales, and legal issues.

While the roles of any one stakeholder  can vary, the development of most projects involves similar steps (see table  1), and one or more of these state and local transportation agencies will  take the lead in moving a project through these steps.", "During our research at 16 airports, we found three common themes  regarding the roles of various stakeholders, although the extent of different  stakeholders' involvement varied among projects. First, almost all airports  are heavily involved with the development of intermodal capabilities on  airport property. This is especially true if the project involves construction  of a major intermodal facility such as an automated people mover  connecting the airport terminals to a transit station. For example, the Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey was the lead agency in planning,  building, and operating the Air Train system at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy  International Airport. The Air Train system is an automated people mover  that links the airport\u2019s terminals to two transit rail stations, thereby  providing passengers a connection from the airport to local transit systems  (see fig. 3).", "The second theme we found is that local transit agencies are heavily  involved in intermodal connections that are part of a new or existing transit  system. Depending on the specific transit system, the involvement of the  transit agency could include providing local bus service or shuttle service  to the airport or could include building and operating a new heavy or light  rail line to the local airport. For instance, Portland, Oregon\u2019s local transit  agency, Tri-Met, was a major stakeholder in the development of the  Metropolitan Area Express light rail line extension to the Portland  International Airport. Tri-Met provided about $46 million towards the  development of the extension, managed the project during construction,  took ownership of most of the extension, and operates the service to the  airport.", "Finally, we found that other local and state transportation agencies, such as  state departments of transportations or local metropolitan planning  organizations, can be involved in these projects, including in certain cases  taking the lead in planning and obtaining funding. For example, the  Wisconsin Department of Transportation served as the lead agency in  planning an Amtrak station at the General Mitchell International Airport in  Milwaukee. Fairfax County, Virginia, secured funding to cover part of the  cost of a section of a planned local rail line extension to Dulles airport by  approving a tax on commercial and industrial properties that was  voluntarily proposed by a group of landowners. In some cases, these state  or local agencies may take the lead because they have the best access to  federal funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Government\u2019s Role Is Primarily One of Funding and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has not established specific goals or funding  programs to develop intermodal capabilities at airports. Its role, therefore,  is primarily one of funding and oversight of projects through separate  transportation programs within DOT agencies. Although there is no federal  funding program specifically for intermodal projects, many intermodal  projects at airports fit the funding criteria for one or more federal programs  focused on surface transportation or aviation. State and local  transportation agencies and airports may receive funding from one or  several of these federal programs to develop their intermodal capabilities.  (See table 2.) Appendix III provides additional information on the financing  of intermodal projects at airports.", "To carry out its oversight responsibility, the federal government ensures  that the design and construction of intermodal facilities complies with  federal laws and regulations, including environmental, safety, security, and  mobility requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. For  example, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires, among  other things, that the project sponsor prepare an environmental impact  statement for projects that receive federal funds. This environmental  impact statement must consider alternatives and mitigation measures that  would lessen the project's impacts. For intermodal projects,  FAA, FTA, or  FHWA will typically act as the lead agency, depending on how the project is  funded\u2014ensuring that environmental documents are properly prepared  and that all environmental concerns are adequately addressed before  granting approval for the project\u2019s construction. FTA also established a  requirement that projects receiving funding through the New Starts  program conduct post implementation evaluations, which are subsequently  provided to FTA. In addition, FAA ensures that intermodal projects meet  airport safety requirements, and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  Transportation Security Administration establishes security requirements  that may affect the use of intermodal facilities at airports.", "Finally, the federal governmen\u2019s role in developing intermodal capabilities  at airports includes increasing awareness of intermodalism at airports  through workshops and funding research. For example, conferences for  FAA regional offices have included topics such as the eligibility of ground  access projects at airports for federal funding programs. In addition, FTA  has provided funding to the Transit Cooperative Research Program to  conduct two studies on improving public transportation access to large  airports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Sector\u2019s Role Includes Funding or Assisting in Developing Intermodal Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["The private sector\u2019s role in developing intermodal projects at airports may  include funding through lease revenues; contracting to design, build, or  operate intermodal capabilities; and participating in the transportation  decision-making process through public participation. For example, a  private developer will fund through lease revenues about 18 percent of the  cost to develop the Metropolitan Area Express light rail extension at the  Portland, Oregon, airport. In another example, in 2001, the Florida  Department of Transportation awarded contracts to private companies for  the design and construction of the rental car facility\u2014one component of  Miami airport\u2019s planned intermodal bus and rail facility. With respect to  contracting arrangements with the private sector, Miami airport is also  requesting proposals to design, build, operate, and maintain an automated  people mover from the airport terminal to the planned intermodal facility.", "Airlines, in particular, can play an important role in the development of  intermodal projects at airports. Use and lease agreements between airlines  and airports are a major revenue source for most large airports, and  because of this financial arrangement, airlines may have influence in or  participate in airport decisionmaking. The ability of airlines to participate  in decisionmaking depends on the specific airport and the structure of the  lease agreement.

However, according to airport officials we interviewed, the  level of bus service provided varies. For example, Seattle-Tacoma  International Airport has five public bus routes that serve the airport from  the surrounding communities, while General Mitchell International Airport  in Milwaukee has only one route that serves the airport. The Boston Logan  Express bus service offers nonstop airport connections to and from  Boston\u2019s General Edward Lawrence Logan Airport and four locations,  serving over 100 communities.", "The level of convenience and access to bus service also varies, as shown in  table 3. Airports with direct connections to local bus systems either had  connections to buses at the airport terminal(s) or at an intermodal facility  or transit center. For example, Denver airport reported that it would be  convenient for an average adult with luggage to walk to the local bus stop,  which is located at the airport terminal, while passengers at Los Angeles  International Airport can take a shuttle to the airport transit center to  access buses. However, transportation experts and some airport officials  we interviewed stated that ridership on public buses is generally very low  for airline passengers but somewhat higher for airport employees. One  reason for this situation is the lack of accommodations for luggage on most  public buses.", "Twenty-seven airports reported having a direct connection to a local rail  system, such as light rail, commuter rail, or subway, as shown in figure 5.  These airports reported several options for passengers to access the rail  system.

Our prior  research has shown that transit investments can provide direct benefits to  travelers by improving travel times for existing transit users, improving  travel times for automobiles and trucks on alternative roadways, lowering  the use of automobiles and the associated environmental costs by  attracting riders out of their vehicles, and providing a back-up or future  option for nonusers of transit. In some cases, these alternative  transportation options may also provide a benefit of reduced travel times  and costs in comparison to traveling in a private vehicle (including shuttle  or taxi) on congested highways. Potential savings for passengers could  include the cost of gas, taxi service, or parking. Several local transportation  officials told us that the benefits of intermodal capabilities are maximized  when the supporting transit system is reliable and is part of a larger transit  network. For example, officials from the Port Authority of New York and  New Jersey said that the automated people mover that connects a terminal  at Newark airport to a new Amtrak and transit rail station was developed to  provide access to many destinations in the New York City area and beyond.  In fact, Amtrak officials stated that a large number of Amtrak passengers  using the Newark airport station are coming from Philadelphia and  Washington, D.C.", "Airport officials stated that another benefit of airport intermodal  capabilities is the potential to reduce congestion on nearby highways,  airport access roads, and the terminal curbside. Transportation and airport  officials stated that a byproduct of reduced road congestion is a reduction  of vehicle emissions and improved air quality. For example, it was  estimated that the extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit to the San  Francisco airport would reduce road traffic around the airport by 4,530  daily vehicular trips, representing 6 percent of the daily vehicular trips to  the airport. While officials believe intermodal projects improve access to  airports and reduce vehicle emissions, they also stated that it is difficult to  determine how trip reductions affect overall congestion since congestion is  affected by many factors, such as land use, traffic patterns, and general  economic conditions, that are difficult to isolate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Intermodality May Allow for the More Efficient Use of Congested Air Space", "paragraphs": ["Transportation industry experts and European transportation officials we  interviewed stated that another potential benefit of intermodal capabilities  at airports is the more efficient use of air space and existing capacity at  congested airports through the replacement of short-haul flights with rail  service. The potential reduction of short-haul flights could allow airlines to  reallocate airport capacity to long-distance flights, which generally have  lower costs per mile. However, our prior work and transportation officials  we talked with indicate that for rail transport to capture the market share  necessary to affect air travel, the distance between potential nationwide  passenger rail destinations must be short enough or trains must travel at  high enough speeds to make rail travel times competitive with air travel  times. Transportation officials we talked with also stated that the  realization of these benefits depends on a reliable and extensive rail  network that would provide competitive service to air travel about travel  time, frequency of service, and passenger convenience. This situation has  occurred in several cases in Europe, where some national governments  have established policies to reduce the number of short-haul flights at their  major airports and have supported these policies by funding high-speed rail  infrastructure. For example, there has been a reduction of air service  between Paris, France and Brussels, Belgium\u2014a popular short distance  city pair for travelers\u2014due, in part, to the high-speed train service linking  Paris Charles de Gaulle airport and downtown Paris with Brussels (see fig.  8).

Users of the investment would receive private  benefits in the form of transportation services and would be expected to  pay some form of fee or user charge. How much users would be willing to  pay would depend on the value of the services that they would receive from  the intermodal facility, compared with the benefits from alternative modes  that they could also use for the same trip and the prices they would have to  pay for the alternatives. In locations where there is highway congestion, a  rail link to the airport might be valuable to many travelers because it could  offer a travel option that might reduce travel time or make the travel time  more reliable. Similarly, if airport parking is expensive, an intermodal link  might have considerable value to travelers.

The public benefits could include  reduced highway and air congestion, pollution, and energy dependence.  For example, if air passengers can access a nationwide rail network  directly at an airport, some passengers might travel to that airport from  other cities by train rather than on highways or short-haul flights, which  might reduce highway or airport and airway congestion. However, the  demand for such service is likely to be low except in a few highly congested  travel corridors where the distances are short enough to make rail travel  times competitive with air travel times. Morever, congestion-relief benefits  would only be realized at airports where either highways or airports are  already at or near capacity, because only at those airports would additional  users have a disproportionate, detrimental effect on the flow of automobile  or aircraft traffic. At airports that do not have substantial highway or  airport congestion, such benefits would not be realized.

Public benefits could also include \u201coption  value,\u201d the value that people place on having the option to use something  even though they are not currently using it. By providing an alternative that  would be available to travelers as an option if their circumstances change,  such as bad weather, investment in intermodal facilities creates value that  could also justify public subsidy. The greater the number of potential users,  and the greater the likelihood that travelers might switch to the new  facility, the greater the option value.", "The existence of public benefits, or externalities, is often cited as a  justification for public subsidies that would induce more people to use a  facility than if they had to pay the full cost. When the price can be reduced  to users due to subsidies, some additional travelers for whom the private  benefits would not be sufficient to justify paying an unsubsidized price  would also choose to use the facility. However, only where both the private  and the public benefits are large would the appropriate subsidy be  sufficient to cover the difference between what users would be willing to  pay and the substantial cost of the facility. Given the high investment costs,  these locations are likely to be limited to airports where there is substantial  ground and air congestion and to a few highly congested travel corridors  where the distances are short enough to make rail travel times competitive  with air travel times."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The limited nature of intermodal connections at major U.S. airports is most  likely the result of many factors. One underlying factor is a lack of demand.  Due to the inconvenience of transferring from airplane to train or bus,  potentially higher travel times, and out-of-pocket costs, many American  travelers in many parts of the country are likely to continue to prefer car  travel over transit to access the airport and short-haul flights over  connections to a nationwide rail system to complete an overall journey.  There is likely to be a greater demand for such connections in a few highly  traveled corridors where higher private benefits to individual travelers and  public benefits such as reduced congestion on roadways would be more  likely to result. Moreover, in the context of federal transportation policy\u2019s  emphasis on local decision making, local officials in communities with  strong local bus and rail transit systems have worked to connect airports to  these systems. A federal strategy of encouraging a more systematic  approach to transportation planning\u2014including alternative funding  mechanisms\u2014could encourage state and local governments to consider  the development of additional intermodal connections at airports in the  context of other transportation investment decisions. At the same time, it is  clear that more quantitative evaluations of the benefits of intermodal  capabilities at airports could help to better inform state and local as well as  federal decision makers as they attempt to determine which projects to  develop with limited resources. The before and after evaluation  requirement for projects that receive funding through the New Starts  program is a positive step in this direction and could potentially be more  widely applied."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided drafts of this report to DOT and Amtrak for their review and  comment.

(2) To what extent have intermodal  services and facilities been developed at selected U.S. airports?  (3) What  benefits, costs, and barriers exist for developing additional intermodal  capabilities at U.S. airports? (4) What transportation strategies, including  lessons learned from the European experience, may help public decision- makers improve intermodal capabilities at U.S. airports?", "To address these questions, we used a variety of methods and sources of  information. To determine the roles that federal, state, and local  governments and the private sector play in developing intermodal  capabilities at U.S. airports, we interviewed transportation officials from  the following Department of Transportation (DOT) offices: Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),  Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the Office of Intermodalism. We  also interviewed officials from the American Bus Association, Association  of American Railroads, Association of Metropolitan Planning  Organizations, Airports Council International-North American, American  Public Transportation Association, International Air Rail Organization,  Amtrak, American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Midwest Airlines, and  Northwest Airlines. In addition, we interviewed officials from state and  local transportation offices, metropolitan planning organizations, transit  authorities, and airport authorities representing selected airports, which  are identified later in this appendix.", "To determine the extent to which intermodal services and facilities have  been developed at major U.S. airports, we selected and administered a  Web-based survey to 72 airports from FAA\u2019s 2003 Air Carrier Activity  Information System database. These airports accounted for approximately  90 percent of the enplanements for calendar year 2003, and consist of all 33  large hub, all 35 medium hub, and the 4 small hub airports that are located in the same metropolitan area as a large or medium hub airport. Appendix  V provides the complete list of airports surveyed. We asked airport officials  about the local and nationwide bus and rail systems that are accessible to  their airports by regular, fixed-route shuttle service, an automated people  mover or walking. We also asked the airports if their capital improvement  plan included proposals to enhance the airport\u2019s connections to local and  nationwide transportation systems. Since responses to surveys are often  subject to nonsampling errors, we attempted to minimize these errors by  taking several precautions during the questionnaire design and pretested  the instrument with 8 medium and large hub airports. We made changes to  the content and format of the final questionnaire as a result of these  pretests. The questionnaire was administered on the Internet from  February 22 to March 31, 2005, with two intervening e-mail messages and  follow-up telephone contacts. We received responses from all 72 airports,  resulting in a 100 percent response rate. To ensure the accuracy of  information presented by the airport officials, we relied on Salk  International\u2019s Airport Transit Guide and follow-up questions at selected  airports. We are not reporting responses for two questions on the survey  because we determined that these responses were unreliable. During our  pretests of the survey questionnaire, some respondents gave incorrect  answers to questions about the existence of stations for either Amtrak or a  nationwide bus system within their metropolitan area (questions 5 and 13).  Based on follow-up questions, we discovered that some pretest  respondents were unaware of some stations located within their  metropolitan area, especially in instances where there was no direct access  between the airport and these stations. In addition, some respondents were  unaware of the exact boundaries of their metropolitan area. Despite these  difficulties, we elected to leave these questions in the survey because of  their role in screening respondents and setting the context for subsequent  questions. The nature of the errors were such that false negative responses  would be unlikely to lead to errors in subsequent questions. That is, it is  unlikely that an airport that actually had direct connections to a nationwide  bus or rail system would state that there was not a station for such a system  in their metropolitan area. We conclude that responses to the remaining  questions are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Appendix  IV provides the survey results.

At the  European locations we visited, airports, many of which are owned or  operated by private airport management companies, have taken the lead in  planning and funding major intermodal facilities on airport property. For  example, Fraport, a private company that manages Frankfurt\u2019s airport, and  Deutsche Bahn, the German rail company, invested over 300 million euros  in building a station for long-distance and high-speed trains at the Frankfurt  airport. Additionally, some European rail systems are also privately  operated. For example, both Germany and France have established private  companies to operate their nations\u2019 rail systems. However, the national  government still takes the lead in planning and funding the building of the  overall rail infrastructure, such as dedicated high-speed rail tracks. Once  this infrastructure is built, it is then turned over to these private companies  that operate and manage this infrastructure. At the Frankfurt airport,  Deutsche Bahn and Fraport funded the construction of the long-distance  train station, but all the track infrastructure was funded by the German  national government. We found that local governments also are involved in  providing intermodal transportation services to airports, with local  government-owned transit agencies providing either rail or local bus  service to the airport.

Generally, distances between many major  cities in the United States are greater than in Europe. These greater  distances can affect intermodal transportation because many experts  believe that for intercity rail to be competitive with air travel, the  distance between cities needs to be within 2-3 hours total travel time or  100-500 miles, depending on the speed of the train. One expert stated  that there are some areas in the United States\u2014California, the  Northeast, and the Great Lakes\u2014where it is possible that rail  transportation could provide competitive service within these areas.", "Lower vehicle use costs. In the United States, gasoline prices are  much lower than in Europe because of substantially lower taxes. In  addition, the rate of car ownership is generally higher.
