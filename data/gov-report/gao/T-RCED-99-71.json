However, NRC has not resolved the most basic of issues; that is, that some utilities do not have current and accurate design information for their nuclear power plants, which is needed for a risk-informed approach. Also, neither NRC nor the nuclear utility industry have standards or guidance that define the quality or adequacy of the risk assessments that utilities use to identify and measure the risks to public health and the environment. Furthermore, NRC has not determined if compliance with risk-informed regulations will be voluntary or mandatory for the nuclear utility industry. More fundamentally, NRC has not developed a comprehensive strategy that would move its regulation of the safety of nuclear power plants from its traditional approach to an approach that considers risk. In January 1999, NRC released for comment a proposed process to assess the overall safety of nuclear power plants. The process would establish generic and plant-specific safety thresholds and indicators to help NRC assess overall plant safety. NRC expects to phase in the new process over the next 2 years and evaluate it by June 2001, at which time NRC would propose any adjustments or modifications needed. In addition, NRC has been examining the changes needed to its enforcement program to make it consistent with, among other things, the proposed plant safety assessment process. For many years, the nuclear industry and public interest groups have criticized the enforcement program as subjective. In the spring of 1999, NRC staff expect to provide the Commission recommendations for revising the enforcement program. In January 1999, we identified major management challenges that limit NRC\u2019s effectiveness. The challenges include the lack of a definition of safety and lack of aggressiveness in requiring utilities to comply with safety regulations. NRC\u2019s revised plant safety assessment and enforcement initiatives may ultimately help the agency address these management challenges and carry out its safety mission more effectively and efficiently."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NRC is responsible for ensuring that the nation\u2019s 103 operating commercial nuclear power plants pose no undue risk to public health and safety. Now, however, the electric utility industry is faced with an unprecedented, overarching development: the economic restructuring of the nation\u2019s electric power system, from a regulated industry to one driven by competition. According to one study, as many as 26 of the nation\u2019s nuclear power plant sites are vulnerable to shutdown because production costs are higher than the projected market prices of electricity. As the electric utility industry is deregulated, operating and maintenance costs will affect the competitiveness of nuclear power plants. NRC acknowledges that competition will challenge it to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden while ensuring that safety margins are not compromised by utilities\u2019 cost-cutting measures.", "Since the early 1980s, NRC has been considering the role of risk in the regulatory process, and in August 1995, NRC issued a policy statement that advocated certain changes in the development and implementation of its regulations through an approach more focused on risk assessment. Under such an approach, NRC and the utilities would give more emphasis to those structures, systems, and components deemed more significant to safety. The following example illustrates the difference between NRC\u2019s existing and a risk-informed approach. One particular nuclear plant has about 635 valves and 33 pumps that the utility must operate, maintain, and periodically replace according to NRC\u2019s existing regulations. Under a risk-informed approach, the utility found that about 515 valves and 12 pumps presented a low safety risk. The utility identified 25 components that were a high risk but would have been treated the same as other components under the existing regulations. If the utility concentrated on the 120 valves, 21 pumps, and 25 components that have been identified as having a high safety risk, it could reduce its regulatory compliance burden and costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Has Not Resolved Many Issues Needed to Implement a Risk-Informed Regulatory Approach", "paragraphs": ["NRC staff estimate that it could take 4 to 8 years to implement a risk-informed regulatory approach and are working to resolve many issues to ensure that the new approach does not endanger public health and safety.

Yet, for more than 10 years, NRC has questioned whether utilities had accurate design information for their plants. Inspections of 26 plants that NRC completed early in fiscal year 1999 confirmed that for some plants (1) utilities had not maintained accurate design documentation, (2) NRC did not have assurance that safety systems would perform as intended at all times, and (3) NRC needed to clarify what constitutes design information subject to NRC\u2019s regulations. As of November 1998, NRC had taken escalated enforcement actions for violations found at five plants\u2014Three Mile Island, Perry, H.B. Robinson, Vermont Yankee, and D.C. Cook. NRC took these actions because it did not have assurance that the plants\u2019 safety systems would perform as intended. One utility, American Electric Power, shut down its D.C. Cook plant as a result of the inspection findings.", "NRC does not plan additional design team inspections because it concluded that the industry did not have serious safety problems. NRC\u2019s Chairman disagreed with this broad conclusion, noting that (1) the inspection results for the five plants indicate the importance of maintaining current and accurate design and facility configuration information, (2) the inspections did not apply to the industry as a whole but to only certain utilities and plants within the industry, and (3) other NRC inspections identified design problems at other such nuclear power plants as Crystal River 3, Millstone, Haddam Neck, and Maine Yankee. The Commissioners and staff agreed that NRC would oversee design information issues using such tools as safety system engineering inspections.", "The 26 inspections also identified a need for NRC to better define the elements of a plant\u2019s design that are subject to NRC\u2019s regulations. NRC staff acknowledge that the existing regulation is a very broad, general statement that has been interpreted differently among NRC staff and among utility and industry officials. According to NRC staff, it is very difficult to develop guidance describing what constitutes adequate design information. Therefore, NRC has agreed that the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) would provide explicit examples of what falls within design parameters. NEI plans to draft guidance that will include examples of design information and provide it to NRC in January 1999. Concurrently, NRC is developing regulatory guidance on design information. NRC staff expect to recommend to the Commission in February 1999 that it endorse either NRC\u2019s or NEI\u2019s guidance and seek approval to obtain public comments in March or April 1999.

As such, the report provides one of the foundations to support a risk-informed approach. Yet, NRC does not have confidence that utilities make the required updates, which results in poor documentation of the safety basis for the plants.", "NRC published guidance for the organization and contents of safety analysis reports in June 1966 and updated the guidance in December 1980. NRC acknowledges that the guidance is limited, resulting in poorly articulated staff comments on the quality of the safety analysis reports and a lack of understanding among utilities about the specific aspects of the safety analysis reports that should be updated. On June 30, 1998, NRC directed its staff to continue working with NEI to finalize the industry\u2019s guidelines on safety analysis report updates, which NRC could then endorse.

For more than 30 years, NRC\u2019s regulations have provided a set of criteria that utilities must use to determine whether they may change their facilities (as described in the final safety analysis report) or procedures or conduct tests and experiments without NRC\u2019s prior review and approval.", "However, in 1993, NRC became aware that Northeast Nuclear Energy Company had refueled Millstone Unit 1 in a manner contrary to that allowed in the updated final safety analysis and its operating license. This led NRC to question the regulatory framework that allows licensees to change their facilities without prior NRC approval. As a result, NRC staff initiated a review to identify the short- and long-term actions needed to improve the process. For example, in October 1998, NRC published a proposed regulation regarding plant changes in the Federal Register for comment; the comment period ended on December 21, 1998. NRC requested comments on criteria for identifying changes that require a license amendment and on a range of options, several of which would allow utilities to make changes without prior NRC approval despite a potential increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

Revising the regulations will be a formidable task because, according to NRC staff, inconsistencies exist among the regulations and because a risk-informed approach focuses on the potential risk of structures, systems, or components, regardless of whether they are located in the plant\u2019s primary (radiological) or secondary (electricity-producing) systems. With one exception, NRC has not attempted to extend its regulatory authority to the secondary systems.", "NRC staff and NEI officials agree that the first priority in revising the regulations will be to define their scope as well as the meaning of such concepts as \u201cimportant to safety\u201d and \u201crisk significant\u201d and integrating the traditional and risk-informed approaches into a cohesive regulatory context. In October 1998, NEI proposed a phased approach to revise the regulations. Under the proposal, by the end of 1999, NRC would define \u201cimportant to safety\u201d and \u201crisk significant.\u201d By the end of 2000, NRC would use the definitions in proposed rulemakings for such regulations as definition of design information and environmental qualification for electrical equipment. By the end of 2003, NEI proposes that NRC address other regulatory issues, such as the change process, the content of technical specifications, and license amendments. After 2003, NEI proposes that NRC would address other regulations on a case-by-case basis.", "NRC staff agreed that the agency must take a phased approach when revising its regulations. The Director, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, said that, if NRC attempted to revise all provisions of the regulations simultaneously, it is conceivable that the agency would accomplish very little. The Director said that NRC needs to address one issue at a time while concurrently working on longer-term actions. He cautioned, however, that once NRC starts, it should be committed to completing the process. At a January 1999 meeting, NRC\u2019s Chairman suggested a more aggressive approach that would entail risk informing all regulations across the board.

NRC staff are working with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers to develop such a standard.", "However, this issue is far from being resolved. The Society is developing the standard for risk assessments in two phases (internal events and emergency preparedness). NRC staff estimate that the agency would have a final standard on the first phase by June 2000 but could not estimate when the second phase would be complete. To ensure consistency with other initiatives, in December 1998, NRC staff requested the Commission\u2019s direction on the quality of risk assessments needed to implement a risk-informed approach.

In December 1998, NRC\u2019s staff provided its recommendations to the Commission. The staff recommended that implementation be voluntary, noting that it would be very difficult to show that requiring mandatory compliance will increase public health and safety and could create the impression that current plants are less safe. In its analysis, the staff did not provide the Commission with information on the number of plants that would be interested in such an approach. In January 1999, the Commissioners expressed concern about a voluntary approach, believing that it would create two classes of plants operating under two different sets of regulations.", "Utilities may be reluctant to shift to a risk-informed regulatory approach for various reasons. First, the number of years remaining on a plant\u2019s operating license is likely to influence the utility\u2019s views. NRC acknowledged that if a plant\u2019s license is due to expire in 10 years or less, then the utility may not have anything to gain by changing from the traditional approach. Second, the costs to comply may outweigh the benefits of doing so. Considering the investment that will be needed to develop risk-informed procedures and operations and identify safety-significant structures, systems, or components, utilities question whether a switch will be worth the reduction in regulatory burden and cost savings that may result. Third, design differences and age disparities among plants make it difficult for NRC and the industry to determine how, or to what extent, a standardized risk-informed approach can be implemented across the industry. Although utilities built one of two types of plants\u2014boiling water or pressurized water\u2014each has design and operational differences. Thus, each plant is unique, and a risk-informed approach would require plant-specific tailoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Has Not Developed a Strategic Plan to Implement a Risk-Informed Approach", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1980s, NRC has considered applying risk to the regulatory process.

However, NRC has not developed a strategic plan that includes objectives, time lines, and performance measures for such an approach.", "Rather, NRC has developed an implementation plan, in conjunction with its policy statement on considering risk, that is a catalog of about 150 separate tasks and milestones for their completion. It has also developed guidance for some activities, such as pilot projects in the four areas where the industry wanted to test the application of a risk-informed approach. In one case, NRC approved a pilot project for Houston Lighting and Power Company at its South Texas plant, and the utility found that it could not implement it because the pilot project would conflict with other NRC regulations.", "Given the complexity and interdependence of NRC\u2019s requirements, such as regulations, plant design, and safety documents and the results of ongoing activities, it is critical that NRC clearly articulate how the various initiatives will help achieve the goals set out in the 1995 policy statement. Although NRC\u2019s implementation plan sets out tasks and expected completion dates, it does not ensure that short-term efforts are building toward NRC\u2019s longer-term goals; does not link the various ongoing initiatives; does not help the agency determine appropriate staff levels, training, skills, and technology needed and the timing of those activities to implement a risk-informed approach; does not provide a link between the day-to-day activities of program managers and staff and the objectives set out in the policy statement; and does not address the manner in which it would establish baseline information about the plants to assess the safety impact of a risk-informed approach.", "In a December 1998 memorandum, NRC staff said that once the Commission provides direction on whether and how to risk-inform the regulations and guidance on the quality of risk assessments to support their decisions for specific regulations, they would develop a plan to implement the direction provided.

We also noted that this inconsistency has been attributed, in part, to the lack of specific criteria, the subjective nature of the process, and the confusion of some NRC managers about their role in the process. NRC acknowledged that it should do a better job of identifying plants deserving increased regulatory attention and said that it was developing a new process that would be predictable, nonredundant, efficient, and risk-informed.", "In January 1999, NRC proposed a new plant assessment process that includes seven \u201ccornerstones.\u201d For each cornerstone, NRC will identify the desired result, important attributes that contribute to achieving the desired result, areas to be measured, and the various ways that exist to measure the identified areas. Three issues cut across the seven cornerstones: human performance, safety conscious work environment, and problem identification and resolution. As proposed, NRC\u2019s plant assessment process would use performance indicators, inspection results, other such information as utility self-assessments, and clearly defined, objective decision thresholds. The process is anchored in a number of principles, including that: (1) a level of safety performance exists that could warrant decreased NRC oversight, (2) performance thresholds should be set high enough to permit NRC to arrest declining performance, (3) NRC must assess both performance indicators and inspection findings, and (4) NRC will establish a minimum level of inspections for all plants (regardless of performance). Although some performance indicators would be generic to the industry, others would be plant-specific based, in part, on the results that utilities derive from their risk assessments. However, the quality of risk assessments and number of staff devoted to maintain them vary considerably among utilities.", "NRC expects to use a phased approach to implement the revised plant assessment process. Beginning in June 1999, NRC expects to pilot test the use of risk-informed performance indicators at eight plants, by January 2000 to fully implement the process, and by June 2001 to complete an evaluation and propose any adjustments or modifications needed. Between January 1999 and January 2001, NRC expects to work with the industry and other stakeholders to develop a comprehensive set of performance indicators to more directly assess plant performance relative to the cornerstones. For those cornerstones or aspects of cornerstones where it is impractical or impossible to develop performance indicators, NRC would use its inspections and utilities\u2019 self assessments to reach a conclusion about plant performance. NRC\u2019s proposed process illustrates an effort by the current Chairman and other Commissioners to improve NRC\u2019s ability to help ensure safe operations of the nation\u2019s nuclear plants as well as address industry concerns regarding excessive regulation.

From an overall perspective, the Union concluded that NRC\u2019s actions are neither consistent nor repeatable and that the enforcement actions did not always reflect the severity of the offense.
