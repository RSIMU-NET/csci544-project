(See app. I for a listing of activities.) During fiscal year 1997, these activities generated sales of approximately $30 million, resulting in nearly $3.3 million in revenues for the Committee. The Committee uses its revenues to provide funding to six civilian MWR funds benefiting military and civilian employees working in the Pentagon and the Navy Annex after paying its operational costs. The MWR funds use the contributions from the Committee to pay administrative and operating expenses and to subsidize welfare and recreation activities, including discount tickets to sporting and cultural events and group events.", "The Director of Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense, is responsible for overseeing the Committee\u2019s operations.

The accounting firm recommended that, for internal control purposes, more than one person be involved in processing cash receipts from temporary concessionaires,the food service inventory process be moved closer to year end, and a new general ledger account be created to report bad debt expense.

The Committee Chairman told us the members\u2019 decisions were guided by the need to fund planned capital improvements and maintain stable MWR contributions during the Pentagon renovation. However, without proper long-term operating budgets, the extent to which such reserves are necessary is not clear. If the Committee\u2019s need for reserves are overstated, additional resources could be made available to MWR funds.", "Annually, the Committee decides how much of the year\u2019s net income will be distributed to MWR activities and how much will be reserved for future needs. According to the Committee Chairman, this decision is based on a number of factors, including known capital expenditure requirements and the needs of the MWR funds. Once the Committee decides on the division of its net income, it requests approval from the Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense. The approved MWR contribution is stated in the Committee\u2019s minutes, but there is no discussion supporting how the members arrived at this decision.", "As of September 30, 1997, the Committee had a total of $3.2 million in cash reserves\u2014$1.3 million that was not designated for a specific purpose but would be available for payments of future operating expenses and MWR contributions and $1.9 million for the repair, maintenance, and replacement of equipment. Although the Committee does not have a long-term operating budget for estimating its future operating cash reserve needs, it does have a capital expenditure program budget, which estimates it will need $3 million through fiscal year 2002 and another $1.6 million beyond that date to fund equipment and related expenditures.", "Despite the current balances in its reserves, the Committee is concerned about its ability to fund planned capital improvements and maintain stable MWR contributions during the planned 10-year renovation of the Pentagon. As a result, the Committee withheld and placed in reserve $50,000 of declared MWR contributions in both fiscal years 1997 and 1996. The Committee did this to enable it to have extra funds available to supplement MWR contributions in future years when reductions in income are anticipated. Specifically, the Committee anticipates income will decrease during the renovation of the Pentagon because 20 percent of the Pentagon staff will be temporarily relocated to office space outside of the building.", "Because of the uncertainties related to the renovation, the Committee Chairman has asked the business manager to reassess the capital expenditure program budget. At our suggestion, the business manager agreed to request its independent public accountant\u2019s assistance in preparing a 5-year operating budget that would identify the minimum level of cash reserves needed to cover normal operations.

Also, the absence of specified operating procedures, including guidance on the types of goods and services that can be offered, represents a weakness in management controls.
