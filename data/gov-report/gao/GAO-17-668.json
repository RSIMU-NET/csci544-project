A 2016 DOD Chief Information Officer policy paper on the IoT  cited a definition from a non-DOD organization. According to this  definition, the IoT consists of two foundational things: 1) the Internet itself,  and 2) semi-autonomous devices (the \u201cthings\u201d) that leverage inexpensive  computing, networking, sensing, and actuating capabilities in uniquely  identified implementations to sense the physical world and act on it. Such  devices have the capability to connect to the Internet, being Internet  Protocol-based, but may also be deployed in stand-alone Internet  Protocol networks.

The primer  cites reports of wireless medical devices being taken over and controlled;  of a widespread wireless standard for IoT devices used in smart energy  being compromised; and of gas stations\u2019 tank-monitoring systems having  no passwords, thereby potentially exposing the pumps to a risk of being  shut down. These security challenges could potentially impact DOD  hospitals and facility energy and fuel systems where managers may  consider using or deploying IoT devices.", "In May 2017, we issued a technology assessment on the IoT that defined  the concept of the IoT, described its uses, highlighted its benefits, and  discussed its potential implications, including security challenges. We  reported that adoption of the IoT across the different sectors has  amplified the challenge of designing and implementing effective security  controls by bringing the potential effects of poor security into homes,  factories, and communities. In addition, the technology assessment noted  a security risk whereby unauthorized individuals or organizations might  gain access to these devices and use them for potentially malicious  purposes, including fraud or sabotage. The lack of attention to security in  designing IoT devices and the predominant use of cloud computing to  provide connectivity with these devices pose unique security challenges.  These challenges have direct implications for DOD as the department  considers how to develop and deploy these devices. As cyber threats  grow increasingly sophisticated, the need to manage and bolster the  cybersecurity of IoT products and services is increasingly critical,  according to our technology assessment. According to the assessment,  while many industry-specific standards and best practices address  information security, standards and best practices that are specific to IoT  technologies are either still in development or not widely adopted.

With respect to IoT configuration, a DOD report in 2016  notes that IoT devices are often sold with old and unpatched software that  can lead to the device being exploited as soon as it is taken out of the  box. Poor password management is another cybersecurity risk.  According to the DOD report, a majority of IoT cloud services allow the  user to choose weak passwords\u2014such as \u201c1234\u201d\u2014and, in some cases,  prevent the user from using strong passwords.", "Given their functionality and capabilities, IoT devices also pose security  risks with their operational implications.

For example, an adversary could gather information related  to which people were present or which organizations were working  overtime.", "The department has also identified notional threat scenarios that  exemplify how these security risks could adversely impact DOD  operations, equipment, or personnel. DOD documents and officials from a  number of organizations\u2014including the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, Joint Force Headquarters-DOD Information Networks, and the  Navy\u2014discussed with us a number of notional threat scenarios. Figure 2  highlights a few examples of these scenarios.", "The first notional IoT scenario, the \u201csabotage of mission,\u201d illustrates a few  security risks that could adversely impact DOD operations. The increase  of IoT devices used to monitor and control DOD infrastructure could  increase the number of attack points through which a network or system  could be attacked. Many of these devices are insecure because of a  limited ability to patch and upgrade devices, or due to poor security  design. As a result, the successful penetration of a smart electrical meter  could lead to cascading effects that negatively impact an industrial control  system and degrade an ongoing mission.

The third notional IoT  scenario, \u201coperations security and intelligence collection,\u201d illustrates the  adverse impacts on operations security that can emerge from smart  televisions. The scenario involves a television with limited cybersecurity  controls being targeted by commercial providers or adversaries to collect  information for malicious purposes. The fourth notional IoT scenario, the  \u201cendangerment of leadership,\u201d depicts how an adversary could exploit a  car equipped with IoT capabilities.

Similarly, DOD Chief Information Officer\u2019s DOD Policy  Recommendations for the Internet of Things (IoT) also recommends a  number of policy tenets to inform changes to DOD\u2019s cybersecurity  policies, including encryption of IoT data, monitoring of IoT networks for  anomalous traffic, and active management of supply chains for IoT  devices.", "Second, core DOD policies and guidance on operations security do not  address IoT devices. As noted earlier, adverse impacts on operations  security is a key security risk that DOD identified with IoT devices.  Although these core operations security policy documents refer to  Internet-based capabilities and the data collection capabilities of potential  adversaries, they do not offer guidance to mitigate the risks to operations  security associated with these devices. Additionally, a key DOD official  with department-wide oversight over operations security agreed that DOD  policy on operations security could be enhanced by providing guidance  and focusing on IoT devices, including a taxonomy for such devices.", "Third, core DOD policies and guidance we reviewed on information  security relating to unclassified DOD information do not address IoT  devices. In a 2017 report, we noted that the rapid adoption of IoT  devices, the lack of attention to security in the design phase, and the  predominant use of cloud computing to provide connectivity with these  devices pose unique information security challenges\u2014challenges that  could be mitigated in part with DOD guidance on information security.  Lastly, core DOD policies and guidance on physical security do not  address IoT devices. For example, in one DOD threat scenario, a  malicious actor compromises an Internet-connected car of a DOD senior  leader and unlocks the doors to abduct the passengers.", "Table 2 below summarizes core DOD security policies and guidance we  reviewed that do not address security risks related to IoT devices.", "DOD has developed guidance and detailed procedures for defending  industrial control systems against cyber attacks. As noted previously,  DOD\u2019s Advanced Cyber Industrial Control System Tactics, Techniques,  and Procedures (ACI TTP) for Department of Defense (DOD) Industrial  Control Systems (ICS) offers guidance to DOD components and identifies  procedures for infrastructure devices, including procedures to assess  device anomalies and to recover devices that may have been targeted in  cyber attacks. According to U.S. Cyber Command officials, the  procedures were tested and validated over the course of 2 years, and  U.S. Cyber Command also trained and tested the procedures with Navy  personnel over a 2-week period to assess their effectiveness. Although  the procedures were found to be effective, DOD does not have a policy  that directs the implementation of these procedures throughout the  department, according to DOD officials. For example, a DOD installations  official cited the need to modify existing and future contracts with vendors  of utility services to ensure that these cybersecurity procedures would be  put in place. Further, Navy and Air Force officials stated that their  services do not have a defined plan in place to implement the advanced  cyber industrial control system tactics, techniques, and procedures. Navy  officials expressed their intent to fully adopt these procedures; however,  they cited a current lack of resources and the strain on system  operators\u2014who are more focused on non-security issues\u2014as reasons for  not yet having implemented the procedures."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Other Actions to Address Security Risks Related to IoT Devices", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the assessments, policies, and guidance discussed above,  DOD has taken other actions to address IoT-related security risks.

All of the military departments drafted and submitted  implementation plans or a strategy to the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations, and Environment) by  February 2017. After the initial inventory phase, DOD components are  to make their control systems resilient to cyber threats and to  implement a continuous monitoring process to respond to emerging  threats. The department\u2019s goal is to implement cybersecurity controls  on the most critical control systems by the end of fiscal year 2019.  These actions would be consistent with the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 and our recommendation in a  prior report, which also requires DOD to take actions on the  cybersecurity of its industrial control systems.", "IoT Forum: According to officials in the Office of the DOD Chief  Information Officer, the office has established an informal IoT working  group for DOD officials working on IoT issues. The group has  attended IoT workshops and developed a paper on the IoT. The group  authored and published the policy paper DOD Policy  Recommendations for the Internet of Things (IoT) in December 2016  to raise awareness of IoT issues. As noted previously, the report  discusses the definition of the IoT, the benefits and cybersecurity risks  of IoT devices, potential IoT threat scenarios, and DOD policy tenets  for addressing the IoT. According to an official in the Office of the  DOD Chief Information Officer, their next steps are to establish an IoT  community of interest and to produce another IoT report that focuses  on DOD component responsibilities and more detailed policy analysis.", "Research and testing efforts: The Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency has a few ongoing research programs that relate to  IoT security issues. The Leveraging the Analog Domain for Security  program seeks to develop new cyber techniques in digital devices by  monitoring their analog emissions (e.g., radio waves, sound waves,  micro-power changes) and is projected to continue through December  2019. By studying analog signals radiating from IoT devices, they  intend to better monitor IoT devices and detect deviations from normal  device behavior to provide protection for DOD networks. Additionally,  the Vetting Commodity Information Technology Software and  Firmware program aims to develop checks for broad classes of  malicious features and dangerous flaws in software and firmware.

DOD  will likely be involved in using these devices for the foreseeable future.  However, IoT devices pose numerous security challenges that need to be  addressed, both in specific instances and as part of a holistic approach to  risk management in the information age. DOD has made some progress  in addressing the security challenges we identify in this report, including:  (1) identifying a number of IoT security risks and notional threat  scenarios; (2) examining security risks of IoT devices by conducting  assessments on critical infrastructure; (3) developing policies and  guidance for IoT devices; and (4) establishing ongoing efforts, such as  research programs, to mitigate the security risks with these devices. DOD  could capitalize on this progress by further addressing challenges we  found in the following areas: the lack of operations security surveys that  could identify and mitigate security risks of IoT; insufficient DOD policies  and guidance for specific IoT devices and applications of concern (e.g.,  smart televisions and smartphone applications); and the need for DOD  core security policies (e.g., cybersecurity, operations security, physical  security, information security) that provide clear guidance on the IoT or  IoT devices.

We also interviewed  officials from a number of organizations\u2014including the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, Joint Force Headquarters-DOD Information  Networks, the military services, the Defense Information Systems  Agency, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency,  and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014to identify key  security risks associated with IoT devices. After these interviews and  reviews, we grouped identified risks into common categories. We  examined DOD notional threat scenarios that depict consequences  ensuing from compromised IoT devices. Officials in the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, the Navy, the Defense Information Systems  Agency, and Joint Force Headquarters-DOD Information Networks  developed these scenarios. Through our interviews with organization  officials, we identified various types of risk assessments that may address  security risks related to IoT devices. We reviewed the focus areas of  these assessments and identified whether they examined IoT  devices. We compared these assessments against DOD criteria. We  collected and analyzed a non-generalizable sample of these assessments  to review. For the mission assurance assessments, we requested and  received a sample of documents from the services to review. From our  request, we received and reviewed a total of 11 mission assurance  assessments\u20142 from the Army, 2 from the Navy, and 7 from the Marine  Corps.

We reviewed  these policies and guidance\u2014including the DOD Chief Information  Officer\u2019s DOD Policy Recommendations for the Internet of Things (IoT)\u2014 and identified their general characteristics, applicability, and focus areas.  When we interviewed officials from the organizations noted above, we  also asked them whether there are any gaps in policies and guidance for  IoT devices, applications, or procedures. We compiled their responses to  identify a few commonly cited policy and guidance gaps where security  risks may not be addressed. Additionally, we reviewed core DOD security  policy documents on cybersecurity, operations security, physical security,  and information security (see table 2 in the report) to assess whether  these documents addressed IoT devices or security risks associated with  IoT devices. We used relevant search terms such as \u201cdevice,\u201d  \u201ccapabilities,\u201d and \u201cthreat\u201d to make these assessments.
