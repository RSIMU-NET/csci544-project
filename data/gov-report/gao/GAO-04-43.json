This modernization, known as the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP), is intended to provide NASA with an agencywide, integrated approach to performing critical business functions, such as contract management--an area that GAO first designated as high risk in 1990 and continues to do so today. GAO was requested to review various aspects of IFMP, and this report is one in a series on the program. The objective of this review was to determine whether NASA has been acquiring and implementing IFMP in the context of an enterprise architecture."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To date, NASA has acquired and implemented significant components of IFMP without an enterprise architecture to guide and constrain the program. An enterprise architecture is an organizational blueprint that defines--in both business and technology terms--how an organization operates today and how it intends to operate in the future; it also provides a plan for transitioning to this future state. Using an enterprise architecture to guide and constrain systems modernization programs is a federal requirement and a recognized best practice of successful public and private organizations. In addition, GAO's research has shown that attempting major modernization programs such as IFMP without a well-defined enterprise architecture risks, among other things, building systems that are duplicative, are not interoperable, and do not effectively and efficiently support mission operations and performance. During the course of GAO's work, NASA recognized the need for an enterprise architecture and has taken steps to develop one. For example, it has established an architecture program office, designated a chief architect, and selected an architecture framework to use. In addition, after GAO completed its audit work, NASA released an initial version of an enterprise architecture, which the chief technology officer stated was not yet complete and would be improved upon in future versions. However, the agency has yet to establish other key architecture management capabilities, such as designating an accountable corporate entity to lead the architecture effort, having an approved policy for developing and maintaining the architecture, and implementing an independent verification and validation function to provide needed assurance that architecture products and architecture management processes are effective. Moreover, the architecture products used to date to manage NASA's investment in IFMP did not provide sufficient context (depth and scope of agencywide operational and technical requirements) to effectively guide and constrain the program. The chief technology officer agreed that NASA needs an effective enterprise architecture program and stated that efforts are under way to establish one. GAO's experience in reviewing other agencies has shown that not having an effective enterprise architecture program can be attributed to, among other things, an absence of senior management understanding and support, as well as cultural resistance. NASA's current approach to acquiring and implementing IFMP outside the context of an architecture unnecessarily increases the risk that the program's system components will not effectively and efficiently support agencywide operations. The result will be costly system rework. It is critical for NASA to discontinue this approach and adopt the best practice of managing its IFMP system investments within the context of a well-defined enterprise architecture."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To improve its ability to manage its contractors, which is an area that we  designated as high risk in 1990, and continue to do so today, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began its third attempt at  modernizing its financial management systems in April 2000. This  modernization effort, known as the Integrated Financial Management  Program (IFMP), is expected to produce an integrated, NASA-wide  business systems environment by acquiring and incrementally  implementing commercial hardware and software components. Our  research of successful public- and private-sector organizations shows that  attempting a modernization program, like IFMP, without having and using a  well-defined modernization blueprint, commonly called an enterprise  architecture, results in operations and systems that are duplicative, are not  well integrated, are unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface, and do  not effectively optimize mission performance.", "In April 2003, we issued the first in a series of reports on the program, in  which we concluded that NASA\u2019s approach to acquiring and implementing  IFMP components had and would continue to introduce risk and increase  the chances that the agency would fall short of meeting its program goal.  Because of the importance of IFMP to overall mission performance, you  asked us to continue our review. Specifically, you requested that we  determine whether (1) NASA has been acquiring and implementing IFMP in  the context of an enterprise architecture, (2) the core financial module as  implemented in June 2003 would satisfy NASA\u2019s key external reporting  requirements, and (3) NASA\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate, program schedule,  and funding reserves for IFMP were reasonable.", "We are responding to the second two issues in separate reports, as well as  summarizing our findings on all three areas in an additional report.

In  particular, we identified the following four performance and accountability  challenges facing the agency:  Strengthening strategic human capital management. NASA is  facing shortages in its workforce, which could likely worsen as the  workforce continues to age and the pipeline of talent shrinks. This  dilemma is more pronounced among areas crucial to NASA\u2019s ability to  perform its mission, such as engineering, science, and IT.

NASA has  addressed many acquisition-related weaknesses and is beginning to  tackle one of its most formidable barriers to sound contract  management\u2014the lack of a modern, integrated financial management  system.

These issues involved how to allocate service and general  and administrative costs, civil service costs, and unassigned costs. Once  these accounting and costing issues were resolved, the OIG reported that  NASA would have to configure the IFMP software to reflect the changes.  The OIG recommended that NASA revise the IFMP plans to include  (1) time frames and milestones for completing steps to implement full cost  accounting, including addressing and resolving the cost issues identified  above; (2) identification of the personnel and other resources necessary to  perform the steps within the established time frames; and (3) senior  management approval and support of these additional procedures.

More specifically, these artifacts do not satisfy the most basic  characteristics of architecture content, such as clearly distinguishing  between artifacts that represent the \u201cAs Is\u201d and the \u201cTo Be\u201d environments.  The agency\u2019s chief technology officer agreed that these existing  architecture products do not clearly distinguish between the two  environments.

By including these elements, the  architecture would provide NASA with the necessary frame of reference  for engineering business processes and systems in a manner that supports  agencywide goals and objectives, such as ensuring that decision makers  routinely receive timely, accurate, and reliable information.", "The \u201cTo Be\u201d architecture products used to date in acquiring and  implementing IFMP provide minimal descriptive content.

Other  important steps include analyzing technology opportunities and  marketplace trends, as well as assessing fiscal and budgetary realities and  institutional acquisition and development capabilities. With the use of such  analyses and assessments, options are explored and decisions are made  regarding which legacy systems to retain, modify, or retire and which new  systems to introduce on a tactical (temporary) basis or to pursue as  strategic solutions. Accordingly, transition plans identify legacy, migration,  and new systems and sequence them to show, for example, the phasing out  and termination of systems and capabilities and the timing of the  introduction of new systems and capabilities, and they do so in light of  resource constraints, such as budget, people, acquisition/development  process maturity, and associated time frames.", "The transition plan artifacts that NASA relied on in acquiring and  implementing IFMP generally do not possess these attributes.

According to this  official, although this initial version of the architecture is incomplete, it  does provide some of the missing contextual information (operational and  technical) that we had identified during our review. The official also stated  that future versions of the architecture are to be issued quarterly through  June 2004 and semiannually thereafter, and that plans are currently being  developed for assessing IFMP\u2019s alignment with the architecture.

Such  practices form the basis of our architecture management maturity  framework, which specifies by stages the key architecture management  controls that are embodied in federal guidance and best practices, provides  an explicit benchmark for gauging the effectiveness of architecture  management, and provides a road map for making improvements. Each of  the five stages is described below.  1. Creating enterprise architecture awareness. The organization does  not have plans to develop and use an architecture, or it has plans that  do not demonstrate an awareness of the value of having and using an  architecture. While stage 1 agencies may have initiated some  architecture activity, these agencies\u2019 efforts are ad hoc and  unstructured, lack institutional leadership and direction, and do not  provide the management foundation necessary for successful  architecture development. 2. Building the enterprise architecture management foundation. The  organization recognizes that the architecture is a corporate asset by  vesting accountability for it in an executive body that represents the  entire enterprise. At this stage, an organization assigns architecture  management roles and responsibilities and establishes plans for  developing enterprise architecture products and for measuring  program progress and product quality; it also commits the resources  necessary for developing an architecture\u2014people, processes, and  tools. 3. Developing the enterprise architecture. The organization focuses on  developing architecture products according to the selected framework,  methodology, tool, and established management plans. Roles and  responsibilities assigned in the previous stage are in place, and  resources are being applied to develop actual enterprise architecture  products. The scope of the architecture has been defined to encompass  the entire enterprise, whether organization-based or function-based. 4. Completing the enterprise architecture. The organization has  completed its enterprise architecture products, meaning that the  products have been approved by the architecture steering committee or  an investment review board, and by the CIO. Further, an independent  agent has assessed the quality (i.e., completeness and accuracy) of the  architecture products. Additionally, evolution of the approved products  is governed by a written architecture maintenance policy approved by  the head of the organization. 5. Leveraging the enterprise architecture to manage change. The  organization has secured senior leadership approval of the enterprise  architecture products and a written institutional policy stating that IT  investments must comply with the architecture, unless granted an  explicit compliance waiver. Further, decision makers are using the  architecture to identify and address ongoing and proposed IT  investments that are conflicting, overlapping, not strategically linked,  or redundant. Also, the organization tracks and measures architecture  benefits or return on investment, and adjustments are continuously  made to both the architecture management process and the enterprise  architecture products.", "For stage 2, our framework specifies nine key practices or core elements  that are necessary to provide the management foundation for successfully  launching and sustaining an architecture effort. Examples of stage 2 core  elements are described below.", "Establish a committee or group representing the enterprise that is  responsible for directing, overseeing, or approving the enterprise  architecture. This committee should include executive-level  representatives from each line of business, and these representatives  should have the authority to commit resources and enforce decisions  within their respective organizational units. By establishing this  enterprisewide responsibility and accountability, the agency  demonstrates its commitment to building the management foundation  and obtaining buy-in from across the organization.", "Appoint a chief architect. The chief architect should be responsible and  accountable for the enterprise architecture, supported by the  architecture program office, and overseen by the architecture steering  committee. The chief architect, in collaboration with the CIO, the  architecture steering committee, and the organizational head, is  instrumental in obtaining organizational buy-in for the enterprise  architecture, including support from the business units, as well as in  securing resources to support architecture management functions, such  as risk management, configuration management, quality assurance, and  security management.", "Use a framework, methodology, and automated tool to develop the  enterprise architecture. These elements are important because they  provide the means for developing the architecture in a consistent and  efficient manner. The framework provides a formal structure for  representing the enterprise architecture, while the methodology is the  common set of procedures that the enterprise is to follow in developing  the architecture products. The automated tool serves as a repository  where architectural products are captured, stored, and maintained.", "Develop an architecture program management plan. This plan  specifies how and when the architecture is to be developed. It includes a  detailed work breakdown structure; resource estimates (e.g., funding,  staffing, and training); performance measures; and management  controls for developing and maintaining the architecture. The plan  demonstrates the organization\u2019s commitment to managing architecture  development and maintenance as a formal program.", "Allocate adequate resources. An organization needs to have the  resources (funding, people, tools, and technology) to establish and  effectively manage its architecture. This includes, among other things,  identifying and securing adequate funding to support architecture  activities, hiring and retaining the right people, and selecting and  acquiring the right tools and technology to support activities.", "Our framework similarly identifies key architecture management practices  associated with later stages of architecture management maturity. For  example, at stage 3, the stage at which organizations focus on architecture  development activities, organizations need to satisfy six core elements.  Examples of these core elements are discussed below.", "Issue a written and approved organization policy for development of  the enterprise architecture. The policy defines the scope of the  architecture, including the requirement for a description of the baseline  and target architecture, as well as an investment road map or  sequencing plan specifying the move between the two. This policy is an  important means for ensuring enterprisewide commitment to  developing an enterprise architecture and for clearly assigning  responsibility for doing so.", "Ensure that enterprise architecture products are under configuration  management. This involves ensuring that changes to products are  identified, tracked, monitored, documented, reported, and audited.  Configuration management maintains the integrity and consistency of  products, which is key to enabling effective integration among related  products and for ensuring alignment between architecture artifacts.", "At stage 4, during which organizations focus on architecture completion  activities, organizations need to satisfy eight core elements. Examples of  these core elements are described below.", "Ensure that enterprise architecture products and management  processes undergo independent verification and validation. This core  element involves having an independent third party\u2014such an as internal  audit function or contractor that is not involved with any of the  architecture development activities\u2014verify and validate that the  products were developed in accordance with architecture processes  and product standards. Doing so provides organizations with needed  assurance of the quality of the architecture.", "Ensure that business, performance, information/data,  application/service, and technology descriptions address security. An  organization should explicitly and consistently address security in its  business, performance, information/data, application/service, and  technology architecture products. Because security permeates every  aspect of an organization\u2019s operations, the nature and substance of  institutionalized security requirements, controls, and standards should  be captured in the enterprise architecture products.", "At stage 5, during which the focus is on architecture maintenance and  implementation activities, organizations need to satisfy eight core  elements. Examples of these core elements are described below.", "Make the enterprise architecture an integral component of the IT  investment management process. Because the road map defines the IT  systems that an organization plans to invest in as it transitions from the  \u201cAs Is\u201d to the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment, the enterprise architecture is a  critical frame of reference for making IT investment decisions. Using the  architecture when making such decisions is important because  organizations should approve only those investments that move the  organization toward the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment, as specified in the road  map.", "Measure and report return on enterprise architecture investment. Like  any investment, the enterprise architecture should produce a return on  investment (i.e., a set of benefits), and this return should be measured  and reported in relation to costs. Measuring return on investment is  important to ensure that expected benefits from the architecture are  realized and to share this information with executive decision makers,  who can then take corrective action to address deviations from  expectations.", "Table 5 summarizes our framework\u2019s five stages and the associated core  elements for each stage.", "The state of NASA\u2019s implementation of key enterprise architecture  management practices, conditions, and structures currently places the  agency at stage 1 of our maturity framework.

According to our framework, effective architecture management is  generally not achieved until an enterprise has a completed and approved  architecture that is being effectively maintained and is being used to  leverage organizational change and support investment decision making;  having these characteristics is equivalent to having satisfied all stage 3 core  elements and many stage 4 and 5 elements.", "Regarding stage 2 core elements, NASA has, for example, recently  established a program office, assigned a chief architect, and selected a  framework (Zachman) and automated tools (e.g., the Rational Rose by  Rational Software Corporation/IBM Software Group). However, the agency  has not satisfied a stage 2 core element that is critical to effective  architecture management. Specifically, a committee or group representing  the enterprise has not yet been established to guide, direct, or approve the  architecture. Instead, the CIO is guiding the architecture development  effort. Having such a corporate entity is critical to overcoming cultural  resistance to using an enterprise architecture. Without such an entity to  lead and be accountable for the architectural effort, there is increased risk  that the architecture will not represent a corporate decision-making tool  and will not be viewed and endorsed as an agencywide asset.", "Concerning stage 3, NASA has not satisfied three of six core elements. For  example, the agency does not have a written and approved policy for  architecture development, which is a stage 3 core element. Without such a  policy that, for example, identifies the major players in the development  process and provides for architecture guidance, direction, and approval,  NASA will be challenged in overcoming cultural resistance to using an  enterprise architecture and achieving agencywide architecture  commitment and support.", "The agency also has yet to implement numerous stage 4 and 5 core  elements. For example, NASA has not (1) documented and approved a  policy for architecture maintenance, (2) implemented an independent  verification and validation function that covers architecture products and  architecture management processes, and (3) made the architecture an  integral component of its IT investment management process. (The  detailed results of our assessment of NASA\u2019s satisfaction of each of the  stages and associated core elements are provided in app. III.)", "According to the chief technology officer, the agency recognizes the  importance of having rigorous and disciplined architecture management  controls and is in the process of establishing them. Our research of  successful organizations and experience in reviewing other agency  enterprise architecture efforts shows that not having these controls is,  among other things, a function of limited senior management  understanding of and commitment to an enterprise architecture and  cultural resistance to having and using one. Until such barriers are  addressed, and effective architecture management structures and  processes are established, it is unlikely that any agency will be able to  produce and maintain a complete and enforceable architecture or  implement modernized systems in a way that minimizes overlap and  duplication and maximizes integration and mission support."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s acquisition and implementation of six major IFMP system  components outside the context of an enterprise architecture was not a  prudent decision.

It is critical for NASA to discontinue this approach and  adopt the best practice of managing its IFMP system investments within  the context of a well-defined enterprise architecture. In order to do so, it is  important for NASA to establish an effective means for developing and  implementing an architecture, which includes gaining top management  understanding and support to lead the way in overcoming any cultural  resistance. It is equally important that the agency ensure that the  architecture contains sufficient depth and scope, quickly determine  whether existing and planned IFMP component systems align with initial  and subsequent versions of the architecture, and limit further investment in  these systems until such determinations are made.
