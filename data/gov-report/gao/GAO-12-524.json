From  the outset, the Air Force\u2019s F-22A development strategy was to pursue a  quantum leap in capability in a single development program, referred to  as a single-step approach, to develop and field a stealthy aircraft with  advanced capabilities to replace its aging F-15C/D fleet and perform air  superiority missions. Recognizing the magnitude of this development  effort, the Air Force estimated that it would need more than 12 years to  develop and deliver an initial F-22A operating capability.", "In 2003, we testified that the Air Force took on significant risk and  onerous technological challenges by committing to an approach to F-22A  development that promised to deliver all of the required capabilities in a  single step. We noted that while it may have allowed the F-22A program  to compete for funding, it hamstrung the program with little knowledge  about its true technology, funding, and schedule needs. In addition, the  Air Force did not make early trade-offs between requirements and  available resources and therefore never established an executable  business case. Ultimately F-22A development took more than 14 years,  encountered significant cost increases and quantity reductions, and has  not yet fully met established requirements, specifically those related to  reliability and maintainability.", "In contrast, the legacy programs we reviewed approached development  of their aircraft as an incremental process in which initial capabilities  would quickly be developed and fielded, and as requirements evolved  and technologies became available, additional increments of aircraft  would then be developed. All of the legacy programs encountered  difficulties during their initial development programs, yet they all delivered  initial increments of operational aircraft within 5 to 7 years. In some  cases, the initial aircraft provided only a limited operating capability  because certain performance requirements could not be achieved. In  most cases, the users deemed the limited capability acceptable, with the  understanding that future increments of the aircraft could address the  shortfalls. The following are illustrative examples from each program(see app. II for a more detailed discussion of each program):", "F-15 Eagle: In the late 1960s, the Air Force identified the need to  develop and field a new air superiority aircraft to counter emerging  threats. The new aircraft, designated the F-15 Eagle, was expected to  possess advanced capabilities, excel in close combat and  maneuvering situations, and specialize in the tactical missions  including escort and combat air patrol. Prior to the start of full-scale  development in 1970, key decision makers made trade-offs, such as  opting not to include 2,000 pounds of additional fuel capacity, to  ensure that the program would be able to deliver a useful increment of  capability within a relatively short time frame. Those early trade-offs  were made with the understanding that the traded capabilities could  potentially be added in the future if requirements demanded them and  resources were available. While the F-15 development program was  considered expensive relative to other programs at that time, and  encountered significant difficulties with its engines, it was able to  deliver an initial operating capability in 1975\u20145 years after the start of  development\u2014and quickly fielded hundreds of operational aircraft.", "F-16 Fighting Falcon: The F-16 development program that began in  1975 was essentially the continuation of a competitive prototype  program that had been ongoing since 1972 known as the Lightweight  Fighter Prototype program. In fact, the Lightweight Fighter Prototype  program\u2019s requirements document became the initial basis of the F-16  full-scale development program. According to the requirements  document, \u201cthe Air Force intend to investigate the feasibility and  operational utility of highly maneuverable lightweight fighter aircraft  through a prototype design, fabrication, and flight test program.\u201d In  addition, the requirements emphasized the need for the aircraft to be  \u201crelatively low cost.\u201d The Air Force also expected the F-16 to be the  low-end complement to its high-end F-15 fleet. The program was  designated as a design-to-cost effort, meaning that cost was the key  requirement against which all other requirements were traded. As a  result, the baseline F-16 aircraft\u2014ultimately designated as F-16A/B\u2014 were day-only, fair-weather fighters with relatively basic capabilities,  although they did possess some more advanced capabilities like  computer-aided flight controls known as fly-by-wire. The radar system  in the initial F-16 aircraft did not fully meet performance specifications,  and similar to the F-15, the aircraft had significant difficulties with its  engine. Regardless, the Air Force delivered an initial operating  capability just over 5 years after development start and quickly fielded  hundreds of operational aircraft.", "F/A-18 Hornet: The Navy\u2019s F/A-18 development program that began  in 1975 was rooted in the Lightweight Fighter Prototype program.  Despite direction to procure the same aircraft as the Air Force\u2014the   F-16\u2014the Navy chose to develop its own unique fighter and attack  aircraft, citing the need for two engines and other unique features that  it believed were necessary to operate from an aircraft carrier. As a  result, the Navy developed its own requirements and planned for a    7-year development program that some documents indicate was also  to be a design-to-cost program. According to current F/A-18 program  officials, the Navy established a formal plan for future F/A-18  improvements and upgrades at the time the development program  began. While the baseline F/A-18 program was able to achieve initial  operating capability in 1983, slightly later than originally planned, it did  not fully meet its established requirements for combat radius or \u201cbring  back\u201d capacity\u2014that is, the capacity of the aircraft to return to the  aircraft carrier with unused weapons and fuel. Program officials  pointed out, however, that those capability shortfalls were deemed  acceptable by the warfighters, and deferred into the future to allow for  the production and fielding of hundreds of operational F/A-18A/B  aircraft.", "A comparison of data from F-22A, F-15, F-16, and F/A-18 selected  acquisition reports at 5-year intervals over the first 20 years following the  start of development for each program shows that the incremental  development approaches of the legacy systems quickly produced large  quantities of operational aircraft and introduced several new increments  of aircraft over that time span (see table 2). The data also highlight the  high cost\u2014in comparable 2012 dollars\u2014of the overall F-22A program  relative to the legacy aircraft we reviewed, and the relatively low  quantities of baseline aircraft that its single-step development approach  produced over that same time frame.", "The F-22A modernization program began in reaction to a significant  change in the aircraft\u2019s primary mission. In contrast, the legacy programs  we reviewed established modernization requirements that focused on  using mature technologies to upgrade the capabilities of their respective  aircraft to better perform the missions for which they had been initially  developed. The F-22A and legacy programs we reviewed all began  modernizing when their respective development programs were either  complete or nearing completion\u2014around the time that the baseline  program achieved initial operating capability\u2014and nearly all of the  programs were early in procurement, with the exception of F-15, which  was further along.", "F-22A modernization was initiated in 2003, in response to new  requirements for the aircraft to perform ground attack missions in addition  to the air supremacy missions it had originally been designed for. Given  the magnitude of this shift in mission, and because the original  development program had not anticipated the need for such a change,  critical information about requirements, technical scope, schedule, and  funding was not available at the time modernization began. As a result,  the initial cost and schedule estimates for the overall modernization  program were not fully informed\u2014that is, they were not knowledge  based\u2014and have since changed significantly, with costs doubling and  schedule slipping by more than 7 years.", "Because the legacy programs anticipated future upgrades, they began  planning and working with other program offices, contractors, and in  some cases, foreign governments, to identify potential new technologies  for future increments while their initial development programs were  ongoing. In many cases, this collaborative approach allowed programs to  leverage investments in new technology that had been made by other  programs or even foreign governments that had purchased variants of the  respective programs\u2019 aircraft. The programs also worked closely with the  warfighters to ensure that the technologies they were pursuing would  provide new capabilities to address new requirements or would  sufficiently enhance existing capabilities. In some cases, this approach  required the warfighters to agree to eliminate or defer some desired  capabilities indefinitely because they were not technologically feasible or  because they were not affordable. For example, former F-16 program  officials explained that the warfighters had stated a desire to include the  Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN)  subsystem in the first major F-16 upgrade that was expected to provide  aircrew with the ability to fly both day and night and in adverse weather,  while improving terrain-following and targeting capabilities. However, the  technology was not mature at the time and as a result the program office  deferred the capability. The former officials noted that the F-16 eventually  received LANTIRN as part of its Block 40/42 upgrade, but only after the  technology had been matured for use on the F-15E.", "While making these types of trade-offs meant that not every desire would  be met, it allowed the programs to establish sound business cases for  moving forward with new increments, and provided the warfighters with  some assurance that the end product would be delivered quickly and  perform as expected. This type of proactive approach allowed the legacy  programs to begin fielding their first increments of modernized aircraft\u2014in  each case designated as C/D series aircraft\u2014in less than 5 years from  the start of their respective modernization programs. The following  examples from the F-16 and F/A-18 programs provide further illustration:", "F-16 Fighting Falcon: The Air Force established an F-16  Multinational Staged Improvement Program in February 1980. The  program provided a structured means of incrementally modifying and  upgrading the F-16, and was originally conceived with three stages.  Although the specific content of each future stage was not fully  defined at the outset, the program office worked closely with the  warfighters, technology developers, and other program offices to  establish feasible and affordable requirements as each successive  stage approached. According to a RAND Corporation study done for  the Air Force in 1993, \u201c  essentially a management device for coordinating many concurrent  efforts to integrate subsystems with one another and an F-16  airframe. That is, in each stage, new designs of the F-16   conceived that integrate many new subsystems to create a  coherent aircraft with new combat capabilities.\u201d As new subsystems  with potential for future F-16 integration were developed, the F-16  program office established a relationship with the subsystem program  office, in some cases providing aircraft for testing and influencing  design, to help mature the technology and facilitate future integration  onto the F-16. In most cases, new technologies were incorporated  onto new production aircraft on the production line. The first F-16C/D  aircraft was delivered to the Air Force on schedule in December 1984,  less than 5 years after the beginning of the improvement program.", "F/A-18 Hornet: The first major upgrade of the F/A-18 began in 1984,  with the issuance of an engineering change proposal. The Navy\u2019s  stated goal was to improve the F/A-18\u2019s existing capabilities while  also providing some new capabilities in the areas of avionics,  armament, and electronic warfare. The upgrade was also expected  to provide new mission computers with adequate speed, interface,  and memory capacity to facilitate future growth. The Navy planned to  use technologies, or subsystems, that had been developed and  matured outside of the F/A-18 program. In its December 1985  selected acquisition report to the Congress, the Navy noted that the  new subsystems, or technologies, for the F/A-18 upgrade would be  provided as government-furnished equipment. Therefore, the costs  and risks associated with developing and maturing the technologies  were not borne by the F/A-18 program. The program integrated the  new technologies into its production line in 1986 and received the first  F/A-18C/D aircraft as scheduled the following year\u2014only 3 years after  the engineering change proposal was first issued.", "Although the programs began for different reasons, our analysis of  program data provided to the Congress in selected acquisition reports in  December of the year immediately preceding the start of each respective  modernization program indicates that they began at essentially the same  points in development and procurement. For example, we found that the  F-16, F/A-18, and F-22A had all funded more than 85 percent of their  projected development costs, funded less than one-third of their  estimated procurement costs, and procured less than 20 percent of their  total estimated aircraft quantities. The F-15 program was also nearly done  with development when it started modernizing, but it was further along in  procurement, having funded and procured more than 40 percent of its  projected aircraft. Figure 1 compares and contrasts the specific  percentages for each program, and to provide additional context, it  identifies the total estimated costs\u2014converted to 2012 dollars\u2014and total  procurement quantities from which the percentages were calculated.", "All of the modernization programs also began around similar acquisition  events. Our review of program selected acquisition reports and other  program data found that all of the programs began modernizing after they  had initiated production and around the time they achieved initial  operating capability. It is important to note, however, that those  acquisition events took place much later in the F-22A program, primarily  because the original development program was over 14 years long, while  the legacy development programs were 5 to 7 years long."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "F-22A Upgrades Are Being Retrofitted onto Complex, Stealth Aircraft While Legacy Programs Incorporated Upgrades into Production of New, Less Complex Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all F-22A modernization upgrades will have to be retrofitted onto  fielded aircraft while the legacy programs integrated their upgrades into  new production aircraft. The Air Force began integrating F-22A Increment  2 onto production aircraft in 2007, and received the first Increment 2  aircraft from the contractor the following year. All of the remaining aircraft  were produced and delivered with Increment 2 upgrades incorporated.  However, F-22A production was terminated in 2009, before the second  modernization increment (Increment 3.1) had finished development, so  the remaining modernization increments will have to be retrofitted into the  fleet. As a result, the aircraft will have used up some of their service life  by the time they are fully upgraded. Based on F-22A flight hour data  provided by the program office our analysis indicates that a large number  of aircraft are likely to have flown more than 1,500 hours, or nearly 20  percent of their 8,000-hour service lives, before the Increment 3.2B  upgrades are fielded. In contrast, the legacy programs produced entirely  new upgraded aircraft.", "It should also be noted that retrofitting upgrades onto stealth aircraft with  fully integrated computer systems\u2014referred to as fused or integrated  avionics\u2014like the F-22A is a riskier and more complex process than  integrating new technologies into a conventional aircraft with separate  and distinct computer systems and software for each subsystem\u2014known  as federated avionics\u2014even if the technologies are mature. In large part,  this is because any changes made to the F-22A have to conform to the  aircraft\u2019s overall stealth design and will require updates to the aircraft\u2019s  computer operating software. For example, the F-22A requires missiles  that are carried and launched from internal weapons bays\u2014not hung on  the wings or under the fuselage as is the case with the F-16, F-15, and  F/A-18. In addition, any new weapon added to the aircraft will also require  new software to target and launch the weapon. For the F-22A, that  software will have to be fully integrated into the aircraft\u2019s overall avionics  system and tested thoroughly to determine its impact on all of the  aircraft\u2019s other systems, which is costly and time consuming. Office of the  Secretary of Defense officials point out that the legacy systems also had  to integrate and test new software to ensure that it would work properly,  but because the avionics systems were federated that process did not  take as long and was less costly. In addition, the legacy aircraft had  greater freedom to place new technologies onto the exterior of the aircraft  or make structural changes as needed.", "Given the stealth and avionics complexities of the F-22A, it is likely that it  will be more costly to modernize than the F-15, F-16, or F/A-18. F-22A  contractor officials emphasize that these complexities translate into labor  hours and ultimately costs that the legacy programs would not have  incurred. The total cost of F-22A modernization\u2014through Increment  3.2B\u2014is currently estimated to be $9.7 billion. We were not able to isolate  comparable costs for the legacy modernization programs, primarily  because they all funded and managed modernization as a continuation of  their initial baselines. As a result, their respective selected acquisition  reports and budget requests did not explicitly identify all of their  modernization costs or funding needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As DOD pursues more complex and costly fighter aircraft to meet the  advanced threats of the future, it is increasingly important that programs  begin planning for incremental modernization at the earliest possible  point. An overall incremental approach to development and early  modernization planning were keys to the success of the legacy aircraft  modernization programs we reviewed. From the beginning, they worked  with the warfighters, technology developers, and in some cases foreign  governments, to match requirements with available resources, and  quickly developed and delivered new increments of upgraded aircraft to  the warfighters. In most cases, the programs delivered initial increments  of aircraft with limited capabilities, with the expectation that they would be  upgraded over time as funding and technologies became available.  Although the legacy and F-22A programs began modernizing at the same  general points in time, the F-22A did not originally plan for a major  modernization program, so when the aircraft\u2019s mission changed in 2003,  the resources\u2014primarily technology and funding\u2014needed to meet the  new requirements had not been fully developed or identified. As a result,  the cost, schedule, and performance projections for the F-22A  modernization program were not well founded and, over time, costs have  doubled and the delivery of the full required capability has been delayed  by more than 7 years.

They also emphasize that the EA-18G has  distinctly different mission\u2014electronic warfare\u2014and therefore, while it is a  variant of the F/A-18F, it is not viewed as a new increment.", "At the time the EA-18G development program started, the Navy still had a  significant amount F/A-18E/F procurement remaining with approximately  370 aircraft still to be purchased, although it had already achieved initial  operating capability. As a result, EA-18G development and procurement  ended up being highly concurrent with F/A-18E/F procurement. The Navy  received approval to begin EA-18G production in July 2007 and the  aircraft achieved initial operating capability in September 2009. As of  December 2010, the Navy anticipates procuring a total of 114 EA-18G  aircraft, with the final procurement being made in fiscal year 2013."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Bruce Fairbairn, Assistant  Director; Travis Masters; Robert Miller; Marie Ahearn; Marvin Bonner;  Laura Greifner; and Roxanna Sun made key contributions to the report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Defense Acquisitions: Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs.
