The network allocated 83 percent of the total, or $825 million, to its medical centers. The medical centers received smaller amounts from VA headquarters (9 percent of the total or about $93 million) and resources from collections (7 percent of the total or about $73 million). As in fiscal year 2002, the network allocated more than 80 percent of medical center resources each year from fiscal years 1997 through fiscal year 2003. Medical centers in Network 9 (Nashville) received about 77 percent of their resources, or $760 million, in fiscal year 2002 based on fixed-per-patient amounts, referred to as fixed-capitation amounts, for patient workload and case mix. Patient workload is the number of patients treated, and case mix is a classification of patients into categories based on health care needs and related costs. The largest portion of these resources allocated on this basis came from the network while a smaller portion came from VA headquarters. Medical centers in the network received about 23 percent of their total resources, or $232 million, in fiscal year 2002 based on a variety of other factors such as network managers' determination of the financial needs of medical centers during the course of the year. These resources came from the network, VA headquarters, and collections. Since VA changed its resource allocation system in fiscal year 1997, the medical centers in the network received about the same portions of their resources based on fixed capitation amounts and on a variety of other factors each year from fiscal years 1997 through 2003.

Since fiscal year 1997, VA  has moved from a centralized allocation system\u2014in which VA  headquarters allocated resources directly to VA medical centers\u2014to a  more decentralized system in which VA headquarters allocates most of its  resources to VA\u2019s 21 health care networks. The networks then allocate  these resources to their respective medical centers. VA headquarters also  directly allocates some additional resources to the medical centers. In  addition, medical centers collect resources from third-party insurance  payments and other sources. While implementing this new resource  allocation process, VA increased the number of patients it treated from  3.1 million to 4.7 million from fiscal years 1997 through 2002 and received  annual appropriations for medical care programs that increased from  $17 billion to $21 billion.", "We and others have examined how VA uses the Veterans Equitable  Resource Allocation (VERA) system to allocate resources to the  networks. VERA is a national, formula-driven approach that VA uses to  allocate most of its resources to networks based primarily on two factors  that experts generally recognize as key principles of health care resource  allocation\u2014patient workload and case mix. Patient workload is the  number of veterans treated. Case mix is a classification of patients into  categories based on their health care needs and related costs. Using  workload and case-mix data, VERA allocates a fixed amount of resources  for each veteran in a case-mix category. These amounts are often referred  to as capitation. By contrast, VA does not require that networks use a  formula-driven approach, like VERA, to allocate resources to medical  centers. Instead, VA provides general guidance to networks for allocating  resources to medical centers that permits variation in the network  allocation methodologies to take into account varying local conditions.", "Representatives from veterans groups and others in Network 9 (Nashville),  also known as the Mid South Healthcare Network, have expressed  concerns about the allocation of resources to the medical centers in  Network 9 (Nashville). These concerns have focused on the total amount  of resources allocated to the network\u2019s largest medical center, the  Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS), which is located in Nashville  and Murfreesboro; the basis on which medical centers in the network  receive their resources; and to what extent network office expenditures  have increased in recent years.", "You asked us to determine for fiscal year 2002 (1) the amount of resources  medical centers in the network received and the source of those  resources, (2) the basis on which medical centers in the network received  these resources, and (3) the extent to which network office expenditures  were greater than in fiscal year 1997 and the primary reasons accounting  for any increase. To place this information in context, you asked us to  supplement our findings for fiscal year 2002, the most recent year for  which complete data were available at the time of our analysis, with  information for fiscal years 1997 through 2003.", "To determine the amount of resources medical centers in the network  received and the sources of those resources in fiscal year 2002, we  categorized information in VA and Network 9 (Nashville) financial reports  on resources available to medical centers by the source of those  resources: Network 9 (Nashville), VA headquarters, and collections.  Because resources for the TVHS medical center and the Network 9  (Nashville) office are combined in the same financial accounts, we used  financial reports maintained by TVHS to separate out financial information  for the TVHS medical center. We developed estimates on similar  information for fiscal years 1997 through 2001 and 2003 based on these  and other data. To determine the basis on which medical centers in the  network received resources in fiscal year 2002, we obtained and analyzed  documents that described the allocation methodology used by the network  and VA headquarters. We relied on VA data, interviews with VA officials,  and on our prior work to calculate the extent of allocations based on  fixed-capitation amounts for patient workload and case mix. We  developed estimates on similar information for fiscal years 1997 through  2001 and 2003 based on these and other data. We limited our review to  how resources were allocated to medical centers and did not analyze how  medical centers in the network spent their allocations to deliver health  care. To examine the extent to which network office expenditures were  greater than in fiscal year 1997, we used financial reports maintained by  TVHS to separate out financial information for the network office from the  TVHS medical center resources and other data we obtained from the  network office. We used these data to analyze changes in network staffing  and other network office functions from fiscal years 1997 through 2002.  We also interviewed network and VA headquarters officials about the roles  and responsibilities of network office staff. To better understand the  issues of concern for all three objectives, we conducted a site visit to  interview officials at the network office located in Nashville and at the  TVHS locations in Nashville and Murfreesboro.

In that year, the six medical centers in  the network treated about 208,000 patients or 20 percent of the veterans  who lived in the area served by the network. (See table 1.) The largest  medical center in the network is TVHS, which has two main locations\u2014  one in Nashville and the other in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. TVHS served  more than twice as many patients and had more than three times the  number of employees as the smallest medical center in the network in  fiscal year 2002. For more detailed information on staff resources at  TVHS\u2019s two locations, which were integrated to form TVHS in fiscal year  2001, see appendix II.", "Network 9 (Nashville) has received increased allocations each year under  VERA to provide resources for medical centers to treat their growing  patient workload. From fiscal year 1997 to fiscal year 2002, the number of  patients medical centers in the network treated increased by 27 percent.  To meet patient health care needs, the network received $700 million in  resources from VERA in fiscal year 1997, and by fiscal year 2002 the  network\u2019s allocations from VERA had risen to $849 million\u2014a 21 percent  increase. The network has been responsible for developing a method to  allocate these VERA resources to its medical centers. VA headquarters  provides general guidance to networks on the principles they should use  when developing their allocation methodologies, but does not require that  networks use patient workload or case mix in their allocation  methodologies.", "Using fixed-capitation amounts for patient workload and case mix are  guiding principles recognized by experts on the design of health care  payment systems and implemented in practice by major health care  programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid, for  example, use fixed-capitation amounts to provide managed care plans  with an incentive to operate efficiently by placing them at risk if their  expenses exceed the payment amount. Our report on VERA in February  2002 also concluded that VERA provides a reasonable approach to  resource allocation, in part because VERA allocates resources to the  networks based primarily on the use of fixed-capitation amounts for  patient workload and case mix. VERA provides fixed-capitation amounts  for each case-mix category that are the same for each network and are  intended to reflect VA\u2019s average costs instead of historical local costs.", "In addition to resources that VA allocates to its medical centers from the  network and headquarters, medical centers also collect other resources  that they use in providing health care to veterans. VA medical centers  collect third-party insurance payments and copayments from veterans. VA  collects insurance payments for treatment of veterans\u2019 conditions that are  not a result of injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during military  service. In addition, some veterans are charged copayments for certain  health care services and prescription drugs obtained at a VA pharmacy.

For instance, TVHS received a lower percentage of its resources  from the network than three other medical centers, in part, because it  received a larger percentage of its resources from VA headquarters than  most medical centers in the network. The larger allocation from VA  headquarters was used, in part, for the TVHS transplant program, the only  one of its kind in the network. Louisville also received a lower percentage  of its resources from the network than three other medical centers, in part,  because the medical center received a higher percentage of its total  resources from collections than any other network medical center.

To calculate its patient workload, the  network, like VERA, used two methods. The network calculated the  number of patients who received a relatively limited amount of health care  during a previous 3-year period, and calculated the number of patients  who received relatively more care during a previous 5-year period. In its  workload calculation for this 3-year period, the network\u2019s resource  allocation methodology, like VERA, excluded a group of veterans, known  as Priority 7 veterans, but included them in its 5-year workload  calculation.

For this  allocation the network included all Priority 7 veterans in its workload  calculation.", "To calculate case mix in fiscal year 2002, the network classified patient  workload into different categories, depending upon estimates of the  patients\u2019 health care needs and associated costs for treating them. The  network, like VERA, used three case-mix categories: basic non-vested,  basic vested, and complex. Basic non-vested and basic-vested categories  included patients who have relatively routine health care needs and are  principally cared for in an outpatient setting. Basic non-vested patients  receive only part of their care through VA and are less costly to VA than  basic-vested patients. Basic-vested patients, by contrast, rely primarily on  VA for meeting their health care needs. Patients in the basic non-vested  and basic-vested category represented about 97 percent of the network\u2019s  patient workload in that year. The complex category included patients  who generally required significant high-cost inpatient care as an integral  part of their rehabilitation or functional maintenance, and represented  about 3 percent of the network\u2019s workload in that year. For patients in  each case-mix category, the network paid medical centers a capitation  rate, which is based on the average cost of care in VA for a patient in that  category. The capitation rates that the network used for each of these  categories were the same as those used in VERA: basic non-vested ($197),  basic vested ($3,121), and complex ($41,667). The network also allocated  about $9 million to medical centers based on other patient case-mix  categories.", "Medical centers in Network 9 (Nashville) with larger patient workloads  generally received more resources than medical centers with smaller  patient workloads. In fiscal year 2002, for example, TVHS had the largest  patient workload and received the most resources. However, if two  medical centers had similar patient workloads but the two had differences  in the case mix of their patients, one may have received more resources  than the other. For example, Mountain Home and Huntington medical  centers had almost identical patient workloads in fiscal year 2002, but  Mountain Home received a larger allocation from the network  ($119 million) than Huntington ($78 million), in part, because of an  important difference in their respective patients\u2019 case mix. Mountain  Home had more patients whose health care needs required more  expensive care as indicated by the number of complex care patients.

In fiscal year 1999, the  network did not use the 3 case-mix categories that VERA converted to in  that year but instead used the 44 classes that VA used to construct VERA\u2019s  3 case-mix categories. In fiscal years 2000 through 2002, the network used  the 3 case-mix categories that VERA used: basic non-vested, basic vested,  and complex care. In fiscal year 2003, the network made a significant  change by increasing the number of case-mix categories from 3 used in  fiscal year 2002 to 644 case-mix categories. The fiscal year 2003 case-mix  approach classified the health care needs of hospital inpatients into the  511 diagnostic related groups (DRGs) used by Medicare to pay hospitals  for inpatient care. For outpatient care, the approach used 121 different  categories to classify the type of visit and account for the amount of  resources the visit consumed. Additionally, the network used 12 different  categories to measure the intensity of care in long-term care settings.  According to a network official, these changes were made to better  account for medical centers\u2019 cost for treating patients.", "The Network 9 (Nashville) decision to use more case-mix categories in  fiscal year 2003 is consistent with a recommendation we made to VA in  February 2002 to improve VERA\u2019s allocation of comparable resources for  comparable workloads among networks. In that report, we  recommended that VA adopt more case-mix categories to better account  for differences in patient health care needs and that VA make other  improvements. We also pointed out that the literature and experts we  consulted suggested that a large increase in the number of case-mix  categories\u2014such as the increase in the number of Network 9 (Nashville)  case-mix categories from 3 to 644 in fiscal year 2003\u2014has advantages and  disadvantages.

VA headquarters requires  that all networks have such a fund, which is similar in concept to VERA\u2019s  reserve fund. Network officials told us while they encourage efficient  operations, some medical centers have higher costs in certain areas and if  these medical centers are unable to lower their costs, the network  allocates funds from the reserve to help medical centers cover unmet  expenses during the year. In fiscal year 2002, the network allocated  reserve funds to medical centers for these purposes and distributed about  half of the reserve fund to the Lexington medical center because of its  higher than average costs in pharmacy, radiology, and laboratory  expenses.

The two primary reasons  for the $22 million increase were the consolidation of information  technology and staffing expenditures. Information technology  expenditures accounted for the largest increase in expenditures made by  the network office. This increase occurred, in part, because the network  assumed the cost of contracts for software licenses and information  technology services for which medical centers had once been responsible,  according to network officials. Instead of having each medical center  contract for information technology services individually, the network  took responsibility for these contracts to consolidate and negotiate lower  costs.

(See table  4.)", "Staff expenditures accounted for the second largest increase in  expenditures made by the network office and accounted for $8 million by  fiscal year 2002. Most of the increase in network office staff resulted  because of growth in Mid South Customer Accounts Center (MCAC)  staffing. (See table 5.) This growth occurred because the network  consolidated staff positions formerly located at medical centers for  medical insurance collections and claims processing at a central location  and also added additional staff for this purpose. To establish this  operation in fiscal year 1998, the network transferred 57 positions from the  medical centers to MCAC. By fiscal year 2002, the network had added  another 30 MCAC staff positions. MCAC staff expenditures in fiscal year  2002 were about $5 million. The MCAC operation is based at TVHS\u2019s  Murfreesboro location. Network officials told us they consolidated this  operation to increase efficiency and improve oversight of collections and  claims processing. From fiscal years 1997 through 2002, collections for  third-party insurance payments and copayments increased from  $28 million to about $67 million.", "Staff expenditures by the network office also increased because of growth  in positions mandated by VA headquarters and additional staff positions  that network management said would improve operations. These staff  positions accounted for about $3 million in staff expenditures in fiscal year  2002. The network office added 5 positions from fiscal years 1997 through  2002 that were mandated by VA headquarters for all network offices to  improve operations VA wide. These staff positions included a patient  safety officer and a compliance officer. In addition, the network created 12  other network staff positions from fiscal years 1997 to 2002 that  management expected to improve operations. For example, the network  created a pharmacy benefits manager position to manage the network\u2019s  pharmaceutical budget, which, according to network officials, has brought  down the increase in pharmaceutical costs for the entire network, and a  Decision Support System (DSS) manager to oversee DSS activities.

Each network medical center was identified in the VA  allocation system with a unique three-digit station number; however, TVHS  and the network office shared the same station number, and as such, the  VA allocation system combined their allotment data. To separate the TVHS  and network office transactions, we obtained the fiscal year 2002 network  office financial transfer report from TVHS. We separated each transaction  on the combined network/TVHS allotment report, which allowed us to  construct an allotment report for TVHS.
