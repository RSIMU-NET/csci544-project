We also found that the roles and responsibilities of  participants are generally clarified in writing in cases where there is an  interagency agreement between the bureau and implementing U.S.  government agency partners on a particular program. For example,  such agreements outline the roles and responsibilities of the  requesting agency and the servicing agency.", "When referring to assessing the performance of counterterrorism  programming, officials from both within State and other U.S.  government agencies said that they were clear on whose  responsibility it was to monitor and evaluate CVE and CTF  programming activities. State and other agency officials understood  that the CT Bureau would be responsible for ensuring evaluations of  counterterrorism programs are conducted; however, the monitoring  and reporting of the outcomes of CT Bureau\u2013funded programs would  be the responsibility of the implementing U.S. government agency  partner of that program, or the recipient of the funding.", "Resources.", "According to information provided by the CT Bureau, it  had provided funding for CVE or CTF programming activities to most  of the agencies with which we spoke. The program funding for these  activities came from the Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and  Related Programs and Economic Support Fund funding accounts.  According to information from the CT Bureau, from fiscal year 2011 to  fiscal year 2014, it obligated over $11 million to agencies we spoke  with for CVE programming and over $43 million to agencies we spoke  with for CTF programming using interagency agreements or transfers.", "We found that, in cases where the CT Bureau funded U.S.  government agencies on CVE or CTF programming, the funding  mechanism was clear and laid out in the interagency agreements.", "Some agency officials told us that these agreements provide the  vehicle whereby funding can be obligated from the CT Bureau to their  agencies using a standard process. For example, Department of  Homeland Security officials said that they have worked with the CT  Bureau when receiving funding for cross-border financial training to be  carried out in various countries and that the funding mechanism was  clear. USAID officials stated that while USAID does not have  interagency agreements with the CT Bureau, funding from the bureau  for the CVE programs and activities that USAID administers comes  through standard interagency transfers.", "Written guidance and agreements.", "We found that many of the  U.S. government agencies we spoke with had formal interagency  agreements with the CT Bureau on CVE- and CTF-related  programming or activities. The interagency agreements described,  among other things, the service to be provided, roles and  responsibilities of each party, method and frequency of performance  reporting, and accounting information for funding of the service  provided. The interagency agreements we reviewed covered a  multiyear agreement period. For example, the CT Bureau has an  agreement with the Department of Justice Office of Overseas  Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training on funding a  Resident Legal Advisor in Panama who works with the host country  government to enhance the capacity of criminal justice actors and  institutions to handle financial crimes involving money laundering and  terrorist finance. The interagency agreement in place covers funding  for the period of 2014 through 2019. According to CT Bureau officials,  as the scope or activities of the CT Bureau\u2013funded programming  changes, the interagency agreements can be modified. In addition,  the CT Bureau and the Department of Justice have an interagency  agreement on development of community police training in  Bangladesh.", "We found that many of the State bureaus we spoke with that  coordinate with the CT Bureau on CVE and CTF programs did not  have any written agreements, such as memorandums of  understanding or written guidance laying out the terms of the  collaboration.

The CT Bureau recently has undertaken steps to  address long-standing staffing gaps and it has placed a priority on efforts  to counter violent extremism, among other things, since being elevated to  a bureau in fiscal year 2012. Although the bureau has completed some  program evaluations, it has yet to evaluate its past or current CVE efforts,  an action that could help it make more informed decisions about  programmatic efforts to counter violent extremism abroad. Also, while the  CT Bureau has completed four program evaluations, resulting in 60  recommendations to improve its programs, it has implemented only about  half of those recommendations and has not established time frames for  addressing the remaining recommendations.

We received data on the total authorized full-time  equivalent (FTE) positions, total established positions, and the total on- board positions for those fiscal years. State\u2019s Office of the Executive  Secretariat provided the FTE staffing data for fiscal years 2011 and 2012,  and the CT Bureau, specifically the Executive Office, provided the FTE  and other staffing data for fiscal years 2013 to 2015. To assess the  reliability of the staffing data, we compared and corroborated information  provided by State with staffing information in the Congressional Budget  Justifications for the fiscal years as well as spoke to State officials  regarding the processes they use to collect and verify the staffing data.  On the basis of the checks we performed, we determined these data to  be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To determine how  the CT Bureau\u2019s mission, organizational structure, and funding resources  may have changed since 2011, we reviewed and analyzed State and CT  Bureau documents pertaining to the mission, organization of the bureau,  staffing, funding, and foreign assistance program allocations. We also  interviewed State officials from the CT Bureau; Office of Inspector  General; Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources; and the Bureaus  of Human Resources, Comptroller and Global Financial Services,  Budgeting and Planning, and Administration. Specifically, for the mission  statement, we reviewed the CT Bureau\u2019s mission statement from 2011  and also from 2015, both reflected in bureau documents and on the  bureau\u2019s website, to ascertain what changes, if any, there have been to  the bureau\u2019s mission. We discussed with CT Bureau officials any changes  to the bureau\u2019s mission over time. To determine changes in the CT  Bureau\u2019s organizational structure, we reviewed the organizational chart of  the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism (CT Office) from 2011  as well as organizational charts of the CT Bureau covering 2012 through  2015. We also spoke to officials representing every directorate and most  offices that had been established within the CT Bureau to understand  their roles and responsibilities and any impact that the bureau\u2019s strategic  review and reorganization has had on their portfolios. To depict changes  in resources, we reviewed data on the CT Bureau\u2019s operations allocations  and obligations from 2011 to 2015 as well as foreign assistance  allocations that the bureau has received over the same time period. The  allocations and obligations for the bureau\u2019s operations were provided by  the CT Bureau, while the allocations for the foreign assistance programs  were provided by State\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources.  We depicted the allocated funding information based on the funding  accounts as well as the foreign assistance programs they cover. To  assess the reliability of the funding and allocations data, we spoke to  State officials regarding the processes they use to collect and verify the  data. On the basis of the checks we performed, we determined these  data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To examine the extent to which the CT Bureau has assessed its  performance since 2011, we reviewed bureau strategic plans,  performance reports, program evaluation reports, and action plans for  evaluation recommendations, as well as State policy and guidance  documents outlining performance reporting and evaluation requirements  for bureaus. Specifically, to examine the CT Bureau\u2019s performance  reporting efforts, we reviewed the bureau\u2019s multiyear strategic plans and  performance reports to determine whether the bureau had established  performance measures for its foreign assistance\u2013related goals and used  established performance measures to assess the bureau\u2019s progress  toward achieving its goals, as required by State policy. While we reviewed documentation on the CT Bureau\u2019s performance measures, and  discussed the CT Bureau\u2019s performance reporting efforts with cognizant  State officials, we did not fully assess the reliability of these measures  because our goal was to determine whether the bureau had established  performance measures rather than describe the bureau\u2019s actual  performance. We are publishing the performance results the CT Bureau  reported to provide context and additional support for our finding that the  bureau has assessed its performance. To examine the CT Bureau\u2019s  program evaluation efforts, we reviewed evaluation reports and compared  the number of evaluations the bureau completed against the number of  evaluations required by State\u2019s February 2012 evaluation policy. We also  compared the bureau\u2019s efforts to track and address recommendations  from evaluations against internal control standards for the federal  government and State\u2019s January 2015 evaluation guidance, which  provides specific criteria and guidelines for evaluating State programs. In  addition, we interviewed or obtained written responses from officials from  State\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources and Bureau of  Budget and Planning to clarify State\u2019s performance reporting and  evaluation requirements for bureaus and whether the CT Bureau had met  the requirements. We also interviewed CT Bureau officials responsible for  strategic planning and program monitoring and evaluation to obtain  additional or clarifying information related to past or currently planned  bureau efforts on performance reporting and evaluations.", "To examine the extent to which the CT Bureau\u2019s coordination within State  and other U.S. government entities on selected programs is in line with  key collaboration practices and collaboration features, we reviewed  agency documents and interviewed officials from various State regional  and functional bureaus and other U.S. government agencies.

We  also spoke with officials from the Departments of Defense, Homeland  Security, Justice, and the Treasury; United States Agency for  International Development; the National Counterterrorism Center; and the  United States Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C. We focused on  coordination on the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) and  Counterterrorism Finance (CTF) programs because these programs  involve coordination with large numbers of agencies and State entities  and also represent strategic priorities for the CT Bureau. We used GAO\u2019s  leading practices for implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms  to better understand the extent and nature of collaboration between the  CT Bureau and other bureaus within State and other U.S. government  agencies on CT Bureau programs and compared CT Bureau\u2019s  coordination efforts against these key collaboration practices. We  devised a standard set of questions that incorporated questions provided  in GAO\u2019s collaboration practices to ask State regional and functional  bureaus and U.S. government agencies. We focused on six of the key  collaboration practices: outcomes and accountability, bridging  organizational cultures, leadership, clarity of roles and responsibilities,  resources, and written guidance and agreements. We analyzed the  information provided by State and agency officials against these practices  to determine whether the collaboration between these entities and the CT  Bureau on CVE and CTF were generally consistent with these practices.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
