Federal agencies provided traditional federal support to the electric utility's restoration efforts. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided financial assistance through its Public Assistance Program, and the Department of Energy (DOE) provided subject matter expertise to assist the local utility. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) provided generators for hospitals and other critical facilities. FEMA obligated about $795 million for these efforts as of July 20, 2018. According to the local utility, it took about 5 months for power to be restored to all customers with structures deemed safe for power restoration.", "Puerto Rico. In addition to the traditional types of support, FEMA and USACE undertook unprecedented roles of helping to coordinate and directly assist with grid restoration in Puerto Rico. FEMA requested that USACE lead federal grid repair efforts because of the scale of the damage and because the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) did not have the capacity to respond, according to FEMA officials. FEMA obligated about $3.2 billion for electricity restoration efforts as of July 20, 2018, and PREPA estimated that it took roughly 11 months for power to be restored to all customers with structures deemed safe for power restoration.", "Various factors affected federal support for electricity grid restoration, according to officials GAO interviewed and documents reviewed. For example, getting the crews and materials needed to islands was more difficult and time-consuming than on the mainland. In Puerto Rico, PREPA was insolvent, which presented challenges for restoring the grid. For example, PREPA canceled its vegetation management program; this contributed to the destruction of the grid when the hurricane arrived, according to FEMA officials. In addition, FEMA did not anticipate or plan for the extensive federal role in grid restoration in Puerto Rico, and USACE did not have a contract in place to immediately initiate grid repair efforts, according to USACE officials. FEMA and USACE identified potential actions to address these challenges, such as reviewing advance contracts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria damaged much of the electricity  grids\u2019 transmission and distribution systems in Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands, leaving millions without power and resulting in the longest  blackout in U.S. history.

PREPA is a public power utility owned by the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and a monopoly supplier of electricity in  the commonwealth. It is also one of the nation\u2019s largest public power  utilities, serving approximately 1.5 million customers. PREPA was  approximately $9 billion in debt prior to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and  its electric power infrastructure was known to be in poor condition, largely  due to underinvestment and poor maintenance practices. In May 2018,  we found that inadequate management of PREPA\u2019s financial condition  contributed to Puerto Rico\u2019s persistent deficits. Specifically, PREPA did  not update or improve its electric generation and transmission systems,  which hampered their performance and led to increased costs of  producing electricity that it did not fully pass on to consumers. In addition,  Puerto Rico\u2019s economy is in a prolonged period of economic contraction,  and according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, its population declined  from a high of approximately 3.8 million people in 2004 to 3.3 million  people in 2017, a decline of 12.8 percent. Along with the declining  population, demand for electricity declined 18 percent from 2007 to 2017,  according to PREPA.", "Impact of 2017 hurricanes. Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September  2017 left Puerto Rico\u2019s entire electricity grid inoperable, according to the  economic and disaster recovery plan for Puerto Rico. According to a  report by a working group that included utilities and national laboratories,  among others, because of the extended and unprecedented damage, a  significant portion of the generation, transmission, and distribution system  must be rebuilt, including high-voltage transmission lines that often  survive lower category hurricanes. While Puerto Rico\u2019s population had  already been declining, the migration of people from Puerto Rico  accelerated following the hurricanes, according to PREPA.", "Status of electricity restoration. According to PREPA, it took roughly 11  months for power to be restored to all of the customers able to receive  power safely in Puerto Rico following the hurricanes. A PREPA official  told us that PREPA\u2019s estimates of customers with power restored are  based on the number of meters that it knows are served by a given power  line and on the number of meters it can read currently. Power has been  restored to 100 percent of customers that are able to receive power  safely, but this does not mean that all pre-storm customers have power  restored, as some structures may not have been deemed safe for power  restoration, according to PREPA officials.

The USVI  Hurricane Recovery and Resilience Task Force Report noted that  VIWAPA has a 17 percent non-payment rate across its customer base, a  significant unfunded pension liability, and long-term debt commitments of  $265 million. In addition, the report states that the U.S. Virgin Island\u2019s  energy system faces many challenges that have led to higher rates and a  historically unreliable grid. These include an aging, inefficient, and  oversized infrastructure and heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels. The  report also says that peak demand declined 18 percent from 2011  through 2017, driven by a variety of factors, including population decline.  In addition, the report says that VIWAPA\u2019s high energy rates and  reliability issues have led some customers\u2014 particularly larger  commercial and industrial ones\u2014to leave the grid.", "Impact of 2017 hurricanes. Hurricanes Irma and Maria damaged more  than 90 percent of VIWAPA\u2019s aboveground power lines and over 20  percent of VIWAPA\u2019s generation capacity, according to the USVI  Hurricane Recovery and Resilience Task Force Report. Specifically, the  hurricanes damaged more than 20,000 poles and 1,100 miles of  transmission and distribution lines, according to the report. Although 90  percent of VIWAPA\u2019s above ground power lines were damaged, this was  far fewer than the miles of transmission and distribution lines damaged in  Puerto Rico.", "Electricity status. According to VIWAPA, following the hurricanes, it took  roughly 5 months for power to be restored to all of the eligible customers  in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Eligible customers were those whose homes  were safely able to receive power. Some homes had suffered substantial  damage to their electrical infrastructure from the hurricanes and were not  able to receive power safely until their electrical equipment was repaired.  VIWAPA\u2019s estimates of customers with power restored are based on the  number of meters that VIWAPA knows are served by a given power line,  as VIWAPA\u2019s automated system for determining the percentage of  customers without power was destroyed and is still being restored,  according to a FEMA official.

FEMA officials said that the most common use for  Community Disaster Loan funds is payroll, and other examples of eligible  uses include employee benefits, facilities maintenance costs, and normal  operating materials.", "Coordination and technical assistance from DOE. DOE received  mission assignments from FEMA and deployed staff from its  headquarters, site offices, and power marketing administrations to  provide subject matter expertise and technical assistance in support of  electricity grid damage assessments and power restoration efforts in both  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to DOE officials,  DOE\u2019s primary role in the response efforts on Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands was coordination and provision of subject matter experts,  as is typical for DOE\u2019s role as the lead agency for the energy sector  emergency support function. In Puerto Rico, however, DOE provided  more advisors for a longer period of time than would be typical because  of the extent of the damage to the electricity grid in Puerto Rico and  PREPA\u2019s limited capacity to respond, according to DOE officials.  Specifically, DOE staffed up to 12 project support advisors to Puerto Rico  from October 18, 2017, to August 8, 2018, and one supply chain support  advisor from December 18, 2017, to March 16, 2018. These advisors  provided subject matter expertise to USACE by reviewing construction  plans and providing recommendations for prioritization, and scheduling  and assisting in inventory management for incoming electrical grid  equipment, among other things, according to DOE. In addition, in the U.S.  Virgin Islands DOE deployed a team of 36 people from the Western Area  Power Administration along with trucks and materials to help rebuild the  electricity grid through a FEMA mission assignment. DOE officials told  us that the department is also providing ongoing support on how to  improve grid resilience as part of grid restoration and recovery efforts in  both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "Temporary power from USACE. USACE provided temporary  emergency power for critical facilities in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands. These temporary emergency power missions provided and  maintained generators to deliver electricity to critical public facilities, such  as hospitals and relief centers. After receiving a FEMA mission  assignment to provide temporary emergency power in Puerto Rico,  USACE deployed its Emergency Power Planning and Response Team,  USACE government employees, soldiers from the 249th Engineer  Battalion, and contractors. USACE installed a record number of  emergency electric generators in Puerto Rico\u2014over 2,300\u2014through the  end of May 2018. The previous record was 310 emergency generators  installed in response to Hurricane Katrina. On May 17, 2018, FEMA  approved the extension of the USACE mission assignment for emergency  power to November 30, 2018. This extension permitted USACE to  continue its support for the more than 700 generators still in use  throughout Puerto Rico at that time. FEMA later extended the mission  assignment until April 8, 2019. As of December 11, 2018, USACE was  supporting 24 generators in Puerto Rico, seven of which were supporting  micro grids for the island municipalities of Vieques and Culebra. In the  U.S. Virgin Islands, USACE installed 180 generators as a part of its  temporary emergency power mission. USACE\u2019s temporary emergency  power mission for the U.S. Virgin Islands was completed in February  2018, and USACE is no longer supporting generators there.", "Unprecedented Roles by FEMA and USACE in Puerto Rico. In  addition to the typical roles federal agencies undertake in restoration  activities, FEMA and USACE undertook unprecedented roles in Puerto  Rico because of the severe and widespread impacts of Hurricane Maria  and PREPA\u2019s limited capacity. For the first time in its history, FEMA  undertook the role of helping to coordinate major electricity grid  restoration because PREPA did not have the necessary capability,  capacity, or structure to respond, according to FEMA officials. FEMA  officials also noted that PREPA\u2019s workers were not only engaged in  restoration work but were also victims dealing with the same post- hurricane effects as the rest of the population.", "As part of its response, FEMA mission assigned USACE to lead federal  efforts to repair Puerto Rico\u2019s electricity grid\u2014a role USACE had not  played in the past during a domestic disaster response. Specifically, on  September 30, 2017, the FEMA Administrator tasked USACE with  leading the planning, coordination, and integration of the grid restoration.  FEMA assigned USACE to lead federal efforts and provide direct support  for grid restoration because PREPA was overwhelmed and had liquidity  issues and USACE had the structures in place to award contracts with  and bring in grid restoration crews, according to FEMA officials. In order  to carry out its mission assignment, USACE issued contracts to bring  lineworkers and materials to Puerto Rico to support the reinstallation and  repair of transmission and distribution lines, among other power  restoration activities. As of June 30, 2018, USACE had obligated  approximately $1.5 billion on these contracts. Figure 2 shows USACE  and its contractors working to restore electricity in Puerto Rico. USACE\u2019s  grid restoration mission assignment from FEMA ended on May 18, 2018,  because, according to FEMA officials, power had been restored to  approximately 98 percent of customers and PREPA, with its remaining  contractors, had adequate capability to do the remaining work.", "In addition to the federal response, PREPA issued its own contracts to  bring in additional lineworkers, received assistance from the New York  State Utility Contingent, and requested and received mutual assistance  from other utilities. PREPA did not initially reach out for mutual  assistance. About 6 weeks following Hurricane Maria, on October 31,  2017, PREPA formally requested aid from other utilities on the mainland  through the American Public Power Association and the Edison Electric  Institute. The electric power industry sent two individuals to Puerto Rico  on November 3, 2017 and they began assessing storm damage and  working with PREPA, FEMA, USACE, and DOE officials to develop a  restoration plan. On November 22, 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico  appointed one of these individuals as Power Restoration Coordinator to  oversee the multipronged restoration effort. According to the Power  Restoration Coordinator, as a first step he worked to create an incident  command structure, and incident management teams began arriving in  December. Once the incident command structure was in place, the  industry deployed additional crews, equipment and materials in January  to accelerate the ongoing restoration efforts across the island. As  discussed previously, local utilities are typically responsible for restoring  service, with federal agencies providing financial and other support. In  contrast, approximately half of the lineworkers working to restore the  electricity grid in Puerto Rico were USACE or USACE contractors at the  peak of restoration efforts in February 2018, as shown in figure 3.", "FEMA established a unified command structure to coordinate efforts of  federal agencies, PREPA, PREPA\u2019s contractors, the New York State  Utility Contingent, and utilities providing mutual assistance to PREPA, to  help target priority work, ensure that crews could get to the work, and  identify needed materials.

Responding to disasters on islands presents  a number of logistical challenges. Specifically, according to federal  officials, getting the crews, equipment, and materials needed to  support restoration efforts to an island was more difficult and time- consuming than doing so on the mainland. This includes  prepositioning assets, such as generators, and delivering equipment  and materials in advance of a storm. The difficulties were greater in  the days following the hurricanes since neither the ports nor the  airports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands had power, which  prevented the delivery of materials to the islands. In Puerto Rico, the  Port of San Juan reopened for daylight operations 3 days after  Hurricane Maria made landfall; every airport and seaport had limited  capacity after reopening for approximately 7 days post-landfall,  according to FEMA\u2019s 2017 Hurricane Season After-Action Report.  Federal officials in the U.S. Virgin Islands told us that they faced  further delays locating key supplies because of inadequate labelling of  shipping containers at the port. For example, some containers were  marked only as disaster supply equipment, which did not sufficiently  identify the contents within them. According to USACE\u2019s 2018  Remedial Action Program Senior Leader Briefing, USACE lacked the  expertise and capabilities to manage the large operational logistics  requirements to support the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands  response.", "Availability of materials. The sequence of three hurricanes making  landfall in the United States in 2017 and the need to restore electricity  service in Texas, Florida, and elsewhere, in addition to Puerto Rico  and the U.S. Virgin Islands, complicated the restoration effort in the  two territories. Since utilities in all affected areas were acquiring  materials to restore electricity service, demand for these materials  increased and available supplies were generally low; in some  instances materials were only available as they were manufactured.  Few, if any, materials were stockpiled locally on Puerto Rico. In  addition, some of the equipment used in Puerto Rico was not  standard in the continental United States and required ordering of  specialized materials, resulting in delays in the restoration process.  The U.S. Virgin Islands also faced supply issues, which became  worse once grid recovery work in Puerto Rico began.", "Financial condition of local utilities and poor condition of  existing infrastructure. Electric utilities in both Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands were insolvent, which led to a lack of maintenance  and presented its own challenges for restoring the grids after the  storms. Specifically, PREPA was approximately $9 billion in debt  before the 2017 hurricane season, with annual costs that exceeded its  revenues. Puerto Rico\u2019s electric power infrastructure was in poor  condition before the 2017 hurricane season largely because of  PREPA\u2019s underinvestment and poor maintenance practices. For  example, PREPA canceled its vegetation management program  because of its financial situation; this contributed to the destruction of  transmission and distribution lines when the hurricane arrived,  according to FEMA officials.", "Similarly, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, financial challenges contributed to  the extent of the damage to grid infrastructure. Specifically, VIWAPA  officials told us that VIWAPA\u2019s financial challenges prevented certain  infrastructure improvements and a large proportion of the electricity  poles were at or above their weight capacity, increasing the likelihood  and extent of wind damage during the hurricanes. According to  VIWAPA officials, VIWAPA was aware that there were too many lines  and heavy transformers on old poles, but was not in a position to  address this concern prior to the hurricanes.", "Extensive and unprecedented role of federal agencies. FEMA did  not anticipate or plan for the extensive role that it and USACE played  in grid restoration in Puerto Rico. According to FEMA\u2019s after action  report for the 2017 hurricane season, FEMA\u2019s planning assumptions  for a hurricane, earthquake, or tsunami striking Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands underestimated the actual requirements. As  discussed above, prior to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, USACE had  never worked on a large-scale power restoration as part of a domestic  disaster response and did not have expertise in this area, according to  USACE officials. This affected grid restoration efforts. For example,  USACE did not have a grid restoration contract in place to  immediately initiate grid repair efforts, according to USACE officials.  Rather, USACE issued an order off of a pre-existing contract that it  had under its public works and engineering support function to bring  electric utility lineworkers to Puerto Rico. According to USACE  officials, a bid protest against one of USACE\u2019s contracts delayed its  ability to increase the contract to bring more lineworkers to Puerto  Rico. In addition, the contract review and approval process USACE  used to obtain supplies took longer than it would typically take utilities  to get supplies, according to FEMA officials we interviewed.  According to USACE officials, USACE followed federal acquisition  regulations, which is a slow process compared to private party  purchases. USACE officials said that USACE is considering looking at  what would be needed to create an advance grid restoration contract.", "FEMA, USACE, and DOE identified potential actions to address these  challenges. According to its after action report, FEMA plans to establish a  standing interagency Power Task Force to coordinate with DOE, USACE,  and state and local governments and provide crisis planning for the  energy sector emergency support function to support the restoration of  power during future national response efforts. USACE\u2019s 2018 Remedial  Action Program Senior Leader Briefing made recommendations to  improve contingency contracting and operational logistics, among other  things. Specifically, recommendations included that USACE review  existing and planned advance contracts and make adjustments as  necessary to increase capacity and improve capabilities, and that USACE  work with FEMA to convene an interagency logistics planning team and  identify logistics contracting gaps and propose government and private  sector solutions. DOE\u2019s after action report for the 2017 hurricane season  says that the lessons learned from the response to Hurricane Maria may  prompt some programmatic improvements to the energy sector  emergency support function roles and responsibilities related to island  response, among other potential improvements. In addition, the report  states that because of the extensive damage to grid infrastructure and the  length of the restoration and recovery, there is an increasing need to  incorporate resilience and hardening into restoration, recovery, and  mitigation planning and execution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense (DOD),  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), DOE, and the governments  of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for review and comment.

In Puerto Rico, agencies took unprecedented direct roles in grid restoration efforts.
