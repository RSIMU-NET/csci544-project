In continuing these efforts, in 1948 the Armed Forces Sports  Program, originally named the Inter-service Sports Council, was  established. In 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued DOD  Instruction 1330.04, which states that the Armed Forces Sports Program  includes actions such as training or national qualifying events in  preparation for servicemember participation in International Military  Sports Council events, the Pan American, Olympic, and Paralympic  Games, and other international competitions.

Federal internal control standards state, among  other things, that managers should establish activities to monitor  performance measures. Furthermore, our prior work on performance  measurement identified ten key attributes of performance measures, such  as clarity, objectivity, having a measurable target, and having baseline  and trend data in order to identify, monitor, and report changes in  performance and to help ensure that performance is viewed in context.  Table 8 identifies each attribute of effective performance measures along  with its definition.", "Sports Council Secretariat officials stated that they use data on the  number of servicemembers and services annually participating in each  sport and competition to measure the performance and effectiveness of  the Armed Forces Sports Program. While these data provide important  context about the program\u2019s size and reach, they are outputs and do not  constitute performance measures because they do not exhibit several of  the key attributes previously discussed.", "First, we found that the Sports Council Secretariat\u2019s use of participation  data does not exhibit the attribute of linkage in that there is not clear  alignment between the number of participants and how it affects the  program\u2019s ability to achieve its goals and mission. For example, while  DOD Instruction 1330.04 does not specify goals or a mission, the Armed  Forces Sports Council\u2019s standard operating procedures identify that the  five objectives of the program are to:  (1) promote goodwill among the Armed Services through sports,  (2) promote a positive image of the Armed Forces through sports,  (3) provide the incentive and encourage physical fitness by promoting a  highly competitive sports program,  (4) provide a venue for military athletes to participate in national and  international competitions, and  (5) engage in valuable military-to-military opportunities with International  Military Sports Council member nations through sports.", "However, Sports Council Secretariat officials have not established a link  between the participant data that they stated are used to measure  program performance and the achievement of these objectives.", "Further, our prior work has shown that linkages between goals and  measures are most effective when they are clearly communicated and  create a \u201cline of sight\u201d so that everyone understands what an organization  is trying to achieve and the goals it seeks to reach. During meetings with  the Sports Council Secretariat, officials stated that they use data, such as  servicemember participation in the Armed Forces Sports Championships,  International Military Sports Council Championships, U.S. Nationals, and  the Olympic and Paralympic Games to measure the performance and  effectiveness of the Armed Forces Sports Program, and that they have  created performance measures on an as-needed basis when it has been  necessary to prioritize the allocation of funds for individual sports.  However, none of the documents we were provided on the program  identify participation or any other data as a performance measure, and  these efforts do not exhibit a deliberate, four-stage performance  measurement process that involves (1) identifying goals, (2) developing  performance measures, (3) collecting data, and (4) analyzing data and  reporting results. Further, servicemember participation in the Olympic  and Paralympic Games is not a valid performance measure because,  according to officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the  Sports Council Secretariat, and the services, the Armed Forces Sports  Program does not have responsibility for these games.", "Second, participation data do not exhibit the measurable target attribute  because they represent a summary of the program\u2019s activity and are not  associated with numerical goals, which are needed to gauge program  progress and results. Our prior work has shown that numerical targets or  other measurable values facilitate future assessments of whether overall  goals and objectives are achieved because comparisons can be easily  made between projected performance and actual results. While the  Sports Council Secretariat\u2019s data included the \u201cactual\u201d number of program  participants, they did not identify projected performance targets that  would enable program officials to determine how far they have  progressed toward a desired outcome or end state. In response to our  analysis, Sports Council Secretariat officials stated that they consider the  list of 24 sports and total number of competitions that servicemembers  may participate in to be the target\u2014the attainment of which is based on  variables such as available funding and the extent to which each service  agrees to provide teams to participate in the competitions.

Specifically, officials cited the program\u2019s  emphasis on a higher level of physical fitness than is otherwise required  by the services as contributing to individual servicemember readiness,  and involvement in national and international sports championships as  aiding recruiting efforts because it showcases some of the unique  opportunities open to those in the services. Further, officials stated that  the opportunity to participate in higher level competitions through the  program helps retention because it provides an incentive for some  servicemembers to stay in the services. However, outside of participation  and cost data and some anecdotal examples, officials did not have  specific measures for or data on the Armed Forces Sports Program\u2019s  contribution to the services\u2019 readiness, recruiting, and retention efforts.", "Third, while DOD has program participation data, it does not track  baseline and trend data in order to assess the program\u2019s performance  and progress over time. Our prior work has demonstrated that by tracking  and developing a performance baseline for all measures\u2014including those  that demonstrate the effectiveness of a program\u2014agencies can better  evaluate progress made and whether or not goals are being achieved.  Further, identifying and reporting deviations from the baseline as a  program proceeds provides valuable information for oversight by  identifying areas of program risk and their causes for decision makers.  According to Sports Council Secretariat officials, many of the program\u2019s  benefits\u2014such as helping with readiness, recruitment, and retention\u2014are  not measured, and commanding officers are responsible for determining  and managing the program\u2019s effect on the readiness of their units. Thus,  given the relatively small number of program participants and participation  being contingent on obtaining commanding officer approval, Sports  Council Secretariat officials stated that they do not believe that the  services\u2019 readiness is negatively affected by servicemembers  participating in the Armed Forces Sports Program.", "We acknowledge that the measurement of the program\u2019s performance  may be difficult, but DOD\u2019s participation data do not include targets  allowing program performance to be measured and do not assess the  intended benefits of the program.

Specifically, DOD said that it will explore the  development and implementation of performance outcome measures for  the Armed Forces Sports Program and that it will review Department of  Defense Instruction 1330.04 for potential opportunities to incorporate  appropriate guidance regarding performance measures for the Armed  Forces Sports Program. However, DOD stated that there are limitations  on establishing metrics for several of the program\u2019s objectives, such as  goodwill and positive image, which are challenging to measure. Further,  DOD said that quantifying outcomes for some objectives, such as the  \u201cspirit\u201d of the program, also will be challenging, but that the lack of a  performance measurement does not negate the importance of pursuing  objectives that contribute to demonstrating the program\u2019s overall  effectiveness. In our report, we acknowledged that measurement of the  program\u2019s performance may be difficult but also necessary to produce the  evidence-based support that is needed to objectively demonstrate how  the specific activities that comprise a program are contributing to its  effectiveness. Exploring the development and implementation of  performance measures and reviewing DOD guidance regarding  performance measures are positive steps, but we continue to believe that  DOD needs to develop and implement performance measures in order to  demonstrate if the Armed Forces Sports Program is being implemented  effectively. While it may be challenging to develop performance  measures, our prior work has demonstrated that even for highly complex  areas such as DOD\u2019s reform of its medical health system and prevention  of sexual assault, developing and implementing performance measures  can be done, and if implemented correctly, can enhance decision-making.
