Section 8 pays the difference between a unit's rent and the household's payment (generally 30 percent of adjusted income). Section 8 includes a voucher program administered by public housing agencies (PHA) that allows eligible households to use vouchers to rent units in the private market and a project-based program administered by property owners who receive subsidies to rent specific units to eligible households. In both programs, contracts between HUD and the administrators specify the duration and amount of the subsidy. GAO assessed Section 8 trends from fiscal years 1998 through 2004 and examined (1) annual budget authority and outlays for each program; (2) factors that have affected outlays; and (3) the estimated impact of factors, such as market rents, on the average rental subsidy per voucher household."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 1998 through 2004, annual budget authority for Section 8 grew from $9.4 billion to $19.3 billion (105 percent, or 82 percent after adjusting for inflation), while outlays grew from $14.8 billion to $22.2 billion (50 percent, or 33 percent after inflation adjustment). The steep rise in budget authority was partly due to the additional funding needed to cover the cost of renewing long-term contracts. GAO estimates that voucher outlays grew by 93 percent from 1998 through 2004 (71 percent after inflation adjustment), accounting for almost all of the growth in total Section 8 outlays. Estimated project-based outlays grew by 6 percent (and actually declined after inflation adjustment) over this period. GAO estimates that about 43 percent of the growth in voucher outlays from 1998 through 2004 stemmed from policy decisions that increased the number (from 1.6 million to 2.1 million) and use of vouchers, while over half of this growth was due to an increase in the average rental subsidy per household. For the project-based program, a modest increase in the average rental subsidy per household drove the growth in outlays but was partly offset by a reduction of 62,000 in the number of units. On the basis of statistical analysis of cost data, GAO estimates that growth in the average annual rental subsidy per voucher household from 1999 through 2004 is primarily explained by changes in market rents (about one-half of the growth), PHAs' decisions to increase the maximum subsidized rents (about one-quarter), and lagging growth in assisted household incomes (about 16 percent.) Household and neighborhood characteristics, while important cost determinants, did not vary enough to cause a substantial change in the average rental subsidy per household."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Annual appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD) Section 8 rental housing programs have grown  significantly in recent years, climbing to nearly $21 billion in 2006.  Authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (P.L.  93-383), as amended, Section 8 currently comprises the Housing Choice  Voucher (voucher) and project-based programs. While these programs are  the federal government\u2019s primary tool for making rental housing units  affordable to low-income households, they are not entitlements\u2014that is,  not all eligible households receive assistance. HUD and Congress have  recently supported changes to the voucher program designed to limit  further growth in appropriations without reducing the number of  households that receive assistance. However, analysis of factors driving the  growth in the budgetary costs of Section 8\u2014which could assist in such  efforts\u2014has been limited, in part because HUD has not separately reported  budget authority or outlays for each program.", "The voucher and project-based programs share the common mission of  making housing affordable to low-income households by paying subsidies  that make up the difference between a unit\u2019s rent and the household\u2019s  payment, which is generally 30 percent of monthly income after  adjustments. Despite their shared goals, the two programs operate  differently. The voucher program, administered by state and local public  housing agencies (PHA), provides vouchers that eligible households can  use to rent houses or apartments in the private market. The subsidies in the  voucher program are tied to the household, rather than to any particular  dwelling unit (i.e., they are tenant-based). In contrast to vouchers, the  project-based program is administered by property owners who have  agreed to rent specific dwelling units to eligible households. The subsidies  in the project-based program are tied to the rental unit rather than to any  specific tenant. Under both programs, the program administrators enter  into contracts with HUD that specify the number of vouchers or units  authorized to receive rental subsidies and the duration of the subsidy  payments. For the voucher program, PHAs have flexibility to determine the  maximum amount of rental subsidy they can pay for assisted households  within limits set by HUD. For example, HUD establishes \u201cfair market rents\u201d  for each geographic area, based on actual market rents for standard-quality  rental units, but PHAs may choose a \u201cpayment standard\u201d that is up to 10  percent lower or higher.", "Each year, Congress appropriates budget authority to cover the cost of  Section 8 contracts. HUD uses its budget authority to incur obligations  (e.g., enter into contracts) that result in expenditures, or outlays, of federal  funds. Unlike budget authority, outlays occur when payments are made and  thus reflect the programs\u2019 actual annual cost of providing rental assistance.  Originally, Section 8 contracts were written with 5- to 40-year terms, and  Congress appropriated all of the budget authority needed to cover the  projected costs of these contracts up front. Under this approach, further  appropriations were generally not needed; HUD could make outlays to  provide the subsidy in each year, using the budget authority already  appropriated, until the contract expired. However, for expiring contracts  that are renewed, appropriations of new budget authority are needed to  cover the renewed contract term. Today, contracts are renewed and funded  in 1-year increments for vouchers and either 1- or 5-year increments for the  project-based program.", "In response to your request, this report provides information on trends in  the size and the cost of the Section 8 programs from 1998 through 2004 (the  last year for which data were available at the time of our analysis).  Specifically, the report discusses (1) the annual numbers of vouchers in the  voucher program and units in the project-based program, (2) the annual  new budget authority and outlays for each program, and (3) the factors that have affected outlays. In addition, for the voucher program\u2014the larger of  the Section 8 programs and the focus of recent efforts to limit costs\u2014the  report discusses factors, such as changes in market rents, that have  affected the annual average rental subsidy cost per household.", "To determine the annual number of vouchers and project-based units and  the annual amounts of new budget authority and outlays for each program,  we obtained and analyzed data from HUD\u2019s budget office, annual budget  requests and other budget documents, and audited financial statements.  HUD\u2019s budget office was not able to report data on budget authority and  outlays for the voucher and project-based programs separately. We  estimated outlays using data from HUD\u2019s accounting systems, which  showed the rental assistance payments paid to PHAs and property owners  under each program from 1998 through 2004. Our report generally presents  budget authority and outlay amounts in nominal dollars; amounts adjusted  for inflation are shown in appendix IV. To identify the factors that have  affected outlays, we analyzed data on rents and household incomes from  HUD\u2019s administrative databases and reviewed reports by HUD,  Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and Congressional Research Service  (CRS). To assess the impact of different factors on the average rental  subsidy cost per household for the voucher program, we developed a  statistical model using data from HUD and the Census Bureau. Our model  allowed us to estimate the effect of each of several variables\u2014market  rents, household incomes, household and neighborhood characteristics,  and a measure of the relationship between program policies and market  rents\u2014on the average rental subsidy per voucher household while  controlling for the effects of other variables. Because data on certain  variables used in our statistical model were not available for 1998, our  analysis of average rental subsidy costs in the voucher program covers the  period from 1999 through 2004. We assessed the reliability of the data from  HUD\u2019s accounting systems and administrative databases by reviewing  related documentation and interviewing agency officials who work with  the systems. In addition, we performed internal checks to determine the  extent to which the data fields were populated and the reasonableness of  the values contained in the fields. We concluded that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To address all of the  objectives, we interviewed officials from HUD\u2019s Offices of the Chief  Financial Officer, Public and Indian Housing, Housing, and Policy  Development and Research. We also met with CBO and CRS officials and  representatives of various industry and research groups. We conducted our  work in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, Illinois, from April 2005 through  March 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Appendix I provides additional details on our scope and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the 1970s, the federal government made housing affordable to low-  and moderate-income households by subsidizing the production of  privately and government-owned properties with below-market interest  rate mortgages, direct loans, and other development subsidies. Under these  production programs, the rent subsidies were project based, and tenants  received assistance only while living in the subsidized units. In the early  1970s, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of these programs:  Many moderate-income tenants benefited from federal assistance, while  lower-income families did not; federal costs for producing the housing  exceeded the private sector costs to produce the same services; and  allegations of waste surfaced. Interest in a more cost-effective approach  led Congress to explore options for using existing housing to shelter  low-income tenants. Section 8 of the Housing and Community  Development Act of 1974, as amended, authorized programs that reflected  both approaches\u2014a tenant-based rental certificate program (now called  the voucher program) for use in existing housing and a project-based  program. The project-based program comprises multiple subprograms,  including Section 8 New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation, Loan  Management Set-Aside, and Property Disposition. Appendix III contains  detailed descriptions of these subprograms.", "The voucher program provides vouchers to eligible households to rent  houses or apartments in the private market from landlords who are willing  to accept the vouchers. Voucher holders are responsible for finding  suitable housing that complies with HUD\u2019s housing quality standards. The  voucher program pays the difference between the lesser of the unit\u2019s gross  rent or a local \u201cpayment standard,\u201d and the household\u2019s payment, which is  generally 30 percent of monthly income, after certain adjustments. To be  eligible to apply for assistance, households must have very low  incomes\u2014less than or equal to 50 percent of area median income (AMI) as  determined by HUD. Under the provisions of the Quality Housing and Work  Responsibility Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-276), at least 75 percent of new  participants in the voucher program must be households with extremely  low incomes\u2014at or below 30 percent of AMI. Households already  participating in the voucher program remain eligible for assistance as long  as their incomes do not rise above 80 percent of AMI. The voucher program  is administered by over 2,500 state and local PHAs that are responsible for  inspecting dwelling units, ensuring that rents are reasonable, determining  households\u2019 eligibility, calculating households\u2019 payments, and making  payments to landlords. HUD provides funding to PHAs for administrative  expenses as well as rental subsidies.", "The project-based program subsidizes rents at properties whose owners  have entered into contracts with HUD to make rents affordable to  low-income households. Often these properties were financed with  mortgages insured or subsidized by HUD or with bonds issued by state and  local housing finance agencies. Property owners and managers are  responsible for administering the program at about 22,000 properties  nationwide. The project-based program operates much like the voucher  program, paying the difference between a HUD-approved unit rent and the  household\u2019s payment, which is generally equal to 30 percent of adjusted  monthly income. In general, only households with low incomes (i.e., at or  below 80 percent of AMI) are eligible for assistance, and since 1998 at least  40 percent of new residents must have extremely low incomes. Private  property owners and managers have requirements similar to those for  PHAs for administering the project-based program\u2014they must ensure that  households meet program eligibility requirements and must calculate  households\u2019 payments. HUD pays rent subsidies directly to the property  owners but does not pay them a separate administrative fee, as the owners\u2019  administrative costs are reflected in the HUD-approved rents. However,  because of limited staff resources and the large number of project-based  Section 8 contracts, HUD pays contract administrators (state and local  PHAs) administrative fees to oversee most of the contracts, a task that  requires processing monthly payment vouchers, reviewing property  owners\u2019 tenant information files, and addressing health and safety issues.", "Each year, Congress appropriates budget authority to cover the costs of  new Section 8 contracts, renewals of expiring contracts, amendments to  existing project-based contracts, and administrative fees. For the period  covered by our review (1998 through 2004), Congress appropriated funds  for the Section 8 programs in HUD\u2019s Housing Certificate Fund account.  Over time, Congress has changed the way it funds the Section 8 programs.  From 1974 to 1983, Congress made large up-front appropriations to cover  the projected costs of multiyear Section 8 contracts. Initially, voucher  contracts were written for 5 years and were renewable, at HUD\u2019s  discretion, for up to 15 years, while the terms for project-based contracts  ranged from 15 to 40 years. When these initial contracts began to expire in  1989, HUD required new budget authority to renew them. Owing to budget  constraints, Congress funded Section 8 contracts with amounts that led to  shorter contract terms. HUD initially renewed expiring contracts generally  for 5-year terms but starting in the mid-1990s switched to 1-year terms for  the voucher program and either 1- or 5-year terms for the project-based  program.", "The Section 8 programs are not entitlements, and as a result, the amount of  budget authority HUD requests and Congress provides through the annual  appropriations process limits the number of households that Section 8 can  assist. Historically, appropriations for the Section 8 programs (as well as  for other federal housing programs) have not been sufficient to assist all  households that HUD has identified as having housing needs\u2014that is,  households with very low incomes that pay more than 30 percent of their  income for housing, live in substandard housing, or both. According to  HUD data for calendar year 2003, Section 8 and other federal housing  programs assisted an estimated 4.3 million households, or 27 percent of all  renter households with very low incomes (see fig. 1). HUD estimated that  over 9 million very low income households (about 59 percent) did not  receive assistance and had housing needs. Of these 9 million households  with housing needs, over 5 million had what HUD terms \u201cworst case\u201d  needs\u2014that is, they paid over half of their income in rent, lived in severely  substandard housing, or both."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increases in the Number of Vouchers Drove Growth in the Size of Section 8 from 1998 through 2004", "paragraphs": ["The combined number of authorized vouchers and project-based units  grew from about 2.93 million to 3.36 million from 1998 through 2004\u2014an  overall increase of about 15 percent and an average annual increase of  about 2 percent (see fig. 2). Most of this increase occurred from 1998 to  2001, when about 327,000 vouchers were added.

Incremental vouchers are those  that resulted from Congress\u2019 decision to expand the program to serve more  households. Notices published in the Federal Register and HUD data  indicate that the agency awarded 276,981 incremental vouchers and  205,853 tenant protection vouchers from 1998 through 2004 (see table 1).", "Incremental vouchers consist of three major types: fair share,  welfare-to-work, and special purpose. Fair share vouchers are those that  HUD allocates to PHAs on a competitive basis using a formula that  accounts for poverty rates, renter populations, vacancies, overcrowding,  and other measures, in each county and independent city throughout the  country. Welfare-to-work vouchers are designated for households for which  a lack of stable, affordable housing is a barrier to employment and that are  making the transition to economic self-sufficiency. Finally, special  purpose vouchers include those designated for a variety of special needs  populations, such as persons with disabilities. Fair share vouchers  accounted for about 56 percent of the total, while welfare-to-work and  special purpose vouchers represented 18 percent and 26 percent,  respectively.", "From 1998 through 2002, Congress provided new funding each year for a  large number of incremental vouchers to help address the unmet housing  needs of very low-income households, and fair share vouchers were the  key type of incremental vouchers used to increase the number of assisted  households.

By 2004, however, no new funding was provided  for any type of incremental voucher.", "Unlike incremental vouchers, tenant protection vouchers do not add to the  total number of authorized units under Section 8 (and other HUD programs  for which they are used) because they replace one form of HUD assistance  with another. Tenant protection vouchers are offered to eligible households  that had received housing assistance under various HUD programs  (including the project-based program, certain HUD mortgage insurance  programs, and public housing) before the assistance was terminated. As  part of its annual budget request, HUD estimates the number of tenant  protection vouchers it will need and the amount of funding required for  these vouchers.

Owners may  choose not to renew their contracts and to opt out of the program for a  variety of reasons, including plans to convert the properties to market-rate  rental units. HUD may decide not to renew some contracts if property  owners have not complied with program requirements, such as maintaining  the property in decent, safe, and sanitary condition.", "If a property owner or HUD decides not to renew a project-based Section 8  contract, the property is no longer required to comply with program rules,  including affordability requirements. To protect Section 8 households from  rent increases that may result when owners opt out of their contracts, HUD  provides a special type of tenant protection voucher known as an enhanced  voucher. Enhanced vouchers are designed to ensure that tenants can afford  to remain in the properties that are no longer receiving project-based  Section 8 assistance\u2014even if the rents for these units exceed those for the  regular voucher program (such vouchers are considered enhanced because  they allow these higher subsidies).

Beginning with its 2006  budget, HUD has provided separate information for each program.", "The substantial growth in new budget authority stemmed primarily from  decisions to renew expiring long-term Section 8 contracts. From 1974 to  1983, Congress made large up-front appropriations to cover the projected  costs of multiyear Section 8 contracts that were written in those years.  Because Congress and HUD funded these long-term contracts up front,  they generally did not require new budget authority during the years  specified in the contracts. During the early to mid-1990s, large numbers of  these long-term contracts reached the end of their terms. Decisions to  renew the contracts created the need for new budget authority. As figure 4  shows, the trend in the numbers of expiring contracts continued from 1998  through 2004. Specifically, the number of project-based units with expiring  contracts that were renewed grew significantly\u2014by 373,310 units from  1998 through 2004. (As noted previously, because some project-based  contracts were not renewed, the total number of authorized project-based  units declined during this period\u2014even as the number needing new budget  authority grew.) Additional new budget authority was required each year to  cover the renewal of 818,095 vouchers from 1998 through 2004.", "A factor also contributing to the need for new budget authority was a  declining amount of \u201ccarryover\u201d budget authority. Carryover consists of  unobligated budget authority (not yet committed to specific contracts),  including funds that have been \u201crecovered\u201d (de-obligated from expired  contracts that did not need all of the budget authority that had been  obligated for them). Congress may rescind any portion of such unused  budget authority and in fact enacted rescissions in the Section 8 program  during each of the years we examined. Total budget authority available to  renew Section 8 contracts in any year thus consists of both the carryover,  net of rescissions, as well as new budget authority, and represents all of the  funds available to HUD for future obligations and outlays.", "Typically, HUD has had large amounts of carryover funds in the Section 8  programs, and these carryover funds have helped offset the need for new  budget authority. However, as shown in figure 5, the carryover amounts  generally declined during the period we examined. For example, about $7.5  billion in carryover funds in 1998 lessened the need for new appropriations  of budget authority in that year, whereas the decline in carryover funds in  later years increased the need for new appropriations. Partly because of  declining carryover amounts during this period, total available budget  authority grew at a slower rate than new budget authority. More  specifically, total available budget authority grew from $14.0 billion to $20.9  billion over this period (fig. 5), an average annual rate of about 7 percent.

This trend,  coupled with a rise in the percentage of authorized vouchers in use (the  utilization rate) that started in 2001, increased the number of assisted  households and, in turn, the amount of outlays for vouchers. We estimate  that about $3.0 billion (43 percent) of the increase in voucher outlays from  1998 through 2004 was attributable to the additional assisted households  resulting from the authorization of new vouchers and higher utilization  rates (table 2).", "Certain policy changes were designed to increase average voucher  utilization rates. For example, starting in 2002, PHAs that applied for fair  share vouchers had to maintain utilization rates of at least 97 percent to be  eligible to receive them. Also, according to HUD, Congress\u2019 decision in  2003 to limit the funding basis for voucher contracts to only vouchers that  were actually in use effectively encouraged PHAs to increase their  utilization rates in order to receive more funding.", "Using the average annual household subsidy in 2004 for the project-based  program ($5,948), we estimate that the decline of about 62,000 units  reduced project-based outlays by roughly $367 million (see table 2).  However, this decrease was more than offset by the other factors, leading  to an overall increase of $419 million.", "Although the decline in the number of project-based units caused outlays  for the project-based program to be less than they would have been  otherwise, its effect on total Section 8 outlays was offset to a large degree  by the issuance of tenant protection vouchers to households displaced  from their project-based units. As noted previously, under the  project-based program (or other HUD programs), tenants in units receiving  assistance that is terminated (e.g., because the unit owner decides not to  renew an expiring contract) may face higher rental payments. To protect  these tenants from potentially unaffordable rent increases and continue  providing assistance, Congress made tenant protection vouchers available.  In effect, outlays from the project-based program were shifted to the  voucher program, although not on a one-for-one basis because the per  household subsidy costs were different for project-based units and  vouchers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increases in the Average Rental Subsidy per Household Contributed to Higher Outlays for Both Programs", "paragraphs": ["Increases in the average rental subsidy per household also contributed to  the growth in outlays for the voucher and project-based programs,  although the average subsidy increased more for vouchers than for  project-based programs.

The high rate of growth in 2002 and 2003 coincided with the largest  yearly increases in voucher outlays (see fig. 6). For 2004, the annual rate of  increase slowed to over 2 percent after several years of substantial growth.  The growth in the number of enhanced vouchers, which, as previously  noted, allows for higher subsidies, may have contributed to the overall  increase.

The annual rate of increase in average per  household subsidy did not exceed 1 percent from 1998 through 2001 and  remained at less than 4 percent from 2002 through 2004.

Before 2003, Congress  appropriated budget authority using a unit-based approach that covered all  vouchers authorized in each contract, whether or not all of the vouchers  had been utilized. Concerned that appropriations were exceeding actual  program needs, Congress changed the formula for funding voucher  contracts to a dollar-based approach, basing it on actual expenditures from  the previous year plus an inflation factor. In addition, Congress authorized  a contingency fund to cover increases in rental costs in excess of the  inflation factor.", "In HUD\u2019s 2004 budget, Congress authorized the creation of a Quality  Assurance Division within HUD to provide more oversight of the  administration and cost of the voucher program. A key part of this effort  involves monitoring and verifying program costs reported by PHAs. The  division also audits PHAs\u2019 program records to ensure that voucher costs  were reported accurately and monitors local rental market trends to  determine whether HUD\u2019s FMRs were set too high or too low.

For example, Congress made further changes to the  voucher\u2019s dollar-based formula in 2005 that eliminated all contingency  funding, so that PHAs were expected to absorb all additional cost increases  during the year. To help PHAs keep their costs within their funding levels,  HUD issued guidance in 2005 concerning options PHAs could exercise to  limit costs. These options included the following.", "Reduce payments standards: Because PHAs may set their own payment  standards\u2014that is, the maximum rent that can be used to calculate  rental subsidies\u2014anywhere between 90 and 110 percent of the FMR for  their area, reducing payment standards allow PHAs to limit growth in  rental subsidy payments.", "Ensure reasonable rents: Statute and HUD regulations require PHAs to  compare rents for voucher units to those for comparable unassisted  units and reduce rents for voucher units if warranted. To ensure that  rents are reasonable, PHAs can conduct more frequent reviews of rents  charged by landlords. Any rent reductions would reduce the rental  subsidy payments that PHAs make.", "Deny moves within and outside PHA jurisdiction: The voucher  program allows households to move anywhere within and outside of a  PHA\u2019s jurisdiction.

To limit costs, PHAs can choose not to reissue  turnover vouchers or pull back outstanding vouchers for other  unassisted households searching for housing. PHAs can also terminate  assistance if they determine that the funding provided by HUD is  insufficient, although according to HUD, the department is not aware of  any instance in which a PHA has terminated voucher assistance.", "Set higher minimum rents: HUD policy allows PHAs to set a minimum  rent for households that can range from as low as $0 to as high as $50.  Some PHAs currently allow certain households with very little income  to pay rents that are below the minimum rent ceiling (i.e., less than $50).

In 1997, Congress passed the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform  and Affordability Act, which established the Mark-to-Market program.  When properties entered the project-based program in the late 1970s  through the mid-1980s, HUD often subsidized rents that were above local  market levels to compensate for high construction costs and  program-related administrative expenses. Thereafter, these rents were  adjusted annually using an operating cost factor determined by HUD. In the  early 1990s, HUD concluded that the continued growth in subsidy levels  would be unsupportable within HUD\u2019s budget limitations. The  Mark-to-Market program, which began in 1998, authorized HUD to reduce  rents to market levels on project-based properties with HUD-insured mortgages.

However, these actions require making difficult trade-offs between limiting  program costs and achieving long-standing policy objectives, such as  serving more needy households, having assisted households pay a  relatively small share of their incomes in rents, making it easier for voucher  holders to find housing (especially in tight rental markets), reducing the  concentration of poverty, and giving PHAs the flexibility to respond to local  rental market conditions.", "Congress and HUD have already responded to the increasing cost of  vouchers by changing the way the program is funded.

Instead, it will be up to  PHAs to exercise their flexibilities and make decisions regarding how to  use the voucher funding that they receive from HUD. For example, some  PHAs may choose to reduce their local payment standard, a course that, as  our analysis suggests, would likely limit growth in voucher costs.

The Mod Rehab program was  created in 1978 to add to the existing stock of assisted housing. It did this  by providing funding to upgrade a portion of the estimated 2.7 million then- unassisted rental housing units with deficiencies that required a moderate  level of repair, and rental subsidies for low-income households to live in  them. Congress funded no new contracts for the Mod Rehab program after  1989 and repealed the program in 1991.", "Under annual contracts with public housing agencies (PHA) that  administer the Mod Rehab program, HUD provides the funding for rental  subsidies as well as an administrative fee to the agencies. The  administering agencies, in turn, enter into contracts with property owners.  Under these contracts, property owners rehabilitate their housing units to  meet HUD\u2019s standards for housing quality by completing repairs costing at  least $1,000 and make the rehabilitated units available to eligible  households. In exchange, PHAs screen applicants for eligibility and pay the  difference between the approved contract rent and the household\u2019s portion  of the rent. The Mod Rehab has features that are common to both the  project-based and voucher programs. For example, similar to the voucher  program, the Mod Rehab program is administered by PHAs and was  intended to utilize the existing stock of privately owned rental housing.  However, Mod Rehab is fundamentally a project-based program because  the rental subsidy is tied to a specific unit, not the household.", "During the 11 years that Congress funded new contracts under the Mod  Rehab program, the term for the Section 8 contracts was 15 years. When  the oldest of these contracts began to expire in 1995 and 1996, HUD  instructed PHAs to replace them with vouchers. Since fiscal year 1997,  however, HUD has renewed expiring contracts on an annual basis if the  owners opt to do so and the properties consist of more than four rental  units.", "As shown in table 3, the Mod Rehab program has undergone significant  reductions in the number of units\u2014from 71,659 in 1998 to 34,141 in 2004, a  decline of about 52 percent. As with project-based Section 8, owners of  Mod Rehab properties can choose to leave the program upon contract  expiration, and in these cases, eligible households can receive enhanced  vouchers.", "Data on budget authority for the Mod Rehab program were not available  separately. From 1998 through 2004, HUD received budget authority for the  Mod Rehab program as part of the overall appropriations for Section 8 in  the Housing Certificate Fund account. Starting in its 2006 budget request,  HUD included renewal funding for the Mod Rehab program in its Project- Based Rental Assistance budgetary account. Similarly, data on Mod Rehab  outlays were not available. However, as we did for the voucher and project- based programs, we estimated Mod Rehab outlays using data from HUD\u2019s  accounting systems. As table 4 shows, from 1998 through 2004, estimated  Mod Rehab outlays decreased by over 50 percent, from $472 million to $246  million. The decrease in outlays was due to significant reductions in the  number of units assisted under the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Description of the Section 8 Rental Housing Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": ["Federal rental housing assistance, which began with the enactment of the  U.S. Housing Act of 1937, includes subsidies to construct new affordable  housing and to make rents affordable in existing rental housing. From 1937  through 1974, the emphasis was almost exclusively on new construction.  Questions about the cost-effectiveness of new construction led Congress to  explore options for using existing housing to shelter low-income families.  In 1974, it added Section 8 to the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 and created the  Existing Housing Certificate program, the first major program to rely on  existing privately owned rental housing and to provide tenant-based, rather  than project-based, assistance. Another type of Section 8 assistance, the  voucher program, started as a demonstration program in 1983, was made  permanent in 1988, and operated simultaneously with the certificate  program until 1998.  At that time, the two programs were consolidated into  the Housing Choice Voucher program, which combined features of both  earlier programs.

These subsidies, which make up the difference between  households\u2019 payments (usually 30 percent of adjusted income) and the  actual unit rent, are limited by the payment standards set by local public  housing agencies. PHAs set these payment standards based in part on fair  market rents (FMR) that the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) establishes for individual housing markets, generally  at the 40th percentile (in some cases 50th percentile) of the distribution of  rents. Raising the payment standard relative to the FMR can provide  assisted households with a wider choice of housing, but renting more  expensive units raises both the cost of the subsidies and thus of the Section  8 programs.", "Because of the potential influence on program costs, we wanted to  investigate the role of HUD and PHA policies in setting payment standards.  Since 1998, PHAs have had more leeway than they did previously to  increase (or decrease) payment standards relative to the FMR. According  to HUD, this authority has been exercised too generously and is a major  cause of the recent increase in HAPs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Model and Data", "paragraphs": ["We developed a pooled cross-section time-series model explaining monthly  HAPs as depending on a variety of housing market, program, and  household characteristics. The results and descriptive statistics are based  on a 10 percent sample of voucher (and certificate) household records  obtained from HUD\u2019s Public and Indian Housing Information Center files.  These files provide snapshots of the program as of the end of each calendar  year from 1998 through 2004 and provide information on HAPs, gross rents,  FMRs, and payment standards as well as household income and other  characteristics. The information in a file on a particular assisted household  is current as of a point in time\u2014for instance, the date of a program action,  usually the date of an annual recertification for program eligibility. HUD\u2019s  Office of Policy Development and Research worked with the underlying  administrative files to (1) correct various coding errors and  inconsistencies, (2) identify the census tract of each household based on  tenants\u2019 addresses, and (3) add information of analytical interest that was not necessarily required for program administration. The date of  admission to the program and the date of the program action were used to  measure how long the household had been in the program, and other fields  were used to indicate any change in the household\u2019s rental unit and  whether the household left the program. We used information on the  household\u2019s census tract to identify neighborhood characteristics. We also  used the census tract information to develop an indicator of neighborhood  quality by determining whether the voucher household\u2019s census tract was a  HUD-designated qualifying census tract (QCT).", "We excluded observations with extreme or missing values for key  variables, and we excluded duplicate observations in the latest record and  the record from the previous year. We also excluded households that  appeared to have entered or left the program more than once.", "We placed each household in one of four categories, based on demographic  and labor market characteristics: single female-headed households with  children (nonelderly, nondisabled), elderly (including elderly disabled),  nonelderly disabled, and all other. Because groups could face different  housing and labor market conditions and the variables in our model could  have different effects on the level of HAP in each group, we estimated the  same model separately for each of the four categories. For instance,  disabled households are typically smaller than other households but may  require housing with features not commonly available in the general rental  stock. Families with children may be larger than other families, and thus  require larger units, and may also experience changes in labor market  incomes.", "The purpose of the model is to explain monthly HAPs using an estimating  equation that is based on a variety of household, housing, neighborhood,  and policy factors. HAPs range from close to zero to the thousands of  dollars, with variations in each cross section and over time. In the model,  HAPs are explained by the general level of market rents, tenant incomes, a  measure of neighborhood quality, time period, and a measure of PHA  payment standard policy. We also included in our model a series of  explanatory dummy variables for household size, duration in program,  termination and moves, and metropolitan areas. All dollar amounts (e.g.,  HAP, market rents, adjusted income) are expressed in 2004:Q4 terms using  the price index for Personal Consumption Expenditures from the Bureau of  Economic Analysis.", "Because gross rents are important in defining the level of HAPs, we control  for the general level of market rents in order to examine the effects of other  variables. We use the FMR for this purpose because it provides  considerable variation within cross sections and across time. The level of  income is also important in determining the level of HAPs, and we used  adjusted income as reported in the file. This choice is potentially  problematic, as the level of HAPs may influence income by encouraging  program participants to seek work or not. However, this problem is  somewhat mitigated by the fact that adjusted income is a predetermined  rather than an actual amount. Specifically, the adjusted income reported in  the file is the PHA\u2019s projection of a household\u2019s income in the upcoming  year based on income information from the previous year, taking into  account expected changes in hours, wages, and labor force status. Finally,  the file did not include information concerning household characteristics,  such as occupation, education, and experience, that would help explain  variations in assistance payments at the individual household level.", "The policy variable of interest relates to the way PHAs set payment  standards (relative to the FMR). We define a ratio variable to measure this  policy by calculating the average payment standard and average FMR by  year and bedroom size for each PHA and then calculate the ratio (1 = 100)  of the year-specific, PHA-specific payment standard to the FMR. Missing  payment standard information were set equal to the FMR for a value of  100. (To limit the effects of outliers, we excluded from the analysis those  households with payment standard ratios of less than 75 and more than  120.)  The baseline specification uses the year-specific, PHA-specific  payment standard to FMR ratio as a continuous variable (also truncated at  75 and 120).", "Neighborhood quality is measured in two ways, both of them based on the  household\u2019s census tract. Our base specifications use HUD-designated  QCTs, which are in less desirable neighborhoods than other tracts. Thus  rents and HAPs should be lower in those neighborhoods, given that the  market rent variable distinguishes higher-rent markets from lower-rent  markets.", "Because the same households are in the data set for many years, up to as  many as six times, the error terms are not likely to be independent from  each other to the extent that unobserved characteristics may make the  error terms for each household correlated with each other. However, to the  extent that this presents a problem with the confidence intervals around a  coefficient estimate (rather than a point) estimate, we believe that this is  mitigated to a large extent by the large sample sizes used in the estimation.
