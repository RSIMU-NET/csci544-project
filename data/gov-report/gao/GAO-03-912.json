Over the past decade, private companies and not-for-profit organizations have sponsored prescription drug discount cards that offer discounts from the prices the elderly would otherwise have to pay for their prescriptions. These cards are typically administered by pharmacy benefit managers (PBM). Pharmaceutical manufacturers also sponsor and administer their own discount cards. The Administration has been interested in endorsing specific drug cards for Medicare beneficiaries to make the discounts more widely available. Legislative proposals in the Senate and House of Representatives have included drug cards as a means to lower prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. GAO was asked to examine how existing drug discount cards work and the prices available to card holders. Specifically, GAO evaluated the extent to which PBM-administered drug discount cards offer savings off non-card prices at 40 pharmacies in California, North Dakota, and Washington, D.C., and the differences between PBM-administered cards and cards sponsored by pharmaceutical manufacturers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Medicare beneficiaries can receive prices with prescription drug discount cards at retail pharmacies that are generally lower than those available to seniors without cards. Prices available for a particular drug tend to be similar across PBM-administered cards. Savings from PBM-administered cards, however, can differ because retail pharmacy prices vary widely. For example, in Washington, D.C., which had the highest median retail pharmacy prices of the three areas GAO surveyed, median savings using a PBM-administered card ranged from $2.09 to $20.95 for a 30-day supply of the nine drugs frequently prescribed for the elderly that GAO examined. This was after accounting for the 10 percent discount for senior citizens given by each of the 14 surveyed pharmacies. Savings in California with the use of a card tended to be lower because 10 of the 13 California pharmacies GAO surveyed participated in the state's Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) and are required to give Medicare beneficiaries the Medi-Cal price. For seven of the nine drugs, savings ranged from $0.44 to $13.06. For the other two drugs the cards offered no savings at Medi-Cal-participating pharmacies because the Medi-Cal prices were lower than the median price available with a PBM-administered card. Savings in North Dakota for the nine drugs ranged from $0.54 to $7.72 even though 10 of the 13 pharmacies there did not offer a senior discount. Any savings achieved with a card are reduced by the annual or one-time fee charged by the PBM-administered cards. Prices available with a pharmaceutical-manufacturer-sponsored card for a particular drug are typically lower than prices obtained using PBM-administered cards, and are often a flat price of $10 or $15. PBM-administered cards differ from pharmaceutical-manufacturer-sponsored cards with respect to eligibility and the range of drugs they cover, as well as the price available with the card. PBM-administered discount cards are available to all adults and can be used to purchase most outpatient prescriptions. Pharmaceutical-manufacturer-sponsored cards are available only to Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below a certain level who have no prescription drug coverage and can be used to purchase only outpatient prescription drugs produced by the sponsoring manufacturers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Prescription drugs have become an increasingly important part of health  care for the elderly.

Over the past decade, private companies and not-for-profit  organizations have sponsored card programs that give the elderly  discounts from the retail prices they would otherwise have to pay for their  prescriptions.", "In July 2001, the President announced a set of principles for reforming  Medicare, including adding a prescription drug benefit for the elderly. As  an initial step toward providing a drug benefit, the Administration  proposed establishing a drug discount card program to lower prescription  drug out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries. The Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule in September 2002  for the Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Plan Assistance Initiative, in  which the agency would endorse discount card programs developed by  private entities if they met certain standards. The initiative would promote  the use of drug discount cards by Medicare beneficiaries. A federal district  court judge found in January 2003, however, that CMS did not have  authority for the initiative and permanently enjoined the agency from  going forward with it. In March 2003, CMS filed a notice of appeal from  this decision. More recently, legislative proposals in the Senate and the  House of Representatives have included drug cards as a means to lower  the prices Medicare beneficiaries pay for their prescription drugs.", "The Medicare-endorsed card initiative has focused interest on private- sector prescription drug discount card programs. You requested that we  examine these programs and pertinent state laws and regulations.  Specifically, you asked (1) how do existing prescription drug discount  card programs work, (2) how do the prescription drug prices available  with existing discount cards compare to prices available without a  discount card, and (3) how do states regulate card programs?", "To obtain information on discount card programs, we used a structured  interview guide to conduct telephone interviews with officials from five  organizations that administer many of the programs. Four of these  organizations are among the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit managers  (PBM)\u2014Medco Health Solutions (formerly Merck-Medco Managed Care),  AdvancePCS, Express Scripts, and WellPoint Health. They administer  numerous nationwide card programs sponsored by a range of entities,  such as health insurers, retail pharmacies, employee associations, and  other organizations. The fifth organization was Citizens Energy, a  nonprofit company that sponsors and administers the Citizens Health drug  discount card, which is available to all adults in Connecticut,  Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. We also obtained information from  company Web sites on the prescription drug discount card programs  introduced in the last 2 years by four pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2014Eli  Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Pfizer\u2014as well as the Web site for  Together Rx, a card that provides discounts on some drugs produced by  eight pharmaceutical manufacturers. An estimated 18 to 19 million people  have enrolled in one or more of the drug discount card programs that we  examined. In addition, we examined CMS\u2019s final rule on the Medicare- Endorsed Prescription Drug Plan Assistance Initiative. To understand the  role of drug discount cards in the retail pharmacy marketplace, we spoke  with representatives of three retail pharmacy chains whose pharmacies  comprise about 22 percent of all retail pharmacies nationwide.", "We obtained April 2002 prices from 40 retail pharmacies in California,  North Dakota, and the Washington, D.C. area for nine drugs frequently  prescribed for the elderly. The prices reflect any senior citizens discount  that the pharmacies routinely provide. We compared these prices to prices  for these drugs in the same period that were available using five PBM- administered discount cards at retail pharmacies or through the PBMs\u2019  mail order pharmacies. We did not independently verify the drug prices  that we obtained, and they may not reflect current prices.", "To examine state regulation of drug discount cards, we obtained  information from the National Conference of State Legislatures, the  National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and several PBMs that track  state regulation of discount cards.

Generally, the PBM creates a  network of participating pharmacies that have contracts with the PBM  specifying discount arrangements. The PBM processes orders for the cards  and operates a mail order pharmacy that cardholders may use. Consumers  can have as many different cards as they like. Each card can be used at  any participating retail pharmacy or through the PBM\u2019s mail order  pharmacy.", "Retail pharmacies play an important role in drug discount card programs  because they agree to offer a lower price to cardholders. The PBM  administrators with whom we spoke estimated that retail pharmacies fill  75 to 95 percent of the prescriptions paid for using PBM-administered  discount cards, with mail order filling the remaining prescriptions. A large  majority of prescriptions paid for using pharmaceutical-manufacturer- sponsored cards are also filled by retail pharmacies, rather than through  mail order.
