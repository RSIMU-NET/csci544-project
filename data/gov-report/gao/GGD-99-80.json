While ONDCP required all departments with drug control responsibilities to submit budget requests in the fall of 1997 (prior to their submission to OMB), certain agencies, bureaus, and programs were also required to submit budget requests in the summer of 1997 (at the same time the request was submitted to their department heads). The purpose of these advance reviews, according to the guidance, is to affect funding levels requested by Cabinet officers in their subsequent budget submissions to OMB.", "In late June 1997, ONDCP issued additional guidance to Cabinet officers identifying drug control funding priorities, as required under the act. This guidance outlined specific program initiatives, by National Strategy goal, that were to be addressed in agencies\u2019 budget submissions to ONDCP.

According to ONDCP officials, the specific level of analysis is left up to the discretion of the individual budget analysts but normally involves a subjective assessment of three factors: 1.  Is the budget consistent with the goals and objectives outlined in the National Strategy? 2.  Does the budget address specific drug control initiatives outlined in ONDCP\u2019s annual guidance? 3.  Are funding levels consistent with overall budget trends and at amounts sufficient to carry out individual programs?", "Determination of adequacy, according to ONDCP internal memorandums, is not meant to be a technical analysis of the budget, but rather a collective opinion\u2014of budget analysts, program analysts, and ultimately ONDCP managers\u2014that agencies are asking for sufficient funding to carry out existing programs and new initiatives to support the National Strategy.", "During July and August 1997, ONDCP began notifying drug control agencies of the results of its summer budget proposed certification decisions. ONDCP prepared precertification letters, which it provided to agencies, identifying specific areas in the budget that must be addressed in order for the budget to be certified. ONDCP officials have stated that these letters allow the agencies time to revise their budgets prior to submitting them in the fall to OMB. It also allows ONDCP to concentrate its certification efforts earlier in the budget process, when there is more time for review and comment prior to the involvement of OMB. These letters are typically provided at the department level, except for independent agencies.", "For the fiscal year 1999 budget cycle, the ONDCP Director personally met with Cabinet officers or their designees to discuss funding priorities.

Following this review, ONDCP notified each department or agency of its final certification decision. Most of the certification letters were issued in late November 1997, with two others provided in early December 1997 and one in early November 1997.", "ONDCP officials noted that, in making the final certification decision for each individual drug control agency, there can be a range of overall funding levels that are considered adequate to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Strategy.

Rather than individually certifying every program, agency, and department with drug control responsibilities, ONDCP issued certification letters primarily at the department level.

Again the letter indicated that an additional $141 million was needed to correct deficiencies in the current budget. Also on November 6, 1997, the Secretary of Defense replied that the amounts requested by ONDCP were excessive. For example, in response to ONDCP\u2019s recommendation for additional spending on the Mexican Initiative, the Secretary stated that DOD already planned to spend $12 million in Mexico in fiscal year 1999 and that it would be a logistical challenge to increase this amount. Additionally, the Secretary stated, DOD could not increase spending on the Andean Initiative until enactment of additional DOD authority by Congress. On November 7, 1997, the ONDCP Director reiterated to the Secretary of Defense that ONDCP would not certify the DOD counterdrug budget and sent similar letters to key administration and congressional officials.", "At the time of OMB\u2019s preliminary budget passback decisions, DOD\u2019s overall budget submission had not yet been finalized. Based on DOD\u2019s preliminary counterdrug budget submission, ONDCP formally appealed to OMB for the $141 million in increased funding that ONDCP had previously identified when it decertified DOD\u2019s counterdrug budget. In mid-December 1997, DOD announced that it would support additional resources in its budget for counterdrug programs. ONDCP supported DOD\u2019s decision, but in a December 16, 1997, letter to DOD, ONDCP continued to request additional funding for the National Guard Counterdrug Program. As finally agreed to with OMB in late December 1997, DOD\u2019s counterdrug budget totaled $883 million, including about $75 million in increased funding for three of the four program initiatives previously recommended by ONDCP.DOD\u2019s total fiscal year 1999 counterdrug budget as approved by the President and submitted to Congress was $883 million.", "According to DOD officials, the DOD budget cycle and that of ONDCP do not align very well. Normally, DOD does not finalize its overall departmental budget (internally or with OMB) until late December. Throughout the fall, and continuing into OMB\u2019s passback season, DOD is constantly refining its budget submission. Thus, DOD\u2019s counterdrug budget is not always available in final form when ONDCP would like it for certification purposes.", "According to ONDCP officials, in order to influence the DOD budget process, ONDCP usually receives DOD\u2019s draft drug budget submission in late August or early September. DOD\u2019s final budget submission is generally completed too late in the process for ONDCP to propose changes. Because of this practice, DOD\u2019s drug budget is typically reviewed for certification purposes prior to other drug control agencies\u2019 budgets in the fall. Based on the preliminary DOD budget submitted in September 1997 and further discussions with DOD officials, ONDCP believed that the department was not going to fund the initiatives in question at a level that would be adequate; and thus, it decertified DOD\u2019s drug budget. ONDCP could not wait until December 1997\u2014when DOD\u2019s final budget was completed\u2014 because it had to begin preparing for discussions with OMB and the President about the overall national drug budget.

This increase can be attributed, in large part, to the October 1998 enactment of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for fiscal year 1999. The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act authorized, among other things, increased funding for drug interdiction and supply reduction activities over the next 3 fiscal years, 1999 to 2001. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations provided increased counterdrug funding for fiscal year 1999 in the amount of $844 million.", "While the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act contains no explicit statement about the relevance of ONDCP\u2019s budget certification process to its passage, one of its purposes was to state Congress\u2019 desire that DOD give higher priority for counterdrug activity\u2014a position also stated by ONDCP when it decertified DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1999 drug budget. In addition, the act authorized increased drug control funding for supply reduction activities in source countries and Caribbean transit zones, two activities for which ONDCP previously recommended budget increases in its precertification letters to Justice and Treasury. Despite Congress\u2019 intentions to increase the national drug budget, the ONDCP Director and the administration opposed passage of this act, stating that, among other things, it was an attempt by Congress to micromanage national drug strategy.", "The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for fiscal year 1999 provided significant supplemental funding for the national drug control budget, particularly in areas in which ONDCP had recommended increases during the budget certification process. For example,", "DEA, whose budget ONDCP had previously certified as adequate, received a small additional increase in counterdrug funding\u2014$10 million.

Most of this amount was for drug surveillance and interdiction in transit zones, as well as enhanced port and border inspection capabilities. ONDCP had recommended increases in each of these areas in its precertification letter to Treasury and also later recommended additional funding for inspection technology.", "DOD received an additional $42 million in counterdrug funding, primarily for port and border security and international supply reduction activities. When added to its regular counterdrug appropriation of $895 million, DOD\u2019s total counterdrug funding for fiscal year 1999 ($937 million) was nearly equal to what ONDCP had originally recommended ($950 million).", "Although SAMHSA did not receive additional funding under the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for fiscal year 1999, SAMHSA\u2019s drug budget may have benefited from ONDCP\u2019s input into the appropriations process.

In addition, in subsequent letters to members of the congressional appropriations committees, the ONDCP Director identified SAMHSA\u2019s Substance Abuse Block Grant as a key initiative needing additional resources for fiscal year 1999.

However, because of statutory restrictions on how ONDCP can exercise this authority and ONDCP\u2019s desire to maintain positive interagency relationships, these authorities have little direct impact on ONDCP\u2019s management of the National Drug Control Program.

Established in February 1998 through cooperative efforts between ONDCP and the drug control community, the PME system provides a framework for assessing the effectiveness of the National Drug Control Strategy by utilizing goals, objectives, and measurable effects, known as performance targets. This system is expected to allow ONDCP, the agencies, and Congress to better manage the programs and resources associated with the nation\u2019s drug control efforts.

ONDCP\u2019s authority also extends to agencies\u2019 appropriated funds, whereby ONDCP must approve, prior to submission to Congress, any request by a federal drug control agency to reprogram or transfer any amount of appropriated drug control funds greater than $5 million; may, upon advance notification to Congress and with the concurrence of the affected agencies, transfer appropriated drug control funds from one federal drug control agency to another; and may issue funds control notices that direct how federal drug control agencies may obligate appropriated drug control funds.", "In addition, as part of the budget certification process described previously, ONDCP can direct federal drug control agencies to make changes to their annual drug budget submissions so that the budgets are consistent with the specific drug control initiatives and priorities identified in the National Strategy.", "ONDCP officials noted that its reprogramming authority, although not specifically aimed at managing agency performance, provides a means by which ONDCP can help ensure, in advance, that any significant budgetary changes will not negatively affect the agency\u2019s ability to meet the goals and objectives of the National Strategy. Normally, the officials noted, the agency has discussed such requests in advance with ONDCP, and the approval is routine. According to ONDCP officials, on two occasions in fiscal year 1999, ONDCP has exercised its authority to approve agency drug budget reprogramming requests. The State Department requested reprogramming of $19.5 million, most of which was to realign funding between existing counterdrug programs; and DOD requested reprogramming to shift an additional $45 million into its Counterdrug Transfer Account. ONDCP officials said they could not recall disapproving of an agency reprogramming request.", "ONDCP has not used its authority to directly transfer drug control funding from one agency or department to another. According to ONDCP officials, this authority is not likely to be used in the future, despite the fact that Congress recently increased the amount eligible for transfer from 2 percent to 3 percent of the transferring agency\u2019s drug budget. Under the current law, ONDCP must not only report any proposed transfer to Congress in advance of taking any action, but also it may exercise the transfer authority only with the consent of the head of each affected agency. Because of these checks and balances, this new authority in effect provides ONDCP no more power to influence agency budgets than it already had under existing authorities. ONDCP officials told us that, in any event, they prefer to effect changes in agency drug budgets through negotiation, interagency working relationships, and the normal budget process.

They said this authority would be used by ONDCP on an exception basis to specify the timing or amount of spending related to certain appropriations.

The existence of this authority tends to make ONDCP budget recommendations and requests to drug control agencies more persuasive.

The Anti- Drug Abuse Act of 1988 required ONDCP to include in each year\u2019s National Strategy an evaluation of the effectiveness of federal drug control efforts during the previous year.

To measure success in meeting the National Strategy\u2019s overall goals and objectives, ONDCP plans to compile data provided by the drug control agencies on those performance targets for which they have supporting responsibilities.", "Each of the goals in the strategy is associated with several impact targets, objectives, performance targets, and measures. For example, goal number 5 of the strategy is to break foreign and domestic drug sources of supply. As described in the PME system, meeting this goal depends on achieving six objectives, each of which addresses some aspect of foreign or domestic supply. Each objective further consists of two to four performance targets, the measurement of which is to determine whether the objectives have been achieved. To determine whether the overall goal has been met, two additional impact targets\u2014one dealing with foreign drug supply and one dealing with domestic drug production\u2014are to measure outcomes over 5- and 10-year periods.", "Focusing on foreign supply, the impact target measuring achievement of this aspect of goal number 5 is as follows: Source zone outflow \u2014 By 2002, reduce the rate of outflow of illicit drugs from the source zone by 15 percent, as compared with the 1996 base year. By 2007, reduce outflow rate by a total of 30 percent measured against the base year.", "Goal number 5, objective 1 is to reduce production of specific illegal drugs which, if achieved, would lead to a reduction in source zone outflow.

First, for many of the performance targets identified, no data currently exist to measure progress towards the target.

For example, one target for goal number 2 is to reduce the rate of violent crimes and crimes against property that are associated with illegal drugs. However, data currently collected for these types of crimes (through FBI Uniform Crime Reports) are not broken out by drug use involvement. ONDCP is taking steps to address these types of data limitations. For example, ONDCP\u2019s Subcommittee on Data, Research, and Interagency Coordination has recently completed a federal drug-related data needs assessment and an inventory of federal drug-related data sources. ONDCP has also included $3.3 million in its fiscal year 2000 budget request to fund data development activities. ONDCP expects that all of the targets identified in the 1999 PME report will be measurable within 3 years.", "Second, it is not yet clear how ONDCP will use the PME information during its budget certification process. Agency officials we talked to raised concerns that PME targets may become a way to judge the performance of individual drug control agencies. ONDCP officials have stated, however, that the PME data will not be used in this manner, but rather these data will be used to assess the effectiveness of the National Strategy and the PME framework itself. During the fiscal year 1999 drug budget certification process, ONDCP did not use performance data as criteria, but rather it focused on overall dollar amounts and specific program initiatives that agencies were expected to address in their budgets. For fiscal year 2000, ONDCP\u2019s budget guidance requested that drug control agencies format their budget submissions so that proposed spending was broken out by performance target. However, ONDCP officials indicated that they have not yet decided how PME information will be integrated into the certification process in future budget cycles. They believe that identifying a direct connection between the funding request and the associated PME performance target will allow ONDCP to make more informed recommendations to the agencies about where they should focus their drug control funds. ONDCP expects that a decision on this issue will likely be made by calendar year 2001, the point at which ONDCP estimates data will be available to measure progress towards all of the previously established performance targets. \u201cAgencies are required to track their own performance through their Government Performance and Results Act plans, which should include aspects of their own specific drug control missions. The plans should be consistent with the  Strategy and the PME system.\u201d", "For the four selected departments and agencies we reviewed, we compared performance measures from their 1999 Results Act performance plans with performance measures developed under the PME system. We found that the Results Act plans may be inconsistent with or contain less specific information than is presented in the PME system. For example:", "DEA\u2019s fiscal year 1999 annual performance plan contains strategic goals and strategies for achieving those goals that parallel goals and objectives described in the PME system. For example, DEA\u2019s plan contains a strategic goal of disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations, which corresponds to two similar PME objectives. The PME performance targets for these two objectives are very specific about achieving percentage increases in numbers of organizations disrupted or dismantled over 5- and 10-year periods. DEA\u2019s corresponding annual goals\u2014increasing arrests, removals, and seizures; increasing foreign operations; and disrupting drug traffickers\u2014are less specific and output-oriented, although they are expected to result in the outcomes of reduced trafficking capability, disruption and dismantling of trafficking organizations, and enhanced international coordination and intelligence collection. In addition, DEA\u2019s plan lacks specific performance targets upon which to gauge progress towards these annual goals or outcomes.", "Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 1999 annual performance plan contains the goal to reduce trafficking, smuggling, and use of illicit drugs. Customs is the primary Treasury agency responsible for achieving this goal, which roughly corresponds to PME goal number 4, objective 1: conduct flexible operations to detect, disrupt, deter, and seize illegal drugs in transit to the United States at U.S. borders. Both the annual performance plan and PME establish targets for specific drugs, although (1) the data sources identified to measure progress towards the targets are slightly different and (2) Customs\u2019 targets focus on single-agency outputs (increased drugs seized) while ONDCP\u2019s focus on multiagency outcomes (reduced flow of drugs).", "SAMHSA\u2019s fiscal year 1999 annual performance plan contains an initiative that directly responds to PME goal number 1, objective 2\u2014pursue a vigorous public advertising and communication program dealing with the dangers of illegal drugs. For both, the expected outcome is to increase the percentage of youth who consider illegal drugs to be harmful. Although similar overall, differences can be seen in the performance targets identified and data sources used to measure progress towards the targets. PME has identified as a target an increase in 20 percent, by 2002, in the percentage of youth perceiving great risk in using marijuana; while SAMHSA\u2019s 2002 target is to reduce, by 25 percent, past month usage of marijuana by youths.

Their comments and our responses are summarized below.", "ONDCP concurred with the report and provided technical clarifications, which we have incorporated in the report where appropriate.

ONDCP will continue its efforts to guide the development of agency drug control programs through the annual drug budget certification process.", "The PME system will be refined during fiscal year 1999, as ONDCP addresses some of the important issues raised in this report. In particular, ONDCP intends to make significant progress this year to better link the PME system with the drug budget.", "DEA expressed concern about our suggestion that DEA\u2019s 1999 performance plan was less specific and output-oriented, and lacked measurable targets upon which to gauge progress towards the annual goals of the Performance Measures of Effectiveness. DEA stated that its performance plan directly supports DOJ\u2019s Strategic Plan, which itself was designed to meet the goals and objectives of the National Drug Control Strategy. We agree that DEA\u2019s 1999 performance plan contains strategic goals and strategies for achieving those goals that parallel goals and objectives described in the PME system, and we have stated so in this report. However, DEA\u2019s annual goals as stated in the plan are less specific than those in the PME system, the goals do not include specific performance targets for either outputs or outcomes, and the performance plan does not identify performance measures that will be used to track progress towards the goals. This approach is inconsistent with the Results Act, which requires performance plans to contain objective, quantifiable, and measurable performance goals, as well as performance indicators to measure outputs and outcomes.", "Customs, HHS, and DOD concurred with the report and also provided technical comments and clarifications, which have been incorporated in the report where appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to Representative Patsy T.

To obtain additional perspectives about both the drug budget certification process and ONDCP\u2019s Performance Measures of Effectiveness, we also reviewed the following four departments and agencies in more detail: (1) the Drug Enforcement Administration (within the Department of Justice), (2) U.S. Customs Service (within the Treasury Department), (3) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (within the Department of Health and Human Services), and (4) the Department of Defense.

We reviewed the legislation governing the ONDCP budget certification process, including changes resulting from ONDCP\u2019s 1998 Reauthorization Act.
