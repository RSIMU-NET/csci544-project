The program schedule has grown 35 percent or 4 years, and its reliability requirement has been reduced from 70 hours of continuous operation to 43.5 hours. Program difficulties occurred in part because not enough time was allowed to demonstrate maturity of the EFV design during SDD. The SDD schedule of about 3 years proved too short to conduct all necessary planning and to incorporate the results of tests into design changes, resulting in schedule slippages. In addition, several significant technical problems surfaced, including problems with the hull electronic unit, the bow flap, and the hydraulics. Reliability also remains a challenge. Three areas of significant risk remain for demonstrating design and production maturity that have potential significant cost and schedule consequences. First, EFV plans are to enter low-rate initial production without requiring the contractor to demonstrate that the EFV's manufacturing processes are under control. Second, the EFV program will begin low-rate initial production without the knowledge that software development capabilities are sufficiently mature. Third, two key performance parameters--reliability and interoperability--are not scheduled to be demonstrated until the initial test and evaluation phase in fiscal year 2010--about 4 years after low-rate initial production has begun."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congress continues to express concerns over both the costs and the cost  growth of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) major acquisition programs  and not following its own acquisition policies.

It will have two variants\u2014a troop carrier for 17 combat-equipped Marines  and a crew of 3 and a command vehicle to manage combat operations in  the field.

In addition, the EFV accounts for a substantial portion of the  Marine Corps\u2019 total acquisition budget for fiscal years 2006 through 2011,  as figure 2 shows.", "The EFV program began its program definition and risk reduction phase in  1995, and was originally referred to as the Advanced Assault Amphibious  Vehicle. The Marine Corps\u2019 existing assault amphibious vehicle was  originally fielded in 1972 and will be over 30 years old when the EFV is  fielded. Several Marine Corps studies identified deficiencies in the existing  vehicle, including the lack of necessary lethality to defeat projected  emerging threats. Despite efforts to extend the service life of the existing  vehicle, Marine Corps officials stated that serious warfighting deficiencies  remained. The studies concluded that the existing vehicle was unable to  perform the type of combat missions envisioned by the Marine Corps\u2019  emerging combat doctrine and that a new vehicle was needed.", "In September 2003, DOD officially changed the name of the new vehicle to  the EFV, which was in keeping with the Marine Corps\u2019 cultural shift from  the 20th century force defined by amphibious operations to a 21st century  force focusing on a broadened range of employment concepts and  possibilities across a spectrum of conflict. The new vehicle is a self- deploying, high water-speed, amphibious, armored, tracked vehicle, and is  to provide essential command, control, communications, computers, and  intelligence functions for embarked personnel and EFV units. These  functions are to be interoperable with other Marine Corps systems as well  as with Army, Air Force, Navy, and NATO systems. The EFV transitioned  to SDD in December 2000. The use of a knowledge-based acquisition  approach was evident at the onset of the EFV program. Early in the  program at the start of program definition and risk reduction, the Marine  Corps ensured that four of the five critical program technologies were  mature. Although the fifth technology (the moving map navigation  technology, which provides situational awareness) was not mature at this  same time, it was sufficiently matured after the program transitioned to  SDD. Furthermore, the EFV design showed evidence of being stable by the  completion and release of design drawings. At critical design review,   84 percent of the drawings were completed and released.

The statute required the Secretary of Defense to certify a  program to Congress when the unit cost growth in constant dollars  reaches 25 percent above the most recent rebaseline cost estimate and  report to Congress when it reaches 15 percent. The National Defense  Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006 made changes to Nunn-McCurdy.  The primary change that affects the EFV program was the additional  requirement to report 30 percent unit cost growth above the original  baseline estimate approved at SDD. The EFV program recently reported an  increase in the EFV\u2019s program average unit cost increase of at least   30 percent above its original baseline estimate at SDD.

Additionally, the analysis determined that this requirement was  excessively high when compared to similar types of vehicles. In fiscal year  2004, DOD\u2019s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) office  reported that overall EFV reliability remained a significant challenge  because of the system\u2019s comparative complexity and harsh operating  environment. In 2004, The Marine Corps\u2019 Combat Development Command  reviewed the 70-hour requirement and recommended that it be reduced to  43.5 hours. According to program officials, the primary reason for the  reduction to 43.5 hours was to more accurately depict the Marine Corps\u2019  current mission profile for the EFV, which calls for a 12.5-hour mission  day.

When this knowledge is  captured, knowledge point 2 has been achieved. Leading commercial  companies use several criteria to determine that this point has been  achieved, including completion of 90 percent of engineering drawings and  prototype or variant testing to demonstrate that the design meets the  requirements.

In November 2002, the program office extended  the test schedule by 12 months for additional testing prior to low-rate  initial production. According to program officials, this extension was  necessary for several reasons. Lessons learned from testing the early  prototypes necessitated design changes in the SDD prototypes, which  delayed delivery and testing of the SDD prototypes. In addition, testing  was taking longer than anticipated, additional time was needed for  reliability testing, and more training was required to qualify crews prior to  certain events. For example, the results of the early EFV firepower, water  operations, and amphibious ship testing revealed the need for more  testing. The schedule was delayed further to allow more time to  demonstrate the reliability of the EFV using the SDD prototypes.

Statistical process control is a technique that focuses on  reducing variations in manufactured parts, which in turn reduces the risk  of entering production with unknown production capability problems.  Reducing and controlling variability lowers the incidence of defective  parts and thereby products, which may have degraded performance and  lower reliability. Defects can also delay delivery and increase support and  production costs by requiring reworking or scrapping. Consequently, prior  to entering production, leading commercial firms collect and analyze  statistical process control data. Leading commercial firms also use a  measure of process control called the process capability index to measure  both the consistency and the quality of output of a process.

It provides that there be no  significant manufacturing risks prior to entering low-rate initial production  and that manufacturing processes be under statistical process control  prior to starting full-rate production.", "The EFV program is working toward the DOD standard. EFV program  officials said that statistical process control will not be used to ensure that  all key EFV manufacturing processes are under control prior to entering  low-rate initial production.

For example, they noted that one of  the most important risk mitigating actions taken was ensuring that SDD  prototypes were built using production-representative tooling and  processes. Program officials also believe that production process maturity  will be demonstrated by achieving repetitive schedule and quality  performance during low-rate initial production. In addition, the program  plans to collect statistical process control data during low-rate initial  production to track equipment and machine performance and detect  statistical shifts. The program believes that using statistical process  control data in this manner will result in earlier detection of machine  malfunctions. Program officials told us that once sufficient quantities of  the EFV are produced and baseline statistical process control data  collected, the results of the analyses of this data will be implemented for  any production measurements that demonstrate process stability.

The EFV program\u2019s approach of  foregoing such control increases the risk of unexpected production  problems during manufacturing. This risk is compounded by the fact that  plans call for reliability and interoperability, along with resolution of other  technical problems, to be operationally tested and demonstrated during  low-rate initial production, not before."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Software Development Capability Maturity Problems", "paragraphs": ["Under current plans, the EFV program is at risk of entering low-rate initial  production before software development capabilities are mature. Again,  leading commercial firms ensure that software development capabilities  are mature before entering production in order to prevent or minimize  additional cost growth and schedule delays during this phase.", "Furthermore, DOD\u2019s weapon system acquisition policy calls for weapon  systems to have mature software development capabilities before they  enter low-rate initial production.", "In assessing software capability maturity, commercial firms, DOD, and  GAO consider the software capability maturity model developed by  Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute to be an  industry standard. This model focuses on improving, standardizing, and  certifying software development processes, including key process areas  that must be established in the software developer\u2019s organization. The  model is essentially an evolutionary path organized into five maturity  levels:    Level 1, Initial\u2014the software process is ad hoc and occasionally  chaotic. Few processes are defined, and success depends on  individual effort.", "Level 2, Repeatable---basic project management processes are  established to track cost, schedule, and functionality.

The EFV\u2019s prime contractor, General Dynamics  Land Systems (GDLS), which at the time had a level 3 maturity software  capability, developed all software for the early EFV program. According  to the program office, when the program entered SDD, responsibility for  EFV\u2019s software development was transferred to GDLS\u2019 amphibious  development division, General Dynamics Amphibious Systems (GDAMS).  GDAMS has a level 1 maturity software capability. Consequently, the SDD  contract required GDLS to achieve a software development capability  maturity level 3 for all EFV software contractors and subcontractors  within 1 year of the contract award date, July 2001. In January 2002, the  program extended this requirement by 1 year, until July 2003.  Nevertheless, while GDAMS twice attempted to achieve level 3 software  development capability maturity, it did not succeed.", "Program officials considered GDAMS\u2019s inability to achieve an acceptable  level of software development capability maturity a risk to the program.  To mitigate this risk, in January 2004, the program manager began  developing a risk mitigation plan. As part of this plan, representatives from  the EFV program office, GDAMS, and Ogden Air Logistics Center\u2019s 309th  Software Maintenance Group\u2014a certified level 5 maturity software  development organization\u2014formed a Software Partnership Working  Group to address software development capability maturity issues. As of  February 2006, EFV program officials were in the process of negotiating a  memorandum of agreement with the 309th Software Partnership Working  Group to develop the EFV\u2019s low-rate initial production software. The   309th will work in partnership with GDAMS as specified by the terms of the  memorandum of agreement. Its involvement is to ensure that the EFV\u2019s  software development capability will be at the desired maturity level.", "However, the 309th Software Maintenance Group will not complete the  software development for the EFV\u2019s low-rate initial production version  until September 2006. Furthermore, GDAMS does not plan to insert this  software into the EFV vehicles until fiscal year 2008, well after low-rate  initial production has begun. This means that the low-rate initial  production decision will be made without the integration of mature  software. Furthermore, the software itself will not be demonstrated in the  vehicle until well into low-rate initial production. While the program office  believes that the level of software risk is an acceptable level risk, we have  found that technology\u2014including software\u2014is mature when it has been  demonstrated in its intended environment.", "While involving the 309th Software Maintenance Group helps to mitigate  the risk of immature software development capability in the EFV program,  it increases certain other risks. The memorandum of agreement distributes  the responsibility for software development between the three  participants. However, much of the responsibility for developing a  working software package in an acceptably mature environment shifts  from the prime contractor to the Marine Corps. The software will now  become government-furnished equipment or information. In essence, the  Marine Corps has now assumed much of the risk in the software  development effort. If the software does not work according to the  requirements, it will be incumbent upon the Marine Corps\u2014not the prime  contractor, GDLS\u2014to correct the problems. Furthermore, if the  integration of the government-furnished software into the vehicles creates  additional problems, the Marine Corps could be responsible for  corrections. Both of these situations could lead to cost and schedule  growth, and thus increase risks to the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Challenges Not Yet Fully Resolved", "paragraphs": ["Several EFV performance challenges are not yet fully resolved.  Specifically, a key performance parameter\u2014interoperability\u2014cannot be  properly demonstrated until initial operational testing and evaluation in  fiscal year 2010, well after low-rate initial production has begun.  Interoperability means that the EFV communication system must provide  essential command, control, communications, and intelligence functions  for embarked personnel and EFV units. In addition, the EFV  communication system must be compatible\u2014able to communicate\u2014with  other Marine Corps systems as well as with Army, Navy, Air Force, and  North Atlantic Treaty Organization systems. In order to demonstrate  interoperability, the EFV must participate in operational tests that involve  these joint forces. Another key performance parameter\u2014reliability\u2014has  been problematic and still presents a significant challenge. It also is not  scheduled to be demonstrated until initial operational testing and  evaluation. Furthermore, the bow flap has been problematic and, while  improved, still requires some design refinement and has not yet been  successfully tested at its operational performance level.", "Program officials commented that they have developed plans to resolve  remaining EFV performance challenges and are optimistic that these plans  will be implemented effectively and testing successfully completed.

Using the lens of a knowledge-based business case, the start of SDD was  sound on requirements and technology maturity (knowledge point 1).  While design stability was judged to be attained at the critical design  review (knowledge point 2) immediately after entering SDD, it appears  that holding critical design review so soon was premature. The acquisition  strategy did not provide the resources (time and money) necessary to  demonstrate design maturity and production maturity (knowledge point  3). However, we do note that the EFV program is planning to do more with  statistical process control than most other programs we have reviewed.", "In retrospect, the EFV program would have been more executable had the  SDD phase allowed for completion of early prototype testing before  holding the SDD critical design review and committing to building the SDD  prototypes. Another lesson learned is that while it is necessary to  demonstrate one knowledge point before a subsequent one can be  demonstrated, this alone is not sufficient. Attaining one knowledge point  does not guarantee the attainment of the next one. Rather, the acquisition  strategy for any program must adequately provide for the attainment of  each knowledge point even in programs, such as the EFV, which were in a  favorable position at the start of SDD.", "The EFV program has put into place a number of corrective actions and  plans to overcome and mitigate weaknesses in acquisition strategy.  Nevertheless, design, production, and software development capability  maturity have not yet been fully demonstrated and technical problems  fully corrected. It is important for the business case for the EFV to remain  valid in light of these changes and that the remainder of SDD adequately  provide for the demonstration of design, production, and software  development capability maturity before committing to production.", "While these problems must be acknowledged and addressed, the fact that  the EFV program has had a number of sound features should not be  overlooked. In this vein, the program can still be the source of lessons that  DOD can apply to other programs. In particular, it is important that all of  the elements of a sound business case be present at the start of SDD.  While it is generally recognized that missing an early knowledge point will  jeopardize the remaining ones, it must also be recognized that later  knowledge points are not guaranteed even if early ones are achieved.

World class companies we have visited do, in fact, often  have a limited production run that they use to manufacture a small  number of production representative assets; however, they do not make a  decision to invest in the tooling necessary to ramp up to full production  until after those assets have been tested by the customer and their critical  manufacturing processes are in control. DOD\u2019s low-rate initial production  decision reflects the decision to invest in all of the resources needed to  achieve full-rate production.
