This report examines (1) the extent to which SLDS and WDQI grantees match individual student and worker records and share data between the education and workforce sectors and (2) how grantees are using longitudinal data to help improve education and workforce outcomes. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed data from a 2013 survey conducted by the DQC. This survey collected information from states on data linkages among education and workforce programs and on how states use longitudinal data. In addition, GAO interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of five grantees, which were selected based on the progress they have made in matching data and on the funding they have received from the SLDS and WDQI programs.

The DQC is a nonprofit organization that supports the effective use of data to improve student achievement. In its survey, DQC collected self-reported information from states on their ability to match, or connect the same individual record, between the (1) K-12 and early education, postsecondary, and workforce sectors and between the (2) postsecondary and workforce sectors. However, as the match rate\u2014that is, the percent of unique individual records reliably connected between databases\u2014increases, the number of grantees able to match data decreases. GAO found that more grantees reported being able to match data among the education sectors than between the education and workforce sectors. Further, most grantees reported that they are not able to match data comprehensively. For example, only 6 of 31 grantees reported that they match K-12 data to all seven possible workforce programs covered by the DQC survey, which include adult basic and secondary education as well as unemployment insurance wage records. State officials cited several challenges to matching data, including state restrictions on the use of a Social Security number. Specifically, officials in three of five grantee states GAO spoke with said state law or agency policy prohibit collecting a Social Security number in K-12 data, which can make it more difficult to directly match individuals' K-12 and workforce records.", "According to GAO analysis of the DQC survey data, grantees use some longitudinal data to inform policy decisions and to shape research agendas. All 48 grantees reported analyzing aggregate-level data to help guide school-, district-, and state-level improvement efforts. For example, 27 grantees said they analyze data on college and career readiness to help schools determine whether students are on track for success in college or in the workforce. Grantees also reported using longitudinal data to analyze outcomes for individual students. For example, 29 grantees reported that they produce early warning reports that identify students who are most likely to be at risk of academic failure or dropping out of school. Data from the DQC survey also show that 39 grantees reported developing a research agenda in conjunction with their longitudinal data systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, states have taken steps to create longitudinal data  systems that will allow them to track individuals\u2019 participation in education  and workforce programs over time.

In addition, the  survey asked questions about how states analyze and use longitudinal  data. We reviewed the survey instrument, interviewed officials  responsible for administering the survey, and tested the data for obvious  inaccuracies and determined that these data are sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report. Our data analysis was limited to the 48 states  that (1) received a SLDS grant, a WDQI grant, or both and (2) responded  to DQC\u2019s survey. These 48 states were awarded grants from fiscal year  2006 through fiscal year 2013, the most recent year for which we had  available data on grants awarded. In addition to our analysis of DQC  survey data, we interviewed Education and DOL officials. We also  conducted interviews with five grantees\u2014Ohio, Pennsylvania, South  Dakota, Virginia, and Washington\u2014to obtain more information about their  longitudinal data systems and, in particular, any challenges they faced in  developing and implementing them. During these interviews, we also  discussed how grantees have used longitudinal data to inform decision- making in education and workforce programs. We selected these  grantees because they differed in terms of the progress they have made  in establishing data linkages and on the federal funding they have  received from the SLDS and WDQI programs. Our findings from these  interviews are not generalizable to all grantees, but they provide  information on a range of challenges faced by grantees in developing and  implementing longitudinal data systems, as well as some examples of  how grantees are using longitudinal data. We also reviewed relevant  federal laws and regulations.

From  fiscal years 2006 to 2013, Education has awarded approximately $613  million in SLDS grants (see table 1). For each grant competition,  Education establishes the award period and range of grant amounts to be  awarded; SLDS grants have ranged anywhere from 3 to 5 years, with a  maximum award amount of $20 million per grantee. See appendix III for a  list of states that received SLDS grants and the amount of their awards.", "Though the SLDS grant requirements have varied over time, states  generally could use SLDS funds to build K-12 longitudinal data systems  or to expand these systems to include data from other sectors, such as  early education, postsecondary education, or workforce (see table 2).

For example, all 20 grantees that received a fiscal year 2009 SLDS  ARRA grant were required to have longitudinal data systems that include  individual student-level data from preschool through postsecondary  education and into the workforce (see table 2). However, fiscal year 2012  grantees could choose from among three different grant priorities, so  some grantees may be focused on building a K-12 longitudinal data  system while others may be using their grant funds to link existing K-12  data to other sectors.

However, in general, few  grantees share all possible types of data (see sidebar). For example, only  3 of 36 states that match data between the postsecondary and workforce  sectors reported sharing all 10 types of data asked about by DQC, which  include information on postsecondary degree completion, earnings and  wages, and industry of employment, among others (see table 6).", "Officials in all five grantee states we spoke with said matching K-12  education and workforce data is challenging without using a Social  Security number (SSN) that uniquely identifies an individual and, as a  result, some states may have greater difficulty tracking particular groups  of students over time. SLDS officials in three states\u2014Ohio, Pennsylvania,  and Virginia\u2014said collecting a SSN in K-12 education data is prohibited  either by state law or agency policy; in the other two states\u2014South  Dakota and Washington\u2014officials said collecting a SSN is optional and  whether to do so is determined at the district level.unique statewide student identifier is a technical requirement of the SLDS  grant program, states can choose the format of the identifier used.  Education suggested, in a November 2010 SLDS Technical Brief, that  states use a unique identifier distinct from a student\u2019s SSN for privacy  reasons; however, Education also stated that states should maintain a   While establishing a  student\u2019s SSN as a data element in order to link data between systems.  According to a 2010 report from the Social Security Administration\u2019s  Office of the Inspector General, 28 states collect a SSN in K-12 education  data.", "Unlike the SLDS program, in its evaluation criteria for WDQI grants, DOL  specifies that states use SSNs as a personal identifier, as they are  already in use throughout the workforce system. To match education and  workforce data absent a SSN, state officials said they are developing  algorithms to match individual records using other identifiers, which could  include an individual\u2019s first name, last name, and date of birth. However, a  person\u2019s last name can change, which Pennsylvania SLDS officials said  can make it difficult to reliably track individuals over time. Further, Ohio  WDQI officials explained that the absence of a SSN makes it particularly  difficult to track students who drop out of high school or to track high  school graduates who do not move on to the workforce. Similarly, Ohio  SLDS officials said tracking students that do not go on to postsecondary  education is a challenge because there is no readily available identifier to  determine any workforce participation by those individuals.", "In four of five grantee states we spoke with, officials also cited data  governance as a challenge. Data governance is the exercise of decision- making and authority for data-related matters using agreed-upon rules  that describe who can take what actions with what information and when,  under what circumstances, and using what methods. SLDS grantees  are generally required to develop a governance structure involving both  state and local stakeholders that includes a common understanding of  data ownership, data management, as well as data confidentiality and  access. All WDQI grantees are expected to establish partnerships with  relevant workforce agencies and with state education agencies for the  purposes of data sharing. Pennsylvania and Ohio officials said it has not  been easy to get the various workforce agencies that maintain data on  individual workforce programs to share their data as the agencies often  operate independently from one another. As a result, Pennsylvania  officials said agencies are territorial about their data, making it difficult to  build consensus around developing a longitudinal data system. In Ohio,  officials said that each agency has to be approached separately to obtain  commitment to share data in a longitudinal system. Similarly, officials in  Virginia said collecting data on early education programs has been a  challenge as the data are scattered across different agencies. An official  from the Early Childhood Data Collaborative explained that it can be  easier to facilitate data matching between early education programs  under the purview of one agency, such as state prekindergarten and  special education, which are generally overseen by state educational  agencies in addition to K-12 data.", "Based on our interviews with grantee states, state officials we spoke with  said they are in different stages of developing a data governance  structure. For example, Pennsylvania WDQI officials said they have not  yet established a formal data governance structure. In contrast, Virginia  officials have established a data governance structure; officials said they  spent 18 months working through the different priorities, cultures, and  agendas of the various agencies providing data to the longitudinal data  system.", "State officials in all five grantee states we spoke with also said they have  had to manage public concerns about the purpose of data collection or  about data privacy. For example, in Ohio, SLDS officials told us there is a  lack of understanding about the value of building a longitudinal data  system; officials have had to counter misperceptions about what data are  being collected in the state\u2019s longitudinal data system, what the data will  be used for, and why data need to be connected between the education  and workforce sectors. South Dakota officials said they have had to  respond to concerns from parents and other education stakeholders  about the privacy of longitudinal data.", "Grantees have tried to provide information to the public about the  purposes of the data system and steps taken to safeguard information.  Forty-six grantees reported using outreach tools to communicate the  availability of the data to non-educator stakeholders, according to our  analysis of the DQC survey data. These grantees reported using  traditional outreach measures, which could include public service  announcements, press conferences and news releases, and posting  information about the data on the state education agency\u2019s website. For  example, four of five grantee states we interviewed have web pages  dedicated to their longitudinal data systems. These web pages can  include overviews of the systems, answers to frequently asked questions,  trainings on how to use or access the data, and examples of research  studies that use the data. Further, 44 grantees reported on the DQC  survey that they take advantage of in-person opportunities, which could  include meetings, conferences, and presentations. Lastly, 35 grantees  reported using electronic or social media to promote the data, which could  include Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and webinars. In the context of  discussing the challenge of managing public concerns about data  collection or privacy, officials in three of the five grantee states we spoke  with specifically said they have provided information about how they  protect individual data. Pennsylvania SLDS officials said they took  considerable time to convey to parents and taxpayers the steps they are  taking to ensure data privacy. Similarly, Virginia officials from both grant  programs said explaining all of the precautions the state is taking with  respect to data privacy seems to help in reducing concerns. Ohio officials  said the state\u2019s Department of Education has convened a new workgroup  to see if there are better ways to address misperceptions about data  collection and use.", "Lastly, state officials cited the importance of federal funding to their efforts  to build their longitudinal data systems and expressed concerns about  sustaining their systems after their grants end. Officials we interviewed in  all five grantee states said they would not be as far along in developing  their longitudinal data systems without the federal funding provided  through the SLDS and WDQI programs. For example, officials in  Washington said they used their initial SLDS and WDQI grants to focus  on building their K-12 data system and workforce systems, respectively.", "They said the second SLDS grant they received was instrumental in  building a P-20W system to connect data between all sectors. Ohio  officials said the SLDS funds have provided, among other uses, critical  funding for further development of the longitudinal data system,  technological updates, and access to technical assistance. However,  officials in all five grantee states also expressed concerns about  sustaining the systems moving forward. For example, officials in Virginia  said they have created a legislative committee to focus on sustainability  efforts and will need to request additional funding to keep the system  sustainable. Officials in Pennsylvania said they are trying to leverage the  existing technical infrastructure and use other available resources, but it  is difficult to find funding for their workforce data efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Data Analysis Has Informed State and Local Policy Making and Helped States Shape Their Research Agendas", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Grantees Reported Using Some Longitudinal Data to Inform Decision and Policy Making", "paragraphs": ["According to our analysis of the DQC survey data and our interviews with  selected states, SLDS and WDQI grantees use longitudinal data to  examine education outcomes and to inform policy decisions. All 48  grantees responded that their state educational agency uses the data to  analyze aggregate education outcomes (see fig. 3). For example, the  three most common types of analyses are related to high school  feedback, cohort graduation or completion, and growth (i.e., changes in  the achievement of the same students over time). These aggregate data  are used to analyze a particular cohort of students and develop  information on students\u2019 outcomes over time. They also help guide  school-, district-, and state-level improvement efforts. For example,  officials from three of the five grantee states we interviewed told us they  have used the data to assess kindergarten readiness for children who  attended state early education programs. Also, 27 grantees responded to  the DQC survey that they use the data to analyze college and career  readiness. More specifically, to better understand the courses and  achievement levels that high school graduates need to be successful in  college, Virginia followed students who graduated from high school from  2006 to 2008 and analyzed enrollment and academic achievement  patterns for different groups of students. According to agency officials in  Virginia, this analysis resulted in changes to the course requirements for  graduation.", "In addition to examining education outcomes, states also use longitudinal  data to assess how cohorts of students fare once they are in the  workforce. Washington\u2019s Education Research and Data Center, a state  center dedicated to analyzing education and workforce issues across the  P-20W spectrum, has published several studies examining workforce  outcomes for high school and college graduates. For example, one study  compared earnings for workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees from Washington  state colleges and universities to earnings of workers with only diplomas  from public high schools.", "In addition to analyzing aggregate student outcomes, grantees also  indicated that they analyze individual-level student outcomes. Our  analysis of DQC survey data shows that 45 of 48 grantees examine  outcomes for individual students (see fig. 4). Student-level data provide  teachers and parents with information they can use to improve student  achievement. For example, 32 grantees reported that the data are used in  diagnostic analysis, which help teachers identify individual students\u2019  strengths and academic needs. Also, 29 grantees responded to the DQC  survey that they produce early warning reports, which identify students  who are most likely to be at risk of academic failure or dropping out of  school. For example, Virginia\u2019s early warning report shows demographic  and enrollment information about an individual student; flags for warning  indicators such as attendance, GPA, and suspensions; and a record of  interventions the school has taken to help the student (see fig. 5). Further,  officials in three of the grantee states we interviewed told us that  educators have access to student-level analyses. In Pennsylvania,  teachers can use an educator dashboard, which includes longitudinal  data, to determine the educational needs of their students and adjust their  teaching plans.", "Forty-one of 48 grantees reported to the DQC that they use longitudinal  data to inform policy and continuous improvement efforts. Specifically,  grantees reported that they use the data to inform school turnaround  efforts (34 grantees), evaluate intervention strategies or programs (14  grantees), or identify and reward schools that demonstrate high growth  (27 grantees), among other things. Officials in three of five grantee states  we spoke with provided more specific examples of how they use or plan  to use longitudinal data to inform their efforts. Ohio officials told us they  used longitudinal data to study students in remediation to help develop a  remediation policy. They also said they have been working on a  workforce success measures dashboard to compare outcomes across  state programs. For example, the dashboard will allow policy makers to  assess how successful the state\u2019s adult basic education program is  compared to the state\u2019s vocational education program. Pennsylvania  officials told us they will develop a similar dashboard. Washington state  officials told us that longitudinal data helped address a concern in the  state legislature about whether math and science teachers were leaving  to work in the private sector. Researchers identified common teacher and  school district characteristics associated with teachers who left for  employment in other fields and found that math and science teachers did  not leave the field at a higher rate than other teachers. Officials told us  that this analysis prompted the state legislature to focus its attention on  improving the recruitment of math and science teachers rather than  improving retention.", "While many grantees reported on the DQC survey that they use  longitudinal data to analyze outcomes for students and workers and to  make policy decisions, officials from all five grantee states we interviewed  told us that these analyses are limited because they are still developing  their longitudinal data systems. In addition, only three of these states\u2014 Ohio, Virginia, and Washington\u2014are conducting education to workforce  analyses.

These  research agendas were developed in partnership with higher education  institutions, independent researchers, or others. Of the five grantee states  we interviewed, only Virginia and Ohio have fully developed their  research agendas. Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Washington officials  told us they are in the process of doing so. State officials shared two  approaches for creating these agendas. Under the first approach,  stakeholders from various state agencies comprise a committee that  identifies research questions. Virginia took this approach and drafted a list  of \u201cburning questions\u201d to answer using longitudinal data. Officials in  Virginia explained that they purposefully kept the agenda broad so that  the questions will remain relevant over the long term. Washington\u2019s  Education Research and Data Center has similarly developed a list of  critical questions it would like to answer using longitudinal data. Under the  second approach, state agencies use information requests and  stakeholder feedback on sample reports to shape the research agenda.  For example, officials from the South Dakota Department of Education  told us they have solicited feedback after training districts on the data and  reviewed requests from the governor\u2019s office and state legislators. They  also told us that they are following the number of hits for individual reports  on the state\u2019s Department of Education\u2019s electronic portal.", "Forty-three of 48 grantees reported that they have a process by which  researchers who are not employees of the state can propose their own  studies for approval, according to the 2013 DQC survey data.

Officials in two grantee states told us that the request  process is intended to streamline access to the data and make it easier  for researchers to seek approval for data requests.

It  remains to be seen whether all grantees will ultimately achieve the long- term goal of developing complete P20-W longitudinal data systems or  how long that will take, particularly in light of unresolved concerns about  limitations to matching data using a Social Security number and  sustainability. Further, even among those grantees that can match data  between sectors, most can only do so for a limited number of programs or  data types.

DQC\u2019s survey  focused on 10 \u201cState Actions\u201d the DQC has developed to ensure effective  data use (see table 7). DQC has conducted this annual survey since  2005. The survey data include self-reported information on how data are  matched and shared between the early education, K-12, postsecondary  education, and workforce sectors, as well as information on specific  programs within these sectors, how states analyze and use the data, and  who has access to the data.", "To conduct the survey, DQC used an online tool to collect information and  invited the governor\u2019s office in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to  participate. According to DQC, the governor\u2019s office is in the best position  to bring stakeholders together to respond to the survey. As part of their  survey response, states were asked to provide documents or website  links as evidence of having specific policies or reports. After survey  responses were received, DQC worked with each state to ensure the  information reported was as accurate as possible.", "We analyzed data from eight survey questions (see table 8 in appendix II)  to determine the extent to which SLDS and WDQI grantees match  individual records and share data among the education sectors and  between the education and workforce sectors. For the purposes of our  report, a grantee is one of the 48 states that received a SLDS grant, a  WDQI grant, or both and responded to the 2013 DQC survey. We  considered the District of Columbia to be a state. We excluded Alabama,  New Mexico and California from our review because neither Alabama nor  New Mexico received a SLDS or a WDQI grant and because California  chose not to participate in DQC\u2019s 2013 survey. We excluded the U.S.  Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico because, while these territories received  SLDS grants, DQC did not include them in its survey. We analyzed data  on SLDS and WDQI grantee states because the SLDS and WDQI grant  programs provide federal funds for developing longitudinal data systems  and are complementary.", "We considered a grantee as matching data between sectors if a grantee  matched data from at least one program between sectors (for a list of  programs included in the DQC survey, see questions 1, 4, 7, and 10 in  table 8 in appendix II). We considered a grantee as sharing data if a  grantee matched data according to our definition and also reported  exchanging at least one data element between sectors, in either direction  (for a list of data elements, see questions 2, 5, 8, and 11 in table 8 in  appendix II). We also analyzed data from another twelve survey  questions to identify how grantees are using longitudinal data to help  improve education and workforce outcomes (see table 9 in appendix II).", "We conducted a data reliability assessment by reviewing the survey  instrument and related documentation, interviewing officials responsible  for administering the survey, and testing the data for obvious  inaccuracies. We determined that these data are sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report.", "In addition to our analysis of DQC survey data we conducted interviews  with a nongeneralizable sample of five grantees as well as relevant  federal agencies and nonprofit organizations. During our interviews with  the five grantee states\u2014Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, and  Washington\u2014we asked grantees to identify challenges they faced in  building and implementing longitudinal data systems and discussed how  grantees have used longitudinal data to inform decision-making in  education and workforce programs. We selected these grantees based  on factors including the differing levels of progress they have made in  establishing data linkages and the federal funding they have received  from the SLDS and WDQI programs.", "Within each state, we spoke with relevant K-12, workforce, postsecondary  education, and early education officials. We also interviewed officials at  Education, DOL, and the Department of Health and Human Services to  obtain information about their roles in helping states build longitudinal  data systems. In addition, we spoke with officials from nonprofit  organizations to obtain their views on states\u2019 implementation of  longitudinal data systems. These stakeholder organizations included the  Early Childhood Education Collaborative, the State Higher Education  Executive Officers Association, and the Workforce Data Quality  Campaign. Finally, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations,  requests for applications, and solicitations for grant applications to  understand the requirements of these grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Data Quality Campaign (DQC) Survey Questions", "paragraphs": ["As explained in appendix I, we analyzed data from DQC\u2019s 2013 survey to  answer our research objectives.
