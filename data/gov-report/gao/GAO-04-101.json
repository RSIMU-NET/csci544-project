By combining loans into one and extending the repayment period, a consolidation loan reduces monthly repayments, which may lower default risk and, thereby, reduce federal costs of loan defaults. Consolidation loans also allow borrowers to lock in a fixed interest rate--an option not available for other student loans--and are available to borrowers regardless of financial need. GAO was asked to examine (1) how consolidation borrowers differ from nonconsolidation borrowers; (2) how federal costs have been affected by recent interest rate and loan volume changes; and (3) the extent to which repayment options--other than consolidation--are available to help simplify and reduce loan repayments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["On average, consolidation loan borrowers, over the 1987 to 2002 period, had higher levels of student loan debt, higher incomes, and larger loan repayments than did nonconsolidation borrowers. For example, the average student loan debt among consolidation borrowers prior to consolidating their loans was about $22,000 versus about $10,000 for nonconsolidation borrowers. As a group, they defaulted less often on their consolidation loans than borrowers who did not consolidate their loans. Recent trends in interest rates and consolidation loan volumes have affected consolidations in the Department of Education's (Education) two major student loan programs--the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP)--in different ways, but in the aggregate, estimated subsidy and administration costs have increased. Subsidy costs for FFELP consolidation loans grew from $1.3 billion for loans made in fiscal year 2002 to nearly $3 billion for loans made in fiscal year 2003. Lower interest rates available to borrowers in fiscal year 2003 increased these costs because FFELP consolidation loans carry a government guaranteed rate of return to lenders that is projected to be higher than the fixed interest rate consolidation loan borrowers pay. Higher loan volumes also added to the estimated subsidy costs. Interest rates and loan volume also affected costs for FDLP consolidation loans, but in a different way. Because the interest rate the government charges borrowers has been somewhat greater than the interest rate that Education pays to finance its lending, consolidation loans have generated a net gain for the government in recent years. Lower rates paid by borrowers and reduced loan volume from recent record highs, however, reduced the net gain to $286 million for loans made in fiscal year 2003, down from $460 million the year before. While administration costs are not specifically tracked for either loan program, available evidence indicates that these costs have also risen. Alternatives to consolidation, such as the ability to make a single repayment to cover multiple loans and obtain extended repayment terms, now give some borrowers opportunities to simplify and reduce loan repayments, but not all borrowers can use them. As a result, consolidation loans may be the only option for some borrowers to simplify and reduce repayments. Borrowers' repayment choices--whether to obtain a consolidation loan or use other alternatives--have consequences for federal costs. While consolidation loans may remain an important tool to help borrowers, overall federal costs in providing for consolidation loans may exceed federal savings from reduced defaults. An assessment of the advantages of consolidation loans for borrowers and the government, taking into account program costs and how costs could be distributed among borrowers, lenders, and the taxpayers, would be useful for decisionmakers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For over 2 decades, the federal government has made consolidation loans  available to help borrowers cope with large amounts of federal student  loan debt. Consolidation loans are designed to help borrowers stay current  on loan payments, thereby reducing the government\u2019s costs of paying for  defaults. Instead of making concurrent repayments on several loans over a  period usually limited to 10 years, consolidation loan borrowers can  combine their loans and extend their repayment periods beyond 10 years,  thereby reducing monthly repayments. Consolidation loans also allow  borrowers to lock in a fixed interest rate, unlike most other federal  student loans, which carry an interest rate that varies from year to year.  Between fiscal year 2000 and 2002, the number of borrowers consolidating  their federal student loans nearly doubled to almost 1 million, and the total  amount\u2014or volume\u2014of loans being consolidated rose even more sharply,  from $12 billion to over $31 billion. Consolidation loans are available  under both of the Department of Education\u2019s (Education) two major  student loan program\u2014the Federal Family Education Loan Program  (FFELP) and the William D.

Two main types of federal costs are involved. One is  \u201csubsidy\u201d\u2014the net present value of cash flows to and from the  government that result from providing these loans to borrowers. For  FFELP consolidation loans, cash flows include, for example, fees paid by  lenders to the government and a special allowance payment by the  government to lenders to provide them a guaranteed rate of return on the  student loans they make. For FDLP consolidation loans, cash flows  include borrowers\u2019 repayment of loan principal and payments of interest  to Education, and loan disbursements by the government to borrowers.  The subsidy costs of FDLP consolidation loans are also affected by the  interest Education must pay to the Department of Treasury (Treasury) to  finance its lending activities. The second type of cost is administration,  which includes such items as expenses related to originating and servicing  direct loans.", "For years, consolidation loans were basically the only alternative available  to borrowers seeking to reduce the size of their loan repayments. In recent  years, however, some repayment options, such as graduated, extended,  and income-based repayment plans, have been added to FFELP and FDLP.  This change has raised congressional interest in the degree to which these  options extend payment relief to borrowers without requiring them to  consolidate their loans, and in the potential advantages and disadvantages  of the various approaches, both for borrowers and the federal government.  In light of the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  (HEA) (which authorizes the consolidation programs), you asked us to  examine several issues concerning consolidation loans. As agreed with  your office, we focused our work on answering the following key  questions:    How do consolidation loan borrowers differ from nonconsolidation loan  borrowers?", "How are federal subsidy and administration costs for consolidation loan  programs affected by recent interest rate and loan volume changes?", "To what extent do repayment options other than consolidation loans allow  borrowers to simplify loan repayment and reduce repayment amounts?", "Our work to answer these questions involved a variety of information  sources, including officials from Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid  and Budget Service, as well as representatives of FFELP lenders. To  develop information about student borrowers, we analyzed a sample of  student loan data from Education\u2019s National Student Loan Data System  (NSLDS)\u2014a comprehensive national database of student loans,  borrowers, and other information. The sample was a randomly drawn,  representative sample that contained records on approximately 4.4 million  loans held by 1.4 million students or their parents. The sample constituted  4 percent of the overall NSLDS population of approximately 32 million  students. To assess the reliability of the NSLDS data, we reviewed existing  information about the sample and interviewed Education officials in  Washington, D.C., responsible for performing data accuracy, validity, and  integrity tests of NSLDS data. In addition, we performed electronic testing  of key variables in our sample for obvious problems in accuracy and  completeness. We determined that the NSLDS data were sufficiently  reliable for this report. Our analysis on borrower characteristics focused  on borrowers in the sample who originated loans from 1987 (the year  consolidation loans were made available under the program as it is  currently structured) to November 2002. To develop information about  the family income of borrowers and their repayment amounts, we  analyzed data provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on family  income and Education on loan repayments for a sample of borrowers who  entered repayment in 1999. Our analysis of federal costs of consolidation  loans is also based in part on interviews with Education officials in  Washington, D.C., and a review of relevant analyses prepared by  Education.

In  figure 8, the bottom line shows the fixed borrower rate for a FFELP  consolidation loan made in the first 9 months of fiscal year 2003, while the  top line shows Education\u2019s estimated values for the guaranteed lender  yield over time. In fiscal year 2003, market interest rates were such that  the guaranteed lender yield established under the SAP formula was  actually below the borrower rate. Lenders would therefore receive only  the rate paid by borrowers; no SAP would be paid. However, in future  years, when the guaranteed lender yield is expected to increase and be  above the borrower rate, Education would have to make up the difference  in the form of a SAP. As the figure shows, Education\u2019s assumptions would  call for lenders to receive a SAP over most of the life of the consolidation  loans made in fiscal year 2003.", "In point of fact, Education is required to revise these estimates  periodically to adjust for changing assumptions about interest rates and  loan performance. Subsidy costs estimates for FFELP consolidation loans  can vary substantially, depending on how much the guaranteed lender  yield rises above the fixed rate paid by borrowers. Education is required to  account for such changes in subsidy cost estimates by annually updating,  or \u201creestimating,\u201d loan program costs, in accordance with OMB budget  guidance. Any increase or decrease in the subsidy cost estimates  resulting from reestimates is reflected in future program budget estimates  as appropriate and Education\u2019s end of the fiscal year financial statements  whenever the reestimated amount is significant. Thus, Education\u2019s  estimates for both fiscal year 2002 loans and fiscal year 2003 loans are  subject to change in the future.", "An increase in loan volume also played a role in the subsidy cost increase  from fiscal years 2002 to 2003, but to a lesser degree than the higher  interest subsidies the government is expected to pay to lenders. On their  own, loan volumes can increase subsidy amounts. To illustrate, estimated  subsidy costs can be converted into subsidy rates, reflecting the estimated  unit cost per loan dollar to the federal government. For example, a $1,000  loan with a federal subsidy cost of $100 would have a subsidy rate of   10 percent. The subsidy rate for FFELP consolidation loans made in fiscal  year 2002 was approximately 5.9 percent. Given a fiscal year 2002 FFELP  consolidation loan volume of about $22.7 billion, and a subsidy rate of   5.9 percent, federal subsidy costs can be determined by multiplying the  loan volume by the subsidy rate ($22.7 billion X 0.059 = $1.3 billion).  Viewed in this way, it is clear that even if the subsidy rate remained the  same from fiscal year 2002 to 2003, the larger expected FFELP  consolidation loan volume of $30.5 billion in fiscal year 2003 would have  increased total subsidy costs to $1.8 billion (i.e., $30.5 billion X 0.059 =   $1.8 billion), an increase of $0.5 billion from fiscal year 2002. However, the  higher interest subsidies the government is expected to pay to lenders, as  previously discussed, also increased the subsidy rate for FFELP  consolidation loans made in fiscal year 2003. This rate\u20149.8 percent\u2014 coupled with the estimated loan volume of $30.5 billion, resulted in the  total FFELP consolidation loan subsidy costs of about $3 billion   ($30.5 billion X 0.098)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changing Interest Rates Also Affected FDLP Consolidation Loans", "paragraphs": ["Subsidy costs can occur within FDLP as well, but in a different way. The  FDLP consolidation program is a direct loan program and therefore  involves no guaranteed yields to private lenders. Still, the program has  potential subsidy costs determined in part by the relationship between  interest rates Education earns from borrowers\u2014the borrower rate and the  rate Education pays Treasury to finance its lending. The government\u2019s cost  of capital is determined by the interest rate Education pays Treasury to  finance direct student loans, which is equivalent to the discount rate. The  difference between borrowers\u2019 rates and the discount rate\u2014called the  interest rate spread\u2014is a key driver of subsidy estimates for FDLP loans.  When the borrower rate is greater than the discount rate, Education will  receive more interest from borrowers than it will pay in interest to  Treasury to finance its loans, resulting in a positive interest rate spread\u2014 or a gain (excluding administrative costs) to the government. Conversely,  when the borrower rate is less than the discount rate, Education will pay  more in interest to Treasury than it will receive from borrowers, which  will result in a negative interest rate spread\u2014or a cost to the government.", "For FDLP consolidation loans made in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, no such  negative interest rate spreads were incurred in either year, based on the  methodology Education uses to determine these costs. In both years,  borrower interest rates for FDLP consolidation loans were somewhat  higher than the discount rate, resulting in a net gain to the government.  However, while Education continued to benefit from lending at interest  rates higher than its cost of borrowing for FDLP consolidation loans made  in fiscal year 2003, the size of this benefit is expected to decline from   $460 million in fiscal year 2002 to $286 million in fiscal year 2003.", "The smaller net gain that is expected to occur in fiscal year 2003 reflects a  narrowed difference between the discount rate and the borrower rate. In  fiscal year 2003, this difference narrowed in part because borrower rates  dropped more than the discount rate. The borrower rates for FDLP  consolidation loans dropped 2 percentage points, from 6 percent in fiscal  year 2002 to 4 percent in fiscal year 2003. The discount rate, on the other  hand, dropped by only 0.95 percentage points. The resulting interest rate  spread decreased from 1.1 percent to 0.05 percent (see table 3). In other  words, each $100 of consolidated FDLP loans made in fiscal year 2002, will  result in $1.10 more in interest received by Education than it will pay out  in interest to the Treasury. A similar loan originated in fiscal year 2003,  however, will generate only $0.05 more in interest for the government.", "While Education revises estimates periodically to adjust for changing  assumptions about future interest rates for FFELP consolidation loans, the  borrower rate and the discount rate used to derive the subsidy cost for  FDLP consolidation loans made in fiscal year 2003 are generally fixed for  the life of the loans. As a result, the subsidy cost of FDLP consolidation  loans made in any given fiscal year do not vary in the way that subsidy  costs for FFELP consolidation loans do.", "Loan volume also played a role in the smaller net gain that occurred in  fiscal year 2003. While FDLP consolidation loan volume increased from  about $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2000 to about $8.8 billion in fiscal year  2002, Education estimated a decrease in demand for FDLP consolidation  loans for 2003, expecting volume to be about $6 billion. The unit cost per  loan dollar, or subsidy rate, for FDLP consolidation loans made in fiscal  year 2002 was a negative 5.2 percent, which resulted in a negative  subsidy\u2014that is, a \u201cgain\u201d\u2014to the government of $0.052 for each dollar  lent (excluding administrative costs). As previously discussed, the  difference between the discount rate and the borrower rate narrowed  from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003, which contributed to the  increased subsidy rate from a negative 5.2 percent to a negative   4.8 percent, resulting in a smaller gain, per loan dollar, to the government.  Had the subsidy rate remained the same from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year  2003, the decrease in FDLP consolidation loan volume would have  resulted in a reduced gain to the government of about $147 million. The  subsidy rate increase from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003, however,  coupled with reduced loan volume, resulted in a reduced gain of   $174 million."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Subsidy Costs Are Sensitive to Interest Rate Changes", "paragraphs": ["As the discussion of both FFELP and FDLP loans shows, interest rates  have a strong effect on whether subsidy costs occur and how large they  are. As a measure of how great an effect different interest rate  assumptions can have, we asked Education to conduct two additional sets  of calculations for fiscal year 2002 FFELP and FDLP consolidation loans.  Using the same loan volume and other assumptions of the fiscal year 2002  estimates, Education applied the interest rate assumptions that were used  to develop the estimates for the fiscal year 2001 and 2003 consolidation  loans. These assumptions differed from those in place in fiscal year 2002,  as well as from each other. In general, the interest rate assumptions for  fiscal year 2001 were higher than the assumptions used in fiscal year 2002,  and future interest rates were expected to decrease. The interest rate  assumptions for fiscal year 2003, on the other hand, were generally lower  than the assumptions used in fiscal year 2002, and future interest rates  were expected to increase.", "Calculating subsidy estimates under these three different sets of interest  rate assumptions produced substantially different results. As figure   9 shows, the results of this analysis indicated that for FFELP consolidation  loans, the fiscal year 2001 interest rate assumptions would result in  estimated subsidy costs totaling $129 million, or about $1 billion less than  the estimated subsidy costs under the actual fiscal year 2002 estimates. In  contrast, the fiscal year 2003 interest rate assumptions resulted in  estimated subsidy costs totaling $2.4 billion, an increase of more than   $1.2 billion in subsidy costs, even though the estimate was calculated  across the same volume of loans. For FDLP consolidation loans, the  analysis indicated that a greater interest rate spread between the discount  rate and the borrower rate for the fiscal year 2001 interest rate  assumptions, resulted in a net gain to the government totaling about   $645 million or about $264 million more than the gain under the actual  fiscal year 2002 estimates. In contrast, the fiscal year 2003 interest rate  assumptions resulted in an estimated subsidy cost to the government  totaling about $370 million, a change of about $751 million. This increase  is primarily due to the negative interest rate spread in which the borrower  rate used in fiscal year 2003 was less than the discount rate used in the  fiscal year 2003 interest rate assumptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administration Costs Also Increase, but Mainly Because of Loan Volume", "paragraphs": ["Loan volume affects administrative costs, in that cost is in part a function  of the number of loans originated and serviced during the year.

Consequently, we were unable to determine the total administration costs  incurred by consolidation loan programs or any off-setting administrative  cost reductions associated with the prepayment of loans underlying  consolidation loans. However, based on available Education data, we were  able to determine some of the direct costs associated with the origination,  servicing and collection of FDLP consolidation loans. For fiscal year 2002,  these costs totaled roughly $52.3 million. This total includes approximately  $31 million for loan origination, $19 million for loan servicing, and   $3 million for loan collection.

These options include provisions for combining multiple loan  payments into one and for restructuring the repayment terms or  lengthening the repayment period in order to lower monthly repayment  amounts. However, these options are limited, in some cases, to borrowers  who have loans with one lender, or whose loan balances meet certain  criteria. These options also differ from the consolidation loan program in  that they carry a variable borrower interest rate, while consolidation loans  allow borrowers to lock in a fixed interest rate. In today\u2019s environment,  with current low interest rates that are expected to rise over time, the  ability to lock in a low fixed rate may affect many borrowers\u2019 decisions  about which approach to take.

For example, when Congress  created the FDLP in 1993, Education provided FDLP borrowers with the  ability to combine payments on multiple FDLP loans into a single  payment. Similarly, in 1999, Education promulgated regulations requiring  FFELP lenders to combine all of a borrower\u2019s FFELP loans into a single  account to be repaid under a single repayment schedule. Furthermore,  Congress has provided borrowers with a number of repayment plans that  give certain FFELP and FDLP borrowers who do not consolidate their  loans flexibility to reduce monthly payment amounts in a variety of ways.  For example, \u201cgraduated\u201d and \u201cincome-sensitive\u201d repayment plans  introduced in 1992, allow borrowers to make smaller payments early in a  repayment period, followed by larger payments in future years. (These  plans assume that a borrower\u2019s income will increase over the repayment  period.) While borrowers who use the FFELP graduated and income- sensitive repayment plans must generally repay their loans over a   10-year period, another repayment plan\u2014\u201cextended\u201d\u2014allows certain  FFELP borrowers to lengthen their repayment terms up to 25 years, thus  reducing monthly repayment amounts.

Depending on prevailing interest rates and  borrowers\u2019 expectations about future interest rates, this difference may  affect the decisions that borrowers make regarding whether to obtain a  consolidation loan or use other options to combine payments, lower  payments, and extend repayment periods. When interest rates are low, as  they are now, and are expected to increase in the future, a consolidation  loan that carries a low fixed interest rate may be more attractive to  borrowers because a variable rate may exceed the fixed rate during most  or all of the remaining repayment period, which could be up to 30 years.  However, if rates are expected to decrease in the future, repayment  options that carry a variable rate may be more attractive, and borrowers  may choose other options over consolidation, hoping to take advantage of  lower rates in the future. Since it is difficult to predict interest rates over a  lengthy period, borrowers need to be aware of all the risks involved before  they make their final decision. Once student loans are consolidated, the  interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan and, under current law,  borrowers generally cannot reconsolidate their existing consolidation  loans to take advantage of lower interest rates. Consequently, borrowers  who chose to consolidate their student loans several years ago\u2014and  locked in what are now high rates relative to what borrowers can now  obtain\u2014are unable to take advantage of the current rate. For example,  borrowers who consolidated between February and June 1999, have a  locked rate of 8.25 percent. Borrowers who elected to consolidate  between July 2002 and June 2003 received a rate of 4 percent, and for   2004, the rate is expected to be about 3.5 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Borrowers\u2019 Choices between Fixed or Variable Rate Alternatives Affect Federal Costs", "paragraphs": ["The choices that borrowers ultimately make will have consequences for  federal costs. As previously discussed, federal costs for FFELP  consolidation loans have recently increased because of the greater  difference between borrowers\u2019 fixed low interest rate and the variable rate  guaranteed to lenders, which is expected to increase in the future. In this  situation, were borrowers to choose an alternative option, costs to the  federal government would likely be less because a variable borrower rate  would increase along with the variable rate guaranteed to lenders and the  difference between the two rates would be less. This decreased difference  would result in decreased FFELP federal subsidy costs. If circumstances  were different, however, federal subsidy costs could increase. For  example, if borrowers obtained a consolidation loan with a fixed interest  rate at a time when rates were expected to decrease in the future, federal  subsidy costs would be lower, than is currently the case, because the  borrower rate would likely exceed the rate guaranteed to lenders, and the  federal government would not be required to pay a SAP. In such situations,  if borrowers were to choose an alternative option with variable borrower  rates, federal subsidy costs could increase because the borrower rate  would decline along with the variable rate guaranteed to lenders. In this  case, the decreased difference could result in increased FFELP federal  subsidy costs, if SAP payments became necessary.", "Borrowers\u2019 choices between fixed and variable rate loans and among  repayment periods also affect costs to the federal government associated  with FDLP loans. A significant driver of FDLP costs, as previously  discussed, is the difference between the discount rate and the borrower  rate. In general, higher borrower rates will result in Education receiving  larger interest payments from borrowers, thus decreasing federal costs.    Allowing borrowers to lock in a low fixed rate might result in decreased  federal revenues if the variable interest rates on those loans borrowers  converted to a consolidation loan would have otherwise increased in the  future.  For both programs, federal costs are also affected by the  repayment period chosen by borrowers. For example, longer FFELP  repayment periods can result in the federal government making special  allowance payments to lenders over a longer period of time.

As a result, many borrowers may find that  consolidation loans remain the only option for combining loans and  lowering their monthly repayments. While consolidation loans may thus  remain an important tool to help borrowers manage their educational debt  and thus reduce the cost of student loan defaults, the surge in the number  of borrowers consolidating their loans suggests that many borrowers who  face little risk of default are choosing consolidation as a way of obtaining  low fixed interest rates\u2014an economically rational choice on the part of  borrowers. If borrowers continue to consolidate their loans in the current  low interest rate environment, and interest rates rise, the government  assumes the cost of larger interest subsidies for FFELP consolidation  loans. Providing for these larger interest subsidies on behalf of a broad  spectrum of borrowers, however, may outweigh any government savings  associated with the reduced costs of loan defaults for the smaller number  of borrowers who might default in the absence of the repayment flexibility  offered by consolidation loans. For FDLP consolidation loans, allowing  borrowers to lock in a low fixed rate might result in decreased federal  revenues if the variable interest rates on those loans borrowers converted  to a consolidation loan would have otherwise increased in the future. The  exact effects of FDLP consolidation loans, however, depend on a number  of factors, including the length of loan repayment periods, borrower  interest rates, and discount rates. Restructuring the consolidation loan  program to specifically target borrowers who are experiencing difficulty in  managing their student loan debt and at risk of default, and/or who are  unable to simplify and reduce repayment amounts by using existing  alternatives, might reduce overall federal costs by reducing the volume of  consolidation loans made.
