The strategy lays out a national framework to be implemented by NMFS' regions but does not provide specific guidance on how climate information should be incorporated into the fisheries management process. An NMFS official said that developing such guidance has not been an agency priority, but as knowledge on climate change progresses there is a more pressing need to incorporate climate information into fisheries management decision making. Developing such guidance would align with federal standards for internal control and may help NMFS ensure consistency in how its regions and the Councils factor climate-related risks into fisheries management. In addition, NMFS has not developed agency-wide performance measures to track progress toward the strategy's overall objectives, a leading practice. NMFS officials said they are waiting to finalize regional action plans for implementing the strategy before determining whether such measures may be necessary. GAO reviewed the proposed measures in NMFS' draft regional action plans and found that they aligned with some key attributes of successful performance measures. But, most of the measures did not contain other key attributes, such as measurable targets.

Accounting for the potential effects of climate  change injects an additional source of uncertainty and risk into the  fisheries management process. The federal government has recognized  the need to account for climate change risks in its planning and programs  and has called on agencies to take certain actions. For example, the  President issued Executive Order 13653 in 2013, directing federal  agencies to develop or update comprehensive climate change adaptation  plans that among other things identify climate-related impacts on and  risks to an agency\u2019s ability to accomplish its missions, operations, and  programs and describe the actions the agency will take to manage  climate risks.

These effects will not be uniform across fish stocks but  rather will likely vary, with the abundance of some stocks being negatively  affected and the abundance of other stocks increasing or not being  affected, according to NMFS documentation. Similarly, potential shifts in  distribution will vary, as some fish stocks may respond to changing ocean  temperatures by moving north or to deeper waters in search of the water  temperatures they are accustomed to, but shifts in other directions may  occur as well.

NMFS officials in the Alaska region said that they  can project some future effects of warming ocean temperatures on the  abundance of walleye pollock. For instance, the officials told us that  research indicates warming ocean temperatures could lead to a  mismatch between the size of the pollock population and the  availability of food sources for pollock to consume. Unusually warm  winters in the Alaska region in the early 2000s caused seasonal ice to  retreat earlier and farther than normal, which led to reductions in the  amount of zooplankton available for young pollock to eat, according to  NMFS officials. When young fish do not have sufficient food in their  first year of life, the likelihood they will survive is reduced, and  according to NMFS officials, the reduction in zooplankton led to a  reduction in the pollock population. The officials did not attribute the  warmer ocean temperatures during this time to climate change, but  they said this event helped them forecast potential future climate  effects by providing an opportunity to observe how pollock respond to  changes in the environment similar to those anticipated from climate  change. However, NMFS officials we interviewed said that making  further predictions about the magnitude of potential climate change  effects on the abundance and distribution of pollock is difficult  because of the limited amount of climate-related information specific  to the species. Agency officials told us that additional research is  under way to better understand the effects of warmer ocean  temperatures on pollock.", "To better understand which fish species may be most vulnerable to  climate change, NMFS initiated an effort to systematically assess the  vulnerability of marine species to a changing climate. Specifically, in  2015, NMFS developed a methodology for conducting climate  vulnerability assessments for marine species using a combination of  quantitative data, qualitative information, and expert opinion. The agency  has used this methodology to complete an assessment for marine fish  and invertebrate species that commonly occur in the Greater Atlantic  region, which it published in February 2016. As of August 2016, NMFS  had climate vulnerability assessments under way for species in its other  four regions, according to agency officials. The assessment in the  Greater Atlantic region found that approximately half of the 82 species  assessed in the region were estimated to have a high or very high  vulnerability to climate change, with the other half having low or moderate  vulnerability. The assessment defined climate vulnerability as the extent  to which the abundance or productivity of a species could be affected by  climate change and natural long-term variability in ocean conditions.  Similarly, more than half of the species were estimated to have a high or  very high potential to shift their distribution in response to projected  changes in the climate. The assessment also provided a summary of the  existing scientific knowledge about the expected effects on different  species in the region but did not quantify the magnitude of the expected  effects for individual species. NMFS officials told us that the assessment  was not designed to provide that type of quantitative information. Instead,  the officials said the information provided by the assessments could be  used to help determine which species should be the subject of additional  research to help quantify potential climate effects in the future. The  vulnerability assessment completed in the Greater Atlantic region  provides illustrations of the range of ways that species may be affected by  climate change, as reflected in the following examples.", "Atlantic Cod  Atlantic cod have a large head, blunt snout,  and a distinct barbel (a whisker-like organ, like  on a catfish) under the lower jaw.

According to the NMFS climate vulnerability  assessment, the abundance of Atlantic cod is likely to be negatively  affected by warming ocean temperatures in the Northeast.  Specifically, the assessment indicated that warmer ocean  temperatures may be linked with a lower number of juvenile cod that  survive and grow to a size sufficient to enter the fishery each year.  The assessment also found that continued ocean warming could  produce less-favorable habitat conditions for cod in the southern end  of its range. Atlantic cod have experienced a decline in abundance in  recent decades, and warming ocean temperatures may have  contributed to this decline, according to NMFS and Council officials in  the Greater Atlantic region. The officials further indicated, however,  that the extent to which changing temperatures played a role in the  cod decline is unclear because it is difficult to isolate this factor from  other contributing factors, such as overfishing.", "Black Sea Bass  Black sea bass are usually black with a  slightly paler belly and a dorsal fin that is  marked with a series of white spots and  bands.

This trend is likely to continue as ocean temperatures warm  and become more favorable for the fish, according to the NMFS  climate vulnerability assessment. The assessment also indicated that  the abundance of black sea bass in more northern areas will likely  increase as temperatures warm and more spawning occurs.  According to NMFS and Council officials and other fisheries  stakeholders, changes in the abundance and distribution of black sea  bass could present a challenge for fisheries managers because  commercial fishing rights have been allocated to states based on  historical catch data that may not reflect where the fish are found in  the future.", "American Lobster  The American lobster is a crustacean with a  large shrimp-like body with eight legs and two  claws.

In 2014,  lobster\u2019s commercial harvest was valued at  approximately $567.3 million, which made it  one of the most economically valuable  fisheries in the country that year, according to  NMFS data.", "American lobster. The overall effect of climate change on lobster  abundance is estimated to be neutral, as population decreases in the  southern portion of its range have been offset by increases in the  north, according to the NMFS climate vulnerability assessment. NMFS  officials in the Greater Atlantic region said that these population  changes are believed to be driven in large part by warming ocean  temperatures. Specifically, officials said that as ocean conditions in  southern New England have become less favorable to lobsters  because of increasing ocean temperatures, the abundance of the  southern stock has declined. In contrast, the abundance of the  northern stock has increased as temperature changes in the Gulf of  Maine (where waters are generally colder) have produced more  favorable conditions for lobster. NMFS has not been able to quantify  the magnitude of expected future changes in lobster abundance in the  region, however, in part because it is difficult to accurately forecast  changes in ocean temperatures more than a few months out,  according to agency officials. Additionally, NMFS officials indicated  that changing ocean conditions can affect the timing of biological  events in the lobster\u2019s life cycle, which may subsequently alter the  seasonal abundance of the stocks in a way that may cause  disruptions to the fishing industry. For instance, in 2012, warmer-than- usual ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Maine resulted in American  lobsters growing to market size earlier than usual, according to NMFS  documentation. As a result, lobsters were harvested early, but some  lobster processing facilities were not yet ready to receive them, which  led to an abundance of supply for the fishermen and a drop in the  market price they received for their harvest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NMFS and the Councils Identified Several Challenges to Better Understand the Effects of Climate Change on Fish Stocks", "paragraphs": ["Through the questionnaire responses and our interviews, NMFS and  Council officials identified several challenges to better understand the  existing and anticipated effects of climate change on fish stocks as well  as efforts they are taking to address some of these challenges, including:", "Understanding how climate change may affect fish stocks.

NMFS officials explained that it can be difficult, for  instance, to understand how water temperature changes may affect  the biology of specific fish stocks or may indirectly affect their habitat  and interactions with other species within that habitat. Officials from  one NMFS region said that they do not have a sufficient  understanding of the processes that drive fish stock productivity\u2014 including their birth, growth, and death rates\u2014in their region, or how  those processes may be affected by climate change. Officials from  several other NMFS regions and Councils shared similar views and  noted that this challenge limits their ability to understand the overall  effects that climate change may have on different fish stocks.", "Availability of baseline data. NMFS and several of the Councils  reported that insufficient baseline data at times limit their ability to  predict the effects of various changes in the climate on fish stocks.  Baseline data include oceanographic information, such as water  temperature in different regions and depths; information about a fish  stock, such as temperature preference and spawning history; and  ecological information, such as the type of plants or animals available  as a food source for a particular stock or its role in a food web. For  example, NMFS officials told us that sea surface temperature data are  widely available in most regions but that data on subsurface  temperatures are limited. The officials attributed the difference in the  availability of these two types of data to the ability to use satellites to  measure sea surface temperatures, whereas the collection of  subsurface temperature data is more difficult and requires  measurements to be taken directly from the ocean. NMFS officials  said that the lack of subsurface temperature data limits their ability to  research and determine potential effects of changing temperatures on  bottom-dwelling fish stocks, such as the American lobster. The  officials told us that NOAA has increased its efforts to utilize  technologies such as ocean gliders\u2014autonomous underwater  vehicles used to collect ocean data\u2014to track subsurface ocean  conditions and collect additional baseline data. For example, in 2014  NOAA partnered with other scientists to launch two ocean gliders in  the Gulf of Alaska to collect data for 5 months on water temperature,  salinity, and dissolved oxygen, among other things.", "Summer Flounder  Summer flounder are flatfish, with both eyes  located on the left side of the body when  viewed from above, with the dorsal fin facing  up.

The stock is  cooperatively managed by the National Marine  Fisheries Service\u2019s (NMFS) Greater Atlantic  region, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management  Council, and the Atlantic States Marine  Fisheries Commission. Summer flounder are  one of the most sought after commercial and  recreational fish along the Atlantic coast, and  in 2014, the commercial harvest was valued at  approximately $32.3 million, according to  NMFS data.", "Distinguishing between climate change and other factors. It can  be challenging to determine whether a change in a fish stock\u2019s  abundance or distribution is caused by climate change; natural  variation in the oceans; or other human or environmental factors, such  as overfishing or pollution, according to NMFS and some Council  officials. Isolating the effects of climate change from other factors is  difficult, and the complexities of trying to understand the ways in  which these factors interact also present challenges, according to the  officials. For example, NMFS officials in the Greater Atlantic region  said that populations of summer flounder have increased in recent  years after experiencing significant declines from overfishing in the  1970s and 1980s, and that summer flounder are being found in  greater numbers in northern areas, such as the Gulf of Maine. The  officials said that changes in fishing levels are likely driving the  increase in summer flounder abundance and their increased presence  in northern areas, but also suggested that warming ocean  temperatures may have played a role.", "Modeling capabilities. NMFS and most of the Councils identified  limitations in climate and fisheries modeling capabilities as a  challenge to better understand the effects of climate change on  fisheries. For example, according to NMFS officials, one important  step to improving the ability to project the effects of climate change on  specific fish stocks will be to downscale global ocean climate models,  such as models of changes in ocean temperatures, to more regional  and local levels that can then be used to assess climate effects on the  fish stocks that inhabit those locations. Agency officials described  this type of information as foundational knowledge that is generally  not yet available across the NMFS regions, in part because it is  resource intensive to develop. The officials said that NMFS considers  the development of downscaled climate models that can be used to  support fisheries management to be a critical need, and that efforts  are under way to develop such models in some NMFS regions. For  example, NMFS is funding a project to help downscale global climate  models for some of the major rivers and estuaries in the Northeast,  such as the Chesapeake Bay, that are crucial habitats for many  commercial, recreational, and protected species.", "Resources. NMFS and most of the Councils identified constrained  resources as a challenge to expanding climate-related data collection  and analysis efforts. For instance, according to NMFS officials at one  Fisheries Science Center, developing climate science for fisheries  management requires extensive new modeling to assess and project  current and future fishery conditions, including how fish stock  abundance and distribution may change under changing physical and  chemical ocean conditions. However, the officials said that staff  capacity to conduct this work is limited because of existing modeling  demands for stock assessments. Similarly, officials from one Council  told us that additional staff and resources would be required to  incorporate climate-related information into their work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NMFS Developed a Strategy to Help Incorporate Climate Information into Fisheries Management, but It Is in the Early Stages of Implementation", "paragraphs": ["NMFS has developed a strategy to help it and the Councils incorporate  climate information\u2014such as information on changes in ocean  temperatures and acidity levels and the risks to fish stocks associated  with those changes\u2014into the fisheries management process, but is in the  early stages of implementing the strategy. Through our analysis, we  found that NMFS and the Councils have generally not incorporated  climate information into the fisheries management process to date  because the information they have on the effects of climate change on  most fish stocks has not been sufficient. However, recognizing the  importance of further developing climate information and incorporating it  into the fisheries management process, NMFS published its NOAA  Fisheries Climate Science Strategy in August 2015. The Strategy is  intended to support efforts by the agency and its partners to increase the  production, delivery, and use of climate information in managing fish and  other living marine resources. According to the Strategy, failing to  adequately incorporate climate change considerations into fisheries  management and conservation efforts could cause those efforts to be  ineffective, produce negative results, or miss opportunities. Determining  how information on the effects of climate change can be incorporated into  the fisheries management process is a key question that NMFS must  address, according to the Strategy.", "The Strategy lays out a national framework that is to be regionally tailored  and implemented. NMFS officials said that the agency\u2019s regions  (including its regional offices and regional Fisheries Science Centers) will  have primary responsibility for implementing the Strategy, and those  offices are in the process of developing regional action plans to describe  how they will do so. NMFS has directed its regions to develop regional  action plans that identify specific actions each region will take over the  next 5 years to implement the Strategy and include the region\u2019s  assessment of its priorities and available resources, among other things.  As of July 2016, four of NMFS\u2019 five regions had released draft versions of  their regional action plans for public comment, and agency officials said  that they expect all of the regions to finalize their plans by October 2016.  The officials said that NMFS headquarters has provided input on the draft  plans and will work with the NMFS Science Board to review and approve  the final plans.", "The Strategy recognizes the importance of incorporating climate  information into the fisheries management process but does not provide  specific guidance on how this is to be done. For example, the Strategy  notes the importance of factoring climate information into stock  assessments but does not include specific guidance on how such  information should be incorporated into developing the assessments.  Historically, fish stock assessments primarily considered the effects of  fishing when estimating the abundance of individual fish stocks and have  not accounted for ecosystem factors, including effects from changes in  the climate. This traditional approach has been effective for assessing  present and historical abundance levels but may not be effective in  forecasting future levels because it does not account for effects related to  changing environmental conditions, according to NMFS documentation.  NMFS and Council officials said that factoring climate information more  widely into stock assessments in the future will be important, given the  changing climate conditions and particularly because stock assessments  often provide the scientific basis for management decisions, including  setting annual catch limits. The Strategy also states that including  climate-related data to inform reference points (the limits or targets used  to guide management decisions), where appropriate, is critical to avoid  misaligned management targets for fish stocks, but the Strategy does not  provide specific guidance on how this is to be done. In addition, the  Strategy calls for NMFS to complete climate vulnerability assessments for  all regions as an initial priority action but does not specify how NMFS  regions and the Councils should use the results of the assessments to  inform management decisions or incorporate them into the fisheries  management process.", "Without developing guidance on how climate information is to be  incorporated into specific aspects of the fisheries management process,  NMFS does not have reasonable assurance that all of its regions and the  Councils will consistently factor climate-related risks into fisheries  management. Under federal standards for internal control, agencies are  to clearly document internal controls, and the documentation is to appear  in management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals.  In addition, according to the International Organization for  Standardization, for risk management to be effective, it is important for  information on risks to be included as a part of decision making.  Moreover, developing guidance would be consistent with actions NMFS  has taken for other parts of its mission, according to the agency\u2019s Climate  Change Coordinator. The official noted that in January 2016, NMFS  developed guidance on using climate change information in the agency\u2019s  Endangered Species Act decisions, which could serve as a model for the  fisheries management process. The guidance provides direction on how  climate information should be incorporated into Endangered Species Act  management decisions and what types of climate information should be  used, among other things. NMFS has not yet developed similar guidance  for fisheries management because doing so was not previously  considered to be an immediate priority given the agency\u2019s limited  information on the anticipated effects of climate change on fish stocks  and the near-term focus of most fisheries management decisions,  according to NMFS\u2019 Climate Change Coordinator. The official said,  however, that as knowledge about the effects of climate change on  fisheries has progressed over time, NMFS has found an increased and  more pressing need to begin preparing for these effects in the near term.  By developing guidance on how the NMFS regions and Councils are to  incorporate climate information into different parts of the fisheries  management process, NMFS may help ensure consistency in how its  regions and the Councils factor climate-related risks into fisheries  management decision making.", "In addition, the Strategy lays out overall objectives to help identify the  agency\u2019s climate information needs and help better ensure effective  management in a changing climate, but does not contain agency-wide  performance measures to track progress in achieving the Strategy\u2019s  objectives. Specifically, the Strategy lays out seven interrelated, priority  objectives (see table 1).", "According to NMFS officials, the agency recognizes the potential benefit  of developing a comprehensive set of agency-wide performance  measures for the Strategy, but it has not specified when or how it may do  so because it is first focusing on completing the regional action plans.  NMFS has directed its regions to include performance measures in their  regional action plans outlining how they will implement the Strategy, and  agency officials told us that once the regional action plans are finalized in  October 2016, NMFS plans to revisit whether to develop agency-wide  performance measures for the Strategy. We have previously reported on  the importance of agencies using performance measures to track  progress in achieving their goals and to inform management decisions.  Moreover, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, as  amended, requires federal agencies to establish performance goals and  related performance measures to track progress in annual agency  performance plans, among other things. While these requirements apply  at the departmental level (e.g., Department of Commerce), we have  previously found that they also serve as leading practices in component  agencies, such as at NMFS, to assist with planning for individual  programs or initiatives that are particularly challenging. This is also in  line with federal standards for internal control, which identify the  establishment and review of performance measures as a control activity  that can help ensure that management\u2019s directives are carried out and  that actions are taken to address risks, among other things.", "According to NMFS guidance, the regional action plans are to identify  performance measures to document progress in implementing the  Strategy at the regional level. In reviewing the four draft regional action  plans that had been released as of July 2016, we found that three of the  draft plans contained proposed performance measures. Specifically, we  found that the measures each of the three regions proposed included  some key attributes of successful performance measures that we have  previously identified, such as being aligned with the Strategy\u2019s objectives  and having limited overlap (see app. II for the full list of key attributes).  However, most of the measures did not contain other key attributes. For  example, nearly all of the proposed measures contained in the three draft  plans did not include measurable targets, another key attribute of  successful performance measures. In some cases, the proposed  measures identified quantitative data to be tracked\u2014such as the number  of stock assessments or annual catch limits that include climate  information\u2014but there were no numerical targets identified that could  serve as a means for assessing progress. We have previously found that  including measurable targets in performance measures helps in  assessing whether performance is meeting expectations. NMFS officials  said that they recognized the importance of developing meaningful  performance measures. By incorporating key attributes associated with  successful performance measures in the final performance measures  developed for the plans and assessing whether agency-wide performance  measures may also be needed, NMFS may be in a better position to  determine the extent to which the objectives of the Strategy overall are  being achieved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Changing environmental conditions in the oceans, such as warming  temperatures, could affect the abundance and distribution of federally  managed fisheries in ways that may pose risks to the communities and  industries that depend on harvesting the affected fish. Such risks also  have potential implications for the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure  because commercial fishery failures may result in the federal government  providing fishery disaster assistance. NMFS has taken steps to help it  and the Councils better understand how climate change may affect the  fish stocks they manage, even as they face challenges related to the  availability of data and resources, among others. Recognizing the  importance of incorporating climate considerations into the fisheries  management process, NMFS has also developed its NOAA Fisheries  Climate Science Strategy to help increase the production, delivery, and  use of climate information.

For both objectives, to understand the legal  framework for fisheries management in the United States, we reviewed  the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of  1976, as amended, which governs marine fisheries management in  federal waters, including both commercial and recreational fishing. We  also reviewed our past work on fisheries management, climate change  adaptation, and risk management.", "To examine information NMFS and the Councils have about the effects of  climate change on federally managed fish stocks and the challenges they  face to better understand these effects, we reviewed scientific studies and  documentation prepared by NMFS, the Councils, and others such as  academics.

We selected  these entities to interview because they are involved in managing  fisheries in regions of the country that are expected to experience  significant effects from climate change, according to NMFS  documentation and our discussions with agency officials. We also  interviewed representatives from 11 stakeholder organizations  representing fishing, conservation, and Alaska Native interests to obtain a  broader range of views on the existing and anticipated effects of climate  change on fish stocks and the efforts of NMFS and the Councils to better  understand these effects.

We assessed the  reliability of NMFS\u2019 commercial fisheries data and found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of selecting our case study species.  The case study species are intended to provide illustrative examples and  cannot be generalized to the entire universe of fish species.
