Congress also enacted the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 (Act), which places new requirements on SBA to ensure it is prepared for catastrophic disasters. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which SBA has addressed the Act's requirements, and (2) how SBA's response to major disasters in 2008 aligned with key components of its June 2007 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). In completing this statement, GAO reviewed and updated, as appropriate, the July 2009 report, Small Business Administration: Additional Steps Should Be Taken to Address Reforms to the Disaster Loan Program and Improve the Application Process for Future Disasters (GAO-09-755). In that report, GAO recommended that SBA should fulfill the Act's region-specific marketing and outreach requirements; complete its annual report to Congress; issue an updated DRP; develop an implementation plan for remaining requirements; and develop procedures to further improve the application process for the Disaster Loan Program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["SBA has made some progress since GAO's July 2009 report in addressing provisions of the Act and continued attention to certain provisions will be important for sustained progress. As of May 2010, SBA met requirements for 15 of 26 provisions of the Act and partially addressed 6. Five provisions do not require any action at this time. Since July 2009 SBA has taken a number of actions. For example, SBA issued an updated DRP in November 2009. In addition, SBA issued regulations on coordinating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on timely submission of disaster assistance applications. SBA also has taken steps to address the Act's requirements for region-specific marketing and outreach. For example, SBA has begun a dialogue with the Small Business Development Center state directors in the Gulf Coast about disseminating disaster planning information in the five most hurricane-prone states before the hurricane season. However, these steps have not been discussed in public documents or venues, such as in the DRP or on the SBA Web site, which would make the information more transparent and easily accessible to the public and Congress. SBA officials told GAO the agency has not yet completely addressed some provisions because the agency must make extensive changes to current programs or implement new programs. In particular, for two requirements that will involve private lenders, SBA plans to implement pilots before finalizing regulations. SBA officials recently said that they had formed a cross-functional work group and began reaching out to lenders about the planned pilots. SBA has not yet developed an implementation plan with milestone dates for addressing the remaining requirements, but recently said it would provide a plan or report that included milestone dates for addressing the Act's requirements. SBA's initial response after the 2008 Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike aligned with certain components of its initial DRP, such as using technology and outreach efforts to better ensure timely assistance. The individuals GAO interviewed and results from SBA's 2008 Disaster Loan Program Customer Satisfaction Survey provided somewhat positive feedback about SBA's performance following the disasters. However, interviewees and survey results indicated areas for improvement; in particular, both indicated that application paperwork was burdensome and that the application process needed improvement. The agency did not appear to have a formal process for identifying problems in the application process and making needed improvements. SBA officials told GAO that they have been taking steps to improve the application process. However, SBA has not provided information to GAO on how it would implement a formal process to address identified problem areas in the disaster loan application process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on reforms made to the  Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Disaster Loan Program. As you  know, SBA plays a critical role in assisting the victims of natural and other  declared disasters. SBA provides financial assistance through its Disaster  Loan Program to help homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and  nonprofits recover from disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and  terrorist attacks. Since the agency\u2019s inception in 1953, SBA has approved  more than $47 billion in disaster loans for homeowners, businesses, and  nonprofits.", "After the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes (Katrina, Rita, and Wilma), SBA faced  an unprecedented demand for disaster loans, while also being confronted  with a significant backlog of applications; therefore, hundreds of  thousands of loans were not disbursed in a timely way. Many criticized  SBA for what was perceived to be a slow and confusing response to the  disasters and one that exposed many deficiencies in the agency\u2019s Disaster  Loan Program and demonstrated the need for reform. As a result,  Congress and SBA agreed that the program needed significant  improvements. Since then, SBA has taken several steps to reform its  Disaster Loan Program including creating an online loan application,  increasing the capacity of its Disaster Credit Management System (DCMS),  and developing a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). In June 2008, Congress  enacted the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements  Act (Act) which places new requirements on SBA to ensure that it is  prepared for future catastrophic disasters.", "My statement today is based on our 2009 report and updated information  on SBA\u2019s progress in addressing the Act\u2019s requirements and our report\u2019s  recommendations. Specifically, this statement focuses on (1) SBA\u2019s  progress in addressing certain requirements of the Act, and (2) how SBA\u2019s  response, following the major disasters of 2008, aligned with key  components of its June 2007 DRP.", "For our 2009 report, we identified and analyzed the requirements of the  Act and related statutory deadlines; obtained information about SBA\u2019s  completed, current, and planned reform efforts; reviewed documents and  progress reports to determine if requirements had been addressed and  deadlines were met; interviewed officials and obtained information on  what, if any, challenges exist that may affect SBA\u2019s ability to meet certain  requirements; and interviewed officials to obtain information about next  steps and resources that the agency identified as needed to address any  remaining requirements. We visited Iowa and Texas, and obtained  information on SBA\u2019s performance in the aftermath of the 2008 Midwest  floods and Hurricane Ike. We interviewed SBA and Small Business  Development Center (SBDC) officials, state and local officials, and  representatives of local Chambers of Commerce, economic development  organizations, and affected small business owners about what worked  well and what improvements to SBA\u2019s disaster loan processes they would  suggest. Finally, we reviewed results from a survey of SBA loan applicants  on their satisfaction with SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program in 2008. To update  this information, we interviewed SBA officials and reviewed documents  related to the disaster reform provisions and actions taken to implement  our recommendations.", "We conducted our work for the July 2009 report between October 2008  and July 2009 and updated information between March 2010 and May 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Rather, local government emergency services assume that role with help  from state and volunteer agencies. For catastrophic disasters, and if a  governor requests it, federal resources can be mobilized through the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA). SBA typically responds to a disaster within 3 days by  sending ODA field staff to the affected area to begin providing public  information about SBA\u2019s services.", "Once a disaster is declared, SBA by law is authorized to make two types of  disaster loans: (1) physical disaster loans, and (2) economic injury disaster  loans. Physical disaster loans are for the permanent rebuilding and  replacement of uninsured or underinsured disaster-damaged property,  including personal residences and businesses of any size. That is, SBA  provides loans to cover repair costs that FEMA or other insurance has not  already fully compensated or covered. Economic injury disaster loans  provide small businesses, including agricultural cooperatives and private  nonprofit organizations, with necessary working capital until normal  operations can resume.", "The Act comprises 26 provisions with substantive requirements for SBA;  some with specific deadlines and some needing appropriations, and  includes requirements that SBA must meet for disaster planning and  response, disaster lending, and reporting. For instance, the Act includes  provisions to improve SBA\u2019s coordination with FEMA, require that the  agency conduct biennial disaster simulations, create a comprehensive  disaster response plan, and improve communication with the public when  disaster assistance is made available. It includes requirements to improve  ODA\u2019s infrastructure, appoint an official to oversee the disaster planning  and responsibilities of the agency, and establish reporting requirements  for various reports to Congress.

However,  the steps recently taken by SBA have not been discussed in public  documents or venues, such as in the DRP or on the SBA Web site, which  would make the information more transparent and easily accessible to public and Congress.

SBA officials recently told us they have  established a cross-functional work group jointly chaired by officia ODA and the Office of Capital Access to address these requirements and develop the pilots. ODA officials said they drafted regulations and  received subsidy and administrative cost funding in the 2010 budget to  allow them to pilot test about 600 loans under the Immediate Disaster  Assistance Program (section 12084).

To  address these concerns,  the individuals we interviewed suggested several changes to the program, such as eliminating the requirement that business loan applicants provide copies of IRS tax records; providing partial disbursements earlier in the  process; using bridge loans to help ensure disaster victims receive timely  assistance; and involving SBA, SBDCs, and state and local officials in joint  pre-planning and disaster preparedness efforts.", "Although SBA officials told us they have been improving the application  ion,  process, they had not documented the improvement efforts.
