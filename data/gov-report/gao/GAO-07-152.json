Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), tank owners and operators are primarily responsible for paying to clean up releases from their tanks. They can demonstrate their financial responsibility by using, among other options, publicly funded state financial assurance funds. Such funds function like insurance and are intended to ensure timely cleanup. These funds also pay to clean up releases from tanks without a viable owner, as does the federal Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund. GAO was asked to report on (1) states' estimates of the public costs to clean up known releases, (2) states' primary sources of cleanups funding and their viability, and (3) federal sources to address these releases. GAO surveyed all states and discussed key issues with EPA and selected state officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["States estimated that fully cleaning up about 54,000 of the approximately 117,000 releases (leaks) known to them as of September 30, 2005, will cost about $12 billion in public funds. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that it costs an average of about $125,000 to fully clean up a release. State officials said that tank owners or operators will pay to clean up most of the remaining 63,000 releases. However, an unknown number of releases lack a viable owner, and the full extent of the cost to clean them up is unknown. A tank owner may not be viable because the owner fails to maintain adequate financial responsibility coverage, which is intended to provide some assurance that the owner has access to funds to pay for cleanups. While 16 states require annual proof of coverage, 25 states check owners' coverage less often or not at all. Furthermore, 43 states expect to confirm about 16,700 new releases in the next 5 years that will require at least some public funds for cleanup. States reported that they primarily use financial assurance funds to pay the costs of cleaning up leaks. States reported that they spent an estimated $1.032 billion from financial assurance funds to clean up tank releases in 2005. Overall, fund revenues totaled about $1.4 billion in 2005, of which about $1.3 billion came from state gasoline taxes. The assurance funds in the 39 states for which GAO has information held an estimated $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2005, according to state officials. However, many states also use these funds to clean up releases from sources other than underground tanks. Several state assurance funds may lack sufficient resources to ensure timely cleanups. While EPA monitors the status of state funds, its method of monitoring the soundness of these funds has limitations. Furthermore, there are concerns that, by paying the bulk of the cleanup costs, state financial assurance funds may provide disincentives for tank owners--who pay only a relatively small deductible--to prevent releases. In addition to their own funds, states employ resources from the LUST Trust Fund, the primary federal source of funds for cleaning up releases from underground storage tanks. As of September 30, 2005, the fund balance was about $2.5 billion. For fiscal year 2005, the Congress appropriated about $70 million from the fund to help EPA and the states clean up releases and to oversee cleanup activities. EPA distributed about $58 million of this amount to the states to investigate and clean up releases and conduct enforcement efforts, among other actions. To distribute LUST Trust Fund money among the states, EPA uses a formula that includes a base amount for each state and factors to recognize states' needs and past cleanup performance. However, although the LUST Trust Fund provides funds to states to assist in addressing releases from tanks without a viable owner, EPA has not incorporated this factor into its formula. Furthermore, EPA's information on states' performance comes from state reports; however, GAO found that some of the information in these reports is inaccurate and inconsistent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Underground storage tanks that leak petroleum or other hazardous  substances can contaminate nearby soil and groundwater, which serves as  the source of drinking water for nearly half of all Americans. Individuals  coming into contact with this contamination, which can contain known  carcinogens, could experience health problems ranging from nausea to  kidney or liver damage. According to the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), about 450,000 releases from underground storage tanks had been  confirmed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1985 and  September 30, 2005\u2014the most recent year for which comprehensive data  were available. In the past 20 years, EPA and states have spent over $10  billion in public funds to clean up these releases. Despite these efforts, as  of September 30, 2005, over 100,000 releases had not yet been fully cleaned  up.", "In 1984, the Congress amended the Resource Conservation and Recovery  Act (RCRA) to require EPA to develop release detection, prevention, and  cleanup regulations that apply to owners and operators of underground  storage tanks. In response, EPA began developing the Underground  Storage Tank (UST) program in 1985 to prevent releases of petroleum and  hazardous substances into the environment, detect releases when they  occur, and clean up any contamination from a release. Under RCRA, tank  owners and operators must register with a designated state or local agency  underground tanks that store petroleum or hazardous substances. EPA and  the states then track and regulate these tanks. EPA\u2019s UST Program is  primarily implemented by the states; EPA maintains responsibility for  program implementation on lands owned by Indian tribes and in Idaho  because that state does not have the necessary laws in place. EPA also  maintains responsibility for taking enforcement actions in New York  because the state lacks the necessary laws. EPA\u2019s primary role has been to  provide national guidance, assistance, and leadership to aid the states in  implementing their programs.", "Under RCRA, owners and operators of tank systems are primarily  responsible for funding the cleanup of releases from underground storage  tanks. However, under some circumstances, such as where an emergency  exists, EPA or a state may pay for the cleanup and then seek  reimbursement from the responsible private party. In order to operate,  owners and operators must demonstrate that they have access to resources  to meet their financial responsibility to cover cleanup costs. Owners and  operators may use a variety of assets to meet this financial responsibility,  including letters of credit, commercial insurance, and other options.", "Some states have established EPA-approved state assurance funds that,  like commercial insurance, are another means by which owners and  operators can demonstrate their financial responsibility coverage. While  the circumstances vary under which states use these funds to clean up  releases, state financial assurance funds\u2014like commercial insurance\u2014 typically pay cleanup costs either directly to cleanup contractors or by  reimbursing tank owners and operators for some or all of the expenses of  cleaning up leaking tank sites in return for the payment of a deductible  amount. In addition to assisting known, solvent owners and operators with  cleanup costs in this manner, some state financial assurance funds also pay  the costs to clean up releases from tanks for which the owners or operators  are not \u201cviable\u201d\u2014that is, they are unknown, unwilling, or unable to perform  the cleanup. States typically raise money for the funds through gasoline  taxes paid by the public and tank registration fees paid by tank owners or  operators.", "Finally, the federal government\u2014through the Leaking Underground  Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, which was established in 1986  amendments to RCRA\u2014also provides public funding to ensure that  releases from tanks are cleaned up. The LUST Trust Fund provides money  to states for (1) overseeing and enforcing cleanup actions taken by a tank  owner or operator and (2) cleaning up leaks at tank sites, including those  without a viable owner, or at sites that require emergency action. The fund  is capitalized through a $0.001/gallon excise tax on gasoline and other  motor fuels and the interest that accrues to the fund balance annually. The  Congress annually appropriates amounts from the LUST Trust Fund to  EPA, which in turn distributes the majority of the funds to help states that  have entered into cooperative agreements with the agency to implement  their cleanup programs.", "In this context, you asked us to determine (1) states\u2019 estimates of the cost  in public funding from state and federal sources to clean up known releases  from underground storage tanks, (2) states\u2019 primary sources of funding for  addressing these releases and the sources\u2019 future viability, and (3) the  funding available from federal sources to address these releases. For the  purposes of this report we defined public funding as including any funding  controlled and/or provided by state and federal agencies, such as funds  from the federal LUST Trust Fund, state financial assurance funds, and  other funds appropriated by states to pay for cleanup that would not  otherwise occur.", "To obtain estimates of the cost to the public to clean up known releases, we  surveyed state officials responsible for underground storage tank programs  or, where applicable, managers of state cleanup funds, in the 50 states and  the District of Columbia. Only one state, South Dakota, did not respond to  our survey. Through the survey, we gathered state officials\u2019 estimates as of  September 30, 2005, of the current number of known releases that have not  yet been cleaned up, the number of releases that will require public funding  to clean up, and the amount of public funding these cleanups will require.  We also relied on our survey to gather information about state sources of  funding used to address releases, the status of these sources, and their  future viability. Because of differences in the time frames used by states to  answer certain survey questions, we refer to data from such questions as  2005 data in this report. We asked a series of questions in the survey to  allow us to assess the reliability of the information provided by states. We  determined that the survey data are sufficiently reliable as they are used in  the body of the report (i.e., to be presented in aggregate, as testimonial  evidence). The survey data presented in appendix II are not reliable for  state level comparisons but are presented to illustrate the range of state  responses and associated reliability issues. We also interviewed officials  from eight states\u2014Florida, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania,  South Carolina, and Utah\u2014to gather additional information regarding their  sources of cleanup money, among other issues. To obtain information  about the funding available from federal sources, we interviewed  Department of the Treasury officials responsible for managing the LUST  Trust Fund and gathered documentation regarding the balance of the fund,  annual revenues and expenditures, and appropriations of money to EPA.  We also interviewed EPA officials to learn how money from this fund flows  from EPA to individual states. To gather additional information about state  and federal funding available to address releases, we conducted interviews  with regional program officials from EPA\u2019s UST program in six EPA  regions\u2014those regions based in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago,  Dallas, and Denver. We selected these regions primarily because survey  responses from one or more states in these regions raised questions about  similar data they had reported to EPA. A more detailed description of our  scope and methodology is presented in appendix I; selected data on  underground storage tanks reported by states are summarized in appendix  II; and a copy of our survey instrument is included as appendix III. We  conducted our work from June 2005 to December 2006 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The 1986 amendments to RCRA established the LUST Trust Fund to, among  other things, finance the cleanup of petroleum releases from underground  storage tanks. Until recently, states could use these funds only for cleanup  and related administrative and enforcement activities. Within this  restriction, trust fund money could be used for the following general  categories of activities:  testing tanks for leaks when one is suspected;   investigating a site to evaluate the source and extent of petroleum   assessing the number of individuals that may have been exposed to  petroleum contaminants and the seriousness of exposure, and  estimating resulting health risks;   cleaning up contaminated soil and water;   providing safe drinking water to residents at the site of a tank leak;  providing for temporary or permanent relocation of residents; and  providing reasonable and necessary administrative and planning  expenses directly related to these activities.", "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act), enacted in August 2005,  expanded the permitted uses of the LUST Trust Fund. It authorizes states  to use a portion of their LUST Trust Fund money for inspections and other  leak prevention purposes. Furthermore, the 2005 Act authorizes  appropriations from the LUST Trust Fund through fiscal year 2011 of $555  million per year for a variety of activities\u2014including release prevention and  inspections\u2014in addition to previously authorized purposes. This annual  amount includes $200 million for cleanups of releases from leaking  underground storage tanks; $200 million for the cleanup of releases of  oxygenated fuel additives from such tanks; $100 million for activities  including onsite inspections, groundwater protection, and enforcement;  and $55 million for delivery prohibition, operator training, and release  prevention and compliance. An additional $50 million per year is  authorized from the general fund to cover administrative expenses and  other activities. Net revenue to the LUST Trust Fund from taxes on  petroleum products totaled approximately $190 million in fiscal year 2005.", "The 2005 Act also included several other provisions regarding inspections,  operator training, and financial responsibility, among other things. Some of  these provisions impose ongoing requirements on states. For example, the  inspection provision requires each state receiving federal funding to  inspect all of its regulated underground storage tanks at least once every 3  years, beginning after the state has inspected tanks that have not been  inspected since December 1998.", "Effective February 2007, the 2005 Act directs EPA to require that each state  receiving federal funds either (1) require additional, or secondary,  structures that would help contain a release (secondary containment) for  new and replaced underground storage tanks located near sources of  drinking water or (2) require evidence of financial responsibility for tank  manufacturers\u2019 and installers\u2019 certification. This coverage would provide  for the costs of cleanup directly related to releases caused by improper  tank manufacture or installation. The 2005 Act also extended until 2011 the  tax on petroleum products that capitalizes the federal LUST Trust Fund.", "Under EPA policy, except in rare circumstances and in Indian Country,  states will address underground storage tank releases that are financed by  the LUST Trust Fund under an appropriate cooperative agreement with  EPA. EPA will undertake a cleanup only when (1) there is a major public  health or environmental emergency, (2) the state is unable to respond, and  (3) no responsible party is able or willing to provide an adequate and timely  response. In these circumstances, EPA\u2019s involvement is to be limited to  stabilizing the immediate situation, with the expectation that further  cleanup will be conducted by the state under its cooperative agreement  with the agency. States are responsible for overseeing cleanup work  performed by the party responsible for the contamination and for  performing the cleanup at sites where no responsible party can be found.", "In addition to the LUST Trust Fund, federal money from EPA\u2019s Brownfields  program can be used to clean up sites contaminated by petroleum under  certain circumstances. In general, Brownfields grants are limited to sites  whose \u201cexpansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated  by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant,  or contaminant.\u201d Only certain governmental organizations, nonprofit  organizations, and nonprofit educational institutions are eligible for  Brownfields cleanup grants. In fiscal year 2005, EPA provided eligible  entities with about $22.3 million in Brownfields grants for cleaning up sites  contaminated with petroleum. About $4.0 million of these grants were  awarded for direct cleanup work, $13.3 million for site assessments, and  $5.0 million for revolving loan fund programs.", "According to data collected from the states and reported by EPA, EPA and  states have made progress in cleaning up releases from underground  storage tanks. These data show that of the almost 450,000 releases  confirmed as of fiscal year-end 2005, cleanups had been initiated for about  93 percent and completed for about 74 percent. Table 1 shows key tank- related data elements reported by EPA as of September 30, 2005, and  provides definitions for those data elements.", "As cleanups have progressed, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE)\u2014a  gasoline additive designed to reduce emissions and raise octane\u2014has  continued to be detected in groundwater used for drinking water supplies.  In some cases, MTBE was added to gasoline to fulfill requirements set in  the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments to reduce certain types of emissions.  However, because MTBE dissolves easily in water and does not cling to soil  very well, it migrates faster and farther through the ground than other  gasoline components, thus making it more likely to contaminate public  water systems and private drinking water wells. MTBE\u2019s health effects have  not been conclusively established, but the federal government has  determined it to be a potential human carcinogen. The effects of exposure  to MTBE include headaches; eye, nose, and throat irritation; coughs;  nausea; dizziness; and disorientation. Low levels of MTBE can make  drinking water supplies undrinkable due to its offensive taste and odor.  Because of uncertainties about MTBE\u2019s health effects, EPA has not set a  national standard for MTBE in drinking water. Some states have set their  own limits on allowable levels of MTBE in drinking water, and some have  banned its use in gasoline sold in the state. The Congress also took action  through the 2005 Act to reduce the use of MTBE in gasoline by eliminating  the requirement from the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that led to the  use of MTBE to reduce emissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Public Costs for Cleaning Up Leaking Underground Storage Tanks May Be Substantial", "paragraphs": ["States reported that completing the cleanup of approximately 54,000  known releases from leaking underground storage tanks would likely  require substantial amounts of public funds from state and federal  resources. The public cost of cleaning up releases from tanks without a  viable owner, as well as the number of releases in states\u2019 cleanup backlogs  that lack a viable owner, is not fully known. In addition to the costs  associated with known releases, states expect that they will use public  funds to clean up a substantial number of releases that they identify within  the next 5 years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Reported That They Expect to Spend an Estimated $12 Billion in Public Funds to Complete the Cleanup of about 54,000 Known Releases", "paragraphs": ["States reported that cleaning up known releases from leaking underground  storage tanks would cost an estimated $12 billion in public funds from state  and federal sources. This estimate reflects the amount of public funds that  states expected it would cost to clean up approximately 54,000 known  releases. States were unable to estimate the cost of cleaning up more than  another 8,000 releases whose cleanup will require at least some public  funds. We asked states to exclude from their estimates any money spent  prior to September 30, 2005, to clean up these releases. As figure 1  illustrates, states reported that a substantial amount of the public costs to  clean up these releases had not yet been incurred.", "States reported that nearly half of these releases will require $100,000 or  more to fully clean up, with about 5 percent requiring $500,000 or more.  Just over half of the approximately 117,000 releases that states reported in  our survey had not yet been fully cleaned up will be cleaned up using at  least some public funds. Tank owners or operators will pay the entire costs  to clean up another 34 percent of these 117,000 releases, according to state  officials. States reported that they did not know whether any public funds  would be used to clean up most of the remaining 13 percent of these  releases or whether tank owners or operators alone would pay for their  cleanup.", "The percentage of releases that states reported would be cleaned up using  at least some public funds varied widely by state, as illustrated in figure 2.  Some states expected all releases in their backlogs to be cleaned up using  at least some public funds, while other states did not expect public funds to  be used to clean up any releases in their current backlog.", "The approach that different states use regarding who pays for the cleanup  of leaking underground storage tanks can affect the percentage of releases  in a state that are cleaned up using at least some public funding. One such  approach is whether a state has chosen to set up a financial assurance fund  that provides financial responsibility coverage for tank owners. For  example, in North Dakota, where nearly all tanks are covered by the state\u2019s  fund, the state expects that more than 95 percent of releases in its current  backlog will be cleaned up using at least some public funding. Similarly,  state laws addressing when a specific owner or operator is considered to  be responsible for a release can affect who pays for cleanups. For example,  Michigan program officials previously told us that the state\u2019s causation  standard exacerbates the funding problem for tanks without a viable owner  because it requires that the state prove that the present owner/operator is  responsible for a site\u2019s contamination before it can be held responsible for  cleanup. Proving responsibility becomes difficult in cases where releases  have occurred in the past and ownership of the property has changed. If  responsibility cannot be established, the state must then fund any cleanup  of the site.", "Although EPA estimates that a release costs about $125,000 on average to  clean up, the cost can vary based on several factors, including the extent of  contamination, the cleanup method selected, and the presence of MTBE or  groundwater contamination. In our survey, we asked states about the  average cost in public funds to clean up both releases with MTBE  contamination and releases that have contaminated groundwater. We also  asked for the average cost in public funds to clean up all releases. With  regard to releases involving MTBE, EPA has reported that the additional  cost for cleaning up these releases varies widely, from no additional cost to  a substantial increase, depending on the history of the release. States\u2019  survey responses generally corresponded with this reported variation.  Twenty-nine states reported estimates of average public costs for cleaning  up releases with MTBE contamination and for all releases. Most of these  states reported that cleaning up releases with MTBE contamination costs  the same or more than cleaning up an average release in the state.  However, estimates of the cost difference varied widely among states.", "EPA has stated that releases that have contaminated groundwater are  generally more complicated and more expensive to clean up than releases  that have not. In our survey, 34 states provided us with estimates for the  average public cost to clean up all releases as well as the average public  cost to clean up releases that have contaminated groundwater. States\u2019  estimates varied widely: about 60 percent of these states reported that it  was more expensive to clean up releases involving groundwater  contamination, while about 40 percent reported that it cost the same."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Number of Releases from Tanks without a Viable Owner and the Public Cost of Such Releases Are Not Fully Known", "paragraphs": ["The full extent of releases from tanks without a viable owner is unknown.  While states reported that about 11 percent of the approximately 117,000  releases that have not yet been fully cleaned up came from such tanks, the  actual number could be much higher for two reasons. First, 11 states  reported that they did not know how many of the releases in their backlogs  were from tanks without a viable owner. Second, 17 states reported that  there were approximately 4,000 releases from tanks for which they had not  yet determined whether a viable owner exists.", "The public cost of cleaning up releases from tanks without a viable owner  is also not fully known. While 26 states and the District of Columbia  estimated that it would cost a total of $2.7 billion to complete the cleanups  of known releases from tanks without a viable owner, 21 states responded  that they did not know the cost, and 2 states did not respond to the  question. Because most states reported that they clean up such releases  using public funding, it is likely that many of the known releases from tanks  without a viable owner will be cleaned up using at least some public  money.", "Nearly all states reported to us in our survey that they use public funding to  clean up releases from tanks without a viable owner. Six states reported  that they had a state fund dedicated to tanks without a viable owner, and  other states without such dedicated funds primarily reported that they use  resources from other types of state funds, such as financial assurance  funds, or from the federal LUST Trust Fund, as illustrated in figure 3.  However, four states reported that they may wait until the property on  which the leaking tank is located is purchased and rely on the new owner  to clean the site up.", "States may have releases from tanks without a viable owner in their  backlog because the owner or operator responsible for the tank failed to  maintain adequate financial responsibility coverage. Maintaining adequate  financial responsibility coverage ensures that money will be available to  clean up releases from underground storage tanks. This money, in turn,  contributes to timely completion of cleanup and thus reduces the risk to  human health and the environment posed by releases that are not cleaned  up in a timely manner. We asked states about the number of cases they had  encountered in the past 5 years in which tank owners did not have  adequate financial responsibility coverage. In responding, states used  somewhat different definitions of what constituted inadequate financial  responsibility coverage. In general, states that we talked with more  in-depth about financial responsibility said they counted cases as having  inadequate coverage when an owner or operator either (1) had not  maintained financial responsibility coverage or (2) had maintained  coverage but did not have proof of coverage at the time the state requested  it. Twenty-three states reported cases of inadequate coverage in the past 5  years, while only 7 states and the District of Columbia reported no cases; 19  other states reported that they did not know the number of cases involving  inadequate coverage.", "The number of cases involving inadequate financial responsibility coverage  may indicate that at least some public funds will be used to clean up a  release that otherwise would have been paid for by a responsible party. For  example, according to Florida officials, the state has cleaned up about 350  sites annually in past years using public funding. Of these sites,  approximately three to four sites per year involved responsible parties that  did not maintain adequate financial responsibility coverage. In our survey,  Florida estimated an average cost of $380,000 in public funds to fully  address each release requiring public funds. Consequently, Florida may  have spent more than $1 million per year on such sites in the past. Florida  officials noted that the state attempts to recover these funds from the tank  owners but indicated that such efforts have not always been successful in  the past. Officials in three additional states\u2014New Jersey, Texas, and  Utah\u2014also told us that public funds could be used in cases involving  inadequate financial responsibility coverage, although they did not know  the number of times public funds had been used in these types of situations  in the past.", "Checking financial responsibility coverage\u2014for example, verifying during  a site inspection that an owner or operator has the required paperwork to  demonstrate coverage\u2014helps to ensure that owners or operators maintain  adequate coverage as required by federal law. Some options that owners or  operators can choose for coverage either require annual updates or are  often renewed annually. For instance, owners or operators that self-insure,  or choose to demonstrate that they have sufficient assets to cover costs  resulting from a release, must prepare an annual letter with financial  information supporting their ability to pay. Similarly, owners or operators  that choose private insurance for financial responsibility coverage must  pay annual premiums to maintain coverage. However, EPA does not provide states specific guidance on whether or how frequently states  should engage in routine verification of financial responsibility coverage.", "Most states reported to us that they attempted to check financial  responsibility coverage on a regular basis, but only about one-third of the  states reported that they required annual proof that tank owners or  operators were maintaining coverage. The remaining states generally  reported that they checked this coverage less often or not at all (see fig. 4).", "Do not check (7)", "Other (9)", "States that do not check financial responsibility coverage on an annual  basis may not know if owners or operators are maintaining required  coverage.

Thirty-nine of the 43 respondents that  expected to spend public funds to clean up future releases also provided  estimates of the average public cost to clean up releases in their state.  Using these estimates, we determined that the total cost to clean up  releases projected to be identified in the next five years in these states  could be around $2.5 billion. States also reported that, overall, the  proportion of releases cleaned up using public funds is likely to decline in  the future. That is, together they anticipate using public funds to clean up a  higher percentage of releases in their current backlog than of releases they  expect to identify in the next 5 years (see fig. 5).

The agency recently began collecting information from states to  determine the soundness of their financial assurance funds, but this effort  has had limited usefulness.

These funds  accounted for $1.032 billion, or 96 percent, of the estimated $1.076 billion  from all state sources to clean up tank releases in 2005, according to our  survey results. State financial assurance funds generally pay for cleaning  up releases from tanks whose owners participate in the assurance funds to  satisfy federal financial responsibility requirements. Figure 6 shows the  state sources of expenditures for cleanup costs in 2005.", "As shown in figure 6, financial assurance funds can be divided into two  types: those that currently provide financial responsibility coverage, and  those that used to but no longer do so. Most states have, or have had,  financial assurance funds. As of September 30, 2005, 37 states had funds  that met federal requirements for financial responsibility, according to  EPA; an additional 6 states had such funds in the past but these funds no  longer provided coverage for new releases; and 7 states and the District of  Columbia have never had financial assurance funds that were approved by  EPA to provide financial responsibility coverage (see fig.7).", "The funds in each of the six states that stopped providing financial  responsibility coverage for new releases did so after a certain deadline.  Tank owners and operators in these states now demonstrate financial  responsibility coverage primarily through private insurance, according to  state officials. However, as recently as fiscal year 2005, some of these state  funds were still paying out large amounts to clean up releases. In fact, over  one-fifth of states\u2019 public spending to clean up releases from underground  storage tanks in 2005 came from these financial assurance funds. For  example, although Florida\u2019s fund last provided financial responsibility  coverage for new releases on December 31, 1998, it is still responsible for  cleaning up approximately 12,000 sites, and it spent almost $150 million on  cleanups in 2005. Michigan\u2019s fund, however, no longer provided financial  responsibility coverage after June 1995 because it had insufficient funds to  pay existing and future claims. Michigan state officials reported that  several other funds provided cleanup money for underground storage tanks  in 2005, including the Clean Michigan Initiative Bond Fund. This fund can  be used to pay for many activities, such as waterfront improvements and  cleanup of contaminated lake and river sediments.", "Seven states and the District of Columbia have never had funds that  provided financial responsibility coverage. In these states, tank owners and  operators use other ways of demonstrating financial responsibility  coverage, primarily private insurance and self-insurance, according to our  survey. While they never had financial assurance funds, some of these  states have provided cleanup funds to address releases from underground  storage tanks. In fact, four of these states reported paying for such  cleanups from state sources in 2005. Delaware, for example, reported  spending $1 million in 2005 from a reimbursement fund for 240 sites. Other  states assist or have assisted owners and operators with cleanup by  operating insurance-type mechanisms. In the state of Washington, for  example, the state\u2019s reinsurance program helps owners and operators of  underground storage tanks obtain affordable pollution liability insurance  by assuming part of the risk for each loss and insulating the primary insurer  from losses greater than a certain amount. In the case of a $1,000,000  policy, for example, Washington\u2019s reinsurance program is responsible for  settlements over $75,000. Table 2 summarizes some of the key distinctions  among state approaches to ensuring that tanks are cleaned up.", "At federal fiscal year-end 2005, state financial assurance funds in 39 states  held unexpended balances of approximately $1.3 billion, according to  estimates reported by state officials. Four states did not have or did not  report a fund balance. As shown in figure 8, individual states\u2019 fund balances  ranged as high as about $207 million. The top five states\u2014Pennsylvania,  Florida, Texas, New Jersey, and California\u2014accounted for more than half  of the total balance in these funds. Because many state assurance funds  also pay to clean up releases from other types of tanks\u2014such as  aboveground storage tanks\u2014the entire balance of any one state\u2019s financial  assurance fund may not be available for cleaning up underground storage  tanks.", "Overall, states reported in our survey that financial assurance funds  accrued revenues of about $1.4 billion in 2005 from a variety of sources.  State taxes on gasoline and other fuels accounted for about $1.3 billion (92  percent) of this income to state funds. Such taxes are generally considered  to be paid by the consumer. States reported that financial assurance funds  also received revenues totaling about $42 million (3 percent) from fees paid  by tank owners and operators. Only four states\u2019 financial assurance funds  collected tank fees but not gasoline taxes in 2005, and tank fees were the  primary source of revenues for only three of these funds, according to our  survey. In addition to gasoline taxes and fees on tanks, states also reported  small amounts of revenues from sources such as interest and cost recovery.", "Whether a state financial assurance fund collects revenue from various  sources in a given year can depend on its balance. Many states have  maximum limits on the overall balance of their funds. Generally, if a state\u2019s  maximum limit is reached, its fund ceases collecting revenues from one or  more of its revenue sources until the fund balance drops below a minimum  threshold. For example, Idaho has not collected certain fees for its fund  since 1998 when the balance of its fund exceeded $30 million, according to  a state official. The fund will again begin collecting revenue from these fees  once its balance drops to $15 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some State Funds Do Not Have Sufficient Resources to Ensure Timely Cleanups", "paragraphs": ["While state financial assurance funds can provide substantial amounts of  funding for cleaning up releases, funds in some states may not have  sufficient resources to ensure that these cleanups are performed in a timely  manner. Specifically, officials in nine states reported in our survey that  their funds limit the amount of cleanup work they finance based on funding  availability. The situation of three such funds, as described by state  officials, follows:  North Carolina. The revenues to the state\u2019s financial assurance fund  have not been sufficient in recent years to address all of the fund\u2019s high- risk sites. As of February 2006, the state was only authorizing cleanup  work that the fund could pay for within 90 days.", "South Carolina. Officials generally preapprove cleanup work only at the  sites where contamination is most severe. After an initial assessment of  each site\u2019s contamination, the state categorizes releases into one of four  categories. The most urgent category includes releases deemed  emergencies, all of which were being actively cleaned up as of August  2006. The remaining categories are ranked based on how soon the  release is likely to affect human health and the environment, as well as  its impact on groundwater. As of August 2006, less than 40 percent of the  releases in these categories were being actively cleaned up.", "Florida. Although the state\u2019s financial assurance fund stopped providing  financial responsibility coverage for new releases in 1998, it is having  difficulty paying for all of its cleanups. The state fund is only able to  actively conduct cleanup work at about one-third of the 12,000  remaining sites. The approximately 8,000 other sites in the fund\u2019s  backlog await cleanup. These cleanups will not occur until money  becomes available for them, or, potentially, the risk posed by the sites  increases so much that they require more urgent cleanup.", "The timeliness of cleanups of releases from underground storage tanks is  especially important because the longer contamination from these releases  is left in place, the greater the potential becomes for the contamination to  spread. The farther these contaminants are allowed to spread, the greater  the chance becomes that they will contaminate drinking water and other  sensitive resources, potentially putting human health and the environment  at risk. In addition, when state financial assurance funds do not pay  cleanup claims on a timely basis, tank owners and operators may delay  cleanups. For example, tank owners may be less likely to voluntarily report  releases if they know that reporting a release could lead to a mandatory  cleanup and believe that they will not be reimbursed by the state financial  assurance fund for performing that cleanup for an extended period,  according to an EPA regional official.", "To ensure that funds are available to clean up releases in a timely and  appropriate manner, state financial assurance funds must be financially  sound. According to EPA guidance on the subject issued in 1993, a state  assurance fund is financially sound if it provides reasonable assurance that  money is available to pay for cleanup costs and other liabilities.  \u201cReasonable assurance,\u201d according to EPA, would be evident, for instance,  if the fund assets are greater than liabilities or there are sufficient  resources to meet current demands, that is, the normal timing of payment  of claims is not significantly delaying cleanups. If funding levels or claim  processing time has a negative impact on the cleanup of releases from  underground storage tanks (i.e., causing undue delays in cleaning up  releases that therefore harm human health and the environment), then EPA  would be concerned about the financial soundness of the fund.", "State financial assurance funds may face additional challenges to  remaining financially sound in coming years for the following reasons:  Financial assurance funds may take on additional liability from tank  installers and manufacturers. Effective February 2007, the 2005 Act  directs EPA to require that each state receiving federal funds either  implement \u201csecondary containment\u201d for new and replaced underground  storage tanks located near sources of drinking water or to require  evidence of financial responsibility for tank manufacturers and  installers. In selecting the second option, states must require that any  manufacturer or installer of an underground storage tank maintain  evidence of financial responsibility coverage. In some cases, tank  installers and manufacturers may turn to state financial assurance funds  for financial responsibility coverage. While a few state funds already  provide such coverage to installers, this additional liability could strain  the resources of some states\u2019 funds, according to a senior official in  EPA\u2019s Office of Underground Storage Tanks.", "Some states may discover more releases in the coming years than in  past years. The 2005 Act requires each state receiving federal funding to  inspect all of their underground storage tanks on a 3-year cycle,  beginning after the state inspects tanks that have not been inspected  since December 1998. For those states that currently inspect sites less  frequently, the additional inspections, while intended to prevent leaks in  the long term, could lead to a spike in the number of releases  discovered. For example, officials in Texas told us that underground  storage tank facilities in their state are inspected about every 10 years,  on average. Releases in this state that may not have otherwise been  found for as long as 10 years may be discovered much sooner, leading to  an increase in confirmed releases over the next few years. Finding these  releases sooner may mean that the contamination would be less  extensive, however, and therefore any cleanup required would be less  costly.", "State financial assurance funds may also be affected by future natural  disasters, such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. As late as June  2006, the impact of the flooding caused by these hurricanes on  Louisiana\u2019s financial assurance fund was not yet fully known, according  to a state official. If all underground storage tanks that could have been  affected by the flooding turn out to have had releases, the workload of  the state assurance fund would increase by 25 percent. Payouts from the  state assurance fund would increase by approximately $4 million per  year, according to this official.", "Diversions from state financial assurance funds may also limit some states\u2019  ability to pay for cleanups under certain circumstances. States may  sometimes decide to withdraw or withhold money from state financial  assurance funds. Of the 43 states that have had financial assurance funds,  16 reported in our survey that they had diverted a total of nearly $435  million from their funds between 2001 and 2005. Officials in most of these  states reported that the diverted amounts went to the state\u2019s general fund  or to offset state budget shortfalls. A few states reported using diverted  funds for specific programs, such as Brownfields grants and loans, a lead- based paint removal program, and cleanup of groundwater contamination  caused by sources other than leaking storage tanks. Officials we  interviewed in two states where diversions occurred\u2014Florida and South  Carolina\u2014reported a negative impact on the state program\u2019s ability to  clean up sites. In Florida, for example, $20 million was diverted in 2002. As  a result, financial assurance fund managers had to adjust the threshold for  cleanup, meaning that the cleanup of less urgent releases, which otherwise  would have been addressed, was delayed, according to state officials.  Officials we interviewed in two other states\u2014Pennsylvania and New  Jersey\u2014did not believe that diversions had caused a significant negative  impact, if any. In the largest case of a diversion reported to us, for example,  the Pennsylvania financial assurance fund loaned the legislature $100  million in 2002 to balance the state\u2019s budget, according to state officials.  State officials reported that this diversion did not impact the fund\u2019s  operations, however, because the fund still had more than enough money  to meet its current expenses. Figure 9 shows the number of states with  financial assurance funds that reported to us that they had experienced a  diversion between 2001 and 2005.", "The 2005 Act included language providing that, if a state diverts resources  from its financial assurance fund, EPA may not distribute a certain portion  of LUST appropriations to that state for enforcement purposes. This  provision affects only the 37 states whose financial assurance funds still  provide financial responsibility coverage for new releases. Officials we  interviewed in Pennsylvania and South Carolina regarding this issue were  uncertain about the 2005 Act\u2019s impact on future diversions in those states.  A South Carolina official, for example, believed that the provisions could  discourage the state from making relatively small diversions from the  financial assurance fund because the loss of federal funding would more  than offset the gain from the diversion. If the state needed to divert a large  amount of money, even relative to the $1.3 million overall distribution it  received from EPA in 2005, the disincentive would not be as significant.  Two states even commented in their responses to our survey that they  anticipated diversions in 2006. EPA had not developed guidance to  implement these provisions of the 2005 Act as of December 2006.", "Concerns have been raised about whether tank owners have incentives to  prevent releases from their tanks when they can rely on state financial  assurance funds to pay the bulk of the cleanup costs. Although EPA  estimates that releases cost about $125,000 to clean up, on average, most  state financial assurance funds charge a deductible of $25,000 or less,  according to our survey. Twelve states described the circumstances under  which penalties could be imposed on tank owners for multiple, or repeated,  releases, in their survey responses. Officials in several states indicated that  penalties were not usually imposed simply if multiple releases occurred.  Rather, most states imposed penalties on the basis of evidence that the  tank owner did not comply with applicable regulations or failed to report a  release. For example, New Hampshire officials indicated that, while the  state has authority for administrative fines and civil penalties in cases  involving multiple releases, such actions are not automatically imposed.  Instead, fines and penalties may be assessed if a second release results  from a tank owner\u2019s recalcitrance in achieving and maintaining compliance  with operational regulations. Of the 20 states that provided comments in  response to our survey question regarding multiple releases, none  indicated that increased penalties were imposed simply based on the  occurrence of a second release."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Method of Ensuring the Adequacy of Financial Assurance Funds Has Limitations", "paragraphs": ["EPA approves state financial assurance funds to provide financial  responsibility coverage.

In Texas, for example, claims substantially exceeded revenues during the  early years of the state\u2019s financial assurance fund. By 1992, the fund had a  backlog of unpaid bills totaling about $170 million.

One region\u2019s  program manager did not expect that the agency\u2019s effort would provide any  new information, except data to document what he already knew. An EPA  headquarters official, who is closely involved with the effort, agreed that  the agency\u2019s information collection, at most, helped confirm what regions  already saw as problem states.

For the most part, the EPA  regional officials whom we interviewed stated that deviations from the  formula distributions, when they occur, are usually relatively minor.", "The formula EPA headquarters uses to distribute LUST Trust Fund money  to the regions incorporates three components: (1) a minimum distribution  of $300,000 per state; (2) a need-based amount that considers the numbers  of underground storage tanks and releases in the state, as well as the  percentage of the population relying on groundwater for potable water; and  (3) a performance-based bonus to states that meet or exceed the national  averages for the numbers of cleanups initiated and completed. The  distribution formula does not consider the number of releases from tanks  without a viable owner in various states, nor does it consider the risk that  specific releases may pose to human health and the environment.

The state reports a site as \u201ccleanup  initiated\u201d when the release has been confirmed and a case number  assigned. According to the EPA definition, however, cleanup initiated  requires that the state or responsible party has evaluated the site and  initiated physical activity (e.g., removal or treatment of the  contamination, removal of the contaminated soil, or monitoring of the  groundwater or soil being remediated). Cleanup initiated should also be  reported in situations where the state has evaluated the site and  determined that no physical activity is necessary to protect human  health and the environment.", "A Louisiana Underground Storage Tank Program official told us that a  review of its files disclosed that the program had been reporting  duplicate entries and releases that did not meet EPA\u2019s definition.", "An Oregon Underground Storage Tank Program Coordinator told us  that, in the process of cleaning up its database information, program  officials found many sites being reported that were duplicates or  involved releases that did not come from regulated tanks.", "A Maryland Department of the Environment official acknowledged that  it has been reporting semiannual performance data incorrectly, and as a  result, some of the state\u2019s performance activities have been double  counted.", "An Oklahoma Petroleum Storage Tank Division official told us that the  division had been reporting performance data on all tanks regulated by  the state, including the aboveground storage tanks, and also  undercounting the number of \u201cactive tanks\u201d by excluding tanks that  were only temporarily out of service.", "To help ensure the accuracy of the states\u2019 semiannual activities reports,  EPA recommends that the regions review each state\u2019s data submission for  reasonableness based on the state\u2019s prior reports and the regional program  manager\u2019s knowledge of the state\u2019s program.

By funding additional staff  positions rather than cleanup activities, states were often able to identify  the responsible parties and force them to do the cleanups, thereby avoiding  the time and expense of pursuing cost-recovery actions. A Region 6 official  told us that some states view the cost recovery process as a deterrent to  using the federal money for cleanup activities.

In response, many states  developed financial assurance funds, at least in part to ensure that releases  are cleaned up in a timely manner. In the event of a release, tank owners  covered by these funds usually pay a relatively small deductible, while the  funds provide sometimes large sums of public funding to complete the  required cleanup. Because these deductibles are often small, they may not  provide an incentive for tank owners to prevent releases from occurring. In  addition, in many states, tank owners are using financial responsibility  mechanisms other than state assurance funds. While some state funds are  currently encountering difficulties paying for cleanups in a timely manner,  tank owners in many states will increasingly rely on other means of  financial responsibility coverage, making it important to know whether  state funds or private forms of coverage are more effective in ensuring  timely cleanups. EPA is ideally situated, through its existing relationship  with state program officials throughout the country, to shed light on this  issue.", "EPA\u2019s distribution of LUST Trust Fund money to states depends on data  that may not be accurate. In addition, states are not required to report data  to EPA on the number of releases from tanks without a viable owner.  Although one of the purposes of the fund is to help states clean up releases  from tanks without a viable owner, EPA currently allocates resources to  the states without taking into account the number of such releases in each  state. In our November 2005 report, we recommended that EPA collect  available data from the states regarding the number of tanks in each state  that had no viable owners. In commenting on this recommendation, EPA  expressed concern about placing an undue burden on states. In our  response, we explained that we were not suggesting that states should try  to identify new sites that they were not currently aware of, but merely  report on sites without viable owners separately from the aggregated data  that they already provided to EPA. We continue to believe that such  reporting would be worthwhile and would not present an undue burden to  most states. In our survey, 37 states and the District of Columbia reported  data on the number of tanks without viable owners that had known  releases. Taking this information into account in distributing LUST Trust  Fund money could encourage the remaining states to gather such  information as well. In addition, developing national data on the extent to  which releases remaining to be cleaned up are attributed to tanks without  viable owners would be useful to both EPA and the Congress in assessing  the future public funding needs for EPA\u2019s UST program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Administrator, EPA, take the following four  actions:  Ensure that states verify, on a regular basis, that tank owners and  operators are maintaining adequate financial responsibility coverage, as  required by RCRA;   Improve the agency\u2019s oversight of the solvency of state assurance funds  to ensure that they continue to provide reliable financial responsibility  coverage for tank owners;   Assess, in coordination with the states, the relative effectiveness of  public and private options for financial responsibility coverage to  ensure that they provide timely funding for the cleanup of releases; and  Better focus how EPA distributes program resources to states, including  LUST Trust Fund money, by  ensuring that states are reporting information in their semiannual  activity reports that is consistent with EPA\u2019s definitions;   encouraging  states to review their databases to ensure that only data  on the appropriate universe of underground storage tanks are being  reported in their semiannual activity reports; and   gathering available information from states on releases attributed to  tanks without a viable owner and taking this information into  account in distributing LUST Trust Fund money to states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided EPA with a draft of this report for its review and comment.  EPA agreed with our recommendations and provided information on the  agency\u2019s plans and activities to address each of them.

Regarding our recommendation that EPA  improve its oversight of the solvency of state assurance funds, the agency  indicated that it would strengthen its oversight by improving a recently  developed monitoring tool and by developing guidance for its oversight  process. Regarding our recommendation that EPA assess the relative  effectiveness of public and private options for financial responsibility  coverage, the agency indicated that it would consider conducting such a  study in conjunction with the states. Finally, regarding our  recommendation to better focus how EPA distributes program resources to  states, the agency stated that it would work toward ensuring that state- reported data are consistent with existing EPA definitions and are limited  to federally regulated underground storage tanks.

Our definition  excluded money spent by federal, state, and local government agencies to  clean up releases from tanks they either own or operate\u2014this money  would be considered to be provided by the responsible party.", "To address our objectives, we developed and administered a survey to state  officials responsible for underground storage tank programs or, where  applicable, for state cleanup funds, in the 50 states and the District of  Columbia. Specifically, we prepared and e-mailed a Word Electronic  Questionnaire to obtain data, whether estimated or actual, from states on  underground storage tanks, including the number of tanks, releases, and  cleanups, and financial responsibility and funding sources for cleanups.  The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling error. For example, differences in how a particular question is  interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, or the  types of people who do not respond can introduce unwanted variability  into the survey results. We included steps in both the data collection and  data analysis stages to minimize such nonsampling errors. For example, in  the research design and data collection stages, we took the following steps:  We obtained from EPA its list of state contacts. We then attempted to  contact all listed state officials via e-mail and asked them to tell us  whether they or someone else in their state would be the most  appropriate contact. Upon receiving this e-mail, a few officials identified  more appropriate survey respondents. In states where we were not able  to contact the officials on EPA\u2019s list via e-mail, we sent the e-mail  regarding the most appropriate contact to officials named on lists of  state contacts from two other professional organizations that also  conduct surveys about underground storage tanks\u2014the New England  Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission and the Association of  State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials\u2014and, in some  cases, to officials listed on states\u2019 underground storage tank-related Web  sites.", "We pretested the survey with officials from four states between October  28, 2005, and December 21, 2005, and used their feedback to refine the  survey. States were selected for the pretests to ensure variation in size  of workload and status of the state financial assurance fund. For these  pretests, we sent agency officials a draft of the survey. We then  interviewed the officials to ensure that the (1) questions were clear and  unambiguous; (2) terms used were precise, including our definition of  public funding; and (3) data needed to respond to the questions was  available to the state officials. As a result of our pretests, we made  changes to some of the survey questions.", "We sent an announcement on November 18, 2005, of the upcoming  survey to state contacts (including the District of Columbia) and then e- mailed the survey as an attachment on January 19, 2006. We asked  respondents to return the survey by e-mail, fax, or mail by February 3,  2006. We accepted responses to the survey through mid-October 2006.", "We sent e-mail reminders and conducted follow-up telephone calls with  nonrespondents.", "To minimize nonsampling error in the data analysis stage, we took the  following steps:    For selected survey questions, where we were able to, we independently  corroborated survey data by comparing these data with EPA data. We  then followed up with states and EPA as needed about discrepancies.", "We included a series of data reliability questions in the survey to assess  the accuracy of the information provided to us by the respondents.", "Specifically, we collected information about (1) the databases states  used to provide survey data; (2) the internal controls on those databases  (e.g., whether it had been reviewed for quality, the procedures to ensure  accurate data entry, and known limitations); (3) whether the data  provided were actual or estimates; and (4) the assumptions, data, and  calculations used to provide the actual or estimated data for selected  questions. We also requested supporting documentation if states noted  their database(s) had been reviewed for quality.", "We used a data collection instrument (DCI) to systematically and  consistently record all available data reliability information (from  survey responses, published reports, or interviews) in order to make  assessments of the reliability of the survey data provided by each state.  The DCI was then reviewed by an independent person who assessed the  accuracy of DCI data entries and the reasonableness of the judgments  on the reliability of states\u2019 survey data. As expected, there was wide  variability in the level of oversight of the databases states use to track  underground storage tank information. There was similar variability in  the ways state officials described how they arrived at responses to  certain questions\u2014whether it was based on states\u2019 \u201cactual\u201d data,  derived estimates, or some other source. Specifically, some states  provided explanations for their responses that were precise and  grounded in reasonable mathematical or trend based assumptions,  while others noted that their responses were educated guesses. Given  the limitations in the information reported from some states, we  determined that the survey data are not comparable by state, nor should  they be reported using such terms as \u201cactual\u201d sums, budgets, or outlays.  Consequently, the data are presented in the body of the report as  aggregate information on what states estimate their underground  storage tank and leaking underground storage tank numbers and  funding to be. We report all states\u2019 responses to selected questions only  in appendix II, because of the known limitations in the reliability of state  level comparisons. Such data are included in appendix II because of  congressional request and in order to illustrate the range of responses  states provided to selected questions and the wide variance in the  reliability of those responses. With these provisos, the survey data are  sufficiently reliable as they are used in the body of the report (i.e., to be  presented in aggregate, as testimonial evidence). The survey data  presented in appendix II are not reliable for state level comparisons.", "We conducted interviews regarding data reliability with a nonprobability  sample of seven states (see next page for a further discussion of this  sample of states). These interviews included in-depth questions  focusing on topics such as the states\u2019 database reviews and database  limitations identified in their survey responses.", "We contacted state officials to clarify survey responses when necessary  and used a centralized tracking document to record all changes.  Changes made in the tracking document were verified against the  keypunched data to ensure all changes and updates were recorded.  When changes took place after a survey was keypunched, the updates  were made in the computer program used to generate survey results.", "We edit-checked all surveys before they were keypunched, verified all  keypunched survey data against hard copies of the surveys, and verified  the computer programs used to generate survey results.", "From the population of 51 state contacts who were asked to participate in  our survey, we received 50 questionnaires for an overall response rate of 98  percent. We did not receive a questionnaire from South Dakota. We do not  know if responses for South Dakota would have differed materially from  those of the states that completed the survey.", "From the responses we received, we gathered information about (1) state  databases used to track underground storage tank information; (2) states\u2019  data for underground storage tank management, including data regarding  active and closed tanks, confirmed releases, and cleanups initiated and  completed; (3) states\u2019 sources of money for cleanup, including state  financial assurance funds; (4) states\u2019 use of federal money to clean up  leaking underground storage tanks; and (5) financial responsibility. We  provided states with the definition of public funding described previously  in this section, and we asked them to respond to all survey questions about  such funding according to this definition. The survey was focused  specifically on federally regulated underground storage tanks, as defined  by EPA. A few states reported they were not able to provide us with data  specific to federally regulated underground storage tanks for selected  questions, and instead, they generally provided us with either data  including a different universe of tanks or data prorated based on the  number of federally regulated underground storage tanks in the state for  these questions. Additionally, most survey questions that asked for data for  a specific year referred to the federal fiscal year. If states were unable to  provide data for the federal fiscal year, we asked them to provide us with  the starting date of their alternative reporting year. As a result, we present  such data in the report as 2005 data.", "In addition to conducting a survey to address our three objectives, we also  interviewed agency officials in a nonprobability sample of eight states\u2014 Florida, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and  Utah\u2014to gather additional information regarding selected survey topics.  Specifically, we talked with this group of states about topics such as their  use of LUST Trust Fund money, restrictions within their state financial  assurance fund on accepting claims, diversions from their state financial  assurance funds, the process of phasing out their state financial assurance  funds, and cases of inadequate financial responsibility coverage in their  state. We selected this sample of states in order to discuss as many of our  topics of interest as possible within a limited number of interviews. To  select the states, we first reviewed all states\u2019 responses to survey questions  related to the relevant topics to determine which states would be able to  discuss each topic of interest. We then calculated a score for each state  based on the number of relevant topics they could discuss, as indicated by  their survey responses. We interviewed all states that had scores at or  above a threshold score that we determined, based on how many states we  would need to discuss the relevant topics with to obtain sufficient  information for the purposes of this report.", "We also conducted interviews with regional program officials from EPA\u2019s  Underground Storage Tank Program in six EPA regions to gather additional  information about (1) states\u2019 primary sources of money for addressing  releases from leaking underground storage tanks, (2) these sources\u2019 future  viability, and (3) the federal funding available to address these releases. We  selected these regions primarily because survey responses from one or  more states in these regions raised questions about similar data they had  reported to EPA. We spoke with regional officials about these apparent  discrepancies, as well as about the regions\u2019 processes for distributing  money from the LUST Trust Fund, states\u2019 use of LUST Trust Fund money,  and the solvency of states\u2019 financial assurance funds.", "To obtain further information about the federal funding to address these  releases, we interviewed Department of the Treasury officials responsible  for managing the LUST Trust Fund, interviewed EPA headquarters and  regional officials to determine the process by which EPA distributes LUST  Trust Fund money, and gathered documentation regarding appropriations  of money from the fund to EPA, states\u2019 expenditure of fund money, and the  balance of the fund and its annual revenues. The documentation we  gathered included (1) annual apportionment letters, which we used to  track appropriations of LUST Trust Fund money to EPA; (2) EPA Spending  Reports, which we used to track state expenditures of LUST Trust Fund  money; and (3) Treasury\u2019s LUST Trust Fund Financial Statements, which  we used to track the fund balance and revenues collected into the fund. We  selected these sources based on EPA officials\u2019 indications that they were  the most appropriate sources for the purposes of this report. For Treasury\u2019s  LUST Trust Fund Financial Statements, we obtained and reviewed relevant  documentation on their reliability, including copies of audits of Treasury\u2019s  financial statements and internal controls. These audits were conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
