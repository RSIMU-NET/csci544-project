FAA's process for approving ground systems, such as radar systems, is done in accordance with policies and procedures in FAA's Acquisition Management System. Approving ground systems, which are usually developed, owned, and operated by FAA, typically involves FAA's Air Traffic Organization determining whether a vendor is in compliance with contract requirements, followed by a rigorous test-and-evaluation process to ensure that the new system will operate safely in the national airspace system. The process for certifying aircraft equipment, which is usually developed by private companies, is done in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations, with FAA serving as the regulator. If a system has both ground components and aircraft equipment components, then the system must go through both processes before it is approved for safe use in the national airspace system. FAA has faced challenges approving systems for safe use in the national airspace system that contributed to cost growth, delays, and performance shortfalls in deploying these systems. We identified three specific challenges through the review of 5 ATC systems and our past work. These challenges are the need to (1) involve appropriate stakeholders, such as users and technical experts, throughout the approval process; (2) ensure that the FAA offices that have responsibility for approving ground systems and certifying aircraft equipment effectively coordinate their efforts for integrated systems; and (3) accurately estimate the amount of time needed to meet complex technical requirements at the beginning of the design and development phase. FAA has taken some actions to address two of the three challenges we identified. However, FAA has not taken action to fully involve all stakeholders, such as air traffic controllers and technical experts, throughout the approval process. FAA officials believe that the agency's new Safety Management System will help ensure that the ground system approval and aircraft certification processes are better coordinated. FAA stated that coordination would improve because, as part of the new Safety Management System, the agency plans to realign its organizational structure to create a formal link between the Air Traffic Organization and the Office of Regulation and Certification. FAA expects full implementation of this system to take 3 to 5 years. We are reserving judgment on whether this change will fully address the challenge because of the early state of this effort and FAA's long-standing problems with internal coordination when approving ATC systems. As such, we believe that FAA should, in the interim, develop specific plans that describe how both internal and external coordination will occur on a system-specific basis."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) process for ensuring that air  traffic control systems will operate safely in the national airspace system is  an integral part of FAA\u2019s multibillion-dollar air traffic control modernization  and safety effort. New air traffic control systems cannot be used in the  national airspace system until FAA has determined that the systems will  operate safely. Over the years, FAA has approved about 45,000 pieces of air  traffic control equipment for safe use in the national airspace system. Some  in the aviation industry and government contend that FAA\u2019s approval  process for air traffic control systems is too lengthy and, therefore,  contributes to cost growth, schedule delays, and performance problems  that have plagued many of the systems that FAA has been trying to develop  for years. In addition, some in the aviation industry have raised concerns  about whether FAA\u2019s approval process has kept pace with changes in  technology. For example, more of today\u2019s new air traffic control systems  are integrated\u2014that is, involving both ground systems and equipment used  exclusively in aircraft (aircraft equipment) that must work together\u2014than  in the past.", "In response to your request, we examined   FAA\u2019s process for approving air traffic control systems for safe use in the   challenges FAA faces in approving air traffic control systems and how  these challenges have affected the cost, schedule, and performance of  the systems; and   actions FAA has taken to improve its process for approving air traffic  control systems.", "In this report, we use the word \u201capproval\u201d to describe the process of  ensuring the safety of an air traffic control system when it has both a  ground system and aircraft equipment.

To  determine the challenges FAA has faced in approving air traffic control  systems and how these challenges affected the cost, schedule, and  performance of the systems, we (1) conducted case illustrations on 5 of  FAA\u2019s 25 air traffic control systems currently receiving funding that were  approved or in the process of being approved for safe use in the national  airspace system and (2) reviewed reports prepared by GAO and the  Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General. The 5 air traffic control  systems are   Airport Surface Detection Equipment - Model X (ASDE-X),  Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC),  Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS),  Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), and  Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).", "We selected these 5 systems because collectively they accounted for about  46 percent of FAA\u2019s air traffic control modernization costs in fiscal year  2002 and 3 of the 5 systems are integrated\u2014that is, they require the  approval of the ground systems as well as certification of aircraft  equipment before they can be used in the national airspace system.

The 5 systems that we reviewed began  the approval process under that structure. Currently, these offices,  although renamed, form the core of the Air Traffic Organization. The  responsibilities of Air Traffic Services are now distributed among several  offices, including System Operations Services and Terminal Services. The  responsibilities of Research and Acquisitions are distributed among several  offices, including Technical Operations Services and En Route and Oceanic  Services. In addition, the Air Traffic Organization includes Safety Services,  which is its focal point for safety, quality assurance, and quality control and  is the primary interface with FAA\u2019s Office of Regulation and Certification.", "FAA\u2019s Office of Regulation and Certification has responsibility for certifying  and regulating aircraft and its equipment. The following 3 offices within the  Office of Regulation and Certification are involved in the certification of  aircraft equipment:  Aircraft Certification Service (aircraft certification office) is responsible  for administering safety standards for aircraft and aircraft equipment  that are manufactured in the United States.", "Flight Standards Service is responsible for granting operational  approval to air carriers that plan to use equipment on their aircraft.", "Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service is responsible for monitoring the  safety of air traffic operations through the establishment, approval, and  acceptance of safety standards and the monitoring of safety  performance and trends. It will also improve coordination between the  Office of Regulation and Certification and the Air Traffic Organization.", "In addition to the internal FAA stakeholders, the approval of air traffic  control (ATC) systems can also involve a number of other external  stakeholders. FAA generally makes the decision about which other  stakeholders will be involved in approving ATC systems for safe use in the  national airspace system. For example, stakeholders involved in approving  ATC systems may include  manufacturers of aircraft equipment;   users, such as controllers and maintenance technicians.", "FAA also regularly requests RTCA, a private, not-for-profit corporation, to  develop consensus-based performance standards for the aircraft  equipment component of ATC systems. RTCA functions as a federal  advisory committee that provides recommendations used by FAA as the  basis for policy, program, and regulatory decisions and by the private  sector as the basis for development, investment, and other business  decisions.", "In this report, we focus on the approval of the 5 ATC systems described in  table 1 and further discussed in appendixes II through VI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Separate Processes for Approving Ground Systems and Certifying Aircraft Equipment", "paragraphs": ["FAA has separate processes for approving ground systems and certifying  aircraft equipment for safe use in the national airspace system.

Most ground  systems that provide air traffic services and air navigation services are  developed, owned, and operated by FAA. Prior to November 2003, FAA\u2019s  Research and Acquisitions and Air Traffic Service offices were responsible  for the approval of ground systems. Currently, FAA\u2019s Air Traffic  Organization has primary responsibility for the approval of ground  systems. FAA\u2019s ground system approval process includes the following six  phases\u2014concept of operations, requirements setting, design and  development, test and evaluation, operational readiness, commissioning\u2014 and involves various stakeholders, which are also noted below.", "Concept of operations: The ground system approval process begins with  the concept of operations phase. If the system being developed has both  a ground system and aircraft equipment, FAA\u2019s Office of Regulation and  Certification, Air Traffic Services Office, and Acquisitions Office may work together to develop the concept of operations. During this phase,  FAA generally identifies and defines a service or capability to meet a  particular need in the national airspace system and may involve other  stakeholders, such as air traffic controllers. FAA also defines the roles  and responsibilities of key participants, such as controllers and  maintenance technicians, and the key elements of the required  capability. The concept of operations phase is not a static process. As  FAA obtains more information about the system it develops, the  concept is revised to reflect the new information even though the next  phase of the process may have already begun. Potential stakeholders in  this phase include FAA\u2019s Office of Regulation and Certification, FAA\u2019s  Air Traffic Organization, aircraft manufacturers, aviation industry  associations, airlines, air traffic controllers, maintenance technicians,  manufacturers of aircraft equipment, ground system developers, and  representatives of general aviation.", "Requirements setting: During the requirements-setting phase, FAA  establishes a minimum set of requirements, including safety objectives,  and specifies how well the new system must perform its intended  functions. For example, it was during this phase that FAA established  WAAS\u2019 and LAAS\u2019 integrity requirement\u2014which is that the system  cannot fail to warn pilots of misleading information that could  potentially create hazardous situations more than once in 10 million  approaches. After analyzing the initial requirements and comparing the  cost, benefits, schedule, and risk of various solutions, FAA sets final  requirements and presents them to the Joint Resources Council as part  of the investment plan. After the council has approved the requirements  for the new system, FAA will issue a request for proposals, evaluate the  offers received, and select a contractor to design a system based on the  requirements set by FAA. Potential stakeholders in this phase include  FAA\u2019s Office of Regulation and Certification, FAA\u2019s Air Traffic  Organization, aircraft manufacturers, aviation industry associations,  airlines, air traffic controllers, maintenance technicians, manufacturers  of aircraft equipment, ground system developers, and representatives of  general aviation.", "Design and development: The design and development of ground  systems is generally completed by a contractor and monitored by FAA.  During this phase, the contractor conducts preliminary and critical  design reviews, which include plans for how it will conduct the testing  phase. FAA must approve these plans before the contractor can proceed  to the next phase. Potential stakeholders in this phase include FAA,  ground system developers, air traffic controllers, and maintenance  technicians.", "Test and evaluation: After FAA has approved the design and  development of the system, it is ready to be tested and evaluated. The  testing and evaluation of ground systems typically includes three major  tests: development tests, operational tests, and an independent  operational test and evaluation. Development testing is performed by  the contractor to verify compliance with contractual requirements and  is overseen by FAA. Operational testing is performed by FAA and is  designed to demonstrate that a new system is operationally effective  and suitable for use in the national airspace system. An independent  operational test and evaluation is a full system-level evaluation  conducted by FAA in an operational environment to confirm the  operational readiness of a system to be part of the national airspace  system. Potential stakeholders in this phase include FAA, ground system  developers, air traffic controllers, and maintenance technicians.", "Operational readiness: During the operational readiness phase, FAA  personnel are trained to operate and maintain the new system, usually in  conjunction with its predecessor system. Following operational  readiness approval, the system is ready to be commissioned. Potential  stakeholders in this phase include FAA, ground system developers, air  traffic controllers, and maintenance technicians.", "Commissioning: The commissioning phase ensures that the new  ground system as installed meets the intended mission and operational  requirements and is fully supported by the national airspace system  infrastructure. Potential stakeholders in this phase include FAA, ground  system developers, air traffic controllers, and maintenance technicians."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aircraft Equipment Certification Process", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the ground system approval process, certification of aircraft  equipment is done in accordance with procedures outlined in the Federal  Aviation Regulations, Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 21. Under  Title 49, Section 44704, of the U.S. Code, FAA has the authority to issue type  certificates, supplemental type certificates, and production certificates,  among others, for aircraft and equipment that will be used in the national  airspace system. Unlike the approval of ground systems, which FAA  accomplishes with the help of a contractor, FAA is the regulator of aircraft  equipment and is not typically involved in the development of the  equipment. An applicant, such as a manufacturer of aircraft equipment,  generally brings fully developed aircraft equipment to FAA for certification.  The aircraft equipment certification process includes the following five  phases\u2014concept of operations, requirements setting, design and  production approval, installation approval, and operational approval\u2014and  involves several stakeholders, which are also noted below:   Concept of operations: Like the ground system approval process, the  aircraft equipment certification process generally begins with the  concept of operations phase, when the aircraft equipment is part of an  ATC system. If the aircraft equipment certification process is not  associated with the approval of a new ground system, then the  certification process may begin with an idea for better equipment.  During this phase, FAA, sometimes with the help of industry, identifies  and defines a service or capability to meet a particular need in the  national airspace system. Potential stakeholders in this phase include  FAA\u2019s Office of Regulation and Certification, FAA\u2019s Air Traffic  Organization, aircraft manufacturers, aviation industry associations,  airlines, air traffic controllers, maintenance technicians, manufacturers  of aircraft equipment, ground system developers, and representatives of  general aviation.", "Requirements setting: Once FAA has identified the need for a new  system with aircraft equipment, FAA determines the requirements for the aircraft equipment. In some cases, the requirements for aircraft  equipment may already exist in the Federal Aviation Regulations. In  other cases, FAA may ask RTCA to develop the requirements, including  safety requirements, which are referred to as minimum operating  performance standards. RTCA typically takes 1 to 5 years to develop  the standards because of the need to reach consensus between FAA  and the industry and the increasing complexity of systems being  developed today. According to a RTCA official, the time required to  develop recommended standards is a function of many variables,  including urgency of the situation and the commitment and availability  of government and industry volunteers to collaboratively develop the  standards. For example, in the case of WAAS, RTCA began setting  performance standards in 1994, completed the original version of the  standards in January 1996, and completed the most recent version of  WAAS performance standards in November 2001. Potential  stakeholders in this phase include FAA\u2019s Office of Regulation and  Certification, FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Organization, aircraft manufacturers,  aviation industry associations, airlines, air traffic controllers,  maintenance technicians, manufacturers of aircraft equipment, ground  system developers, and representatives of general aviation.", "Design and production approval: The requirements/performance  standards, most often developed by RTCA, typically form the basis for a  technical standard order, which FAA uses to grant design and  production approval for most new aircraft equipment developed in  support of national airspace system modernization efforts. Technical  standard orders are FAA\u2019s requirements for materials, parts, processes,  and appliances used on civil aircraft. Most aircraft manufacturers want  technical standard orders because they make installation approval  simpler and less costly and allow for operation in any type of aircraft.  Technical standard orders are issued for items ranging from safety belts  to navigation equipment. If the applicant successfully completes the  design and production approval phase, FAA provides the applicant with  a technical standard order authorization letter, which states that the  applicant has met a specific technical standard order and the product is  now ready for the installation approval phase. Potential stakeholders in  this phase include FAA\u2019s Aircraft Certification Service, manufacturers of  aircraft equipment, and aircraft manufacturers.", "Installation approval: After receiving a technical standard order  authorization for new aircraft equipment, the initial applicant must  receive installation approval from FAA before the aircraft equipment  may be used in the national airspace system. To receive installation  approval, the applicant submits a certification plan and test plan to one  of FAA\u2019s aircraft certification offices for review and approval. In  addition, the applicant conducts ground and flight tests under FAA\u2019s  supervision to ensure that the new equipment operates properly upon  installation. Once the tests are completed to FAA\u2019s satisfaction, FAA  issues a supplemental type certificate, which is evidence of FAA\u2019s  approval to modify an aircraft from its original design. Potential  stakeholders in this phase include FAA\u2019s Aircraft Certification Service,  manufacturers of aircraft equipment, and aircraft manufacturers.", "Operational approval: Finally, for the aircraft equipment to become  certified for use in the national airspace system by air carrier operators,  operational approval is also needed from FAA. To obtain operational  approval, the applicant must successfully demonstrate, among other  things, that the pilots are properly trained to use the aircraft equipment  and that maintenance personnel are properly trained to maintain the  equipment. Potential stakeholders in this phase include FAA\u2019s Flight  Standards Service, airlines, and representatives of general aviation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FAA Faced Challenges in Approving Several ATC Systems", "paragraphs": ["FAA faced challenges in approving systems for safe use in the national  airspace system that contributed to cost growth, delays, and performance  shortfalls in deploying these systems. We identified three specific challenges through the review of 5 ATC systems and our past work. These  challenges are the need to  involve appropriate stakeholders, such as users and technical experts,  throughout the approval process;   ensure that the FAA offices that have responsibility for approving  ground systems and certifying aircraft equipment effectively coordinate  their efforts for integrated systems; and  accurately estimate the amount of time needed to meet complex  technical requirements at the beginning of the design and development  phase.", "Although most of the challenges we found relate to the ground system  approval process, RTCA and the Aerospace Commission have identified  challenges with FAA\u2019s aircraft equipment certification process. For  example, RTCA found that there was a need for better internal FAA  communication and coordination, including the establishment of an  organizational focal point to provide coordinated responses to all matters  related to ground systems and aircraft equipment. In addition, the  Aerospace Commission found that FAA\u2019s regulatory process needs to be  streamlined to enable the timely development of regulations needed to  address new technologies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA Did Not Always Adequately Involve Appropriate Stakeholders, Such as Users and Technical Experts, Throughout Its Approval Process", "paragraphs": ["FAA failed to adequately involve appropriate stakeholders, such as air  traffic controllers and maintenance technicians, for 3 of the 5 systems we  reviewed. For example, FAA did not adequately involve controllers and  maintenance technicians throughout the approval process of STARS, which  will replace controller workstations with new color displays, processors,  and computer software. Although controllers and technicians were  involved in developing requirements for STARS in 1994 prior to the 1996  contract award to Raytheon, the original approved acquisition plan  provided for only limited human factors evaluation by controllers and  technicians during STARS\u2019 design and development because the aggressive  development schedule limited the amount of time available to involve  them. Consequently, FAA and Raytheon had to restructure the contract to  address controllers\u2019 concerns that were identified later, such as the  inconsistency of visual warning alarms and color codes with the new  system. According to FAA officials, not involving controllers and  maintenance technicians in the design phase caused the agency to revise its  strategy for acquiring and approving STARS, which contributed to STARS\u2019  overall cost growth of $500 million and added 3 years to the schedule.", "FAA also did not always sufficiently involve technical experts early in its  approval process for 2 additional systems that we reviewed. For example,  FAA did not obtain technical expertise on how to resolve the integrity  requirement of WAAS, a navigation system for aviation that augments the  Global Positioning System (GPS), until late in the design and development  phase. FAA acknowledges that the agency\u2019s in-house technical expertise  was not sufficient to address the technical challenges of WAAS. Initially,  FAA and the contractor believed they could meet the WAAS integrity  requirement to alert the pilot in a timely manner when the system should  not be used. However, although WAAS was being developed by an  integrated product team that included representatives from several FAA  offices, the team did not function effectively in resolving issues related to  meeting an important functional requirement to alert the pilot in a timely  manner when the system should not be used because of a possible error.  According to FAA officials, the reason coordination did not occur was that  the two offices had competing priorities that were not associated with  WAAS\u2019 development. Consequently, in 2000, FAA convened the WAAS  Integrity Performance Panel to help it meet the integrity requirement. The  WAAS Integrity Panel worked for about 2-1/2 years before it came up with a  solution to the integrity requirement. In addition, in August 2000, the  agency established an Independent Review Board, which is independent of  the panel and included experts in satellite navigation and safety  certification, to oversee the panel and evaluate the soundness of its efforts.", "According to a member of the WAAS Integrity Panel, if FAA had involved  these technical groups immediately after the contract was awarded to  Raytheon in 1996, these groups could have started devising a solution in  1996, rather than in 2000. This lack of technical expertise contributed to a  6-year delay in WAAS\u2019 commissioning and a $1.5 billion increase in its  development costs from the 1994 baseline.", "FAA also did not fully engage technical experts early in the approval  process of LAAS, a precision approach and landing system that will  augment GPS. According to FAA officials, meeting the LAAS integrity  requirement to alert the pilot in a timely manner when the system should  not be used is perhaps the most difficult part of approving this system for  safe use in the national airspace system. According to the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Inspector General, although FAA had a LAAS Integrity  Panel in place since 1996 to assist with its research and development  activities, the panel was not formally tasked with resolving LAAS\u2019 integrity  issues. According to one satellite navigation expert and the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Inspector General, focusing the LAAS Integrity Panel on  resolving the integrity requirement early in the approval process may have  enabled FAA to develop a quicker solution. In 2003, FAA focused the  LAAS Integrity Panel on developing a solution to meet the integrity  requirement. However, FAA and another satellite expert maintain that the  technical complexity of this problem is the main reason that LAAS is not  commissioned. According to FAA officials, the need to validate integrity  requirements and further software development has resulted in FAA  placing LAAS in its research and development program and suspending  funding for fiscal year 2005.", "In contrast, FAA faced fewer schedule and cost problems in approving  ASDE-X for use in the national airspace system. This was, in part, because  FAA included stakeholders early and throughout the approval process and  because program managers had strong technical expertise. The ASDE-X  program office brought in stakeholders, including maintenance technicians  and air traffic controllers, during the concept of operations phase and  continued to involve them during requirements setting, design and  development, and test and evaluation. FAA also brought ASDE-X  stakeholders together at technical meetings to provide input on ASDE-X  design and development, which allowed the ASDE-X program office to  design a system that met requirements and incorporated stakeholders\u2019  needs. By obtaining the input of controllers and technicians at the  beginning of the approval process, FAA was able to ensure that ASDE-X  requirements were set at appropriate levels and not overspecified or  underspecified. Some stakeholders commented that the program  managers\u2019 strong technical expertise was one reason that ASDE-X\u2019s  requirements were set appropriately. As a result, this system was initially  commissioned only 5 months behind schedule and its cost increased  moderately from $424 million to $510 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Did Not Always Effectively Coordinate Its Certification and Approval Processes", "paragraphs": ["FAA did not always effectively coordinate its certification and approval  processes for CPDLC, WAAS, and LAAS. Coordination between FAA\u2019s  offices responsible for approval of ground systems and certification of  aircraft equipment is becoming increasingly important given that more and  more ATC systems have both ground systems and aircraft equipment.  However, we found that coordination was not effective on CPDLC Build  1A, which allows pilots and controllers to transmit digital data messages  directly between FAA ground automation systems and suitably equipped  aircraft. In the interest of meeting the original cost and schedule  estimates, FAA awarded the contract before it had a full understanding of  system requirements. Requirements that specify how the ground system  and aircraft equipment would operate together were not yet completed  prior to award of the Build 1A contract. Consequently, changes needed to  be made after the contract was awarded. New hardware requirements,  software requirements, and other system requirement changes were added,  which increased CPDLC\u2019s costs by $41 million, almost 61 percent of the  total cost increases associated with CPDLC.", "The lack of effective coordination among FAA offices responsible for  approving WAAS also contributed to delays and increased costs in  commissioning WAAS. Although WAAS was being developed by an  integrated product team that included representatives from various FAA  offices, the team did not function effectively in resolving issues related to  meeting an important functional requirement to alert the pilot in a timely  manner when the system should not be used because of a possible error.  According to FAA officials, the reason coordination was not effective was  because the two offices had competing priorities that were not associated  with development of WAAS. Consequently, it was not until September 1999,  when the aircraft certification office became fully involved, that FAA  recognized that its solution to meet WAAS\u2019 integrity requirement was not  sufficient and that it did not have the technical expertise needed to develop  a solution. This lack of coordination contributed to a 6-year delay in WAAS\u2019  commissioning and a $1.5 billion increase in its development costs.", "LAAS is another example of how FAA did not effectively coordinate its  efforts. For example, FAA\u2019s Office of Regulation and Certification  completed the design and production approval of LAAS aircraft equipment  without effectively coordinating with the offices responsible for acquisition  to determine the consequences of certifying aircraft equipment before  approval of the associated ground system. According to an FAA official,  once the Office of Regulation and Certification has given design and  production approval to the LAAS aircraft equipment, it is not possible to  make a change to the requirements for the aircraft equipment so that they  are better integrated with the associated LAAS ground system.  Consequently, LAAS ground system developers may have to make more  costly and time-consuming changes to the ground system than would have  been necessary if the Office of Regulation and Certification and  acquisitions offices had coordinated their efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Did Not Always Prepare Accurate Estimates of the Amount of Time Needed to Meet Complex Technical Requirements", "paragraphs": ["We have reported in the past that when FAA attempts to combine different  phases of system development in an effort to more quickly implement the  systems to meet milestones, it repeatedly experiences major performance  shortfalls and rework, which leads to schedule delays and cost increases.  We found that WAAS, STARS, and LAAS all experienced delays and cost  increases in part because FAA did not prepare accurate estimates of the  amount of time needed to meet complex technical requirements, leading to  an accelerated schedule that sometimes failed to include activities such as  human factors evaluations and technical expert consultations. For  example, in 1994, in response to the concerns of government and aviation  groups, FAA accelerated implementation of WAAS milestones from 2000 to  1997. FAA planned to develop, test, and deploy WAAS within 28 months, an  unrealistic goal given that software development alone was expected to  take 24 to 28 months. It was not until July 2003, over 6 years later, that FAA  was able to commission WAAS for initial operating capability. The  accelerated schedule contributed to the 6-year delay in the commissioning  of the system because the schedule itself was unrealistic and additional  design work needed to be completed. During that time, the cost to develop  the system increased about $1.5 billion, and the system has yet to meet its  original performance goal of providing pilots with the ability to navigate  down to 200 feet during their approach to the runway.", "FAA also accelerated the schedule for STARS in 1995. FAA\u2019s approach to  commissioning STARS was oriented to rapid deployment to meet critical  needs for new equipment. To meet these needs, FAA compressed its  original development and testing schedule from 32 to 25 months.  Consequently, this acceleration in schedule left only limited time for human  factors evaluations and, according to FAA officials, contributed to STARS\u2019  overall cost growth of $500 million and added 3 years to the first  deployment because the agency had to revise its strategy for acquiring and  approving STARS.", "Although FAA had not developed a solution for meeting the integrity  requirement, FAA also accelerated the LAAS schedule in 1999 by setting  system milestones before completely designing the system.

RTCA found that FAA\u2019s ground system approval process and  aircraft equipment certification process took too long and cost too much,  and RTCA made several recommendations to improve the processes. For  example, in 2001, RTCA recommended that FAA implement a coordinated  approval process that, among other things, would ensure that all  stakeholders, including those outside FAA\u2019s program offices, participate in  all phases of the approval process. Specifically, similar to our finding that  the FAA offices that had responsibility for approving ground systems and  certifying aircraft equipment did not always effectively coordinate their  efforts, RTCA found that there was a need for better internal FAA  communication and coordination, including the establishment of an  organizational focal point to provide coordinated responses to all matters  related to ground systems and aircraft equipment.

The Aerospace Commission found that FAA\u2019s certification of new aircraft  technologies has become uncertain in terms of time and cost and  recommended that FAA\u2019s regulatory process be streamlined to enable the  timely development of regulations needed to address new technologies.  According to the Aerospace Commission, instead of focusing on rules and  regulations that dictate the design and approval of equipment, FAA should  focus on certifying that manufacturing organizations have safety built into  their processes for designing, testing, and ensuring the performance of an  overall system. The commission believed that such an approach would  allow FAA personnel to better keep up with technological progress by  becoming less design-specific and more safety-focused."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Taken Action to Improve Its Process for Approving ATC Systems", "paragraphs": ["FAA has taken action to address two of the three management challenges  that we identified. However, FAA has not taken action to ensure that all  stakeholders, such as air traffic controllers, maintenance technicians,  technical experts, and industry representatives, are involved throughout  the ground system approval process. FAA has also taken some action to  address recommendations made by RTCA and the Aerospace Commission.  Examples of some of the actions FAA has taken that address the  management challenges that we found as well as RTCA and Aerospace  Commission recommendations are discussed below:  Coordinating FAA\u2019s acquisitions offices and Office of Regulation and  Certification efforts for approving systems with ground and aircraft  components: FAA officials believe that the agency\u2019s new Safety  Management System, which is designed to formalize the agency\u2019s safety  process, will also improve coordination among FAA internal  stakeholders once it is implemented. FAA stated that coordination  would improve because as part of the new Safety Management System  the agency plans to realign its organizational structure to create a formal  link between the Air Traffic Organization and the Office of Regulation  and Certification. Within the Office of Regulation and Certification,  there is the newly created Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service, which  oversees the safety operations of the Air Traffic Organization and  collaborates with the Air Traffic Organization\u2019s Safety Services. In  addition, according to FAA officials, both ground systems and aircraft  equipment will be more consistently assessed for their effect on safety  as safety terminology is standardized. FAA expects full implementation  to take 3 to 5 years. We are reserving judgment on whether this change  will fully address the challenge because of the early state of this effort  and because FAA\u2019s problems with internal coordination when approving  ATC systems are long-standing. In addition, because FAA has  historically faced internal and external coordination challenges in  approving ATC systems for safe use in the national airspace, we believe  that as FAA moves forward with the agency\u2019s new Safety Management  System, it should, in the interim, develop plans that describe how both  internal and external coordination will occur on a system-specific basis.  In addition, plans to include external stakeholders are particularly  important since the Safety Management System is not intended to  address this challenge.", "Estimating the amount of time needed to meet complex technical  requirements: During the development of WAAS and STARS, FAA  adopted an incremental approach to developing and testing these  systems to get them back on track, which is referred to as the \u201cbuild a  little, test a little\u201d or spiral development approach. For example, to get  WAAS back on track, FAA decided to take a more incremental approach  to implementing the new navigation system\u2014focusing more on the  successful completion of research and development before starting  system approval. In particular, FAA allowed time for collecting and  evaluating data on key system performance requirements like the WAAS  integrity requirement before moving forward. FAA officials  acknowledged that the manner in which FAA decided to implement  WAAS development before implementing this incremental approach  was a high-risk approach and was a primary issue underlying the  system\u2019s problems. Some aviation stakeholders believe this approach is  advantageous because, although it can increase costs initially, money  can be saved in the long run because the approach may help to avoid  mistakes that are very costly to fix once a system has been developed.  This approach also helps to ensure that the necessary building blocks of  a system are tested along the way through the early and ongoing  involvement of key stakeholders, those who will use and maintain the  system. These stakeholders are key to identifying critical omissions and  issues that could prevent a system from operating as intended.", "As previously discussed, RTCA and the Aerospace Commission reviewed  FAA\u2019s approval process and made a number of recommendations to  improve it. FAA has taken some action to address these recommendations.  For example:  In response to RTCA\u2019s recommendation to implement a process in  which the regulators and applicants come to an early and clear  agreement on their respective roles, responsibilities, expectations,  schedules, and standards to be used in certification projects, FAA issued  The FAA and Industry Guide to Avionics Approval in 2001, which is  intended to help FAA reduce the time and cost for the certification of  aircraft equipment. This guide describes how to plan, manage, and  document an effective, efficient aircraft equipment certification process  and how to develop a working relationship between FAA and the  applicant. In addition, as part of the 1999 FAA and Industry Guide to  Product Certification, FAA encourages the manufacturers of aircraft  equipment to develop a Partnership for Safety Plan that defines roles  and responsibilities, describes how the certification process will be  conducted, and identifies the milestones for completing the  certification. A WAAS aircraft equipment manufacturer said that the  certification of the WAAS aircraft equipment it developed went  smoothly, primarily because of this up-front agreement with FAA.  Although FAA\u2019s actions address the aircraft equipment certification  process, it does not have a similar process for its ground system  approval process.", "In response to RTCA\u2019s recommendation to establish an organizational  focal point to provide one-stop service to users, industry, and other  governments in all matters related to advanced ground electronics and  aircraft equipment, FAA has completed a Web site that provides a broad  range of information on the certification process for aircraft equipment.  However, there is still no focal point to which industry can address  questions about the approval process and be assured of getting a fully  coordinated FAA answer.", "In response to the Aerospace Commission\u2019s recommendation to  streamline its aircraft equipment certification process to ensure timely  development of regulations needed to address new technologies and to  focus on certifying that manufacturing organizations have built safety  into their processes for designing, testing, and ensuring the performance  of an overall system, FAA proposed creating an Organizational  Designation Authorization program in January 2004. The program would  expand the approval functions of FAA organizational designees,  standardize these functions to increase efficiency, and expand eligibility  for organizational designees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FAA did not always include stakeholders throughout the process for  approving ATC systems for safe use in the national airspace system.  Including stakeholders is particularly important because the new ATC  systems are more integrated today than in the past and thus require more  coordination among all the stakeholders, particularly FAA\u2019s Office of  Regulation and Certification and the recently created Air Traffic  Organization, but also between FAA and other stakeholders, such as  technical experts, controllers, and maintenance technicians. When  decisions regarding integrated ATC systems are made in isolation, they may  contribute to the ineffective use of resources and time. We found that 3 of  the 5 ATC systems we reviewed experienced cost growth and schedule  delays, in part, because FAA did not always involve all necessary  stakeholders, such as controllers and technical experts, throughout the  approval process. In 2001, RTCA recommended that FAA implement a  coordinated approval process that, among other things, would ensure that  all stakeholders, including those outside FAA\u2019s program offices, participate  in all phases of the approval process. We agree with RTCA\u2019s  recommendation, which FAA has not fully implemented, and believe that  fully implementing it would help address some of the challenges we found  with FAA\u2019s approval and certification processes.", "In addition, although FAA\u2019s new Safety Management System and the  planned alignment between FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Organization and Office of  Regulation and Certification have the potential to improve FAA\u2019s internal  coordination, FAA has just begun implementing these initiatives with full  implementation 3 to 5 years away. FAA also has historically faced internal  coordination challenges in approving ATC systems for safe use in the  national airspace system as we found for each of the 3 integrated systems  that we reviewed.

However, the system will not be implemented until 3 to 5  years. Therefore, because of FAA\u2019s history of internal and external  coordination challenges, such as the lack of effective coordination between  FAA offices responsible for approving WAAS, which contributed to WAAS\u2019  cost increase of about $1.5 billion and schedule delays of 6 years, we  believe that specific plans for improving coordination both internally and  externally on a system-specific basis are needed now."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that key stakeholders, such as air traffic controllers,  maintenance technicians, and technical experts, outside FAA\u2019s acquisitions  offices and Office of Regulation and Certification, are involved early and  throughout FAA\u2019s ground system approval process and to ensure better  internal coordination between FAA\u2019s offices responsible for approving  ground systems and certifying aircraft equipment, we recommend that the  Secretary of Transportation direct the Administrator of FAA to develop  ATC system-specific plans early in the approval process that specify how  and when the approving and certifying offices within FAA and other  stakeholders, including controllers, maintenance technicians, technical  experts, and industry representatives, will meet to ensure coordination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Transportation for  review and comment.

Under FAA\u2019s integrity requirement for LAAS, the  system must alert the pilot with timely warnings when it should not be  used. However, FAA has not been able to develop a solution to meet this  requirement because it has not been able to prove that the system is safe  during solar storms. According to FAA officials, one of the reasons that  FAA has not been able to develop a solution to meet this requirement is that  a solar storm\u2019s effect on the ionosphere has not been modeled.

Initially, FAA was in  a partnership with industry, including Honeywell and others, to develop a  LAAS Category I precision approach and landing system, which has a 200- foot ceiling height and one-half mile visibility. FAA partnered with industry  to develop LAAS because FAA would have to pay industry only if industry  achieved preset milestones, such as an analysis of the LAAS system  integrity requirement.

However,  5 months later, after further review, FAA discovered that only about 20  percent of development was complete. Nevertheless, Honeywell believes it  met 80 percent of the LAAS requirements. Both parties attribute the  disagreement to lack of communication about what was needed to satisfy  the LAAS ground system requirements.

Although controllers and  technicians were involved in developing requirements for STARS prior to  the 1996 contract award to Raytheon, the original approved acquisition  plan provided only limited human factors evaluation from controllers and  technicians during STARS\u2019 design and development phase. The acquisition  approach was to employ a commercial off-the-shelf system with limited  modifications, and the competition was limited to companies with already  operational ATC systems. In 1997, FAA controllers, who were accustomed  to using the older equipment, began to voice concerns about computer- human interface issues that could hamper their ability to monitor air  traffic. For example, the controllers noted that many features of the old  equipment could be operated with knobs, allowing controllers to focus on  the screen. By contrast, the STARS commercial system was menu-driven  and required the controllers to make several keystrokes and use a  trackball, diverting their attention from the screen. The maintenance  technicians also identified differences between STARS and its backup  system that made monitoring the system less efficient. For example, the  visual warning alarms and color codes identifying problems were not  consistent between the two systems. In 1997, FAA, the National Air Traffic  Controllers Association, the Professional Airways System Specialists, and  Raytheon formed a team to deal with these computer-human interface  issues. The team identified 98 air traffic and 52 airway facilities computer- human interface enhancements to address these issues.", "FAA and Raytheon restructured the contract to address the technicians\u2019  and controllers\u2019 concerns. According to FAA, not involving controllers and  maintenance technicians caused FAA to revise its strategy for approving  STARS, which FAA estimates added $500 million and 3 years to the  schedule. The original STARS cost estimate of $940 million included limited  human factors evaluations and the use of a basic commercial off-the-shelf  configuration. This acquisition strategy was replaced by an incremental  development strategy that incorporated up front the majority of human  factors considerations and additional functionality that were not included  in the original cost estimate. This new acquisition strategy added years to  the development schedule and significantly increased the system\u2019s  requirements specifications. These additional requirements resulted in  both cost and schedule growth. FAA\u2019s own guidance showed that limiting  human factors evaluations will result in higher costs and schedule delays.  Initially, it is more expensive (in terms of time and funding) to deal with  human factors considerations than to ignore them. However, an initial  human factors investment pays high dividends, in terms of costs and  schedule, in later stages of acquisition when changes are more costly and  difficult to make.", "FAA also experienced challenges in approving STARS, partly, because of  aggressive scheduling. FAA\u2019s approach to approving STARS was oriented to  rapid deployment to meet critical needs. To meet these needs, FAA  compressed its original development and testing schedule from 32 months  to 25 months. This acceleration in schedule left only limited time for human  factors evaluations and not enough time for involvement of controllers and  maintenance technicians.", "Table 12 shows the major phases and time frames associated with the  STARS approval process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Wide Area Augmentation System Case Illustration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["WAAS is a GPS-based navigation and landing system.

Pilots are able to use this information to  determine their aircrafts\u2019 time and speed, and latitude, longitude, and  altitude positions. WAAS currently consists of a network of 25 ground  reference stations, 2 leased geostationary satellites, 2 master stations, and  4 uplink (ground earth) stations. The ground reference stations are  strategically positioned across the United States to collect GPS satellite  data. (See fig. 6.)

As of August 2004, there were about 20 LPV  landing procedures published for WAAS. With over 4,000 runways needing  them, much work still needs to be done to fully utilize the WAAS capability.

Under the May 2004 baseline, FAA estimates that WAAS development costs  will be about $2.0 billion, which is $1.5 billion higher than the 1994  estimated development costs. Also, FAA has not yet met some of its  original performance goals, such as providing pilots with the ability to  navigate as low as 200 feet above the runway. According to FAA, WAAS  cannot easily achieve Category I as a single frequency system because the  error sources caused by solar storms are difficult to correct without the use  of a second civil aviation frequency in space, which is the responsibility of  the Department of Defense.

FAA\u2019s challenges in approving  WAAS began in 1994 when FAA accelerated the implementation of  milestones, including moving up the commissioning of WAAS by 3 years.  FAA originally planned to commission WAAS in 2000; however, at the  urging of government and aviation industry groups in the 1990s, it decided  to change WAAS\u2019 commissioning date to 1997. FAA tried to develop, test,  and deploy WAAS within 28 months, despite the fact that software  development alone was expected to take 24 to 28 months. FAA also set  system milestones before completing the research and development  required to prove the system\u2019s capability.

For example, although an integrated product team, which included  representatives from aircraft certification and acquisition offices, was  developing WAAS, it was not until September 1999, when the aircraft  certification office became fully involved, that FAA recognized (1) the  difficulty of meeting the integrity requirement\u2014that WAAS must alert the  pilot in a timely manner when the system should not be used\u2014and (2) it did  not have the technical expertise needed. According to FAA officials, the  reason coordination did not occur was because the two offices had  competing priorities, such as the day-to-day aircraft equipment  certification activities not associated with the development of a new ATC  system. This situation may have developed because FAA\u2019s aircraft  certification organization is more accustomed to being involved after a  project is developed, rather than actively participating throughout project  development.", "The need to meet WAAS\u2019 integrity requirement also hampered FAA\u2019s ability  to approve WAAS for safe use in the national airspace system. In December  1999, FAA found that WAAS did not meet the agency\u2019s integrity requirement  for precision approaches, and FAA recognized that it did not have the  technical expertise required to resolve the issue. Therefore, in 2000, FAA  established a team of satellite navigation experts, which was referred to as  the WAAS Integrity Performance Panel and included representatives from  the MITRE Corporation, Stanford University, Ohio University, and the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory. Developing a solution to prove that the WAAS  design met the integrity requirement added about 2 years and 4 months to  the approval process and contributed to WAAS\u2019 cost growth.
