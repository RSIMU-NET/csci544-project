According to an HHS website, by December 2013, the  increased system capacity allowed the system to accommodate more  than 1.8 million visits a day from consumers to the website and its  supporting systems. According to an HHS progress report issued in  December 2013 and other data provided by CMS, Healthcare.gov system  availability went from 42.9 percent to just over 93 percent during  November 2013, and the FFM system response time went from 8  seconds in late October 2013 to less than 1 second by December 2013.", "In addition, in October 2013 CMS took steps to mitigate system coding  issues. For example, the agency directed its development contractors to,  among other things, modify system software to increase the efficiency in  system interactions and implement software fixes to address issues with  users logging into their accounts. In December 2013, HHS reported that  the number of errors encountered by individuals using the system  decreased by over 5 percent by the end of November 2013, going from a  6 percent error rate to under 1 percent.", "Also, CMS documented data quality plans for the Enterprise Identity  Management system in March 2014 and the FFM system in June 2014  that outline an approach for improving the quality of the systems\u2019 code.

As the primary verification activity, peer reviews are to  be conducted to help facilitate early detection of problems, and thus  reduce the number of problems discovered in later stages of  development, which helps to minimize the cost associated with  rework. Peer reviews are to include a review of requirements, design,  code, and test planning work products. Peer reviews can be  conducted by peer members of the project team or team leads,  managers, and design review boards.", "Process and Product Quality Assurance Reviews. These reviews  are intended to ensure that work products, project management  processes, high-level development processes, and day-to-day  practices adhere to documented CMS processes and standards.  These reviews are to be conducted by contractors not directly  responsible for the work product or process being reviewed.", "Quality Assurance Review. The primary purpose of the quality  assurance review is to verify that the FFM IT program is progressing  based on expectations and is providing business value, and that  appropriate risks are identified and managed so that solutions can be  delivered on time and within budget. This review is conducted by a  contractor Managing Director who is also referred to as a quality  assurance Director. These directors are external to the FFM system  project, with technical and functional expertise in line with the  program.", "Nonetheless, even with these efforts, IV&V assessments continued to  identify issues with software coding practices. For example, in July 2014  the assessment team identified over 11,000 critical code violations in the  eligibility and enrollment module of the FFM system which could cause  major issues in production or difficulties in maintaining the code. The  assessment team highlighted the need for CMS to ensure the FFM  system code is reviewed and that critical and major violations are  remediated.", "CMS has also taken steps to develop additional system functionality for  the FFM system. In order to complete FFM system development and to  improve system functionality already provided by the original contractor  tasked with developing this system, the agency awarded a new contract  in January 2014. According to the statement of work, this new FFM  system development contract represents almost exclusively new  development and major fixes to software already developed. The contract  called for the new contractor to design, develop, test, and implement  services supporting the FFM system. This includes the financial  management module, the plan management module, and certain  eligibility and enrollment module functions that include eligibility  verification and determination.", "Some FFM system development activities are still in progress, such as  the payment service to issuers for subsidy payments to issuers through  the financial management module, among others. However, CMS made  progress in developing and implementing services related to the FFM  eligibility and enrollment and plan management modules.

In the comments, CMS disagreed with our characterization of  the 11,000 FFM critical code violations that were identified by the IV&V  assessment team in July 2014. CMS stated that these code violations  were identified very early on in the development phase of building the  eligibility and enrollment module and that most of the risk represented by  these code violations is to the cost of maintaining the code over time,  rather than to its successful functionality. The agency added that any  defects which could cause problems with the functionality of the  Healthcare.gov system would have been identified and addressed during  subsequent testing. However, the IV&V assessment stated that the  review was based on a \u201csnapshot of the production code\u201d and not code  that was in development.

In the comments, OMB took issue with our  statement that it did not conduct a TechStat review when the IT  Dashboard indicated problems 7 months prior to the initial launch of  Healthcare.gov and its supporting systems. According to the OMB official,  a brief dip in the risk rating, such as the one experienced in March 2013,  did not necessitate a formal TechStat. The official further stated that the  tech surge that OMB instituted shortly after the launch of the system,  which included an assessment of its problems, effectively represented a  large-scale and comprehensive TechStat session and replaced the need  for a separate OMB- or agency-led review. Nevertheless, had such an  assessment or a TechStat been conducted earlier in the system  development process, the results could have been used to identify and  correct deficiencies prior to system launch.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,  and other interested parties.
