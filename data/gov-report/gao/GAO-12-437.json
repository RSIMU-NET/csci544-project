Full rate production is now planned for 2019, a delay of 6 years from the 2007 baseline. Unit costs per aircraft have doubled since start of development in 2001. Critical dates for delivering warfighter requirements remain unsettled because of program uncertainties. While the total number of aircraft DOD plans to buy has not changed, it has for 3 straight years reduced near-term procurement quantities, deferring aircraft and costs to future years. Since 2002, the total quantity through 2017 has been reduced by three-fourths, from 1,591 to 365. Affordability is a key challenge\u0096annual acquisition funding needs average about $12.5 billion through 2037 and life-cycle operating and support costs are estimated at $1.1 trillion. DOD has not thoroughly analyzed program impacts should funding expectations be unmet.", "Overall performance in 2011 was mixed as the program achieved 6 of 11 important objectives. Developmental flight testing gained momentum and is now about 21 percent complete with the most challenging tasks still ahead. Performance of the short takeoff and vertical landing variant improved this year and its \u0093probation\u0094 period to fix deficiencies was ended after 1 year with several fixes temporary and untested. Developing and integrating the more than 24 million lines of software code continues to be of concern. Late software releases and concurrent work on multiple software blocks have delayed testing and training. Development of critical mission systems providing core combat capabilities remains behind schedule and risky. To date, only 4 percent of the mission systems required for full capability have been verified. Deficiencies with the helmet mounted display, integral to mission systems functionality and concepts of operation, are most problematic. The autonomic logistics information system, integral technology for improving aircraft availability and lowering support costs, is not fully developed.", "Most of the instability in the program has been and continues to be the result of highly concurrent development, testing, and production activities. Cost overruns on the first four annual procurement contracts total more than $1 billion and aircraft deliveries are on average more than 1 year late. Program officials said the government\u0092s share of the cost growth is $672 million; this adds about $11 million to the price of each of the 63 aircraft under those contracts. Effectively managing the expanding network of global suppliers will be key to improving program outcomes, increasing manufacturing throughput, and enabling higher production rates. In addition to contract overruns, concurrency costs of at least $373 million have been incurred on production aircraft to correct deficiencies found in testing. The manufacturing process is still absorbing higher than expected number of engineering changes resulting from flight testing, changes which are expected to persist at elevated levels into 2019, making it difficult to achieve efficient production rates. More design and manufacturing changes are expected as testing continues, bringing risks for more contract overruns and concurrency costs.

The program was replanned in  2004 following weight and performance problems and rebaselined in  2007 due to cost growth and schedule slips. In February 2010, the  Secretary of Defense announced another comprehensive restructuring of  the program due to poor outcomes and continuing problems. This  restructuring followed an extensive Department-wide review which  included three independent groups chartered to evaluate program  execution and resources, manufacturing processes and plans, and  engine costs and affordability initiatives. DOD provided additional  resources for testing\u2013funding, time, and flight test assets\u2013and reduced  near-term procurement by 122 aircraft. As a result of the additional  funding needed and recognition of higher unit procurement costs, in  March 2010 the Department declared that the program experienced a  Nunn-McCurdy breach of the critical cost growth statutory threshold and  subsequently certified to the Congress in June 2010 that the JSF program  should continue. The program\u2019s approval to enter system development  was rescinded and efforts commenced to establish a new acquisition  program baseline. The new JSF program executive officer subsequently  led a comprehensive technical baseline review. In January 2011, the  Secretary of Defense announced additional development cost increases,  further delays, and cut another 124 aircraft through fiscal year 2016.  Restructuring continued throughout 2011 and into 2012, adding to costs  and extending the schedules for achieving key activities.

Program officials reported  that flight tests to date have largely demonstrated air worthiness, flying  qualities, and initial speed, altitude, and maneuvering performance  requirements. According to JSF test officials, the more complex testing  such as low altitude flight operations, weapons and mission systems  integration, and high angle of attack has yet to be done for any variant  and may result in new discoveries of aircraft deficiencies. Initial  development flight tests of a fully integrated, capable JSF aircraft to  demonstrate full mission systems capabilities, weapons delivery, and  autonomic logistics is not expected until 2015 at the earliest. This will be  critical for verifying that the JSF aircraft will work as intended and for  demonstrating that the design is not likely to need costly changes.  Development flight testing in a production-representative test aircraft and  in the operational flight environment planned for the JSF is important to  reducing risk. This actual environment differs from what can be  demonstrated in the laboratory and has historically identified unexpected  problems. For example, the F-22A fighter software worked as expected in  the laboratory, but significant problems were identified in flight tests.  These problems delayed testing and the delivery of a proven capability to  the warfighter. Like other major weapon systems acquisitions, the JSF will  be susceptible to discovering costly problems later in development when  the more complex software and advanced capabilities are integrated and  flight tested. With most development flight testing still to go, the program  can expect more changes to aircraft design and continued alterations of  manufacturing processes.", "Initial dedicated operational testing of a fully integrated and capable JSF  is scheduled to begin in 2017.

Flight training efforts were delayed because of  immature aircraft. Durability testing identified structural modifications  needed for production aircraft to meet service life and operational  requirements. Analysis of the bulkhead crack problem revealed numerous  other life-limited parts on all three variants. According to DOT&E\u2019s report,  the most significant of these deficiencies in terms of complexity, aircraft  downtime, and difficulty in modification required for existing aircraft is the  forward wing root rib which experienced cracking during CTOL durability  testing. STOVL variant aircraft are also affected. Production aircraft in the  first four lots (63 aircraft) will need the modification before these aircraft  reach their forward root rib operating limits, which program officials  identified as 574 flight hours for the CTOL and 750 hours for the STOVL.  DOT&E also found that, although it is early in the program, current  reliability and maintainability data indicate that more attention is needed in  these areas to achieve an operationally suitable system.

Substantial  concurrency costs are expected to continue for several more years.

The JSF program now needs  to demonstrate that it can effectively perform against cost and schedule  targets in the new baseline and deliver on its promises so that the  warfighter can confidently establish basing plans, retire aging legacy  aircraft, and acquire a support infrastructure. Addressing affordability risks  will be critical in determining how many aircraft the U.S. and international  partners can ultimately acquire and sustain over the life cycle. As  currently structured, the program will require unprecedented levels of  procurement funding during a period of more constrained defense budget  expectations. Aircraft deferrals, risky funding assumptions, and future  budget constraints make it prudent to evaluate potential impacts from  reduced levels of funding. If funding demands cannot be fully met, it  would be important for congressional and defense decisionmakers to  understand the programmatic and cost impacts from lower levels of  funding; however, DOD officials have not thoroughly analyzed JSF  impacts should funding expectations be unmet.

The probation limited the U.S. STOVL procurement to three  aircraft in fiscal year 2011 and six aircraft in fiscal year 2012 and  decoupled STOVL testing from CV and CTOL testing so as not to delay  those variants. The 2 year probation was expected to provide enough  time to address STOVL-specific technical issues, engineer solutions, and  assess their impact. It was presumed that at the end of probation, an  informed decision could be made about whether and how to proceed with  ,  STOVL, but no specific exit criteria were established. In our 2011 reportwe recommended that the program establish criteria for the STOVL  probation period and take additional steps to sustain individual attention  on STOVL-specific issues to ensure cost and schedule milestones were  achieved in order to deliver required warfighter capabilities.", "Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Report to Congress  on Probationary Period in Development of Short Take-off, Vertical Landing Variant of the  Joint Strike Fighter: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 148. scrutiny than the other two variants. According to the department, interim  solutions are in place to mitigate the lingering technical issues with the  STOVL and permanent solutions are in varying stages of development or  implementation.", "While the probation period did not include specific criteria, the reasons  given for probation were to address technical issues, engineer solutions,  and assess impact, and it was expected to take 2 years to do so.  Although we note that several technical issues have been addressed and  some potential solutions engineered, assessing whether the deficiencies  are resolved is ongoing and, in some cases, will not be known for years.  Table 5 provides details on the STOVL technical problems identified at  the onset of probation, the efforts to resolve the problems, and  timeframes for implementing fixes. According to the program, of the five  specific problems cited, two are considered to be fixed (bulkhead cracks  and air inlet door loads) while the other three have temporary fixes in  place. The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) officials  reported that significant work remains to verify and incorporate  modifications to correct known STOVL deficiencies and prepare the  system for operational use. Until the proposed technical solutions have  been fully tested and demonstrated, it cannot be determined if the  technical problems have been resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact name above, the following staff members made  key contributions to this report: Bruce Fairbairn, Assistant Director;  Charlie Shivers; Sean Merrill; LeAnna Parkey; Dr. W.
