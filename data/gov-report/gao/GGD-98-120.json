However, by the end of fiscal year 1995, federal agencies\u2019 annual paperwork burden-hour estimate had risen from about 1.5 billion hours in 1980 to about 6.9 billion hours. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 amended and recodified the original act and was intended to, among other things, minimize the paperwork burden for individuals, small businesses, and others resulting from the collection of information by or for the federal government. The 1995 act reaffirmed and expanded OIRA\u2019s PRA responsibilities, and the drafters of the legislation indicated that improving OIRA\u2019s leadership would be one of the key factors in determining whether the act was successful.", "This report responds to your request that we assess how OIRA has implemented selected responsibilities assigned to it by the 1995 PRA. As requested, we compared OIRA\u2019s actions to the act\u2019s requirements in three areas of OIRA\u2019s information collection responsibilities.", "We looked at how OIRA reviews and controls paperwork, including (1) reviewing and approving agencies\u2019 information collection requests; (2) establishing and overseeing guidance for estimating information collection burden; (3) setting annual governmentwide goals for the reduction of that burden by at least 10 percent in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, 5 percent during the next 4 fiscal years, and setting annual agency goals that reduce paperwork to the \u201cmaximum practicable opportunity\u201d; and (4) conducting pilot projects to test alternative policies and procedures to minimize information collection burden.", "We examined OIRA\u2019s oversight of federal information resources management (IRM) activities, including developing and maintaining a governmentwide IRM plan and periodically reviewing selected agency IRM activities to determine their ability to improve agencies\u2019 performance and accomplish agencies\u2019 missions.", "We reviewed how OIRA keeps Congress and congressional committees fully and currently informed about major activities under the act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The 1995 PRA reaffirms the principles in the original act and gives significant new responsibilities to OIRA and executive branch agencies. For example, the act requires OIRA to \u201coversee the use of information resources to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governmental operations to serve agency missions,\u201d and it makes more explicit agencies\u2019 responsibilities in developing proposed collections of information and submitting them to OIRA for review. Like the original statute, the 1995 act requires agencies to justify any collection of information from the public by establishing the need and intended use of the information, estimating the burden that the collection will impose on the respondents, and showing that the collection is the least burdensome way to gather the information. Agencies must receive OIRA approval for each information collection request before it is implemented. The PRA also assigns OIRA other responsibilities, including information dissemination, statistical policy and coordination, records management, and information technology.", "Congress has also given OIRA other statutory responsibilities related to regulatory management. For example:", "The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) requires OIRA to collect agencies\u2019 written statements describing the costs and benefits of their rules and to forward those statements to the Congressional Budget Office. UMRA also required OIRA to establish pilot projects in at least two agencies to test regulatory approaches that reduce the burden on small governments and to submit annual reports to Congress detailing agencies\u2019 compliance with the act.", "The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA) requires OIRA to designate certain rules as \u201cmajor\u201d and therefore subject to a 60 day congressional review period. SBREFA also amended the Regulatory Flexibility Act and required OIRA to serve on advocacy review panels involving rules that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) intend to propose that the agencies believe will have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.", "Section 645(a) of the 1997 Treasury, Postal Services, and General Government Appropriations Act, required OIRA to submit to Congress by September 30, 1997, a report providing estimates of, among other things, the total annual costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. In the equivalent appropriations act for fiscal year 1998, Congress repeated the requirement for another such report by September 30, 1998.", "OMB as a whole also has statutory responsibilities that are related to OIRA\u2019s roles in the PRA. For example, under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act), OMB is charged with overseeing and guiding agencies\u2019 strategic and annual performance planning and reporting, and it is responsible for preparing an annual governmentwide performance plan that presents a single cohesive picture of federal performance goals. The Results Act also calls for OMB to review agencies\u2019 performance in view of the results the agencies are achieving with the resources they are given. The governmentwide performance plan that the Results Act requires OMB to prepare should, in part, reflect the governmentwide IRM strategic plan that the PRA requires OIRA to prepare. Similarly, OIRA\u2019s reviews of agencies\u2019 IRM activities under the PRA are logically related to OMB\u2019s reviews of agencies\u2019 performance and resource use under the Results Act.", "Also, like other federal agencies, the Results Act requires OMB to prepare its own strategic and annual performance plans and, beginning no later than March 31, 2000, to report to Congress annually on its progress toward achieving the goals in its annual performance plan for the previous fiscal year. Agencies\u2019 performance plans are to establish connections between their long-term strategic plans and the day-to-day activities of managers and staff. The annual program performance reports are to discuss the extent to which agencies are meeting annual performance goals and the actions needed to achieve or modify those goals that have not been met.Congress can use these plans and reports to determine how agencies are carrying out their statutory missions.", "The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which amended parts of the PRA, also gave OIRA significant leadership responsibilities in supporting agencies\u2019 efforts to improve their information technology management practices. Shortly after the passage of the act, we reported that OMB faced a number of challenges in this area, one of which was to develop recommendations for the president\u2019s budget that reflect an agency\u2019s actual track record in delivering mission performance for information technology funds expended. We specifically recommended that OMB, among other things, clearly show what improvements in mission performance have been achieved for information technology investments.", "In addition to these statutory responsibilities, two executive orders have made OIRA responsible for providing overall leadership of other executive branch regulatory activities and for reviewing executive departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 proposed and final regulations before they are published in the Federal Register. Executive Order 12291, issued in 1981 shortly after the original PRA was enacted, gave OMB the authority to review all new regulations issued by executive departments and agencies (other than independent regulatory agencies) for consistency with administration policies. In 1993, that order was revoked and replaced by Executive Order 12866, but the new order reaffirmed OMB\u2019s responsibilities for regulatory review and leadership. The order specifically stated that OIRA is the repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues, including matters that affect more than one agency. In calendar years 1995 through 1997, OIRA staff members reviewed approximately 500 significant proposed and final rules each year from executive departments and agencies pursuant to Executive Order 12866. The order also gives OIRA other responsibilities, including convening a regulatory working group comprising representatives of major regulatory agencies.", "With both statutory and executive order responsibilities, OIRA plays a dual role in the management of federal regulatory, paperwork, and information policies. It must carry out the responsibilities that Congress has given it through legislation while, at the same time, serving as an advisor to and implementor of presidential policy initiatives. OMB as a whole must similarly balance its statutory responsibilities and its responsibilities as a staff office to the president.", "We have issued a number of reports on the PRA since it was first enacted in 1980, several of which have focused on OIRA\u2019s responsibilities. For example, in 1983 we concluded that OIRA had made only limited progress in several IRM-related areas of the act and that the primary reason was the decision to assign OIRA primary responsibility for the administration\u2019s regulatory reform program without additional resources. In that report, we recommended that the OMB Director identify in the agency\u2019s budget program and financing schedule the resources needed to implement the PRA and assess the feasibility of assigning existing resources to address the act\u2019s requirements. We also suggested that Congress consider requiring OMB to (1) identify the resources it needed to implement the act and report annually on those expenditures, (2) provide a separate appropriation for the PRA\u2019s implementation, or (3) provide a separate PRA appropriation and prohibit OIRA from performing any duties other than those required in the act. In 1989, we reported that OIRA had established a formal process to review the 3,000 to 4,000 information collection requests it received each year, but those policies were not being consistently applied. We also noted that OIRA almost always approved requests from agencies with established review procedures, and we recommended that OIRA delegate primary review responsibility to senior officials in those agencies.", "More recently, in both 1996 and 1997, we testified on the implementation of selected features of the 1995 PRA. In both of our statements, we noted that the governmentwide burden-reduction goals contemplated in the PRA were unlikely to be met and that agencies often cited statutory constraints as the primary reason. For example, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials said that they would not be able to reduce their fiscal year 1995 paperwork totals by more than about 2 percent by the end of fiscal year 1998 unless major changes are made to the tax code. Because IRS has accounted for at least 75 percent of the government\u2019s estimated burden-hour total in each year since 1989, we said it appeared unlikely that the federal government as a whole would meet the 25 percent burden-reduction goal contemplated in the act.", "As we noted in our June 1997 testimony, it is important to remember that some federal paperwork is necessary and can serve a useful purpose. Information collection is one method by which agencies carry out their missions. For example, IRS needs to collect information from taxpayers and their employers to know the amount of taxes owed. EPA and OSHA must collect information to know whether the intent of such statutes as the Clean Air Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act are being achieved. The Results Act may require agencies to collect information that they had not previously collected in order to demonstrate their effectiveness. However, the Results Act may also help agencies eliminate certain paperwork requirements and keep the amount of paperwork as low as possible by focusing agencies\u2019 information collection actions on only those collections needed to accomplish their missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of our review were to assess how OIRA has implemented three of its information collection responsibilities under the PRA:", "We looked at how OIRA reviews and controls paperwork, including (1) reviewing and approving agencies\u2019 information collection requests; (2) establishing and overseeing guidance for estimating information collection burden; (3) setting annual governmentwide goals for the reduction of that burden by at least 10 percent in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, 5 percent during the next 4 fiscal years, and setting annual agency goals that reduce paperwork to the \u201cmaximum practicable opportunity\u201d; and (4) conducting pilot projects to test alternative policies and procedures to minimize information collection burden.", "We examined OIRA\u2019s development and oversight of federal IRM policies, including developing and maintaining a governmentwide IRM plan and periodically reviewing selected agency IRM activities to determine their ability to improve agencies\u2019 performance and accomplish agencies\u2019 missions.", "We looked at whether OIRA is keeping Congress and congressional committees fully and currently informed about major activities under the act.", "To determine what actions OIRA had taken in these areas, we analyzed OIRA\u2019s reports to Congress and other documents since the act passed in 1995; and we interviewed several OIRA officials and staff members, including the Acting Administrator. We then compared our understanding of OIRA\u2019s actions in these areas with the PRA\u2019s requirements and its legislative history. We also obtained OIRA staffing information from agency officials and data from the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) on the number of OIRA actions related to the information collection requests that it reviewed since the 1995 act was passed, including information on the types of requests submitted and the disposition of those reviews. To put these data in a larger perspective, we also obtained information on OIRA staffing and actions back to 1981, when OIRA was created by the original PRA.", "We focused our review solely on OIRA\u2019s implementation of the specific responsibilities delineated in the objectives. We did not examine the implementation of OIRA\u2019s other PRA responsibilities, including its responsibilities in the areas of federal information technology, records management, and statistical policies. Neither did we examine agencies\u2019 information collection responsibilities under the act; the quality of OIRA\u2019s information collection request reviews; or OMB\u2019s or OIRA\u2019s actions to develop information policies (e.g., OMB Circular A-130). Although OIRA\u2019s role as a staff office to the president makes it unique in some respects, this study evaluates OIRA\u2019s performance of specific statutory responsibilities for which it is accountable to Congress like any other agency.", "We conducted our review between January and May 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In each of these areas, OIRA officials described certain actions that they had taken or that were ongoing that they believed were consistent with the overall intent of the PRA\u2019s provisions. However, we believe that OIRA\u2019s actions in several of these areas fell short of the act\u2019s specific requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OIRA Review and Approval of Agencies\u2019 Proposed Information Collections", "paragraphs": ["As figure 1 shows, OIRA is currently organized into five branches. Three of those branches (Commerce and Lands, Human Resources and Housing, and Natural Resources) are primarily responsible for the office\u2019s paperwork and regulatory review functions. Certain OIRA staff within each of these branches, known as \u201cdesk officers,\u201d are responsible for reviewing proposed information collections and proposed rules from specific agencies. For example, one desk officer in OIRA\u2019s Commerce and Lands branch is primarily responsible for reviewing the regulatory and information collection proposals submitted by the Department of Transportation and the Federal Trade Commission. The two remaining OIRA branches (Information Policy and Technology Management and Statistical Policy) are primarily responsible for other functions assigned by the PRA. However, some staff in those branches review proposed information collections from certain agencies, and other staff may be involved in paperwork and regulatory reviews when called upon by staff in the other three branches.", "As shown in figure 2, OIRA had 77 employees when it was established in 1981. However, by 1997, OIRA had decreased in size to 48 employees\u2014a 38-percent reduction since 1981. As previously noted, not all of OIRA\u2019s employees are directly involved in reviewing agencies\u2019 information collection requests. Some employees in the agency\u2019s Information Policy and Technology Management and Statistical Policy branches do not review proposed information collections, and others are in support or managerial positions. In 1989, we reported that OIRA employed about 35 desk officers to review agencies\u2019 information collection submissions each year. OIRA officials told us that since the PRA was passed in 1995, between 20 and 25 desk officers have been primarily responsible for reviewing proposed information collections. In 1997, OIRA had 22 desk officers reviewing submissions\u2014about a 35-percent reduction from the level in 1989.", "Section 3504(c)(1) of the PRA states that OIRA shall \u201creview and approve proposed agency collections of information.\u201d The act also says that OIRA must complete its review of agencies\u2019 information collection requests within 60 days of the date that they are submitted to OIRA. However, the act does not prescribe a single way of reviewing proposed information collections. Therefore, OIRA desk officers have considerable statutory discretion in determining how much time and attention to devote to different parts of the submission and in deciding whether to approve the proposed collection or dispose of it in some other way.", "OIRA desk officers told us that the agencies requesting OIRA approvals for proposed collections of information initiate OIRA\u2019s review process by submitting a copy of the proposed collection, an OMB form summarizing how the proposed collection meets the PRA requirements, and a written supporting statement providing more details about the collection. They said this information is initially sent to OIRA\u2019s docket library, where it is logged in and forwarded to the relevant branch and desk officer. At the same time, the submitting agency issues a notice in the Federal Register stating that OIRA\u2019s approval is being sought, thereby providing the public with an opportunity to comment on the proposed collection. Information collection requests awaiting OIRA\u2019s approval are also posted on the agency\u2019s electronic bulletin board. The OIRA desk officer then reviews the information collection request and determines whether it should be approved. OIRA desk officers told us that some information collection requests require greater effort and take more time to review than others\u2014e.g., those that are new submissions (as opposed to renewals of existing information collections); that impose heavy paperwork burdens; and that relate to an administration initiative (e.g., welfare reform). The desk officers also said that information collection requests that receive only a limited review at the agencies also require more intensive review at OIRA. For example, they said that the Department of Agriculture has only one person responsible for reviewing proposed information collections for the entire Department. As a result, they said that they have to review the Department\u2019s information collection requests more intensively than submissions from other agencies that have devoted more staff to information collection reviews.", "If the request is a new information collection, the OIRA desk officers said that they first review any relevant statutes to determine whether the proposed collection is required to fulfill the purposes of the statutes and whether other less burdensome options could meet those purposes. They also said they focus on how the proposed collection meets each of the PRA requirements summarized on the accompanying form. The desk officers told us that they often review the information collections in the context of the agencies\u2019 programs and missions, and they are beginning to consider whether the proposed collections are linked to strategic plans that the agencies recently submitted under the Results Act requirements.", "The desk officers also said that a key part of their review is an attempt to validate agencies\u2019 burden-hour estimates. Some of the desk officers said that they do so by attempting to complete the proposed information collections as a respondent, keeping track of how long it takes to collect and provide the information. However, other desk officers said that they use other approaches to validate agencies\u2019 burden-hour estimates.", "All of the desk officers whom we spoke to said they frequently pose questions to the agencies about their proposed information collections, and any memoranda or letters related to those questions are placed in OIRA\u2019s public docket. They also said that they review agencies\u2019 summaries of public comments regarding the proposed collections and any public comments sent directly to OIRA. However, they also said that the public frequently submits no comments to either the agencies or OIRA.", "At the end of OIRA\u2019s review process the desk officers said that their initial determinations are reviewed by the branch chief and, if necessary, the Deputy Administrator. They then notify the agency proposing the information collection of the disposition of its request, and the disposition is posted to OIRA\u2019s electronic bulletin board. According to the PRA, information collection requests may be approved for up to 3 years, at which time they must be resubmitted to OIRA for approval if the agency wishes to continue to collect the information. The desk officers said that they typically complete their reviews of proposed information collection requests within the 60 days permitted in the PRA. They also said that their day-to-day work reviewing agencies\u2019 information collection requests did not substantially change as a result of the 1995 revisions to the PRA.", "Section 3511 of the PRA requires OIRA to establish and maintain a Government Information Locator Service (GILS) to assist agencies and the public in locating information and to promote information sharing and equitable access by the public. OIRA staff with whom we spoke said they do not use GILS to identify potentially overlapping agency information collection requests. They said that they were generally aware of potential information collection overlaps, and if unsure they would consult other desk officers or other OMB staff."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OIRA Actions and Staffing", "paragraphs": ["RISC\u2019s data on OIRA\u2019s activities under the PRA are based on the number of actions the agency takes pursuant to agencies\u2019 information collection requests. As shown in figure 3, the total number of OIRA actions has fluctuated during the past 17 years, but it has generally been between 3,000 and 5,000 actions each year. The figure also illustrates how those OIRA actions were distributed across the various types of information collection request submissions (e.g., new collections; revisions; and other types of submissions, such as extensions and reinstatements). The number of OIRA actions on new information collection requests has declined since the first several years of the act. Within the last several years there has been an increase in the number of actions in the \u201cother\u201d category, particularly requests for extensions of original approvals and reinstatements of elapsed information collections.", "Figure 4 also shows the number of OIRA actions each year between 1981 and 1997, and it shows how OIRA acted upon each of the agencies\u2019 information collection requests. The figure illustrates that the majority of OIRA actions in each year were approvals, followed by corrections and other actions (e.g., disapprovals, short-term extensions of existing approvals, and agency withdrawals of requests). The number of \u201cother\u201d dispositions increased in the 2 years following the enactment of the PRA in 1995, due largely to an increase in the number of short-term extensions of information collections for less than the full 3 years permitted in the act. However, the number of OIRA disapprovals of proposed collections of information declined from more than 200 in 1981 and 1982 to fewer than 15 in each year since 1993. OIRA officials and staff told us that this decline in the number of disapprovals reflects the fact that agencies have learned over time what the PRA requires and also illustrates a change in the way in which OIRA and the agencies interact. They said that during the Reagan and Bush administrations, OIRA\u2019s interactions with the agencies were more contentious; as a result, more information collection requests were disapproved, resubmitted with changes made, and then approved. However, OIRA officials said the Clinton administration has emphasized working collegially with the agencies to resolve differences, so the number of initial disapprovals has declined. Proposed information collections that, in the past, had been initially disapproved are now frequently \u201capproved with changes.\u201d They also pointed out that the increased number of short-term extensions reflects a measure of OIRA concern about the proposed collection.", "The total number of PRA actions that OIRA has taken each year has been relatively constant since the original PRA was enacted, but (as previously noted) the number of OIRA desk officers available to review proposed collections of information declined during this period. Therefore, the PRA-related workload per OIRA desk officer has increased since the 1980s. One OIRA desk officer told us that she typically has between 20 and 30 proposed information collections on her desk at any one time. However, she pointed out that some of these proposals are renewals of previously approved information collections that do not require substantial effort. She said that she manages the workload through an informal \u201ctriage\u201d system, in which proposed information collections are ranked in terms of the degree of attention required."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OIRA Guidance on Estimating Paperwork Burden", "paragraphs": ["Section 3504(c)(5) of the PRA requires OIRA to \u201cestablish and oversee standards and guidelines by which agencies are to estimate the burden to comply with a proposed collection of information.\u201d In August 1995, OIRA issued final regulations that, among other things, reflect the changes that Congress made in the act regarding how the terms \u201ccollection of information\u201d and \u201cburden\u201d are defined. For example, the preamble to the regulation notes that the 1995 act redefined burden to include the total time, effort, or financial resources expended to generate, maintain, retain, disclose, or provide information to a federal agency. However, the preamble and the regulation contain only general instructions to agencies on how they should estimate the burden associated with their information collections.", "OIRA is in the process of developing more detailed guidance for agencies and OIRA desk officers to use in implementing the PRA. Although the guidance was still in draft when we developed this report, OIRA officials said that it has been widely used by both agencies and OIRA staff since early 1997. The guidance contains a section on burden that specifically references the OIRA responsibilities in section 3504(c)(5) of the act and describes the various types of activities that the act says constitute burden. That section of the guidance also references an appendix with suggested worksheets that are designed to help an agency calculate burden-hours. The appendix describes actions agencies could take to estimate (1) burden-hours per respondent, (2) aggregate burden-hours, (3) capital and other nonlabor costs per respondent, and (4) aggregate capital and other non labor costs. Although the guidance indicates that agencies should estimate the time it takes for respondents to undertake various elements of paperwork activity (e.g., reviewing instructions, searching data sources, and completing and reviewing the collection of information to arrive at the number of burden-hours per respondent), it does not clearly indicate how agencies are to arrive at these estimates or provide examples of how different agencies have estimated the burden associated with particular information collections.", "OIRA officials and staff said that there are differences both between and within departments and agencies in how they estimate the burden associated with their information collections. For example, they said that IRS estimates the burden associated with its information collections partly on the basis of the number of lines on the forms to be completed, but other agencies calculate burden in ways unrelated to the number of lines on each form. OIRA officials said they believe it is less important that agencies measure their information collections in the same way than that the measurements are consistent over time within particular agencies. Consistency over time, they said, permits OIRA to determine whether the burden associated with specific agencies\u2019 information collections is increasing or decreasing.", "Measuring the number of burden-hours associated with individual information collections or for an agency as a whole is extremely difficult, as illustrated by agencies\u2019 reestimates of their burden-hour totals and the magnitude of those adjustments. For example, in 1989, IRS did a comprehensive reassessment of all of its existing data collections, resulting in a 3.4 billion hour increase in its burden-hour estimate.However, this change did not reflect any alteration in the actual paperwork burden felt by the public because only the measurement system used to produce this estimate was altered. A recent analysis of IRS\u2019s current burden-hour estimate methodology concluded that the agency may be overstating businesses\u2019 paperwork burden by nearly 400 percent.", "Agencies should review and, if necessary, revise their methods for estimating burden-hours. However, these large fluctuations in burden-hour estimates by IRS, an agency that constitutes 75 percent of the governmentwide total, illustrate a continuing need for clear guidance on how paperwork burden can be measured. Although a single methodology may not be feasible for all agencies or for all information collections, the PRA clearly contemplated that OIRA would play a critical role in the development of governmentwide guidance and the achievement of reliable and valid measurements of paperwork burden. Although OIRA has taken some steps in this area, it has not fully played that role."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establishment of Governmentwide and Agency-Specific Paperwork Reduction Goals", "paragraphs": ["One of the PRA\u2019s key features is the requirement in section 3505(a) of the act that OIRA, in consultation with the agency heads, set annual governmentwide goals for the reduction of information collection burdens by at least 10 percent in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 and by at least 5 percent in the succeeding 4 fiscal years. The act also requires OIRA to establish annual agency goals to (1) reduce information collection burdens imposed on the public that \u201crepresent the maximum practicable opportunity in each agency\u201d and that are consistent with improving agencies\u2019 review processes; and (2) improve IRM in ways that increase the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of federal programs.", "In our June 1996 testimony on the implementation of the PRA, we said that OIRA had not set either governmentwide or agency-specific burden-reduction goals as required by the act. OIRA officials told us at the time that they planned to set the fiscal year 1996 governmentwide burden-reduction goal when they published their information collection budget (ICB) later that year, and they said that the goal would be the 10-percent reduction for fiscal year 1996 required in the act. They also said that the agency goals would reflect the end of fiscal year 1996 burden-hour estimates that the agencies provided in their ICB submissions\u2014essentially, what the agencies expected their burden-hour totals would be by the end of the fiscal year\u2014unless changed as a result of OIRA review. We noted in our testimony that the weighted average of the agencies\u2019 burden-reduction projections for fiscal year 1996 was about 1 percent governmentwide. \u201cindividual agency goals negotiated with OIRA may differ depending on the agency\u2019s potential to reduce the paperwork burden such agency imposes on the public. Goals negotiated with some agencies may substantially exceed the Government-wide goal, while those negotiated with other agencies may be substantially less.\u201d", "In August 1996, OIRA formally set agency-specific burden-reduction goals for fiscal year 1996 by publishing the ICB in its Information Resources Management Plan of the Federal Government. The agencies estimated that in the aggregate, their burden-hour totals at the end of fiscal year 1996 (less than 2 months later) would be less than 1 percent below their totals at the end of fiscal year 1995. However, in a subsequent ICB the agencies estimated that the fiscal year 1996 reductions were about 2.6 percent\u2014still far short of the 10 percent governmentwide burden-reduction goal contemplated in the act for that year. OIRA officials told us at the time that OIRA had satisfied the PRA\u2019s requirement that it set governmentwide burden-reduction goals by repeating the act\u2019s requirements in the ICB.", "In January 1997, OMB issued Bulletin 97-03, which instructed executive departments and agencies to prepare and implement ICBs and information streamlining plans that would include \u201cgoals and timetables to achieve, by the end of  1998, a cumulative burden reduction of 25 percent from their  1995 year-end level, consistent with the governmentwide burden-reduction goals in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.\u201d OIRA officials said that they decided to set a 3-year goal instead of the year-to-year goals required in the act because many approved collections are approved for 3 years, and it would take that long for associated paperwork reductions to be implemented. Although the January 1997 bulletin indicated that each agency\u2019s burden-reduction goal should be consistent with the 25 percent governmentwide goal envisioned in the PRA by the end of fiscal year 1998, OIRA officials again told us during this review that the act does not require that the agencies\u2019 goals total to 25 percent by that date.", "In our June 1997 testimony, we noted that OIRA had not published the ICB for fiscal year 1997 and, therefore, had not formally established agencies\u2019 burden-reduction goals for that year. We also noted that all three of the regulatory agencies that we examined in that review (EPA, OSHA, and IRS) said that the statutory framework underlying their regulations and/or continued actions by Congress requiring the agencies to produce regulations were major impediments to eliminating paperwork burden. For example, IRS said that it could not reach a 25 percent burden-reduction goal of eliminating more than 1 billion burden-hours of paperwork under its current statutory framework and still carry out its mission. Of the three agencies, only OSHA indicated that it would achieve the 25 percent burden-reduction goal by the end of fiscal year 1998.", "In September 1997, OIRA set agency-specific burden-reduction goals for fiscal year 1997 by publishing the ICB in its Reports to Congress Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The agencies\u2019 aggregate burden-hour estimate for the end of fiscal year 1997 (less than 1 month later) was less than 2 percent below the total for fiscal year 1996. In combination with the reductions in the previous fiscal year, the agencies estimated that their total reductions by the end of fiscal year 1997 from the fiscal year 1995 baseline would be about 4.4 percent. Therefore, in order to meet the 25-percent reduction by the end of fiscal year 1998 that was contemplated in the PRA and indicated in OMB\u2019s January 1997 bulletin, federal agencies would have to reduce their paperwork burden by more than 20 percent during fiscal year 1998. This scenario is unlikely because, as previously noted, the agency that accounts for 75 percent of the governmentwide total (IRS) has indicated that it can reduce its burden by only about 2 percent by the end of fiscal year 1998. OIRA officials told us during this review that the ICB establishing burden-reduction goals for fiscal year 1998 will not be published until later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OIRA Pilot Projects", "paragraphs": ["Section 3505(a)(2) of the PRA requires OIRA to conduct pilot projects with selected agencies and nonfederal entities on a voluntary basis to test alternative policies, practices, regulations, and procedures to fulfill the purposes of the act, particularly with regard to minimizing the federal information collection burden.

However, they consider the three pilot projects used to satisfy UMRA\u2019s pilot project requirement to also satisfy the PRA\u2019s pilot requirement. Section 207 of UMRA requires OMB to establish pilot projects in at least two agencies to test innovative, flexible regulatory approaches that reduce reporting and compliance burdens on small governments. However, as we noted in our February 1998 UMRA report, the pilots that OIRA identified as satisfying the UMRA requirements were not started because of UMRA. In fact, at least two of the pilots appear to have been initiated as a result of recommendations from the National Performance Review in September 1993\u2014before either UMRA or the PRA were enacted.

The CIO Council that developed the report was chaired by the OMB Acting Deputy Director for Management, and the foreword to the strategic plan notes the requirement in section 3505(c)(3) of the act that OIRA develop a governmentwide IRM strategic plan. The CIO Council\u2019s strategic plan contained sections on (1) defining an interoperable federal information architecture, (2) ensuring security practices that protect government services, (3) leading the federal year 2000 conversion effort, (4) establishing sound capital planning and investment practices, (5) improving the information technology skills of the federal workforce, and (6) building relationships and outreach programs.

For example, although these reports contained a few examples of how agencies are using information technology, none of the reports clearly discussed the objectives and means by which the federal government would use all types of information resources to improve agency and program performance. Although both of the OIRA reports contained examples of how agencies had reduced information collection requirements, neither report described agencies\u2019 progress in applying IRM to improve their performance or mission accomplishment. As we noted in our testimony last October, we believe that the strategic goals agreed to by the CIO Council (and later included in its strategic plan) are the right set of issues to pursue regarding information technology management. However, we also noted that the CIO Council lacked a \u201cvisible yardstick\u201d to provide an incentive for progress in meeting information management goals and demonstrating positive impact on the agencies\u2019 bottom line performance. Also, the CIO Council\u2019s strategic plan focused primarily on information technology issues, which the PRA indicates is only one part of information resources or IRM.", "In June 1997, we reported on five regulatory agencies\u2019 efforts to focus on results and the factors that they believed assisted or impeded these efforts. Although officials from all five agencies said that they found it difficult to establish outcome-oriented program performance measures because of problems they experienced in collecting necessary data, several of the agencies had developed measures that we considered at least somewhat results oriented. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration measured progress toward its strategic goal of \u201csystem safety\u201d by collecting such information as the number of fatalities per million passenger miles and the number of accidents and runway incursions that occurred each year. IRS assessed accomplishment of its strategic objective of improving customer service by collecting information on the rate at which taxpayer issues were resolved during the first contact with IRS. Also, OSHA has collected information on the number of accidents, injuries, and deaths within 80,000 workplaces in order to better target its enforcement activities. These kinds of information and performance measures are examples of how information resources can be used to direct, assess, and, ultimately, improve agencies\u2019 performance.

They also said that the PRA requirement that OIRA review agencies\u2019 IRM activities is part of the \u201cdaily life\u201d of the agency and OMB.

Also, although OIRA officials said that they review agencies\u2019 IRM activities through a variety of vehicles, it is not clear how all of the vehicles that they mentioned relate to the two agency IRM requirements that we examined in section 3506(b). For example, OIRA\u2019s participation in the selection of agencies\u2019 CIOs and its review of agencies\u2019 information system investments in the budget process do not constitute a review of agencies\u2019 IRM strategic plans or the agencies\u2019 goals for improving IRM\u2019s contribution to program productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. Also, OIRA does not require agencies\u2019 individual information collection requests to present the agencies\u2019 IRM strategic plans or IRM goals. Therefore, unless the agencies include that information on their own in the supplementary information, OIRA\u2019s reviews of agencies\u2019 information collection requests cannot satisfy its responsibilities to review agencies\u2019 IRM activities.

Although the ICBs in these reports presented the changes in burden-hour estimates from year to year, neither of the reports clearly stated that the governmentwide burden-reduction goals contemplated in the act were unlikely to be met. Neither did those reports indicate that OIRA believes that the sum of the individual reduction goals that is the maximum practicable for each agency need not equal the governmentwide goal.

Similarly, the other reports and actions that OIRA mentioned contained discussions of other PRA-related activities. However, other elements that the PRA requires in those reports were missing. For example, the reports did not list the authority for each information collection whose burden increased.

OMB\u2019s January 1997 bulletin said that agencies should prepare and implement ICBs and streamlining plans that would achieve a 25-percent reduction by the end of fiscal year 1998. However, the agencies\u2019 goals are actually established in the ICBs. OIRA\u2019s practice of establishing agency-specific burden-reduction goals in those ICBs at the level that it and the agencies expect the agencies\u2019 paperwork burden will be by the end of the fiscal year will not motivate the agencies to reduce their information collection requirements. A goal should represent a desired condition, not simply the condition that the participating parties expect will occur. Also, OIRA\u2019s pattern in the past 2 years of publishing agency goals for the fiscal year within the last 2 months of the fiscal year makes the goals of limited value in the management of the agencies\u2019 paperwork reduction efforts. This year, OIRA will again not publish agency-specific goals until late in the fiscal year. Finally, although OMB\u2019s January 1997 bulletin said that each agency\u2019s burden-reduction goal should be consistent with the governmentwide, 25 percent burden-reduction goal envisioned in the PRA, OIRA officials told us during this review that the agency and governmentwide goals are not necessarily linked. This position is illogical and appears inconsistent with the PRA\u2019s legislative history.", "OIRA also has not fully satisfied either of the IRM-related responsibilities that we examined\u2014developing a governmentwide IRM plan and periodically reviewing selected agency IRM activities. Although OIRA\u2019s August 1996 and September 1997 reports on the PRA and the CIO Council\u2019s strategic plan contain some of the elements that the PRA requires in an IRM strategic plan, none of these documents describe, in a clear and comprehensive manner, (1) the objectives and means by which the federal government should use information resources to improve agency and program performance or (2) agencies\u2019 progress in applying IRM to improve their performance\u2014two of the three basic elements that the act says an IRM strategic plan should have. Also, although OIRA desk officers and officials mentioned a number of actions that they had taken to review agencies\u2019 IRM activities, none of those actions appeared to focus on the two specific IRM responsibilities that the PRA explicitly assigns to the agencies\u2014the development of an IRM strategic plan and the development of a process to establish goals for improving IRM\u2019s contribution to productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness.", "Finally, as we have previously testified, OIRA has not kept Congress and congressional committees fully and currently informed about certain major activities under the PRA. The establishment of burden-reduction goals was one of the key elements in the 1995 PRA, and OIRA has included information in its annual reports to Congress about the status of agencies\u2019 burden-reduction efforts. However, OIRA has never directly informed Congress in its reports or elsewhere that the goals envisioned in the PRA are unlikely to be met, or that the agencies believe that the goals cannot be met given current statutory requirements. Neither has OIRA informed Congress that it believes that the total of the agency-specific goals do not have to equal the governmentwide goals. We believe that these are major activities under the act about which OIRA should have kept Congress and congressional committees fully and currently informed. Had OIRA informed Congress that the goals in the PRA were unlikely to be met given agencies\u2019 statutory obligations, Congress could have used that information to determine whether it wanted to change the goals or to change the statutory requirements to allow the agencies to meet the PRA\u2019s goals. Also, OIRA has not informed Congress that it has not developed an IRM strategic plan, or even that it believes its August 1996 and September 1997 reports to Congress and the CIO Council\u2019s report represent a strategic plan. Finally, OIRA\u2019s reports to Congress have not included several of the specific elements that the PRA requires OIRA to include in those reports.", "OIRA\u2019s lack of action in some of these areas may be a function of its resource and staffing limitations. The office has less than two dozen staff who review between 3,000 and 5,000 PRA information collection requests each year, analyze the substance of about 500 significant rules each year under Executive Order 12866, and perform other duties pursuant to other statutes and executive orders. As a result, it may be difficult for OIRA officials and staff to carry out all of the specific tasks that the PRA requires it to take or to adopt a strategic view of information collection and information management. However, as we said in our 1983 report on the PRA, if resource limitations are the problem, OMB officials need to notify Congress of those limits in its budget submission. It has not done so.", "Through its oversight role, Congress can help ensure that OIRA carries out its statutory obligations under the PRA and plays the leadership role that the drafters of the PRA believed would be critical to the act\u2019s success. Congress can exercise that oversight in any number of ways, including congressional hearings that focus directly on how well OIRA has carried out its responsibilities under the act. Another alternative is through the appointment and confirmation process in which the Senate has an opportunity to explore what prospective OMB and OIRA nominees plan to do to ensure stronger leadership and better compliance with the PRA\u2019s requirements.", "Congress could also use its review of the annual performance plans and reports that OMB is required to submit under the Results Act as a means of overseeing how OIRA is carrying out its PRA responsibilities.

OMB\u2019s performance plan would have to identify goals that relate to OIRA\u2019s PRA responsibilities, identify the specific strategies and resources that it will use to achieve these performance goals, and develop measures that would inform Congress and the public about how well OMB is achieving these goals. Those performance goals would be specifically linked to program activities in OMB\u2019s budget requests.

In that summary, the Acting Administrator said that because the report discusses only a few of OIRA\u2019s responsibilities under the PRA, it does not accurately or fully portray the complexity and scope of these responsibilities. He also said that because the report does not include other responsibilities on which OIRA has taken action under the PRA, it does not accurately represent the extent to which OIRA has fulfilled most of these responsibilities. As a result, he said the report does not provide a complete, balanced, or accurate picture of how OIRA is carrying out its PRA responsibilities.", "For example, the Acting Administrator said the report suggests that OIRA has never directly informed Congress that the burden-reduction goals stated in the PRA are unlikely to be met, or that the agencies believe that the goals cannot be met given current statutory requirements. However, he noted that OMB has, for each year since the 1980 PRA, published an Information Collection Budget that sets forth the previous year\u2019s baseline, the current year\u2019s accomplishment, and the future year\u2019s targeted goal for paperwork burdens. Moreover, he said OIRA has, for the past 3 years, informed Congress through formal and informal contacts that the general paperwork burden-reduction goals are unlikely to be met and that they could not be met given current statutory requirements.", "In addition, the Acting Administrator said the report suggests that agencies will not be motivated to meet the statutory governmentwide 10 and 5 percent annual burden-reduction goals because OIRA sets the agency-specific burden-reduction goals in the annual Information Collection Budget at the level that OMB and the agencies\u2019 expect the agencies\u2019 paperwork burden to be by the end of the upcoming fiscal year. He said that this conclusion does not take into account the fact that the PRA itself establishes the procedure under which OMB and the agencies establish their annual paperwork burden-reduction goals. Specifically, he said, the PRA directs OMB, in consultation with each agency, to set an annual agency goal to reduce information collection burdens that \u201crepresent the maximum practicable opportunity in each agency\u201d that is \u201cconsistent with improving agency management of the process for review of collections of information\u201d established by the agency\u2019s Chief Information Officer. He said this means that each year each agency is to seek to attain the \u201cmaximum practicable\u201d paperwork burden reduction consistent with the agency\u2019s statutory and program missions and the information management strategy of the Chief Information Officer. The aggregate of each agency\u2019s annual goals that is the \u201cmaximum practicable\u201d in light of each agency\u2019s programmatic and statutory responsibilities may not, and as a general matter has not, totaled to the governmentwide goal.", "The Acting Administrator also said this conclusion does not take into account the fact that agency information collections are largely driven by the need to carry out program and statutory missions. If an information collection that an agency submits for OMB review meets the practical utility, burden, and other PRA criteria for approval, he said that OMB does not have authority to disapprove it just because the approval would cause the agency to exceed the agency\u2019s paperwork burden reduction goal stated in the Information Collection Budget.", "The Acting Administrator said another example involves OMB\u2019s implementation of its IRM responsibilities. Under the 1980 and 1995 PRAs, IRM is the broad umbrella under which all of OMB\u2019s PRA responsibilities are carried out. However, he said that the report\u2019s conclusions appear to be based on a narrow reading of a particular section of the PRA, rather than on a broad reading of the PRA itself.", "He also said that OMB\u2019s annual performance plans and reports already discuss OIRA\u2019s PRA responsibilities and describe the targets by which OIRA\u2019s attainment of those responsibilities will be met, and he said that OIRA has the resources adequate to meet its many responsibilities. Finally, he suggested a number of technical and clarifying changes in the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Evaluation of Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In relation to the Acting Administrator\u2019s first point regarding the scope of our review, we clearly stated in several places in the draft report, including the title, that the report discusses only selected OIRA responsibilities under the PRA. The \u201cObjectives, Scope, and Methodology\u201d section of the report says \u201ce focused our review solely on OIRA\u2019s implementation of the specific responsibilities delineated in the objectives. We did not examine the implementation of OIRA\u2019s other PRA responsibilities, including its responsibilities in the areas of federal information technology, records management, and statistical policies.\u201d The first sentence of the \u201cConclusions\u201d section states that \u201chis report examines some, but not all, of OIRA\u2019s specific responsibilities under the 1995 PRA.\u201d Also, in the \u201cBackground\u201d section we noted that OIRA has many other statutory and executive order responsibilities related to regulatory management, and we specifically delineated OIRA\u2019s responsibilities under UMRA, SBREFA, and other statutes. Therefore, we believe that the report makes clear its scope limitations, and it also provides the context needed to understand the complexity and breadth of the PRA responsibilities on which we focused.", "We have issued other reports and testimonies related to OIRA\u2019s PRA responsibilities that were outside of the scope of this report and that criticized OIRA\u2019s performance in those areas. Therefore, even if this report had been expanded to address these other responsibilities, there is no assurance that the report would have, as the Acting Administrator suggests, reached a different conclusion regarding the extent to which OIRA had fulfilled those responsibilities. For example, in September 1996 we reported that although OMB had taken some steps to improve information security, its oversight efforts were uneven and OMB \u201cgenerally did not proactively attempt to identify and promote resolution of fundamental security program weaknesses that are likely to be at the root of these problems.\u201d We have also previously reported concerns about OMB\u2019s capacity to coordinate the budgets and statistical activities of the agencies in the federal statistical system.", "Furthermore, we believe that the PRA responsibilities on which we focused (e.g., establishment of burden-reduction goals and development of IRM strategic plans) are central to the successful implementation of the act. Within those areas, we believe that the report presents a complete, balanced, and accurate picture of OIRA\u2019s actions and, in several cases, its lack of action.", "The Acting Administrator indicated that OMB\u2019s Information Collection Budgets have kept Congress and congressional committees informed regarding progress toward the burden reduction goals in the PRA, and he said that OIRA has informed Congress through \u201cformal and informal contacts\u201d that the goals are unlikely to be met because of current statutory requirements. We called the Acting Administrator to determine what \u201cformal and informal contacts\u201d he was referring to in his comments, and he said that OIRA officials had told both majority and minority congressional staff that the PRA\u2019s burden-reduction goals were unlikely to be met. However, he said that OIRA had never communicated that conclusion to Congress or congressional committees in any testimonies, letters, or other written documents. Also, although the ICBs in OIRA\u2019s annual reports contain information on governmentwide progress toward the burden-reduction goals envisioned in the PRA, those documents do not clearly state that the goals are unlikely to be met or that existing statutory requirements are the reason.", "The Acting Administrator indicated that the PRA requires OIRA to set agency burden-reduction goals at the levels that the agencies believed represented their \u201cmaximum practicable opportunity,\u201d and that these goals may not total to the governmentwide goal. We continue to believe that Congress, when it enacted the PRA, envisioned a relationship between the governmentwide goals and the agency specific goals. If OIRA believes that agencies\u2019 statutory and program missions make achievement of these interrelated goals unattainable, or that the PRA\u2019s requirements regarding governmentwide and agency specific goals are inconsistent, OIRA should notify Congress of its conclusions. To date, OIRA has not done so. We also continue to believe that agencies will not be motivated to improve their performance in reducing paperwork burden by OIRA\u2019s practice of setting agency-specific goals after 10 months of the fiscal year have passed at a level that the agencies expect to reach within the next 2 months.", "The Acting Administrator\u2019s statement regarding OMB\u2019s inability to disapprove an agency\u2019s proposed information collection simply because it may cause the agency to exceed its burden-reduction goal does not address our intended point. The PRA requires OIRA to set both governmentwide and agency specific burden-reduction goals. The establishment of those goals does not, in any way, inhibit OIRA\u2019s ability to review and, if necessary, disapprove an agency\u2019s proposed collection of information. Similarly, OIRA\u2019s reviews of agencies proposed information collections does not inhibit its ability to establish burden-reduction goals. The act does not require agencies to meet the burden-reduction goals, only that OIRA and the agencies establish them.", "In another portion of his response, the Acting Administrator said that \u201cnder the 1980 and 1995 PRAs, IRM is the broad umbrella under which all of OMB\u2019s PRA responsibilities are carried out.\u201d We agree that the 1995 PRA (but not the 1980 act) envisions IRM as a central focus of OIRA\u2019s (and the agencies\u2019) responsibilities under the act. Conceptually, all of OIRA\u2019s responsibilities under the act can be viewed as IRM-related. However, we believe that the requirements that OIRA (1) develop and maintain a governmentwide IRM strategic plan; and (2) oversee, among other things, agencies\u2019 development of their own IRM strategic plans are central elements of OIRA\u2019s IRM responsibilities under the PRA. The act states that both the governmentwide and agency-specific IRM plans are supposed to describe how information resources help accomplish agencies\u2019 missions. It is only within the context of these mission-related plans that the relevance and accomplishment of OIRA\u2019s other conceptually-related IRM responsibilities can be assessed. Therefore, we focused on OIRA\u2019s actions regarding these plans in this portion of our review. The Acting Administrator did not, in his response, dispute our conclusion that OIRA had not satisfied all of its responsibilities in this area.", "The Acting Administrator also said that OMB\u2019s annual performance plans and reports under the Results Act already discuss OIRA\u2019s PRA responsibilities and describe the targets by which OIRA\u2019s attainment of those responsibilities will be met. As we point out in the report, OMB\u2019s February 1998 performance plan under the Results Act does not identify the specific strategies and resources that it will use to achieve the performance goal to \u201cwork with agencies to reduce paperwork burdens.\u201d Also, the plan does not provide performance measures that would allow Congress and the public to determine how well OMB is achieving these goals. Finally, OMB\u2019s program performance reports under the Results Act are not due until March 31, 2000. Therefore, we did not change our recommendation.", "Finally, we accepted some, but not all, of the Acting Administrator\u2019s technical and clarifying changes to the draft report. For example, at his suggestion, we noted that the Clinger-Cohen Act amended parts of the PRA. We also clarified the scope of some of the headings in the report.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publically announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies to the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs\u2019 Subcommittee on Oversight, Restructuring and the District of Columbia; other interested committees; and the Director of OMB.
