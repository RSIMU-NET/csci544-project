In related reports, GAO has recommended corrective action to address those weaknesses. Each year, as part of the annual audit of IRS's financial statements, GAO not only makes recommendations to address any new weaknesses identified but also follows up on the status of weaknesses GAO identified in previous years' audits.

This progress has been the result of hard work and commitment at the top levels of the agency. However, IRS still faces financial management challenges. At the beginning of GAO's audit of IRS's fiscal year 2005 financial statements, 84 financial management-related recommendations from prior audits remained open because IRS had not fully addressed the issues that gave rise to them. During the fiscal year 2005 financial audit, IRS took actions that enabled GAO to close 34 of those recommendations. At the same time, GAO identified additional internal control deficiencies resulting in 22 new recommendations. In total, 72 recommendations currently remain open. To assist IRS in evaluating its internal controls and in making improvements, GAO categorized the 72 open recommendations by various internal control activities which, in turn, were grouped into three broad control activity groupings. The continued existence of internal control weaknesses that gave rise to these recommendations represents a serious obstacle that IRS needs to overcome. Effective implementation of GAO's recommendations can greatly assist IRS in improving its internal controls and achieving sound financial management. IRS stated that it is taking action to address the recommendations included in the report. GAO will review the effectiveness of these corrective actions and the status of IRS's progress as part of the fiscal year 2006 audit."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In its role as the nation\u2019s tax collector, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  In its role as the nation\u2019s tax collector, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  has a demanding responsibility to collect taxes, process tax returns, and  has a demanding responsibility to collect taxes, process tax returns, and  enforce the nation\u2019s tax laws.

We have grouped together the four  control activities in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government that relate to safeguarding of assets (including tax receipts)  and security activities (such as limiting access to only authorized  personnel): (1) physical control over vulnerable assets, (2) segregation of  duties, (3) controls over information processing, and (4) access  restrictions to and accountability for resources and records.", "An agency must establish physical control to secure and safeguard vulnerable assets.

IRS collects taxes  both at its own facilities as well as at lockbox banks that operate under  contract with the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Management Service  (FMS) to provide processing services for certain taxpayer receipts for IRS.  IRS acts as custodian for (1) the tax payments it receives until they are  deposited in the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury and (2) the tax returns  and related information it receives until they are either sent to the Federal  Records Center or destroyed. IRS is also charged with controlling many  other assets, such as computers and other equipment, but IRS\u2019s legal  responsibility to safeguard tax returns and the confidential information  taxpayers provide in tax returns makes the effectiveness of its internal  controls with respect to physical security essential.", "IRS receives cash and checks mailed to its service centers or lockbox  banks with accompanying tax returns and information or payment  vouchers and payments made in person at one of its offices. While  adequate physical safeguards over receipts should exist throughout the  year, it is especially important during the peak tax filing season. Each year  during the weeks preceding and shortly after April 15, an IRS service  center campus (SCC) may receive and process daily over 100,000 pieces of  mail containing returns, receipts, or both.

Consequently, it is critical that IRS maintain  appropriate separation of duties to allow for adequate oversight of staff  and protection of these vulnerable resources so that no single individual  would be in a position of both causing an error or irregularity and then  concealing it. For example, when an IRS field office or lockbox bank  receives taxpayer receipts and returns, it is responsible for depositing the  cash and checks in a depository institution and forwarding the related  information received to an SCC for further processing. In order to  adequately safeguard receipts from theft, the person responsible for  recording the information from the taxpayer receipts on a voucher should  be different from the individual who prepares those receipts for  transmittal to the SCC for further processing.", "The following three open recommendations would help IRS improve its  separation of duties, which will in turn strengthen its controls over both  tax receipts and refunds.
