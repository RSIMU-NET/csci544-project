In addition, FDIC stated it has initiated and completed some actions to mitigate the remaining five prior weaknesses. However, we have not verified that these actions have been completed. Although FDIC has made significant progress improving its information system controls, old and new weaknesses could limit the corporation's ability to effectively protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its financial systems and information. In addition to the five previously reported weaknesses that remain unresolved, newly identified weaknesses in access controls and configuration management controls introduce risk to two key financial systems. For example, FDIC did not always implement adequate access controls. Specifically, multiple FDIC users shared the same login ID and password, had unrestricted access to application source code, and used passwords that were not adequately encrypted. In addition, FDIC did not adequately (1) maintain a full and complete baseline for system requirements; (2) assign unique identifiers to configuration items; (3) authorize, document, and report all configuration changes; and (4) perform configuration audits. Although these weaknesses do not pose significant risk of misstatement of the corporation's financial statements, they do increase preventable risk to the corporation's financial systems and information. A key reason for these weaknesses is that FDIC did not always fully implement key information security program activities. For example, it did not adequately conduct configuration control testing or complete the remedial action plan in a timely manner and did not include necessary and key information. Until FDIC fully performs key information security program activities, its ability to maintain adequate control over its financial systems and information will be limited."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has a demanding  responsibility enforcing banking laws, regulating banking institutions, and  protecting depositors.

We  believe that the issues we presented in the report are accurately presented  and can increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or  destruction of the corporation\u2019s financial information and that  management decisions may be based on unreliable or inaccurate  information.", "Regarding the nine recommendations to which FDIC partially concurred,  the Deputy stated that the corporation has developed or implemented  plans to adequately address the underlying risks that prompted these nine  recommendations, and in some instances, pursued alternative corrective  actions. If the corporation effectively implements the alternative  corrective actions to reduce risk, it will satisfy the intent of the  recommendations.

An integral part of our objectives  was to support the opinion on internal control in GAO\u2019s 2007 financial  statement audit by assessing the controls over systems that support  financial management and the generation of the FDIC funds\u2019 financial  statements.", "To determine the status of FDIC\u2019s actions to correct or mitigate previously  reported information security weaknesses, we identified and reviewed its  information security policies, procedures, and guidance. We reviewed  prior GAO reports to identify previously reported weaknesses and  examined FDIC\u2019s corrective action plans to determine which weaknesses  FDIC had reported were corrected. For those instances where FDIC  reported it had completed corrective actions, we assessed the  effectiveness of those actions.", "To determine whether controls over key financial systems were effective,  we tested the effectiveness of information security and information  technology-based internal controls. We concentrated our evaluation  primarily on the controls for financial applications, enterprise database  applications, and network infrastructure associated with the New  Financial Environment (NFE) release 1.43 and the Assessment  Information Management System II (AIMS II) release 10.0 applications.", "Our evaluation was based on our Federal Information System Controls  Audit Manual, which contains guidance for reviewing information system  controls that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of  computerized information.", "Using NIST standards and guidance, and FDIC\u2019s policies, procedures,  practices, and standards, we evaluated controls by    observing methods for providing secure data transmissions across the  network to determine whether sensitive data was being encrypted;  testing and observing physical access controls to determine if computer  facilities and resources were being protected from espionage, sabotage,  damage, and theft;    evaluated the control configurations of selected servers and database  inspecting key servers and workstations to determine whether critical  patches had been installed or were up-to-date;    examining access responsibilities to determine whether incompatible  functions were segregated among different individuals; and,    observing end-user activity pertaining to the process of preparing FDIC  financial statements.", "Using the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA), which establishes key elements for an effective agencywide  information security program, we evaluated FDIC\u2019s implementation of its  security program by  reviewing FDIC\u2019s risk assessment process and risk assessments for two  key FDIC systems that support the preparation of financial statements to  determine whether risks and threats were documented consistent with  federal guidance;    analyzing FDIC\u2019s policies, procedures, practices, and standards to  determine their effectiveness in providing guidance to personnel  responsible for securing information and information systems;    analyzing security plans to determine if management, operational, and  technical controls were in place or planned and that security plans were  updated;    examining training records for personnel with significant security  responsibilities to determine if they received training commensurate with  those responsibilities;    analyzing configuration management plans and procedures to determine if  configurations are being managed appropriately;    analyzing security testing and evaluation results for two key FDIC systems  to determine whether management, operational, and technical controls  were tested at least annually and based on risk;    examining remedial action plans to determine whether they addressed  vulnerabilities identified in the FDIC\u2019s security testing and evaluations;  and    examining contingency plans for two key FDIC systems to determine  whether those plans had been tested or updated.", "We also discussed with key security representatives and management  officials, whether information security controls were in place, adequately  designed, and operating effectively. We conducted this audit work from  October 2007 to May 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

FDIC did not adequately control physical access to the Virginia Square computer  processing facility.   5. FDIC did not apply physical security controls for some instances.
