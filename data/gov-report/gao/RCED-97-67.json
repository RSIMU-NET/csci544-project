In 1988, the Fair Housing Initiatives Program was established to assist all parties in fighting housing discrimination. These included private nonprofit organizations such as civil rights organizations and local fair housing groups; public entities such as colleges and universities; and certain state and local fair housing agencies. The program funds activities designed to enforce fair housing laws and to inform the public about their rights and obligations under such laws.

The act allowed the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to investigate and conciliate complaints of housing discrimination and authorized the Department of Justice to file suits in cases of a pattern or practice of discrimination or in cases of public importance. HUD was not given any authority to administratively remedy acts of discrimination against an individual, however.", "The Fair Housing Act also required HUD to refer housing discrimination complaints to state and local agencies where the state or local law provided rights and remedies substantially equivalent to those provided by the federal law. In 1980, HUD established the Fair Housing Assistance Program to provide financial assistance to state and local agencies to encourage them to assume a greater share of the enforcement of their fair housing laws.", "The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP), administered by HUD, is designed to provide a coordinated and comprehensive approach to fair housing activities in order to strengthen enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. During the 1986 Senate hearings on its proposal to establish the FHIP, HUD testified that enforcement activity, particularly testing, by private nonprofit and other private entities would be the principal focus and motivation of the program. In February 1988, the program was created as a 2-year demonstration program by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987.", "About 7 months later, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 was signed into law, and it became effective in March 1989. The 1988 act attempted to remedy the enforcement shortcomings of the original legislation. It significantly strengthened federal fair housing enforcement by, among other things, establishing an administrative enforcement mechanism, allowing HUD to pursue cases filed by an individual before an administrative law judge for disposition and providing for civil penalties.", "In November 1990, FHIP was extended for 2 additional years, and with the enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, it became a permanent program, effective fiscal year 1993. The 1992 act also expanded the program to reflect significant legislative changes in fair housing and lending that had taken place after the program\u2019s creation in 1988. It authorized FHIP to implement testing programs whenever there was a reasonable basis for doing so; establish new fair housing organizations or expand the capacity of existing ones; conduct special projects to, for example, respond to new or sophisticated forms of housing discrimination; undertake larger, long-term enforcement activities through multiyear funding agreements; and pay for litigation. For fiscal years 1989 through 1997, the Congress appropriated $113 million for FHIP. The permanent program grew from an appropriation of $10.6 million in fiscal year 1993 to $26 million in fiscal year 1995 (see fig. 1).", "Funds for the program are distributed on the basis of competitive grants through four program initiatives. These initiatives or funding categories generally define who is eligible to receive funds and/or the focus of activities to be funded. The initiatives are (1) the private enforcement initiative\u2014funding for private nonprofit organizations to undertake testing and other enforcement-related activities; (2) the fair housing organizations initiative\u2014funding for private nonprofit organizations to create new fair housing enforcement organizations in those areas of the country that were unserved or underserved by such organizations or expand the capacity of existing private nonprofit fair housing organizations; (3) the education and outreach initiative\u2014funding for private and public entities to educate the general public and housing industry groups about fair housing rights and responsibilities; and (4) the administrative enforcement initiative\u2014funding for state and local government agencies that administer fair housing laws certified by HUD as substantially equivalent to federal law to help such agencies broaden their range of enforcement and compliance activities.

Eligible activities include education and outreach programs, testing based on complaints and other reasonable bases, the recruitment of testers and attorneys, special projects to respond to new or sophisticated forms of discrimination, litigation expenses, and the creation of new fair housing organizations in areas of the country underserved by fair housing enforcement organizations. The program is restricted from funding two types of activities: (1) settlements, judgments, or court orders in any litigation action involving HUD or HUD-funded housing providers and (2) expenses associated with litigation against the federal government.

In addition to FHIP, this office is responsible for the oversight of the Fair Housing Assistance Program, investigation and processing of fair housing complaints, and referral of complaints to Justice when appropriate. FHIP links and extends fair housing enforcement and education and outreach activities to many state and local governments and communities across the country. The program makes it possible for HUD to look comprehensively at fair housing problems and to work with the whole spectrum of agencies that are involved in fighting housing discrimination. Taken together, FHIP and the Fair Housing Assistance Program, form a national fair housing strategy through greater cooperation between the private and public sectors. In fiscal year 1996, FHIP accounted for about 22 percent of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity\u2019s $76.3 million budget (see fig. 2)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD Uses Discretion in Allocating FHIP Funds, and Allocations Are Generally as Proposed in Budgets to the Congress", "paragraphs": ["HUD uses discretion in deciding how FHIP funds are allocated among the four program initiatives.

HUD\u2019s allocations for FHIP have consistently reflected that enforcement activities are the principal focus of the program. In annual budget justifications to the Congress, HUD discusses its emphasis for the year and indicates how much of FHIP\u2019s total budget request it plans to allocate to each FHIP initiative. Table II.1 in appendix II shows by fiscal year the dollar amounts HUD anticipated it would allocate to each initiative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dollar Amounts Made Available for Each Initiative", "paragraphs": ["The Congress has appropriated amounts equal to or greater than the amounts HUD requested each fiscal year until 1996. In accordance with its budget plans, HUD has made the largest portion of FHIP dollars available for the private enforcement initiative. In 2 fiscal years (1993 and 1994) in which HUD received appropriated amounts higher than its budget requests, the additional dollars available resulted in the private enforcement initiative\u2019s receiving significantly more money than initially planned. Overall, HUD made about 48 percent of FHIP funds available for the private enforcement initiative (see table II.2).", "The relationship between HUD\u2019s proposed allocations for each initiative and the funds made available indicates that the dollar amounts were basically the same in 4 of the 8 years (fiscal years 1989 through 1991 and 1995). For the remaining years, allocations varied considerably from HUD\u2019s initial budget plans primarily because appropriated amounts for FHIP overall were either higher or lower than the budget requests. The variations were as follows: In fiscal year 1992, the amount appropriated for FHIP was the same as the budget request. The private enforcement initiative\u2019s allocation was $1.3 million less than HUD initially anticipated; the administrative enforcement initiative\u2019s was $0.9 million more, and the education and outreach initiative\u2019s was $0.4 million more. In fiscal year 1993, FHIP\u2019s appropriation was $3 million higher than the budget request. The private enforcement initiative\u2019s allocation was $1 million more; the education and outreach initiative\u2019s, $0.5 million more. The fair housing organizations initiative, which was authorized in late 1992, received a $2.6 million allocation. The administrative enforcement initiative\u2019s allocation was $1.1 million less than anticipated, however. In fiscal year 1994, FHIP\u2019s appropriation was $3.6 million higher than the budget request. Of this, HUD allocated $3 million to the private enforcement initiative and $0.6 million to the fair housing organizations initiative.", "In fiscal year 1996, FHIP\u2019s appropriation was 43 percent lower than the budget request. While the budget request included funds for all initiatives, owing to the reduced appropriation, HUD did not allocate any funds to the administrative enforcement initiative.

For the 3 most recent years (fiscal years 1994 through 1996), the greatest demand, as measured by the amounts requested on applications, has been for the private enforcement initiative.", "In fiscal year 1996, the number of applications for grants decreased from 300 in each of the 3 previous fiscal years to 91. The most significant decrease was for education and outreach grants, dropping to 19 applications from over 200 the prior year (see table II.3). HUD told us that the significant drop in education and outreach applications is primarily attributable to language in the 1996 appropriations law requiring applicants to meet the definition of a qualified fair housing enforcement organization in order to be eligible for FHIP funds. According to FHIP legislation, a qualified fair housing enforcement organization is a private nonprofit organization that has at least 2 years of experience in complaint intake, complaint investigations, testing, and enforcement of legal claims. HUD told us that the legislative requirement precluded many previously eligible organizations from applying for an education and outreach initiative grant. Also, according to HUD, a one-third reduction in FHIP\u2019s appropriation for that fiscal year discouraged many organizations from applying for FHIP funding.", "On the basis of the dollar value of grant applications submitted to HUD, the greatest demand has been for private enforcement initiative grants. Our analysis of the dollar amount of applications is based on fiscal years 1994 through 1996 for which complete information is readily available (see table II.4).

Information obtained from FHIP-funded projects can be used by either public or private nonprofit organizations, or HUD, as the basis for a formal complaint against individuals or lending institutions.

We are also providing background information, as you requested, on the history of FHIP and activities that can be funded under the program.", "To obtain information on FHIP, its funding, and eligible activities, we reviewed the program\u2019s legislative history, regulations, policies, procedures, and Federal Register notices that solicited applications from eligible fair housing agencies and organizations. We also reviewed HUD\u2019s annual reports to the Congress on fair housing programs for 1993 and 1994 and obtained descriptions and budgets for other HUD-administered fair housing activities. We interviewed the Director, Office of Fair Housing Initiatives and Voluntary Programs (who also is the Acting FHIP Division Director); FHIP\u2019s government technical representatives; the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Enforcement and Investigations; and the Director, Office of Investigations, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.", "We also interviewed FHIP officials at the HUD\u2019s Southwest and Midwest Regions in Fort Worth, Texas and Chicago, Illinois, respectively, as well as officials of six organizations that received FHIP grants. In addition, we held discussions with the National Association of Realtors and the Mortgage Bankers Association and attended the 1996 New England and Mid-Atlantic Fair Housing Conference.", "To determine how HUD allocates funds among the four program initiatives, we reviewed and analyzed FHIP congressional budget justifications for fiscal years 1989 to 1997. We also reviewed memorandums and correspondence regarding funding allocations and HUD\u2019s priorities for FHIP since its inception. To determine the amounts available for award, we reviewed FHIP\u2019s notices of funding availability as published in the Federal Register for fiscal years 1989 through 1996.", "To determine the demand for funds, we reviewed and analyzed the available selection results, including technical evaluation panels\u2019 reports, which contained lists of grant applicants and the panels\u2019 recommendations to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. We reviewed technical evaluation reports to compile data on the number of applications by fiscal year and by program initiative. We also analyzed the dollar value of applications for those years for which complete information was readily available\u2014fiscal years 1994 to 1996. Additionally, we reviewed program guidance on the selection process and interviewed HUD government technical representatives involved in the selection process.", "To identify the recipients of FHIP funds and the amount of dollars received, we obtained a copy of the FHIP funding and contract tracking system\u2019s database, which contained 486 grant listings as of October 1996. Many grant numbers were not accompanied by the grantee organizations\u2019 names and locations. To develop a more complete list, we compared the listed grant numbers to other HUD-provided reports and added names and locations to the database where possible. We used this database as a control for our review of the FHIP grant files. During our review of the files, we filled in the missing names and locations and verified all other grantees\u2019 names and locations, as well as the grant amounts and year of appropriation.", "To determine how FHIP dollars are being used, we developed a data collection instrument to record data from grant files on the activities organizations agreed to carry out under the program. In developing the instrument, we interviewed program officials, reviewed FHIP legislation and regulations, notices of funding availability, and a sample of FHIP grant files. HUD program officials reviewed and commented on the data collection instrument, and we incorporated their suggested changes. For grants awarded through fiscal year 1996, we reviewed the available grant files (483) and recorded on the data collection instrument the activities each grantee agreed to carry out. We used the information to develop a database from which we analyzed the number and dollar value of the grants awarded to organizations and the kinds of activities funded under each FHIP initiative. We also reviewed the available final performance assessments (206) to determine whether grantees completed work as agreed and how HUD rated their overall performance. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the final performance assessments. In addition, we interviewed HUD Inspector General officials in each HUD region regarding their reviews of FHIP grantees.", "To determine whether any grantees have used FHIP funds to pay expenses associated with litigation against the U.S. government, we interviewed officials in HUD\u2019s Office of General Counsel, namely, the Assistant General Counsel, Fair Housing Enforcement Division, and Managing Attorney, Litigation Division. At our request, HUD\u2019s General Counsel contacted agency attorneys in each region to determine whether they had knowledge of any lawsuits filed by FHIP grantees against the government. We interviewed the Acting FHIP Division Director, responsible government technical representatives, and government technical monitors about their knowledge of the cases identified. We also reviewed correspondence from grantees concerning whether FHIP funds were used to pursue litigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division", "paragraphs": ["Patricia D.
