As a result, grantees may be diverting resources from program objectives to comply with varying administrative requirements. Congress, attempting to reduce this inefficiency, passed the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, commonly referred to as P.L. 106-107. It required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure that agencies streamline processes, develop common systems, and consult with grantees; it also required GAO to evaluate the law's effectiveness. In response, this report discusses aspects of grant administration that grantees identified as inadequate to meet the act's goals and on which further action was needed. GAO reviewed grantee comments on changes needed, obtained views from grantee associations and users of the Web portal called Grants.gov, performed detailed site visits at selected grantees, and obtained views of OMB."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While some progress has been made since GAO issued its report last year on interagency reform initiatives (GAO-05-355), federal grantees continue to identify areas where the goals of P.L. 106-107 have not yet been met. These include continued lack of standardization and continued inefficiencies in grant administration across agencies and technological difficulties with implementing Grants.gov, the Web site where grantees can find and apply for grants. Grantees report they continue to need to use different application, reporting, and payment systems, and definitions differ across agencies. Further, some inefficiencies continue to exist, such as agency grant processes not aligning with typical grantee business practices. In addition, problems using Grants.gov, such as search engine problems and complex registration practices, have caused grantees frustration as they have used the site for identifying and applying for grant opportunities. The Grants.gov Program Management Office has taken actions to address some of these problems and has plans for further improvements. Grantees GAO interviewed were concerned that, while the three federal cross-agency initiatives underway to streamline grant administration--Grants.gov, the Grants Management Line of Business, and the cross-agency workgroups--were moving forward, progress to date has been inadequate. Grantees identified two specific areas where the management of P.L. 106-107 initiatives contributed to the lack of progress. They pointed out that inadequate ongoing communication with grantees before decisions on changes were made resulted in poor implementation and prioritization of initiatives. Grantees also said lack of clear objectives and a public time line for the reform process sometimes prevented them from understanding the scope and timing of planned changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About one-fifth of the federal budget\u2014over $460 billion\u2014was distributed  in fiscal year 2004 in grants to various entities, such as state, local, and  tribal governments, nonprofit organizations, and colleges and universities.  Grantees, particularly those that obtain grants from multiple federal  agencies, must comply with the different requirements and systems that  agencies have established, which can result in directing excessive  resources to meeting varying administrative requirements rather than  toward the purpose of the program. While these requirements are  generally intended to ensure accountability, Congress became concerned  that these administrative requirements may be duplicative, burdensome, or  conflicting and could impede the cost-effective delivery of services at the  local level. In response, Congress passed Public Law 106-107, the Federal  Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999. The act  (commonly referred to by the grants community as P.L. 106-107) required  that federal grant-making agencies streamline administrative requirements  and engage and involve grantees in developing and implementing their   reform goals and implementation plans. It specifically requires that the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) work with agencies to establish  common applications and systems and uniform rules for federal grant  administration. The act is scheduled to sunset in November 2007.", "P.L. 106-107 also directed GAO to assess the effectiveness of the reform  efforts and to obtain input from state, local, and tribal governments and  nonprofit organizations. In April 2005, we completed an evaluation that  focused on efforts federal grant-making agencies had made to streamline  and develop common processes for grantees and the extent of  coordination among OMB, the agencies, and potential grant recipients.  This second report examines how selected grantees view the federal  streamlining effort. Specifically, we will identify    aspects of the various federal reform efforts and initiatives that grantees  identified as inadequate to meet the goals of P.L. 106-107, in particular  simplifying federal financial assistance application and reporting  requirements; and    grantees\u2019 views on further action needed to standardize and streamline  grant processes for grantees.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed P.L.106-107 to identify  requirements and criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of agency and  governmentwide reform efforts. We then reviewed the common plan  developed initially by 26 grant-making agencies, and we obtained and  reviewed the annual progress reports that the act required each agency to  submit to OMB and Congress. We met with officials from OMB and with  lead officials from the various cross-agency work groups to discuss  ongoing reform and streamlining efforts. To get the perspective of  grantees, we reviewed the public comments that were received in  response to proposals for the initial, multiagencywide plan. We also  interviewed staff from several associations representing different  communities of grantees to identify issues that their memberships have  expressed about federal grant management process reform and to identify  states that were undertaking grant process management reforms of their  own. We analyzed results from surveys of users of the Grants.gov Web  portal, one of the initiatives implemented so far.", "To get a better working-level understanding of grant management issues,  we visited and interviewed officials at 17 grantee organizations\u20144 state  governments, 3 tribal governments, 2 county governments, 3 municipal  governments, 2 nonprofit organizations, 2 higher education institutions,  and a nonacademic research institution. This selected set of grantees  represented a range of grantee sizes, levels of administrative  sophistication, and types of grants being applied for. These discussions  enabled us to gain an in-depth perspective on the concerns of grantees  from different communities of grant recipients, and to understand how  grantees manage an array of grants from different programs and agencies,  a perspective not obtained from individual program reviews. Although we  cannot project these results to all grantees, the comments obtained help  inform the issue of the type of difficulties that grantees must address.  These discussions also enabled us to identify grant reform initiatives  undertaken by selected states that could have potential to reduce grantee  administrative burdens. For more on our methodology, see appendix I. We  conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards from June 2005 through May 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The process of distributing federal assistance through grants is  complicated and involves many different parties, both public and private,  with different organizational structures and sizes as well as varying  missions. Federal grants are disbursed and managed by 26 different  federal agencies as well as by some smaller federal entities, and grants are  used to implement about 1,000 different federal programs. Grant programs  have different objectives and strategies\u2014reflected in the application,  selection, monitoring, and reporting processes\u2014that are intended to  assure accountability to the federal agencies.", "The universe of potential applicants for grants is also large and varied. It  includes governments from the smallest school district to the largest state.  According to information from the Census Bureau and the Department of  Interior, there are approximately 88,500 units of government in the United  States, including states, tribal governments and county governments,  municipalities, townships, school districts, and various other special  purpose governments. Grant recipients also include nonprofit  organizations, described in one study as ranging from small organizations  with annual budgets less than $25,000 to multi-million-dollar health  organizations. We reported in 2005 that over 460,000 nonprofit  organizations filed tax forms in 2002. Some grants are also provided to  individuals. While not all of these entities actually apply for grants, they  are potentially eligible and do reflect the considerable diversity of grant  recipients. The grants process is further complicated because state  agencies may act as both grantees soliciting federal grant resources and as  grantors distributing federal funds to other grantees. Thus states  redistribute significant amounts of the federal aid they receive to local  governments and nonprofit agencies in their states.", "Moreover, the grants themselves come in a wide variety of types and sizes.  Grant types cover a broad spectrum from those narrowly targeted to fund  a program to those that are broadly targeted and allow the grantee to  make decisions regarding how funds are used. Mandatory grants are  awarded under a program where the authorizing statute requires the  award to be made to each eligible entity under the conditions and in the  amount (or based on the formula) specified in statute. Discretionary  grants are those in which the federal awarding agency may select the  recipient from among all eligible recipients, may decide to make or not  make an award based on the programmatic, technical, or scientific content  of an application, and can decide the amount of funding to be awarded to  each recipient. Grants can be small, such as the $1,100 National Science  Foundation Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Grant, or large,  such as California\u2019s $3.7 billion Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  block grant.", "While there is substantial variation among grants, they generally follow a  life cycle as shown in figure 1: announcement, application, award,  postaward, and closeout. Once a grant program is established through  legislation, which may specify particular objectives, eligibility, and other  requirements, a grantor agency may impose additional requirements on it.  For competitive grant programs, the public is notified of the grant  opportunity through an announcement, and potential grantees must  submit applications for agency review. In the award stage, the agency  identifies successful applicants or legislatively defined grant recipients and  awards funding. The postaward stage includes payment processing,  agency monitoring, and grantee reporting, which may include financial and  performance information. The closeout phase includes preparation of final  reports, financial reconciliation, and any required accounting for property.  Audits may occur multiple times during the life cycle of the grant and after  closeout.", "Grantees have different approaches for managing their grants across their  own internal subdivisions or departments. Grantees we visited had a  variety of grant administration structures and degrees of centralization  that were not dependent on the size of the organization or the number of  grants they received. In a more decentralized structure, each department  within the organization managed most aspects of its grants, including  financial accounting and reporting. For example, in a municipality the  police department might deal with federal Department of Justice grants;  the health department might deal with Environmental Protection Agency  grants; and the school administration might deal with Department of  Education grants. Conversely, a more centralized structure might have a  single grants office that coordinated all aspects of grant administration  across the organization, including final submission of applications and  general oversight of reporting and accountability compliance. Even for  grantees we visited with a decentralized structure, some amount of central  grant oversight was generally present.", "P.L. 106-107 was passed in response to the complicated nature of the grant  process. To address these issues, the act required OMB to direct,  coordinate, and assist federal agencies in establishing common  applications, systems, and uniform rules to improve the effectiveness and  performance of federal grants with the goal of improved efficiency and  delivery of services to the public. For example, under P.L. 106-107    OMB is required to direct, coordinate, and assist federal agencies in  developing and implementing a common application and reporting system,  including electronic processes with which a nonfederal entity can apply  for, manage, and report on the use of funds from multiple grant programs  that serve similar purposes but are administered by different federal  agencies; and  federal grant-making agencies are required to streamline and simplify their  application, administrative, and reporting procedures and enable  applicants to apply for and report on the use of federal grants funds  electronically.", "As we reported previously, the federal government has undertaken several  activities to implement P.L. 106-107. OMB has designated the Department  of Health and Human Services as the lead agency responsible for assisting  OMB in implementing the act. Activities are presently organized under two  different groups\u2014the Grants Policy Committee and the Grants Executive  Board\u2014who report to OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Financial Management and  Office of E-Government and Information Technology, respectively (see fig.  2). The Grants Policy Committee is currently responsible for formulating  overall grant management reform policy and oversees the efforts of the  cross-agency work groups. Work groups were organized shortly after the  act was passed to develop policies for implementing the act\u2019s goals related  to their respective areas:    Pre-Award Work Group, responsible for streamlining policies and  practices that occur while grantees find grants, apply for grants, and  receive notification of award decision;    Mandatory Work Group, responsible for streamlining policies and  practices for mandatory grants;    Post-Award Work Group, responsible for streamlining policies and  practices that occur while grantees perform awards, complete required  reporting, acquire payments, and during the federal monitoring of  grantees;    Audit Oversight Work Group, responsible for improving OMB\u2019s Circular   A-133 single audit process; and    Training and Oversight Work Group, responsible for addressing  governmentwide issues concerning the grants management workforce.", "The Grants Executive Board consists of senior officials from federal grant- making agencies. They provide strategic direction and oversight of  Grants.gov and the Grants Management Line of Business, which  implement technological aspects of P.L. 106-107. Grants.gov is a single  Web portal that enables users of all types to search for grants  electronically. Agencies are required to post all discretionary grant  opportunities on Grants.gov. Agencies are also able to provide the  capability for potential grantees to apply for grants through this Web site.  A Grants.gov official said that as of May 22, 2006, all but two agencies have  provided this capability and that both agencies plan to post applications  on the site in June 2006. Grants.gov continues to make improvements to its  cross-agency systems at which potential grantees can find and apply for  grant opportunities. A Grants.gov official told us they have started  planning and designing upgrades to the computer hardware to meet the  processing requirements as additional grant application packages and  functions, including improved search capabilities, are added to the site.  Further, a newly designed Grants.gov Web site was introduced in July  2006.", "The Grants Management Line of Business is an initiative begun in spring  2004 that intends to provide end-to-end management (that is, over the  entire life cycle of a grant from announcement to closeout) of grants and  address how best to consolidate the administration and management of  grants across agencies. In 2005, the Department of Health and Human  Services and the National Science Foundation were selected by OMB to be  the managing partners to lead the Grants Management Line of Business  effort. They plan to implement a consortia-based approach that builds on  existing commercial systems and grants management systems in selected  agencies to develop those agencies and their systems into shared service  providers or centers of excellence to be used by other agencies. In late  2005, OMB and the Grants Executive Board chose three agencies\u2014the  National Science Foundation, the Administration for Children and  Families within the Department of Health and Human Services, and the  Department of Education\u2014to lead three consortia in defining  requirements and agency needs around a common end-to-end grants  management system for members of each consortium. OMB officials told  us that they, the cochairs of the Grants Management Line of Business, and  the consortia leads have developed a process for agencies to join a  consortium and that the consortia leaders are working with other agencies  to discuss potential partnerships and develop memorandums of  understanding. A cochair of the initiative said OMB may designate  additional consortia based on agency interests in leading a consortium.  Detailed plans for the initiative indicate a goal of September 2011 for  completing the movement of agencies to the common systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grantees Report That, Despite Federal Efforts to Streamline, Excessive Administrative Burden Remains", "paragraphs": ["While OMB and the federal agencies have various efforts under way at the  federal level to streamline grant administration, grantees continue to  identify areas in which the goals of P.L. 106-107 have not been met.

(App. II summarizes  specific areas grantees identified as needing standardization and  streamlining through the grant life cycle.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multiple Application, Reporting, and Payment Systems Remain", "paragraphs": ["Grantees commented that they continue to need to be familiar with  multiple electronic systems and paper processes of different agencies to  apply for grants. As federal agencies transition to using Grants.gov for  their application process, grantees find themselves submitting applications  by mail, through existing agency systems, and through Grants.gov. For  example, officials from one research institution told us that they had  recently submitted applications through Grants.gov, other federal agency  Web-based systems, and by mail. A few grantees mentioned that they had  to mail in parts of the application in addition to submitting parts online for  some agencies. Some grantees expressed a preference to be able to  continue to use particular existing agency systems because they were  familiar with these systems and they found useful some of the options that  they provided, such as tracking the status of applications.", "Along with agencies\u2019 varying application processes, grantees described  varying agency procedures required to submit financial and progress  reports. When the cross-agency work groups sought public comments in  2001, several grantees raised issues such as the need to develop uniform  reporting requirements, formats, guidelines, and submission frequencies,  and the need to obtain and submit reports online. Grantees we visited said  that the frequency with which progress and financial reports were  required varied across programs, making it difficult to keep track of when  reports were due. Progress reports are sometimes required quarterly,  semiannually, or annually. Due dates for quarterly financial reports also  varied; grantees reported that financial reports are due as few as 30 days  and as long as 90 days after the end of the quarter.", "Grantees provided several examples of administrative requirements that  vary across grants and the resulting challenges. An official from one  nonprofit group we met with, which receives seven separate grants all  related to serving one special population, said reporting was the most  difficult part of managing federal grants for them. Reports require  information in different ways, and this requires that intake information on  their clients must be collected in different ways, such as by special age- grouping categories. Grantees also described different systems to submit  reports. Some are submitted to agencies\u2019 online systems, while others are  submitted via paper hardcopy. One system that grantees described  required continual updating of activities as often as daily for the purpose  of generating performance reports. A P.L. 106-107 cross-agency team  representative explained that standard reports are being developed, but  have not been implemented yet. Grantees receiving many federal grants  also told us they would like to have the ability to track reporting deadlines  and submissions online. This capability for grant administrators to  conduct online tracking of when reports are due and which reports have  been submitted to and received by the federal grantor agencies would  decrease the confusion caused by various reporting schedules.", "Some grantees we interviewed expressed a preference for a single grant  management system on which multiple users could perform concurrent  tasks and that would provide the data to conduct end-to-end management  of grants throughout the grants\u2019 life cycle, unlike Grants.gov, which only  handles the front end of the process (i.e., identifying and applying for  grants). Several grantees told us they have had experience using such  systems. However, without the capability for grantee staff to oversee the  entire grant process on one system, grantees cannot easily monitor when  program reports are due, whether these reports have been submitted and  received, and whether payments have been made. Not having this end-to- end grant management capability makes it particularly challenging for  central grant management staff at larger grantees to oversee the grant  process across their organizations. P.L. 106-107 required the development  of a common system, including electronic processes, through which a  grantee can apply for, manage, and report on the use of funding. To date,  such a system has not been developed across federal agencies. However,  the Grants Management Line of Business initiative, if implemented as  proposed in its business plan, could eventually result in reducing the  number of different systems.", "Several grantees identified the multiple payment systems that they must  access to receive funds as a source of frustration. The existence of  multiple payment systems was one of the areas of greatest concern by  those grantees who commented on the initial plan, and grantees continue  to identify the need to reduce the number of payment systems. The  National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers,  commenting on this situation, explained that it has continued to cause  problems for the states because of the continued use by some federal  agencies of unreliable and antiquated systems. Some of these systems are  paper-based or phone systems. Many grantees with whom we spoke  described needing to understand several payment systems\u2014as many as  six different systems in one municipality. This creates problems as new  employees need to be trained on multiple systems. Grantees we  interviewed said they preferred some electronic systems more than others  because of the ease of use and the ability to track balances and print  reports. They also expressed concern that as systems were standardized,  the grant management systems that they believe are the most functional  will not be selected and used as the standard system.", "In 1998, the Chief Financial Officers Council designated two payment  systems for use by federal civilian grant-making agencies and designated a  third payment system for use by the Department of Defense. As of  November 2005, 16 civilian agencies have migrated to one of the civilian  payment systems, but agencies still continued to operate nine different  systems. As of May 2006, the Grants Policy Committee\u2019s Post-Award Work  Group was seeking information on agencies\u2019 current payment systems and  their plans for these systems in the future. Officials from neither the work  group nor the Grants Management Line of Business team could provide us  with information on payment systems that would be used under the Line  of Business consortia approach.

Grantees  reported that standard definitions do not exist for some terms, and as a  result, grantees must track and report expenses in different ways. For  example, expenses such as particular employee-related costs are  categorized differently across agencies, which requires recalculating  expenses into new categories, a time-consuming step.", "Grantees said that the lengthy and differing terms and conditions that are  part of the award agreements are difficult to grasp. They generally said  standard terms and conditions would be very helpful in identifying  significant differences between requirements of different agencies. As of  March 2006, the Grants Policy Committee\u2019s Pre-Award Work Group was  drafting a standard award notice and standard terms and conditions. It  would include a standard section, but would also identify award-specific  terms and conditions, including points related to the program and to the  specific grantee, if needed. After the draft is complete, it will be reviewed  by the Grants Policy Committee, reviewed by the agencies, sent to OMB  for approval, and published in the Federal Register for a period of public  comment. The goal for publication is early 2007.", "Grantees reported that for each grant awarded, they are required to review  and sign a set of multiple certifications and assurances forms, though  these forms do not vary widely from grant to grant, even across agencies.  These forms attest that the policies and procedures of a grantee  organization are in accordance with federal requirements. Grantees are  typically asked to avow that they will not use funds for lobbying purposes  and that they will provide a drug-free workplace, among other assurances.  Grantees noted that these types of policies are unlikely to change  frequently, and that it seems unnecessary to reconfirm their adherence to  them on a continual basis. Nevertheless, grantees receiving many federal  grants must get essentially the same forms signed many times by executive  level managers and submit these forms to agencies, a process they say is  duplicative and time-consuming. In addition, frequently, certifications and  assurances require original signatures, and must be submitted in hardcopy,  even at times when the application is submitted electronically, adding  additional burden. Grantees suggested that there should be a mechanism  to submit any required certifications and assurances annually, in a format  which is accessible and accepted governmentwide.

For example, grantees told us that federal agencies  generally only send award notifications to one person in the organization,  frequently at the executive level (for example, the mayor of a city),  although several contacts are listed in the application. By sending the  notification by paper or e-mail to a single contact who is authorized to sign  off on grant applications for the organization but is not directly involved  with applying for the grant, federal agencies might inadvertently leave the  grantee\u2019s program manager and financial staff out of the communication  chain. It can take some time for organizations to filter the information  through, and grantees said that notifications were frequently lost in their  organizations. For instance, if a letter or e-mail is sent to the mayor of a  city, it could be some time before that information is reviewed and passed  along to the appropriate person. Grantees would prefer that notifications  go to multiple people in the organization.", "Additionally, grantees told us when they receive a bank wire transfer  report from their bank indicating that a payment has been credited to their  account, they sometimes cannot identify the grant program for which it is  providing funds because the bank report does not provide helpful  information. When funds from federal agencies are deposited, grantee  financial staff are notified of a deposit to the grantee\u2019s account, which is  notated with coding on a wire transfer report. Grantees explained that  these codes are complicated alphanumeric sequences which have little or  no information about which grant or program the money is for. The  grantee accountants may be unaware that the funds are coming,  sometimes because grantee program staff have drawn down funds and  have not notified them and sometimes because the deposit was not  expected. Financial staff said that even if they are aware of the request,  they match transactions primarily by dollar amount because the codes are  difficult to decipher. Grantees said that it would be helpful to have more  information, such as a payment transaction number or Catalogue of  Federal Domestic Assistance number, on the wire transfer report.

They said that they sometimes have insufficient time to  obtain approvals from internal authorities such as city councils and county  boards, who meet infrequently, yet such approvals are often required by  local officials before submitting applications. If lengthening the  application period is not feasible for a given grant or program, one grantee  suggested that federal agencies provide better forecasting of opportunities  they expect to be available, funds permitting.

They said they had, for example, upgraded hardware and  increased capacity for peak application periods as agencies continue to  increase the number of grant opportunities requiring that applications be  submitted through Grants.gov.

However, this requires  significant programming and financial investment to use. In addition, in  December 2005, Grants.gov instituted a temporary solution to allow users  of Macintosh systems to complete and submit applications using the  electronic forms software. Grants.gov officials anticipate that a final  solution will be available in November 2006.", "One particularly difficult problem for grantees using the apply feature has  been the initial registration process. Grantees experienced difficulties with  registering through the Central Contractor Registration\u2014a requirement to  use Grants.gov\u2014as well as the time it takes to complete the process. They  stated that the registration process was complicated and difficult. Much of  the confusion has centered on the use of Data Universal Numbering  System (DUNS) numbers, which are used to track grantees. States, as well  as other grantees, sometimes have more than one DUNS number and  stated that it is unclear which number should be used for the registration.  Grantees also stated that the process takes too long to complete. The  Grants.gov online survey also asked site visitors to rate both the clarity of  instructions for registering and the ease of registering.

P.L. 106- 107 required that lead officials consult with representatives of nonfederal  entities during the development and implementation of the P.L. 106-107  initial plan. In 2005, we recommended to OMB that cross-agency work  groups solicit grantee input and provide coordination with grantees on an  ongoing basis. However, there has not been extensive communication  with all types of grantees on policy and technology development. For  example, one of the work groups told us that they obtained feedback from  grantees on a potential product during its development, but this has not  occurred on a wide scale.", "Our discussions with grantees about P.L. 106-107 initiatives that have been  implemented indicate that insufficient communication with the diverse  grantee community has hampered effective and efficient implementation  of the act, especially in the case of the technology implemented. As  discussed earlier, grantees experienced problems stemming from policies  and technologies that are inconsistent with grantees\u2019 business practices  and these have caused inefficiencies in their administration of grants.  These issues may have been addressed, or addressed sooner, if greater  communication, before implementation, existed between grantees and the  cross-agency work groups. For example, we found that some grantees  could not efficiently use the software needed to apply for grants on  Grants.gov as intended because internal information technology policies  limit their use and transfer of certain files or programs throughout the  organization.", "The Grants.gov staff felt that the needs of rural users merited the use of an  application that could be completed offline, rather than using a system  that involves completing forms while online, to reduce the time spent  online completing the application.

Grantees we spoke  with stated that there was a need to address postaward administration in  addition to addressing the find and apply phases that are completed on  Grants.gov. P.L. 106-107 requires a common electronic system that  grantees can use to apply for, manage, and report on federal financial  assistance.

Some  grantees also expressed concern about the lack of training they received  on the use of electronic systems, either Grants.gov or other agency  electronic systems used for grants management. Those that did use  Grants.gov expressed some serious concerns about its functionality as  well.

Some of these issues may have been resolved more quickly  if communication with grantees had been greater.", "The lack of adequate communication between the federal government and  state grantees particularly affects progress in streamlining grant  administration because of the dual role that states play. States both  receive federal grants and provide grants to other levels of government  and nonprofit agencies, including some federal funds that pass through the  state. Subrecipients of federal grants must follow procedures established  by both federal agencies and state agencies, all of which can differ. States  must implement federal changes in their own state grant awards as  required by the federal agencies. In addition, federal efforts to reduce  administrative burden on grantees may also stimulate corresponding state  actions to examine requirements added by states. Some states are already  taking actions (discussed in more detail in app. III) that may reduce  administrative burdens on recipients of state grant awards. For example,  states we visited had initiated their own grant process management  reforms, including    establishing central policies and procedures that provide consistency  across all state agencies awarding funds to local governments and  nonprofit agencies;    establishing central state grants management offices that can provide  mechanisms for statewide oversight of grants management; and    developing new streamlined and standardized grants management systems  that are similar in intent to the federal Grants.gov system.", "The research community has established avenues of communication with  relevant federal agencies through the Federal Demonstration Partnership,  a cooperative initiative of 10 agencies and over 90 research institutions  that encourages streamlining the administration of federally-sponsored  research.

They organized into work  groups, proposed changes, and implemented some of them. Their job has  not been a simple one; it involves reaching consensus and obtaining  conformity among 26 agencies whose procedures have evolved  independently to address varying program goals, agency systems,  management styles, and individual initiatives over the years. Given the  complexity of the P.L. 106-107 initiatives, it is vital to continue to integrate  and coordinate their various components. However, despite all these  efforts, estimates for completing these initiatives indicate that the goals of  P.L. 106-107 will not be met by the act\u2019s sunset in November 2007.

As a result  of P.L. 106-107, agencies have begun to work together to develop common  systems and processes.

As a result,  opportunities to simplify grant administration for the grantee, and thus to  deliver services more cost-effectively, could be missed.", "As we spoke with grantees, it was apparent that closer involvement with  all types of grantees as policies and technologies have been developed  may have both reduced the negative effect on grantees from some  technological changes and could have identified other areas that are  critical to grantees. The cross-agency teams are just beginning to establish  a mechanism to get grantees\u2019 views through forums held across the nation.  Grants.gov\u2019s ongoing systematic efforts to get system users\u2019 comments  have helped keep it informed of grantees\u2019 concerns about its systems in  place. However, it has no systematic way to get grantees\u2019 views as it  develops and proposes changes. Plans to involve grantees as the newer  Grants Management Line of Business initiative evolves have not yet been  developed. It is particularly important that states, with large grant  management systems of their own, be able to have input into, and  knowledge of, potential changes at the federal level.

Some programs are managed through online systems, but  sophistication of the systems varies within a state. One grantee cited a  state agency system that allowed the grantees to access, complete, and  submit reports online, but not save the form, meaning that later changes  required them to complete the whole form again. Another said it would be  helpful to have the forms mirror federal forms as the federal forms are  standardized. They also said that terms and conditions vary across state  agencies; and a few grant coordinators pointed out the difficulty of  ensuring that their various program departments are complying because of  the variations in the administrative requirements laid out in the terms and  conditions.

For  example, Tennessee has a policy to streamline the reporting requirements  for selected subrecipients of federal and state grant monies and to achieve  cost savings to both subrecipients and state funding agencies. Prior to this  policy, subrecipients were required to submit revenue, expenditure, and  budget reports that were individualized and tailor-made to the needs of the  various state agencies, causing subrecipients to prepare a variety of  reports for each state agency to which it reported. In another example,  Texas has established statewide Uniform Grant Management Standards.  These standards were established to promote the efficient use of public  funds by providing awarding agencies and grantees a standardized set of  financial management procedures and definitions, by requiring  consistency among state grantor agencies in their dealings with grantees,  and by ensuring accountability for the expenditure of public funds. State  agencies are required to adhere to these standards when administering  grants and other financial assistance agreements with cities, counties, and  other political subdivisions of the state.", "Several states have also established or are considering central offices that  can provide mechanisms for statewide oversight of grants management.

The system will provide a portal that provides a  single source for grant posting and grant searching across all state  agencies and comprehensive information about all phases of the grants  process. Applicants will be able to obtain information about the eligibility  requirements of a grant, apply online, and check the status of their  application. State staff will be able to manage the grant process  electronically.", "Texas has also begun development of a Grants.gov type project. The state  legislature directed in 2005 that the Department of Information Resources,  in cooperation with the Office of the Governor\u2019s State Grants Team,  develop an electronic system for state agency grants.
