Program funding, which primarily supported continuing health center services, increased from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2004. However, funding for new access point grants, which fund one or more new delivery sites, decreased by 53 percent during this period. At the same time, the number of applicants for these grants increased by 28 percent. As a result, the proportion of applicants receiving new access point grants declined from 52 percent in fiscal year 2002 to 20 percent in fiscal year 2004. In fiscal years 2002 through 2004, HRSA funded 334 new access point grants and 285 grants for expanded services at existing sites. While HRSA includes an assessment of communities' need for services in its process for awarding new access point grants, agency officials indicated that they were not confident that the process has sufficiently targeted communities with the greatest need. Therefore, the agency is considering changes to the way it assesses community need and the relative weight it gives need in the award process. The number of health centers receiving new access point grants varied widely by state--from 1 to 57--during fiscal years 2002 through 2004, but HRSA lacks reliable data on the number and location of health centers' delivery sites. Although HRSA uses data on the number of delivery sites to track the progress of the Consolidated Health Centers program, it is not confident that grantees are accurately identifying delivery sites funded by the program. Furthermore, in its reporting, HRSA counted each new access point grant funded in fiscal years 2002 through 2004 as a single delivery site, although some represent more than one site. HRSA needs to collect and report accurate and complete delivery site data to give the agency and the Congress data they need to make decisions about the program. HRSA has increased the role of performance measurement in its monitoring of health centers and has improved its collection of data that could help measure overall program performance. In 2004, the agency began to use a new process for on-site monitoring of health centers that focuses on each center's performance on measures tailored to its community and patient population. However, the new review generally does not provide standardized performance information that HRSA can use to evaluate the health center program as a whole. The agency is using other tools to collect health outcome data on patients that could help measure program performance. Continued attention to such efforts could improve the agency's ability to evaluate its success in improving the health of people in underserved communities. In addition to developing these data collection tools, HRSA has taken steps to improve the accuracy and completeness of its Uniform Data System, a data set that HRSA uses to monitor aspects of the health centers' performance. For example, HRSA provided grantees with more detailed instructions on how to identify their delivery sites."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nationwide network of health centers in the federal Consolidated  Health Centers program is an important component of the health care  safety net for vulnerable populations, including Medicaid beneficiaries,  people who are uninsured, and others who may have difficulty obtaining  access to health care. The centers provide comprehensive primary health  care services\u2014including preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and emergency  services and referrals to specialty care\u2014without regard to patients\u2019 ability  to pay. They also provide enabling services, such as transportation and  translation, that help patients gain access to care. In 2003, through this  program, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Health  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) was funding nearly 900  health centers with one or more delivery sites. The health centers provided  comprehensive primary care services to over 12 million people\u2014including  over 4 million Medicaid patients and nearly 5 million uninsured patients. To  increase access to health care for vulnerable populations, HRSA began  implementing the 5-year President\u2019s Health Centers Initiative in fiscal year  2002.

The Health Centers  Consolidation Act of 1996 created the Consolidated Health Centers  program by combining these various types of health center programs under  Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. In fiscal year 2004, funding  for the Consolidated Health Centers program was about $1.6 billion, of  which about $1.4 billion was allocated to grants for health centers.

We also reviewed information on health center funding, grant  applications, and grant awards during fiscal years 2002 through 2004. We  assessed the reliability of these data by interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data and the systems that produced them, and we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We interviewed HRSA officials and representatives of state and  national health center membership organizations and conducted structured  interviews with officials of 12 health centers in urban and rural areas of  California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas. We selected these states  because they vary in geographic location and were among the states with  the highest number of health centers.

Centers are also required to provide referrals for specialty care and  substance abuse and mental health services, and although centers may use  program funds to provide such services themselves or to reimburse other  providers, they are not required to do so. In addition, a distinguishing  feature of health centers is that they are required to provide enabling  services that facilitate access to care, such as case management,  translation, and transportation. The health care services are provided by  clinical staff\u2014including physicians, nurses, dentists, and mental health and  substance abuse professionals\u2014or through contracts or cooperative  arrangements with other providers. Health center services are offered at  one or more delivery sites and are required to be available to all people in  the center\u2019s service area. Services must be provided regardless of  patients\u2019 ability to pay. Uninsured users are charged for services based on  a sliding fee schedule that takes into account their income level, and health  centers seek reimbursement from public or private insurers for patients  with health insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HRSA\u2019s Award Process for Grants Funded through the Consolidated Health Centers Program", "paragraphs": ["HRSA uses a competitive process to award grants to health centers. Grant  applications undergo an initial review for eligibility in which HRSA screens  applications based on specific criteria\u2014the applicant must be a public or  private nonprofit entity, the applicant must be applying for an appropriate  grant (e.g., certain grants funded by the program are available only to  existing grantees), and the application must include the correct documents  and meet page limitations and format requirements. Independent  reviewers who have expertise in the health center program are selected by  HRSA to review and score all eligible applications. The reviewers score an  application by assessing each component of the applicant\u2019s proposal,  including descriptions of the need for health care services in the applicant\u2019s  proposed service area, how the applicant would integrate services with  other efforts in the community, and the applicant\u2019s capacity and readiness  to initiate the proposed services. The Administrator of HRSA makes final  award decisions and is required to take into account whether a center is  located in a sparsely populated rural area, the urban/rural distribution of  grants, and the distribution of funds across types of health centers  (community, homeless, migrant, and public housing). In addition, the  Administrator of HRSA also considers geographic distribution in making  award decisions. The scope of a health center\u2019s grant is delineated in its  application and consists of its services, sites, providers, target population,  and service area. (See app. II for additional information on HRSA\u2019s process  for awarding health center grants.)", "BPHC administers several competitive grants under the Consolidated  Health Centers program, including new access point, expanded medical  capacity, service expansion, and service area competition grants. (See table  1.) HRSA approves funding for a specific project period\u2014which can be up  to 5 years for existing grantees and up to 3 years for new organizations\u2014 and provides funds for the first year. For subsequent years, health centers  must obtain funding annually through a noncompeting continuation grant  application process in which the grantee must demonstrate that it has  made satisfactory progress in providing services. A grantee\u2019s continued  receipt of grant funds also depends on the availability of funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HRSA\u2019s Monitoring of the Consolidated Health Centers Program", "paragraphs": ["To monitor health centers\u2019 performance and compliance with federal  statutes, regulations, and policies, HRSA relies on periodic on-site  monitoring reviews, as well as ongoing monitoring. Through early 2004,  HRSA used BPHC\u2019s Primary Care Effectiveness Review (PCER) to provide  periodic on-site monitoring of health center operations. The PCER was  scheduled to occur every 3 to 5 years as a mandatory part of the  competitive grant renewal process when a health center\u2019s project period  was about to expire. During on-site PCER visits, a team of reviewers  identified strengths and weaknesses in health center administration,  governance, clinical and fiscal operations, and management information  systems. According to HRSA officials, review team members were  generally not HRSA staff, but contractors. The last PCER review was  conducted in March 2004.", "HRSA created a new process for the periodic on-site review of all agency  grantees, including health centers, and reviewers from HRSA\u2019s Office of  Performance Review (OPR) began to use this new process in May 2004.  OPR reviews grantees in the middle of their project period\u2014in the second  year for new grantees and in the third or fourth year for existing grantees.  According to HRSA officials, a goal of the OPR performance review  process is to reduce the burden on grantees by consolidating the on-site  monitoring of all HRSA grants to a health center into one comprehensive  review. For example, if a health center receives a Ryan White Title III HIV  Early Intervention grant, the OPR performance review covers both the  Ryan White grant and the Consolidated Health Centers program grant(s).  Each health center review team has three or four reviewers; HRSA\u2019s goal is  for the reviewers to be OPR staff, who are located in HRSA\u2019s regional  offices, with contractors being used to supplement OPR staff only when  necessary. For each health center review, the review team prepares a  performance report describing its findings. As necessary, the report  identifies the health center\u2019s technical assistance needs and actions the  center needs to take to ensure its compliance with program requirements.", "HRSA also conducts ongoing monitoring of health centers through its  project officers, who serve as grantees\u2019 main point of contact with the  agency. Project officers use various tools to monitor compliance with  program requirements and to assess the overall condition of health centers.  For example, project officers review annual noncompeting continuation  grant applications, conduct midyear assessments, and regularly examine  available data, including financial audits and UDS data. They are also  expected to have regular contact with health centers by telephone and  through e-mail and to connect grantees to resources for assistance when  necessary, such as referring a health center to a HRSA-funded contractor  for technical assistance to improve health center operations. In July 2003,  HRSA transferred project officer responsibilities from its 10 regional  offices and centralized this function within BPHC to improve the  consistency of program oversight.", "In addition, about one-third of the health centers funded under the  Consolidated Health Centers program are accredited by the Joint  Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and  receive additional periodic on-site monitoring. These reviews include an  assessment of a health center\u2019s compliance with program laws and  regulations, clinical procedures, and organizational processes, such as  performance improvement activities and human resource management.  HRSA began promoting accreditation for health centers in 1996, and under  its current agreement with JCAHO, HRSA pays the fees for health center  surveys, reducing the financial burden of accreditation for health centers.  HRSA also provides financial support to the National Association of  Community Health Centers to encourage accreditation and educate health  centers about its benefits.", "HRSA uses UDS data to monitor aspects of health center and overall  program performance. Each year, health centers are required to report  administrative data on their operations through UDS. These data include a  list of each center\u2019s service delivery sites and information about the  center\u2019s patients (e.g., race/ethnicity, insurance status); revenues;  expenses; and service, staffing, and utilization patterns. HRSA uses UDS  data to prepare its annual National Rollup Report, which summarizes the  Consolidated Health Centers program; to prepare Comparison Reports,  which allow the centers to compare their performance on certain measures  (e.g., productivity, cost per encounter) against that of other centers; and to  generate analyses that HRSA uses when evaluating the program.", "In March 2000, we reported on HRSA\u2019s monitoring of the Consolidated  Health Centers program. We analyzed UDS data from 1996 through 1998  and noted deficiencies in data completeness and quality. Specifically, some  grantees failed to report certain data elements or reported them very late,  resulting in missing data. Furthermore, we found that the data editing and  cleaning processes that were in place at the time did not always correct  data errors that they were designed to detect. We recommended that HRSA  improve the quality of UDS data and enforce the requirement that every  grantee report complete and accurate data. In response to the  recommendation, HRSA reported that a new requirement was in place for  grantees to submit their UDS reports electronically, which improved the  timeliness and accuracy of data by eliminating the need for a second level  of data entry.

For example, the health center discussed above proposed hiring an outside  physician to conduct chart reviews and showing a video on cultural  competence to all staff as two specific actions to improve performance on  its low-birth-weight measure.", "While the OPR review primarily focuses on health centers\u2019 performance on  specific measures, the reviews also verify key aspects of health centers\u2019  compliance with Consolidated Health Centers program requirements. The  review teams examine information HRSA maintains on each health center,  including grant applications and financial audits. According to HRSA  officials, OPR reviewers also follow up on concerns identified by project  officers, who are the agency\u2019s primary means for ongoing monitoring of  health center operations and compliance. If the review team identifies any  instances of noncompliance with program requirements\u2014such as those  related to the types of services the center must provide and the  composition of its governing board\u2014HRSA requires grantees to address  them in the action plan.", "HRSA officials told us they hoped that in addition to providing information  on individual health centers, the OPR performance reviews would result in  information that could improve other centers\u2019 services and operations.  HRSA officials said that as reviewers gained more experience in evaluating  health centers, they would be better able to identify best practices that  contribute to outstanding patient health outcomes and share these  practices among health centers. HRSA officials told us that OPR planned to  use this information to develop a list of successful practices employed by  health centers, such as a patient tracking system or prescription drug  subsidy program. They said they expected to generate this list three times a  year and to make it available as a resource for project officers and OPR  review teams to share with other health centers.", "The health center officials we interviewed whose centers had undergone  the OPR performance review said that, in general, it provided helpful  suggestions for improving services and operations. Officials from some  health centers told us that they planned to incorporate the performance  goals and their progress in achieving them into their future grant  applications. Health center staff also described the reviews as accurate and  thorough and said they appreciated the in-depth method of looking at  performance in targeted areas. Officials from a few health centers also  noted that their reviewers had expertise on the health centers program  because the reviewers had previously been project officers for the  program; one health center official said that this expertise was critical to  the review process. In many cases, HRSA field office staff conduct  performance reviews of health centers in states or communities with which  they are already familiar. HRSA officials told us this experience has  allowed the OPR reviewers to understand performance in the context of  the local, state, and regional environment, such as the effect state Medicaid  funding and policy changes might have on the number of people receiving  health center services.", "While the OPR review evaluates the performance of individual health  centers, it generally does not provide standardized performance  information for the Consolidated Health Centers program as a whole, and  HRSA is using other tools to collect information that could help measure  overall program performance. In 2002, HRSA began collecting data on  health centers\u2019 services and patient populations through its Sentinel  Centers Network\u2014a network of health centers designed to be  geographically and sociodemographically representative. As of February  2005, 67 health centers, with more than 1 million patients, were  participating in the network. Participating health centers report patient-,   encounter-, and practitioner-level data. The network is intended to  supplement HRSA\u2019s other data sources, such as the Community Health  Center User and Visit Survey,which is conducted only every 5 to 7 years,  and the UDS, which generally provides grantee-level data.", "HRSA also collects information that could help it measure overall program  performance through its Health Disparities Collaboratives, which the  agency views as a tool for improving the quality of care. Participating  health centers use a model for patient care that includes evidence-based  practice guidelines. The model also includes a database in which the health  centers collect standardized patient-level health outcome data that are  used to track progress and are shared with all health centers in the collaborative. HRSA plans to expand the collaborative model from a focus  on specific diseases to a focus on primary care in general. Through 2004,  497 health centers had implemented the collaborative model for at least  one disease. An additional 150 centers began the collaborative process in  February 2005. In the future, HRSA officials would like to extend the  model to all health centers in the Consolidated Health Centers program.", "HRSA has a contract with Johns Hopkins University for evaluating data  from the Sentinel Centers Network and other health center data, such as  UDS data. According to HRSA officials, the purpose of this contract is to  provide timely, short-term statistical analyses and longer-term evaluation  studies using databases that contain information on health centers. One  planned study will examine preventive services provided by health centers,  and several will focus on the role of health centers in reducing racial/ethnic  and socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes for health center users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HRSA Has Taken Actions to Improve the Completeness and Accuracy of Its Uniform Data System", "paragraphs": ["Since our previous report on the health centers program in March 2000,  HRSA has taken steps to improve the UDS data collection and reporting  process by trying to ensure that all Consolidated Health Centers program  grantees report to the system and that the information they report is  complete and accurate. HRSA\u2019s efforts resulted in near-universal  reporting\u201499.8 percent\u2014by grantees for 2003.

HRSA officials told us that after they made several efforts to try to  obtain UDS data, only 2 of the 892 grantees required to report in 2003 did  not submit data.", "To minimize errors in the data set, HRSA implements data quality  assurance procedures in the UDS data collection process. Specifically,  HRSA has programmed 474 edit checks into the software that grantees use  to report UDS data. These edit checks detect mathematical and logical  errors and are triggered while grantees are entering or verifying data.  Mathematical edit checks ensure that rows and columns sum to the total  submitted by the grantee, and logical edit checks ensure consistency within  and across tables. For example, one logical edit check ensures that the  total number of patients reported by age and sex equals the total number of  patients reported by race/ethnicity. The grantee is prompted to address  inaccuracies or inconsistencies identified by the edit checks before  submitting the data to HRSA.", "When HRSA receives grantees\u2019 UDS submissions, its contractor conducts  additional edit checks. The contractor confirms that grantees\u2019 submissions  are substantially complete, which includes ensuring that tables are not  blank, and forwards satisfactory submissions to an editor. The editors  review the mathematical and logical checks triggered by the software and  the checks for completeness conducted by the contractor. The editors also  conduct 304 additional edit checks, which include comparisons to data  submitted in the previous year and comparisons to industry norms. When  they find an aberrant data element, editors contact grantees to determine if there is an error in the data or if there is a reasonable explanation. If there  is an error, the editor and grantee agree on a process and timeline for the  grantee to submit corrected data, and the grantee\u2019s UDS data are revised.  HRSA officials told us that editors were experienced with UDS, the  Consolidated Health Centers program, and data editing. The editors have  also attended training to ensure consistency across editors and to learn  about new edit checks. In addition, editors are assigned to grantees in a  single state or region to facilitate their understanding of unique regional  issues that could affect UDS data, such as managed care participation.", "We found the UDS data for the selected data elements we evaluated to be  generally accurate. For the mathematical and logical edit checks of 25 data  elements we conducted, we found very few errors, and each error was due  to missing data. In addition, we found no discrepancies in our replication  of five analyses in HRSA\u2019s 2003 National Rollup Report.", "To improve the accuracy of UDS data on the number and location of health  center delivery sites, for 2004, HRSA revised the instructions to grantees  for identifying their delivery sites. The new instructions specified that  grantees should report delivery sites that provide services on a regularly  scheduled basis and that are operated within the approved scope of the  health center\u2019s grant. HRSA also provided more detailed instructions to  help grantees determine which delivery sites they should include in their  UDS submission and which sites they should exclude.

According to the 2003  UDS data, 32 percent of health centers provided some specialty care on  site. Specialists providing services on site include health center  employees and volunteers. In addition, 83 percent of health centers  reported that they had formal referral arrangements for some specialty  care, which included agreements with community providers, such as local  hospitals and networks of specialty care providers. Almost all of these  health centers reported that they did not pay for some of the services for  which they referred patients. In addition to formal referrals, health centers  also informally refer patients to specialty care. Health center officials told  us that many of their referrals for specialty care were arranged informally  through discussions between health center staff and the specialty care  provider, and specialists donated their time to provide services to the  health center\u2019s patients.", "Health center officials told us that obtaining specialty care for center  patients, especially patients who are uninsured, could be difficult. Officials  from most of the health centers in our review said that there was a shortage  of certain specialists available to receive referrals from their health center.  For example, one official told us that there were only two specialists  providing gynecologic oncology services in the county, and both physicians  were overbooked with paying patients. Health center officials told us that  some specialists\u2014such as orthopedists, neurologists, oncologists,  cardiologists, ophthalmologists, and dermatologists\u2014were difficult to find.", "This problem is exacerbated because, according to officials from most of  the health centers in our review, some specialists are not willing to provide  free care for uninsured patients. As a result, there are often long waiting  lists for health center patients to see a specialty care provider who is  willing to provide donated services. For example, one health center official  told us that a patient might have to wait 9 months for an appointment with  a dermatologist. One health center official characterized the center\u2019s  efforts to secure specialty care for patients as \u201cbegging.\u201d Although these  issues present a problem for health centers in both urban and rural areas,  people living in rural communities could face additional challenges  affecting their access to care, such as a need to travel a long distance to  obtain care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HRSA\u2019s Consolidated Health Centers program has played a pivotal role in  providing access to health care for people who are uninsured or who face  other barriers to receiving needed care.

HRSA has indicated that it is not confident that its award process for new  access point grants\u2014which is intended to meet this challenge\u2014has  sufficiently targeted communities with the greatest need. HRSA\u2019s recent  effort to evaluate the assessment and relative weight of need in the award  process could result in greater confidence that the agency is appropriately  considering community need in distributing federal resources to increase  access to health care.", "In light of the growing federal investment in health centers during the  President\u2019s Health Centers Initiative, it is important for HRSA to ensure  that health centers are operating effectively and improving patient health  outcomes. HRSA\u2019s adoption of a performance monitoring process that  includes emphasis on patient health outcomes and its efforts to collect  health outcome data constitute an important step in improving the agency\u2019s  capacity to assess health centers and the health centers program.

In providing new  UDS guidance to grantees, HRSA has taken a step toward improving the  quality of its information on delivery sites. The agency will need to  carefully assess the effectiveness of its new guidance and, if necessary,  take additional steps to ensure that delivery site information is accurate.

HRSA  stated that the accuracy of delivery site data does not affect its ability to  assess and report the progress of the President\u2019s Health Centers Initiative  because it believes this progress is more appropriately assessed by the  number of new access point and expanded medical capacity grants HRSA  has awarded. While HRSA may choose to assess the progress of the  President\u2019s Health Centers Initiative on this basis, it is not appropriate to  equate the number of new access point grants awarded to health centers  with the number of delivery sites where these centers provide care.

We selected  these states because of their geographic diversity and because they were  among the states with the highest number of health centers. Within each of  the four states, we selected 3 health centers, including at least 1 urban and  1 rural center in each state. To ensure that we could obtain information  about securing specialty care for uninsured patients, we selected only  centers where at least 26 percent of the patients were uninsured in  calendar year 2003; 75 percent of all health centers had a proportion of  uninsured patients of at least 26 percent.

To describe the geographic  distribution of health centers, we analyzed Uniform Data System (UDS)  data on health center location by zip code and state and other data HRSA  provided on centers\u2019 urban/rural status. We assessed the reliability of the  data on health center funding and geographic distribution of health centers  by interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data and the  systems that produced them, and we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To determine HRSA\u2019s process for assessing the need for services, we  reviewed agency grant announcements, grant applications, and application  guidance documents for the various grant types. We also reviewed the  need-for-assistance worksheet and the need criteria in the new access point  grant application guidance. We interviewed agency officials about the  criteria used to assess the application sections on need for services and  about HRSA\u2019s ongoing consideration of revising the way need is assessed  for new access point grants. In addition, we interviewed health center  officials and officials from national and state associations that work with  health centers about their experiences with the grant process.", "To examine HRSA\u2019s monitoring of health center performance, we reviewed  agency reports and protocols related to the new monitoring process  conducted by the Office of Performance Review (OPR). We interviewed  agency officials about the development of the new process and the roles  played by different agency branches in monitoring health centers. To obtain  information about health centers\u2019 experiences with the new OPR  performance review process, we conducted interviews with officials from  health centers that had completed the process. One of the 12 original health  centers we interviewed had completed the OPR performance review  process, and we also interviewed officials at an additional 6 health centers  that were among the first to complete the process.

The preview includes information  on eligibility requirements; the estimated number of awards to be made; the  estimated amount of each award; and the dates that application guidance  will be available, applications will be due, and awards will be made. HRSA  later issues grant application guidance, which includes the forms  applicants need to submit (such as forms describing the composition of the  applicant\u2019s governing board, summarizing the funding request, and  describing the type of services to be provided) and a detailed description of  the application review criteria and process.", "The application guidance for new access point grants also encourages  applicants to submit a letter of interest prior to submitting a grant  application. In the letter of interest, the applicant describes its community\u2019s  need for services and proposes services that the health center would offer  to address those needs. HRSA officials told us that in fiscal year 2004,  nearly one-half of applicants for new access point grants submitted a letter  of interest. HRSA provides feedback to organizations on whether the  proposal is consistent with the objectives of the health center program and  whether HRSA thinks the organization is ready to establish a new delivery  site.", "HRSA also provides applicants with technical assistance resources during  the development of grant applications. For example, through cooperative  agreements with HRSA, state primary care associations and the National  Association of Community Health Centers offer regional training sessions  on various topics, including strategic planning, proposal writing,  community assessment, and data collection. Potential applicants may also  contact their state primary care association for individual technical  assistance and application review.", "HRSA approves funding for a specific project period\u2014up to 5 years for  existing grantees and up to 3 years for new grantees. HRSA provides funds  for the first year of the project; for subsequent years, health centers must  obtain funding annually through a noncompeting continuation grant  application process in which the grantee must demonstrate that it has  made satisfactory progress in providing services. A grantee\u2019s continued  receipt of funds also depends on the availability of funding.", "Applications submitted to HRSA go through several stages of review. HRSA  initially screens applications for eligibility based on specific criteria\u2014the  applicant must be a public or private nonprofit entity, the applicant must be  applying for an appropriate grant (e.g., expanded medical capacity and  service expansion grants are available only to existing grantees), and the  application must include the correct documents and comply with page  limitations and format requirements.", "Eligible applications go through a review process in which independent  reviewers evaluate and score applications. The reviewers are selected by  HRSA and have expertise in a specific field relevant to the health center  program. HRSA provides reviewers with the same application guidance  that it provides to applicants, and reviewers are to use their professional  judgment in scoring applications.", "During the first stage of the review process, HRSA forwards eligible  applications to three independent reviewers, who have 3 to 4 weeks to  individually evaluate the applications. Applications for new access point  grants include a need-for-assistance worksheet, which is evaluated by the  reviewers. HRSA uses the need-for-assistance worksheet to measure  barriers to obtaining care and to measure health disparity factors in the  applicant\u2019s proposed service area. Applicants can score up to 100 points on  the worksheet, and only those applicants that receive a score of 70 or  higher on the worksheet go on to have the technical merits of their  application evaluated. The reviewers evaluate the merits of all qualified applications; they base their review on a standard set of criteria (see table  2) and give each application a preliminary score of up to 100 points. For  example, reviewers of new access point grant applications evaluate the  need for services through the criterion that describes the applicant\u2019s  service area/community and target population and assign a score from 0 to  10, which constitutes a maximum of 10 percent of the applicant\u2019s maximum  final score. Similarly, reviewers evaluate the applicant\u2019s service delivery  strategy and model and assign a score from 0 to 20, which constitutes a  maximum of 20 percent of the maximum final score.", "During the second stage of the review process, reviewers present the  strengths and weaknesses of the application to a panel of 10 to 15  reviewers. After discussing the application, each panel member scores it.  For each application, HRSA averages the scores assigned by each reviewer  in the panel. The volume of applications may result in HRSA\u2019s using  multiple review panels during a funding cycle. When this occurs, HRSA  uses a statistical method to adjust for variation in scores among different  review panels. The adjusted score becomes the final application score, and  the final scores are used to develop a rank order list of applicants.", "HRSA bases its award decisions on the rank order of scores and other  factors. Two types of factors\u2014the funding preference and awarding  factors\u2014can affect which applicants HRSA chooses for funding from the  rank order list. The funding preference is given to applicants proposing to  serve a sparsely populated rural area. To be considered for the preference,  the applicant must demonstrate that the entire area proposed to be served  by the delivery site has seven or fewer people per square mile. In addition  to scoring an application, the review panel evaluates the requested funding  amount and determines if an applicant should be considered for the  funding preference. The funding preference does not affect the score, but  may place an applicant in a more competitive position in relation to other  applicants. For example, if the panel has determined that the applicant  qualifies for the funding preference, it may receive a grant award over  higher scoring applicants that did not qualify for the preference. In fiscal  year 2004, of the five applicants that received a service expansion grant to  provide new oral health services, three were determined to qualify for the  funding preference. These three applicants\u2014with scores of 83, 86, and 90\u2014 were each awarded a grant over six applicants with application scores  above 90.", "As with the funding preference factor, the law requires HRSA to consider  awarding factors in selecting applicants to fund from the rank order list.  HRSA must consider the urban/rural distribution of awards, the  distribution of funds across types of health centers (community, homeless,  migrant, and public housing), and a health center\u2019s compliance with program requirements. In fiscal year 2004, HRSA gave priority to funding  homeless and migrant health centers and, from the new access point  applications the agency received that year, it funded only health centers  requesting homeless or migrant health center funding. HRSA officials said  the agency did this because the applications it had already approved in  fiscal year 2003 for funding in fiscal year 2004, pending funding availability,  did not include applications for homeless or migrant health center funding.  In addition to the preference and awarding factors specified in the law,  HRSA also considers the geographic distribution of awards in making  funding decisions.", "HRSA sends a Notice of Grant Award to successful applicants. The notice  includes a set of standard terms and conditions with which the grantee  must comply to receive grant funds, such as allowable uses of federal funds  and reporting requirements. In addition, the notice may include grantee- specific conditions of award. For example, common conditions placed on  new access point awards relate to the health center\u2019s being operational  within 120 days, having the appropriate governing board composition, and  hiring key staff. About 80 percent of new access point awards receive at  least one condition, according to HRSA officials.
