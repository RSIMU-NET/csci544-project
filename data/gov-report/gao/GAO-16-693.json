In particular, GAO identified several areas where OMB is not fully meeting agency priority and cross-agency priority goal public reporting requirements. OMB and PIC staff told GAO they are aware that Performance.gov is not fully GPRAMA compliant, but in moving forward, are focused on ensuring its compliance.", "According to OMB and PIC staff, limited resources have prevented them from taking actions to address the 2013 usability test and setting goals for measures. By not fully implementing Digitalgov.gov requirements and GAO's recommendations on GPRAMA requirements, Performance.gov will continue to have difficulty serving its intended purpose as a central website where users can easily locate government-wide performance information.", "OMB does not have a strategic plan for the website that will help guide staff in the future. Specifically, OMB does not have a customer outreach strategy that incorporates, as appropriate, information about how OMB intends to (1) inform users of changes on Performance.gov, (2) use social media as a method of communication, and (3) use mobile devices and applications. OMB also lacks an archiving plan to retain data and content on Performance.gov. Agency-wide strategic planning practices required under law can serve as leading practices for planning at lower levels within federal agencies, such as individual programs or initiatives. Consistent with these practices, strategic plans should contain goals and objectives, approaches, and resources. OMB staff said they had not developed a strategic plan for Performance.gov because they wanted to allow transition time for the operations and website maintenance contractor hired in August 2015. OMB staff also said that, in February 2016, they hired a Digital Services Director to develop a strategic plan and manage the website's long-term development.

We reviewed related federal  websites and found examples of clearly stated purposes on the home  page. Figure 3 compares the DATA.gov home page to that of  Performance.gov. Data.gov has a simple explanation of the site and uses  icons to depict the available topics. Performance.gov has two large  paragraphs of text explaining the benefits of establishing APGs and CAP  goals, but it does not clarify its purpose as a central, government-wide  website where users can find these APGs and CAP goals for federal  agencies.", "Performance.gov\u2019s lack of a simple and clear explanation of its purpose  could potentially confuse users. Without guidance about tasks that can be  accomplished on a website, along with explanations of the different areas  of the website and navigation assistance, website users may be unable to  successfully achieve their objectives.", "Data visualizations. The GSA usability test also reported that some  users had trouble locating graphs or data visualizations, and  understanding whether agencies had met target goals. For example, the  usability test noted that users wanted a \u201cgoal line\u201d showing target values.  In 2013, we also reported on the importance of making the information  and data on a performance-reporting website engaging and easily  understandable. Figure 4 shows how \u201cMeasures of Australia\u2019s Progress,\u201d  a website designed to show users how Australia is progressing, provides  color-coded indicators of how a performance metric is performing relative  to the goal. In contrast, Performance.gov does not have color-coded  indicators or other data visualizations that help users understand if  agencies are meeting their goals.", "Search. The 2013 GSA usability test also examined how well the home  page\u2019s search function performed. The test revealed that search terms  were not highlighted in search results and results of the search did not  necessarily match the search terms. For example, when users searched  for the \u201cNational Institutes of Health,\u201d search results returned the home  page for the National Science Foundation instead of pages directly  related to the National Institutes of Health.

Specifically, we  found that OMB had not articulated ways that intended audiences, such  as members of the public, Congress, and agency staff, could use the  website or the information available through it to accomplish other specific  tasks. For example, the website gave no indication or examples of the  ways that various audiences could use Performance.gov to facilitate  coordination or communication about goals, activities, and performance  between agencies. At that time, we recommended OMB clarify ways that  intended audiences could use the information on Performance.gov to  accomplish specific tasks and identify the design changes that would be  required to facilitate that change. OMB agreed with our recommendation  and subsequently conducted the usability test. Although the actions OMB  has taken are a step in the right direction, they do not fully address our  prior findings with regard to how people could use the website to  complete specific tasks.

We recommended that OMB, working with  the PIC, identify practices participating agencies can use to improve their  public reporting in their performance plans and reports of how they are  ensuring the quality of performance information used to measure  progress towards APGs. PIC staff took steps to address this  recommendation. In May 2016, PIC staff reported that they had  summarized the self-assessments completed by the performance  improvement officers (PIOs) and their deputies on their agency\u2019s data  quality policies and procedures. The PIC staff summary we reviewed  identified aspects of data quality in which agencies had generally rated  their performance highest, and other aspects of data quality in which  agencies had rated their performance lowest. We believe the PIC\u2019s efforts  should help PIOs examine their agency\u2019s data quality policies and  procedures, and ultimately improve data quality and the information  provided to external audiences. We also recommended that OMB,  working with the PIC, identify additional changes that are needed for its  guidance to agencies on ensuring the quality of performance information  for APGs on Performance.gov.

While they were at various stages of the process, they were  not reporting on these efforts consistently. In that report, we  recommended that OMB and the PIC report on Performance.gov the  actions that CAP goal teams are taking, or plan to take, to develop  performance measures and quarterly targets. OMB staff generally agreed  with the recommendation.

Further, we communicated with OMB and PIC staff to  determine the actions taken thus far to address our prior  recommendations in relation to APGs, CAP goals, and the federal  program inventory.", "To further address our second objective, we requested documentation on  OMB\u2019s strategic plan for Performance.gov, social media and customer  outreach strategy, and web records plan. We found the agency has not  developed these documents. We also interviewed staff from OMB, the  PIC, and GSA on the Performance.gov website\u2019s strategic plan, social  media and customer outreach strategy, web records plan, and  accessibility on mobile devices. We compared any steps taken on those  actions to Digitalgov.gov requirements.", "We reviewed the Digital Services Playbook, which outlines key successful  practices from the private sector that would help the government build  effective digital resources. The playbook provides guidance on  interacting with users through different channels. It was used to analyze  the extent to which Performance.gov is accessible on mobile devices. We  reviewed Performance.gov to determine if it was accessible on mobile  devices by visiting each main tab of the website on multiple devices. We  also identified NARA guidance on web records management. This  guidance assists agencies in how to properly manage and schedule web  records. We reviewed the Research-Based Web Design and Usability  Guidelines for guidelines about informing website users of changes to the  website. The Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines  provide guidance on a broad range of web design and communication  issues.", "We also reviewed a selection of APG pages on Performance.gov to  document whether the page had an indication of the last time it was  updated. We concentrated on evaluating the 22 agencies listed on  Performance.gov, which are mostly department level agencies. The  additional 31 agencies listed on Performance.gov do not have dedicated  pages on the website, and therefore were not evaluated as part of this  analysis. For the 22 selected agencies, we focused on the APG\u2019s for  fiscal years 2014 to 2015 because the number of APGs for fiscal years  2016 to 2017 was not yet finalized at the time of the analysis. We  randomly selected one APG from each of the 22 agency pages for  review. For each selected APG, we reviewed all of the tabs to determine  if there were any date or time stamps to indicate the last time the page  was updated. We also reviewed in more detail the Progress Update and  Indicators pages to evaluate whether users could determine through page  context when the information or data on a given page was last updated.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to August 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Lisa Pearson, Assistant Director;  Sonya Phillips, Analyst-in-Charge, supervised the development of this  report.
