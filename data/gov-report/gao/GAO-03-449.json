To collect this information, GAO surveyed newborn screening programs for genetic and metabolic disorders in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

In deciding which disorders to include, states generally consider similar criteria, such as whether the disorder is treatable. States also consider the cost of screening for additional disorders. HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration is funding an expert group to assist it in developing a recommended set of disorders for which all states should screen and criteria for selecting disorders. Most state newborn screening programs have similar practices for administering and funding their programs. Almost all states provide education on their newborn screening program for parents and providers, but fewer than one-fourth inform parents of their option to obtain tests for additional disorders not included in the state's program. State programs are primarily funded through fees collected from health care providers, who may receive payments from Medicaid and other third-party payers. Nationwide, fees funded 64 percent of states' 2001 fiscal year program expenditures of over $120 million. All newborn screening laboratories participate in a quality assurance program offered by HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which assists programs in evaluating the quality of their laboratories. All states require newborn screening, and state statutes that govern screening usually do not require parental consent. However, 33 states' newborn screening statutes or regulations allow exemptions from screening for religious reasons, and 13 additional states' newborn screening statutes or regulations allow exemptions for any reason. Newborn screening statutes and regulations in over half the states contain confidentiality provisions, but these provisions are often subject to exceptions.

The baby\u2019s heel is pricked to  obtain a few drops of blood, which are placed on a specimen collection  card and sent to a laboratory for analysis. State departments of health may  use their own laboratory to test samples from the dried blood spots or may  have a contract with a private laboratory, a laboratory at a university  medical school, or another state\u2019s public laboratory.", "Laboratories may choose among a variety of testing methods to maximize  the efficiency and effectiveness of their testing. A major technical advance  in newborn screening is use of the tandem mass spectrometer, an  analytical instrument that can precisely measure small amounts of  material and enable detection of multiple disorders from a single analysis  of a blood sample. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has greatly  increased the number of disorders that can be detected, but it cannot  completely replace other analysis methods because it cannot screen for all  disorders included in state newborn screening programs.", "After initial testing, state newborn screening program staff notify health  care providers of abnormal results because it may be necessary to verify  the accuracy of the initial screening result by testing a sample from a  second specimen or to ensure that the infant receives more extensive  diagnostic testing to confirm the presence of a disorder. The infant may  also need immediate treatment. Laboratories and state maternal and child  health programs generally carry out the notification process.", "Primary care and specialty physicians are involved in various stages of the  newborn screening process. They generally are responsible for notifying  the family of abnormal screening results and may confirm initial results  through additional testing.

HRSA offers grants to states, including the Maternal and Child  Health Services Block Grant, that state newborn screening programs may  use to support their newborn screening services. HRSA also funded the  development of the Council of Regional Networks for Genetic Services  (CORN) in 1985 to provide a forum for information exchange among  groups concerned with public health aspects of genetic services. The  newborn screening committee of CORN identified several areas of  importance to programs, including the process of selecting disorders for  screening, communication, quality assurance, and funding. It developed  guidelines in these areas to increase consistency among state newborn  screening programs and also began collecting data on state programs. In  1999, CORN was disbanded, and HRSA established the National Newborn  Screening and Genetics Resource Center\u2014the Resource Center.

Nationwide, Medicaid finances services for  one in three births each year. Through the CLIA program, CMS also  regulates laboratory testing performed on specimens obtained from  humans, including the dried blood spots used for newborn screening.  CLIA\u2019s purpose is to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of  laboratory test results. CLIA requires that laboratories comply with quality  requirements in five major areas: personnel qualifications and  responsibilities, quality control, patient test management, quality  assurance, and proficiency testing. Laboratories that fail to meet CLIA\u2019s  quality requirements are subject to sanctions, including denial of Medicaid  payments. Through the CLIA program, laboratories that test dried blood  spots in connection with newborn screening must have a process for  verifying the accuracy of their tests at least two times each year.

The task force recommended that federal and state public  health agencies, in partnership with health professionals and consumers,  develop and disseminate model state regulations to guide implementation  of state newborn screening systems, including the development of criteria  for selecting disorders. In 2001, HRSA awarded a contract to the American  College of Medical Genetics to convene an expert group to assist it in  developing a recommended set of disorders for which all states should  screen and criteria that states should consider when adding to or revising  the disorders in their newborn screening programs.

Overall, HHS said  that the report presents a thorough summary of state newborn screening  programs\u2019 current practices. (HHS\u2019s comments are reprinted in app. VI.)  HHS said that the report needed to reflect that newborn screening is a  system that, in addition to testing, includes follow-up, diagnosis, disease  management and treatment, evaluation, and education. However, the draft  report did identify the various components of the newborn screening  system. HHS said that there is a need to more comprehensively address  components of the system beyond testing. For example, HHS commented  that there is a need for a coordinated effort in states to train and educate  health professionals and state newborn screening program directors in the  use of newer technologies. In addition, it stated that there is a need to  provide information to families and parents about the screening their state  provides and the screening options available to them outside of their  state\u2019s program. HHS said that it anticipated that the report would, among  other things, include recommendations to improve state newborn  screening programs. As we noted in the draft report, HRSA has initiated a  process to develop recommendations for state newborn screening  programs. The scope of our review focused on providing the Congress  with descriptive information about state programs.", "HHS supported the development of benchmarks to help states evaluate the  quality of the various components of the newborn screening system.

For example, HHS described demonstration projects  it funded to examine the use of new technology and initiatives to improve  family and provider education. In addition, HHS indicated that all of its  programs address the recommendations of the AAP newborn screening  task force and encourage the integration of various newborn screening  and genetics services into systems of care.
