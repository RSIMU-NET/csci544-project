Postal facilities in New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere became heavily contaminated. The anthrax incidents highlighted major gaps in civilian preparedness to detect anthrax contamination in buildings. GAO was asked to describe and assess federal agencies' activities to detect anthrax in postal facilities, assess the results of agencies' testing, and assess whether agencies' detection activities were validated."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies conducted several sampling activities, including developing a sampling strategy and collecting, transporting, extracting, and analyzing samples. They primarily collected samples from specific areas, such as mail processing areas, using their judgment about where anthrax would most likely be found--that is, targeted sampling. The agencies did not use probability sampling, which would have allowed agencies to determine, with some defined level of confidence, when all results are negative, whether a building is contaminated. The results of the agencies' testing in 286 postal facilities were largely negative--no anthrax was detected. However, agencies did not use validated sample collection and analytical methods. Thus, there can be little confidence in negative results. With a validated process, agencies and the public could be reasonably confident that any test results generated by that process would be reliable. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the principal agency responsible for coordinating the federal response. Thus, in its 2005 report, GAO recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security develop a coordinated approach to improve the overall process for detecting anthrax and increase confidence in negative test results generated by that process. DHS stated that while it has overall responsibility for coordinating the federal response during future biological attacks, other agencies have the lead responsibility for validation. Therefore, uncertainty over which agency would take the lead role--that is, who is in charge--in improving the overall process for detecting anthrax, including validation of the methods, continued after GAO issued its report. On the basis of these uncertainties, GAO recommended in its May 9, 2006, testimony that DHS's approach to validating the overall process start with a strategic plan that would include a road map outlining how individual agencies' efforts would lead to the validation of the individual activities as well as the overall process, noting that such a plan would assist DHS in monitoring progress and measuring agency performance toward improving the detection of anthrax and other prioritized threat agents. While DHS generally agreed with these recommendations, it stated that it cannot ensure validation studies would be done, since \"there are legal limitations in DHS authority to direct the activities of other agencies.\" Also, since validation would require a sustained effort over a long period, DHS noted that it could not mandate commitment of other agencies' funds, over which it has no control. Until responsibility is accepted for ensuring that sampling activities will be validated, the fate of the validation process will remain uncertain. Without validation, if another anthrax attack were to occur tomorrow, federal civilian agencies would not be able to conclude with any given level of statistical confidence, in cases of negative results, that a building is free of contamination."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss our findings on anthrax  detection testing. The threat of bioterrorism has been recognized for a  considerable time. Long before the anthrax attacks of 2001, several hoax  letters indicating the presence of anthrax had been mailed to federal and  state agencies, as well as to private sector organizations. These events  raised the possibility that facilities could become contaminated and would  therefore have to be evaluated for environmental contamination. However,  federal agencies were not fully prepared to deal with environmental  contamination\u2014that is, anthrax released through the mail\u2014including the  potential for multiple dispersals in indoor environments.", "In September and October 2001, contaminated letters laced with Bacillus  anthracis were sent through the mail to two U.S. senators, Thomas  Daschle and Patrick Leahy, and members of the media. The postal  facilities in New Jersey and Washington, D.C., that processed the senators\u2019  letters became heavily contaminated. Other mail routed through these  facilities, as well as additional facilities in the postal network, also became  contaminated. In addition, numerous federal facilities in the Washington,  D.C., area were later found to be contaminated. The letters led to the first  cases of anthrax disease related to bioterrorism in the United States. In all,  22 individuals contracted anthrax disease in four states\u2014Connecticut,  Florida, New Jersey, and New York\u2014as well as in Washington, D.C. Five  of these 22 individuals died.", "The anthrax incidents in September and October 2001 highlighted major  gaps in civilian preparedness to detect and respond. In today\u2019s testimony,   I will discuss our findings concerning anthrax sampling activities,  recommendations we made, and a major issue we identified\u2014the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cannot ensure and guarantee  that sampling activities will be validated.", "In developing this testimony, we relied on our prior work. We conducted  our review in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In October 2001, an American Media Incorporated employee died from  inhalation anthrax disease. In the same month, contaminated letters laced  with Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax spores, were sent through the mail to  Senators Thomas Daschle and Patrick Leahy. The response to the incident  in the American Media Incorporated building in Florida in September 2001  led to the identification of mail as the potential source of contamination;  eventually, it led to the sampling of the postal facilities. The agencies  began sampling on October 12, 2001, in Florida and stopped on April 21,  2002, when the Wallingford, Connecticut, facility was sampled for the last  time. The letters led to the first cases of anthrax disease related to  bioterrorism in the United States. In all, 22 individuals contracted anthrax  disease in Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, and New York, as well as in  Washington, D.C., and 5 died.", "The federal agencies involved in the response in the postal facilities have  different responsibilities. CDC and state and local health departments  primarily provided public health advice and assistance to USPS. CDC has  primary responsibility for national surveillance of specific diseases,  including anthrax; it also conducts epidemiologic investigations to  determine, among other things, the source of the disease, and it  participates in environmental sample collection and analysis activities.  The FBI is responsible for criminal investigations involving interstate  commerce and the mail and crimes committed on federal property. EPA is  the nation\u2019s lead agency for responding to a release of hazardous  substances into the environment and subsequent decontamination.", "On October 8, 2001, the President created the Office of Homeland Security  to develop and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy for dealing  with domestic terrorist threats or attacks. The office, which had limited  involvement in the 2001 response, was superseded by the Homeland  Security Act of 2002, which transferred many of its functions to DHS,  which became operational in 2003. DHS was created by combining many  previously separate agencies and is assigned a lead role in coordinating  the efforts of federal agencies that respond to acts of terrorism in the  United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Findings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sampling Strategy", "paragraphs": ["The federal agencies primarily used a targeted strategy\u2014they collected  samples from specific areas considered more likely to be contaminated,  based on judgments. Such judgments can be effective in some situations\u2014 for example, in determining whether a facility is contaminated when  information on the source of potential contamination is definitive.", "However, in the case of a negative finding, when the source of potential  contamination is not definitive, the basic question\u2014Is this building  contaminated?\u2014will remain unanswered.", "CDC and USPS officials said that they used a targeted strategy for several  reasons, including limitations on how many samples could be collected  and analyzed. They also said that in 2001, they lacked the data from  empirical research to develop an initial sampling strategy that  incorporated probability sampling. We disagree with this interpretation.  Probability sampling is statistically based and does not depend solely on  empirical criteria regarding the details of possible contamination.", "The situation in 2001 was unique, and the agencies were not fully prepared  to deal with environmental contamination. In the future, if the agencies  decide to use a targeted rather than a probability sampling strategy, they  must recognize that they could lose a number of days if their targeted  sampling produces negative test results. In this case, additional samples  would have to be collected and analyzed, resulting in the loss of critical  time for public health interventions. This was so at the Wallingford postal  facility in the fall of 2001, when about 3 weeks elapsed between the time  the first sampling took place and the results of the fourth testing, which  revealed positive results. Furthermore, about 5 months elapsed between  the time of the first sampling event and the time anthrax was found in the  Wallingford facility\u2019s high-bay area.", "Therefore, strategies that include probability sampling need to be  developed in order to provide statistical confidence in negative results.  Further, even if information on all the performance characteristics of  methods is not yet available, a probability sampling strategy could be  developed from assumptions about the efficiency of some of the methods.  And even if precise data are not available, a conservative, approximate  number could be used for developing a sampling strategy. This would give  agencies and the public greater confidence in negative test results than  was associated with the sampling strategy used in 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sampling Methods", "paragraphs": ["CDC, EPA, and USPS, the federal agencies involved in sampling the postal  facilities in 2001 to detect anthrax, undertook several activities. These  included development of a sampling strategy followed by collecting  samples, using a variety of methods, and transporting, extracting, and  analyzing the samples. Neither these activities nor the overall process was  validated for anthrax testing. Consequently, the agencies were challenged  by limited information for reliably choosing one method over another and  by lack of information on the detection limit to use when evaluating  negative results.", "Federal agencies used different methods for collecting samples. While  USPS generally used dry swabs to collect samples (the least effective  method), CDC and EPA used multiple methods\u2014dry swabs, premoistened  swabs, wet wipes, and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuum\u2014 in various combinations or alone.", "However, none of the agencies\u2019 collection methods were evaluated for  anthrax detection in environmental samples. In the absence of empirical  research, agencies had no information available for reliably choosing one  method over another and no information on the limits of detection to use  when evaluating negative results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of Testing", "paragraphs": ["The majority of the samples collected from the postal facilities tested  negative. In all, federal agencies collected about 10,000 samples during  initial testing. It is interesting that of the 9,807 samples that the agencies  collected, more than 98 percent, or 9,648, were negative; a little more than  1 percent, or 159, were positive. In all, 286 facilities were tested for  anthrax contamination. Of these, Brentwood, Trenton, and Morgan were  primary facilities; that is, these 3 facilities processed the original letters  containing the anthrax.", "The results of the CDC, EPA, and USPS testing in 286 postal facilities were  largely negative. Of 286 facilities, 23 tested positive. For 2 of these   23 facilities, test results were negative at first but positive on a subsequent  testing. However, in 1 of these facilities\u2014the Wallingford, Connecticut,  facility\u2014it was not until the fourth testing that positive results were  obtained.", "Testing results differed between the primary facilities and Wallingford. In  the 3 primary facilities, results were positive each time a facility was  tested, with the important exception of the two quick tests in Brentwood.  In Wallingford, considered less likely to be contaminated, results were  positive only on the fourth sampling. These results underscore the  importance of retesting and cast doubt on the efficiency of the judgmental  sampling strategy.", "Of the 263 facilities that tested negative, only 9 were sampled more than  once. A facility in West Trenton tested negative, even though an employee  had contracted cutaneous anthrax. The facility in West Trenton was tested  twice by the FBI and once by CDC, during which a total of 57 samples  were collected, with negative results.", "Final, or confirmed, results will be negative if contamination is not present  in a facility. However, a result can be erroneously negative for several  other reasons, such as (1) the sampling method was not efficient enough,  (2) samples were not collected from places where contamination was  present, (3) not enough samples were collected, (4) not enough spores  were recovered from the sample material, or (5) analysis of the sample  extract was not sensitive enough to detect anthrax spores that were  present."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The agencies that sampled postal facilities in 2001\u2014USPS, CDC, and  EPA\u2014did not use validated sample collection and analysis methods to  perform their tests. According to these agencies, validated methods were  not available at that time. They conducted several interdependent  activities, including sample strategy development, followed by sample  collection, transportation, and analysis of the samples to detect anthrax.  Neither these activities nor the overall process had been validated for  anthrax testing.", "Validation is a formal, empirical process in which an authority determines  and certifies the performance characteristics of a given method.  Therefore, investments are also needed to validate these methods, as well  as the overall anthrax detection process. Validating the overall process, as  well as the individual activities, is important because operational and  health-related decisions are made on the basis of testing results that the  process generates.", "CDC and USPS officials said that they used targeted sampling; that is, they  collected samples from specific areas considered\u2014based on agencies\u2019  technical judgments\u2014more likely to be contaminated. Such judgments can  be effective in some situations, for example, in determining the source of  contamination in a disease outbreak investigation, provided results are  positive. However, if the results are negative, the basic question\u2014Is this  building contaminated?\u2014cannot be answered with statistical confidence.", "When the level of contamination is extremely high and dispersed in a  facility, the method of sampling (for example, wipes versus swabs) is not  as critical if the purpose is to find some contaminant. However, at lower  levels, a way of interpreting the significance of negative results is needed,  and this requirement emphasizes the importance of validation of the  methods and the need for statistically based sampling strategies. This  emphasizes the need for methods that have been validated, and sampling  strategies that are likely to find contamination at low levels. Probability- based sampling does allow conclusions, at specific levels of confidence,  about testing results.", "Using a probability-based sampling strategy, together with validated  methods for detecting contamination, would provide a known level of  confidence with which to interpret any negative results. This would allow  agencies to be more definitive in determining necessary actions. Figure 1  shows how lack of validation could affect individual activities\u2014including  the sampling strategy\u2014as well as the results generated by the overall  process.", "The lack of validated methods for assessing contamination in postal  facilities impeded the agencies in responding to the incidents. The  significance of the lack of validated methods was exemplified in the case  of the one postal facility where negative preliminary results were obtained  by field-based methods of analysis, with limitations that appear not to have  been well understood by some agencies. Negative results do not  necessarily mean a facility is free from contamination. As we reported,  results can be negative if (1) samples were not collected from places  where anthrax was present, (2) the detection limit of the method was  greater than the actual contamination level, (3) not enough samples were  recovered from the sample material, (4) analysis of the sample extract did  not detect spores, or (5) anthrax was not present in the facility.", "In addition, while the 2001 events involved anthrax, many other biothreat  agents exist. Differences in their characteristics mean different solutions.  Accordingly, efforts to develop sampling strategies and to validate  methods should address requirements specific to those threat agents as  well. However, since addressing other agents would consume resources  and time, all these efforts should be prioritized in a long-term strategy.", "The several agencies that dealt with the anthrax attacks generally worked  well together, but we have identified areas that would have benefited from  one agency\u2019s taking the lead in coordinating the response. Given the  mission of DHS and its responsibilities, it appears that DHS is now well  positioned to take a lead role in promoting and coordinating the activities  of the various agencies that have technical expertise related to  environmental testing.
