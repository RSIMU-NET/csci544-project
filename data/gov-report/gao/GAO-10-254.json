The service components rely on their recruiters to act with the utmost integrity because even a single incident of wrongdoing on the part of a recruiter--a recruiter irregularity--can adversely affect the service components' ability to recruit qualified individuals. GAO was asked to (1) analyze data on reported cases of recruiter irregularities across the service components, (2) review the extent to which the service components have guidance and procedures to address recruiter irregularities, and (3) review the extent to which the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has oversight over recruiter irregularities. GAO analyzed the data on recruiter irregularities reported to OSD by the service components; reviewed the service components' recruiter irregularity case files; examined relevant guidance and procedures from the service components; and interviewed service components' recruiting command personnel, recruiters, and OSD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2006 through 2008, the total number of substantiated cases of recruiter irregularities across the service components represented a small percentage of overall accessions (i.e., number of individuals entering military service), and the service components have taken various actions against the recruiters responsible for these irregularities. Specifically, the number of substantiated cases of recruiter irregularities as a percentage of overall accessions was 0.26 percent in fiscal year 2006, 0.22 percent in fiscal year 2007, and 0.18 percent in fiscal year 2008. The most common types of recruiter irregularity reported involved concealment or falsification of documents or information, sexual misconduct, and quality control measures (e.g., valid parental signatures). The action most commonly applied against recruiters who committed irregularities varied by service component. Removal from recruiting was the most commonly applied action in the Marine Corps while adverse administrative action (e.g., a letter of reprimand in the recruiter's personnel file) was most commonly applied in the Army. All service components have guidance and procedures on addressing recruiter irregularities and have improved oversight over them, but the manner in which data on recruiter irregularities are shared within the service components varied. Although some differences exist, the service components are similar in how they identify, investigate, and adjudicate recruiter irregularities. In addition, the service components have taken steps to identify and prevent recruiter irregularities, including establishing quality control checks to help identify recruiter irregularities and providing training for recruiters to help prevent recruiter irregularities. However, in most service components, not all levels of command have regular access to information on recruiter irregularities that occur. Without regular access to information, commanders may not be able to take full advantage of servicewide recruiter irregularity data and opportunities to learn from their peers. Although OSD has implemented requirements for the service components to regularly report on recruiter irregularities, it does not have complete oversight over the recruiter irregularities that occur. In December 2006, OSD issued a memorandum for the service components on tracking and reporting recruiter irregularities, and the service components have been providing recruiter irregularity data to OSD. However, because some of the reporting requirements lack clarity, the service components do not interpret the reporting requirements in the same way. Further, the data provided to OSD by the National Guard are incomplete and the relevant offices within the National Guard Bureau do not provide appropriate caveats regarding these data, such as including information on the States and Territories that did not submit recruiter irregularity data. Unless OSD clarifies the reporting requirements in its memorandum and directs the service components to provide transparency in the data they report, it will be unable to maintain complete oversight over the extent to which recruiter irregularities are occurring and make determinations on whether corrective action is needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To sustain a viable all-volunteer military force, the Department of Defense  (DOD) depends on recruiting several hundred thousand qualified  individuals into the military each year. Although DOD\u2019s service  components have generally met their recruiting goals in recent years, the  recruiting environment continues to present challenges, partly due to the  length, frequency, and difficult nature of deployments expected of  servicemembers. While the present economic downturn has increased the  number of individuals expressing an interest in military service, DOD  estimates that only 3 out of 10 American youth ages 17 to 24 are qualified  to join the military. If economic conditions improve, it may become more  difficult for the military to find qualified recruits to carry out its  challenging mission.", "The service components have assigned 30,000 recruiting personnel to  carry out DOD\u2019s goal of recruiting high-quality individuals into the military.  Recruiters serve as the military\u2019s representatives in communities  throughout the United States, and the service components rely on them to  act with the utmost integrity in order to win and maintain the public\u2019s  trust. DOD recognizes that even a single incident of wrongdoing on the  part of a recruiter can erode public confidence in the recruiting process  and damage a service component\u2019s reputation.  To prevent such incidents  from occurring, the service components\u2019 recruiting commands have  developed guidance that governs recruiter irregularities, and instituted  procedures for (1) reporting allegations of recruiter irregularities and (2)  conducting an investigation to determine whether a case is substantiated  or unsubstantiated. Substantiated cases of recruiter wrongdoing are those  cases in which the service components determine that a recruiter violated  recruiting guidance based on a review of the facts in the case.", "Oversight of the service components\u2019 recruiting programs is the  responsibility of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.  That office is  responsible for policy development, planning, resource management, and  program evaluation specific to the readiness of the force, including those  affecting the recruiting force.  In establishing oversight over recruiter  irregularities, OSD issued a directive-type memorandum defining recruiter  irregularities as those willful and unwillful acts of omission and  improprieties that are perpetrated or alleged to be perpetrated by a  recruiter to facilitate the recruiting process for an applicant.  Recruiter  irregularities encompass a range of actions including, for example,  administrative paperwork errors, instructing applicants not to reveal  certain disqualifying conditions, and criminal misconduct.", "In 2006, we reported that substantiated cases of recruiter irregularities  were low relative to overall accessions (i.e., the number of individuals  entering military service)\u2014less than 1 percent. However, we found at that  time that the service components and OSD were not able to determine the  full extent to which recruiter irregularities were occurring within their  command structures, thus preventing them from fully addressing the  problem. For example, we determined that none of the service  components could provide a comprehensive and accurate report on  recruiter irregularities within its own organization because the service  components used multiple data systems that were not integrated and  maintained the data in different formats; lacked standardized procedures  for recording the data; and did not account for all allegations of recruiter  irregularities. As a result, we recommended that OSD establish an  oversight framework to assess recruiter irregularities to include  developing criteria and common definitions across the services for  maintaining recruiter irregularity data, implementing a reporting  requirement across the services, directing the services to develop internal  systems and processes that better capture and integrate data on recruiter  irregularities, and directing the commander of DOD\u2019s Military Entrance  Processing Command (MEPCOM) to track and report allegations and  service-identified incidents of recruiter irregularities to OSD. In providing  comments on our report, OSD agreed to establish a standardized  framework allowing for a fair and accurate assessment of recruiter  irregularities across the services, including establishing the criteria and  common definitions for maintaining data on recruiter irregularities, and  for the services to develop internal processes that better capture and  integrate these data. OSD partially concurred with the recommendation to  establish a reporting requirement across the services, but disagreed with  the recommendation for MEPCOM to track and report allegations and  incidents of recruiter irregularities to OSD because it said such a  requirement would duplicate the reporting performed by the service  components. Following our report, OSD issued the memorandum in  December 2006 setting the definitions of recruiter irregularities and the  requirements for the service components to track and report on all cases  of recruiter irregularities.", "In this context, you asked us to examine the service components\u2019 policies  and procedures for addressing recruiter irregularities and OSD\u2019s oversight  framework for assessing recruiter irregularities. This report addresses the  following questions:   1.  What have the data shown on the incidence and types of reported  cases of recruiter irregularities across the service components and  what actions have the service components taken in substantiated cases  of recruiter irregularities?   2.  To what extent have the service components developed guidance and  procedures to address recruiter irregularities, what progress have they  made in increasing their oversight over recruiter irregularities, and to  what extent is information on recruiter irregularities shared within the  service components?    3.  To what extent does OSD have oversight over recruiter irregularities  that occur across the service components?", "In conducting this review, we focused our scope on recruiter irregularities  that affect the active, reserve, and National Guard components of DOD\u2019s  military services that occurred from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year  2008. To provide information on the number and type of recruiter  irregularities, we analyzed recruiter irregularity data that OSD received  from the service components for that period. However, due to possible  reporting errors in the 2006 data resulting from the new reporting  requirement on recruiter irregularities issued by OSD in December 2006,  we were unable to present trends in recruiter irregularities.  Additionally,  we did not include fiscal year 2009 data in our analysis of recruiter  irregularities across the service components because the data covering the  full fiscal year 2009 will not be reported to OSD by the service components  in time to be included in our analysis. Although we found recruiter  irregularity data for the active and reserve components to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report, we could not present the data on  recruiter irregularities reported by the National Guard because States and  Territories do not report their data consistently and the different systems  used by States and Territories for maintaining and reporting these data  lead to data reliability issues.  As part of our first objective, we also  requested and reviewed case files from each of the active and reserve  components for all substantiated cases of recruiter irregularities that  occurred in fiscal year 2008 to provide illustrative examples of the types of  recruiter irregularities that occur and the actions taken by the service  components against recruiters responsible for committing recruiter  irregularities.  However, because the National Guard Bureau does not  maintain centralized data on cases of recruiter irregularities, we selected  and obtained case files from all seven States (Alabama, California, Indiana,  Minnesota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) that reported more  than four substantiated recruiter irregularities in fiscal year 2008. To  assess the extent to which the service components\u2019 have guidance and  procedures in place to address recruiter irregularities, we obtained and  reviewed the service components\u2019 written guidance related to the  enlistment process and recruiter conduct. To determine the extent to  which OSD has oversight over recruiter irregularities, we interviewed  officials from OSD and MEPCOM. We supplemented our work for all three  objectives with site visits to the service components\u2019 recruiting commands  to interview recruiting command officials, staff from military entrance  processing stations (MEPS), and recruiters.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2009 through January  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. More information on our  scope and methodology is available in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense,  it is the responsibility of the services to recruit and train their forces. The  service components depend on military recruiters to meet their annual  recruiting missions. In fiscal year 2009, the service components utilized  30,936 military recruiters. Of those, 26,381 were frontline recruiters  assigned a monthly recruiting goal. The remaining recruiters held  supervisory and staff positions throughout the services\u2019 recruiting  commands. (See table 1 for the number of recruiters for fiscal year 2006  through fiscal year 2009.)", "Each of the military services has its own recruiting command, which is  responsible for the service\u2019s recruiting mission and functions.  The role  of the recruiting command is to provide support to the recruiting force and  guidance for the recruitment and enlistment process. In addition, the  recruiting command plays a role in developing the recruiting goals.  The  commands are structured similarly across the services with some variation  in organizational structure, as noted in figure 1.  The recruiting command  is the recruiting headquarters for each service, with subordinate  commands between the headquarters level and recruiting stations or  substations where frontline recruiters work to reach out to prospective  applicants and communicate to them the benefits of joining the military.", "Since 2006, most of the service components have been able to achieve  their recruiting goals, and all service components met their recruiting  goals in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. (See table 2 for accession goals and  achievements from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2009.)  Service  component officials and recruiters alike have attributed the high rate of  recruiting success to the conditions of the economy and the services\u2019  competitive advantage over the civilian job market, particularly given the  rising unemployment rate. DOD found that more youth are willing to  consider military service during periods of high unemployment.   Recruiters reported, however, that while they have seen an increase in the  number of individuals interested in military service, many of them do not  meet the military\u2019s qualification requirements.  DOD estimated that  approximately 7 out of 10 youth ages 17 to 24 do not meet the military\u2019s  entrance standards for reasons including medical conditions, prior  criminal records, and existence of young dependents.", "Even in this favorable recruiting environment, irregularities can occur and  checks have been built into the enlistment process that may help minimize  recruiter irregularities.  These checks begin with the initial prescreening of  the applicant conducted by the recruiter and involve a background review,  an initial determination of physical eligibility, and a review of education  credentials. After the initial prescreening, the military pays the applicant to  travel to 1 of the 65 military entrance processing stations (MEPS) located  throughout the country. Each MEPS station is staffed with military and  civilian personnel, including liaisons representing each service component  and MEPS staff who are responsible for quality control checks that are  designed to prevent anyone not qualified for their service component from  entering. Upon arrival at the MEPS, applicants meet with their service  component\u2019s liaison who reviews their qualifications. Applicants are also  administered the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)  that determines the applicant\u2019s qualifications for enlistment and for a  specific military job.  In addition, a MEPS doctor conducts a medical  examination to determine whether the applicant meets the physical  entrance standards.  When the applicant has met the qualifications for  military enlistment, the applicant signs an enlistment contract and is  sworn into the service before entering into the delayed entry program. In  this program, applicants become members of the Individual Ready Reserve  in an unpaid status until they receive orders to report for basic training.  Prior to shipping to basic training, the applicant must return to the MEPS  to undergo a brief physical examination that ascertains that the applicant  continues to meet the physical fitness standards for entering the military.   Upon successful completion of this final exam, the applicant is sworn into  the military and shipped to basic training.

For example, of the cases of recruiter  irregularities reported in the Army during fiscal year 2008, 15 percent were  found to be substantiated by commanders based on a review of the facts  of an investigation; during the same period, 71 percent of the Air Force\u2019s  reported cases were substantiated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concealment or Falsification of Documents or Information Was the Most Commonly Reported Irregularity", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2008, recruiter irregularities  involving concealment or falsification, such as when a recruiter omitted  information concerning prior criminal violations in an applicant\u2019s  application packet, constituted the most commonly reported type of  recruiter irregularity by all service components except the Air Force  Reserve.  For the Air Force Reserve, quality control measures, such as a  recruiter failing to obtain parental signatures on an applicant\u2019s application  form, were the most common type of recruiter irregularity reported.  The  second most commonly reported type of recruiter irregularity varied  among the service components. For example, in fiscal year 2008, it  involved quality control measures in the Army, while during the same  fiscal year, it involved sexual misconduct in the Marine Corps.

Our  review of the service components\u2019 case files of recruiter irregularities  reported in fiscal year 2008 identified examples illustrating each of OSD\u2019s  reporting categories.  As can be seen in table 8, the service components  sometimes take different actions against recruiters who committed similar  types of recruiter irregularities. For instance, an Air Force recruiter was  court-martialed for fraternizing with an applicant, while a Navy recruiter  received an Article 15 Non-Judicial Punishment for a similar type of  offense. (Additional examples can be found in appendix III.)", "For all service components, the determination of the action to apply in  cases of recruiter irregularities is vested with the recruiting unit, and the  commanders of the responsible recruiting units take a variety of factors  into consideration when deciding on the actions to take against recruiters  who commit irregularities.   Several service component officials we  interviewed reported that these commanders generally decide on the  appropriate action to take against a recruiter on a case-by-case basis. For  example, a Marine Corps Recruiting Command official told us that the  commanders who are ultimately responsible for taking action against a  recruiter can take into account how a particular action will affect a  recruiter\u2019s family before deciding upon the appropriate level of action.  This can lead to different actions taken in cases that fall into similar  recruiter irregularity categories.  While the Army National Guard States  and Territories follow states\u2019 and territories\u2019 laws and guidance that  govern how actions are applied, our review of selected recruiter  irregularity case files from the Army National Guard also showed that the  actions taken against recruiters who committed irregularities varied  among States. For example, we found that different actions were taken  against the recruiters from different States who engaged in irregularities  falling into the sexual misconduct category, ranging from non-adverse  administrative action to removal from service. A recruiter in one State who  admitted to a sexual relationship with an applicant received non-adverse  administrative action, which included counseling, a 12-month suspended  reduction in rank, and a 12-month suspension from favorable personnel  actions, such as the ability to be promoted, be reassigned, or receive  awards or bonuses.  However, a recruiter in another State who provided  alcohol to and engaged in a sexual relationship with an applicant was  removed from service.", "In the view of the recruiting command officials and recruiters with whom  we spoke, the actions taken against recruiters who committed  irregularities have generally been fair and sufficiently strict to act as  deterrents against future recruiter irregularities. Further, they said that the  ongoing training that recruiters receive includes examples of the actions  taken against other recruiters who committed irregularities, thereby  reinforcing the seriousness of committing a recruiter irregularity. For  example, an Air Force recruiter told us that he realizes that he stands to  receive strict punishment, such as a reduction in rank or removal from the  Air Force, if he commits a recruiter irregularity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Service Components Have Developed Guidance and Procedures to Address Recruiter Irregularities, but Not All Service Components Share Recruiter Irregularity Data throughout All Levels of Command", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Service Components Have Developed Guidance to Address Recruiter Irregularities", "paragraphs": ["All of the service components have developed guidance on recruiter  irregularities and have instituted procedures for reporting allegations of  recruiter irregularities, conducting an investigation, and adjudicating  cases.

For example, the U.S. Army Recruiting Command  developed a regulation that specifically focuses on recruiter  irregularities\u2014Regulation 601-45, Recruiting Improprieties Policies and  Procedures\u2014which covers the definitions of recruiter irregularities, the  process of reporting irregularities up the chain of command, and the  investigation and adjudication of recruiter irregularity cases.  Other  service components, such as the Marine Corps, address recruiter  irregularities within their existing framework of recruiting guidance. For  example, the Marine Corps uses Marine Corps Order 1130.65A, Total Force  Recruiting Quality Control, which covers recruiting in general, but  includes provisions that apply to the reporting of recruiter irregularities  and the actions that should be taken against recruiters who commit  irregularities.", "The Army National Guard Strength Maintenance Division and the Air  National Guard Recruiting and Retention Service within the National  Guard Bureau have also issued guidance providing the Army and Air  National Guards of the 54 States and Territories with a broad framework  for addressing recruiter irregularities.  This guidance supplements laws  and guidance that the Army National Guard and Air National Guard from  each State and Territory follow. However, the implementation of National  Guard Bureau guidance is at the discretion of the individual States and  Territories. State National Guard recruiters typically operate under Title 32  of the U.S. Code through which they are federally funded but under state  control. Therefore, State National Guard recruiters are subject to state  laws and guidance unlike active duty recruiters operating under Title 10 of  the U.S. Code who are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and  service component guidance in the event they commit a recruiter  irregularity. The Secretary of Defense issued a model code of military  justice to recommend to the states for use with respect to the National  Guard when not in federal service. According to an official within the  Office of the Chief Counsel within the National Guard Bureau, many states  have partially adopted this model military code while others have not  adopted it at all.", "The service components have similar procedures for identifying,  investigating, and adjudicating recruiter irregularities. As figure 3 shows,  recruiter irregularity allegations can be brought to light through a variety  of sources, such as complaints submitted through congressional  representatives, service component hotlines, and recruiting staff reporting  on the suspicious behavior of a fellow recruiter. Once an allegation is  brought to the attention of the service component, all service components  follow several steps, including the appointment of the investigating officer,  the investigation process, and the review of the report produced by the  investigating officer. The investigation report and the recommendations  therein are used by the appropriate unit commander to determine whether  the allegation can be substantiated.  When it is determined that an  allegation is substantiated, the commander also determines the  appropriate action and provides the recruiter with the opportunity to  present additional information and appeal the decision. The service  components\u2019 recruiting command headquarters are notified of all final  decisions in recruiter irregularity cases.", "Although the procedures for investigating and adjudicating cases of  recruiter irregularities are generally similar across the service  components, some differences exist. For example, the Army and the Air  Force require that all recruiter irregularity investigations undergo a legal  review\u2014a review of the investigation report findings by the service  component\u2019s Judge Advocate\u2019s office\u2014while the Navy, Marine Corps, and  Air Force Reserve do not have such a requirement.", "Service component officials we interviewed generally agreed that the  existing service component guidance on recruiter irregularities is  sufficient and informs those involved on how to handle recruiter  irregularities that come to light.

The service components use the following  mechanisms to ensure that recruiters are abiding by recruiting standards  and verify the accuracy of information in applicant packets:    Hotline.  Most service components make telephone numbers available  to applicants and parents for reporting any suspected cases of recruiter  irregularities by posting a notice in recruiting stations with a hotline  listed or providing a card to applicants with the service component\u2019s  hotline number listed. For example, Navy recruiters provide applicants  with hotline cards that list recruiter and applicant rights, activities that  recruiters are prohibited from doing, and a hotline number that  applicants can call to report any alleged recruiter irregularities to the  Navy Recruiting Command Inspector General\u2019s office.", "Periodic inspections. All of the service components conduct periodic  inspections and command visits to recruiting stations. For example, the  Marine Corps Recruiting Command\u2019s inspection program includes  monthly visits and annual inspections by recruiting station  commanders of the recruiting substations for which they are  responsible. While these inspections do not focus specifically on  identifying recruiter irregularities, recruiting command officials told us  that some recruiter irregularities are identified in the course of the  inspections process.", "Opportunities to reveal irregularities. All of the service  components provide recruits with an opportunity to disclose any  information about themselves that could disqualify them from  enlistment, such as medical issues or criminal history, and also allow  applicants to bring up any inappropriate behavior displayed by their  recruiter, such as a recruiter telling an applicant to conceal a medical  problem in order to facilitate the enlistment process. Officials we  interviewed generally agreed that such opportunities for disclosure,  commonly known as a \u201cmoment of truth,\u201d provide a powerful tool for  identifying recruiter irregularities.", "All of the service components have programs in place to help prevent  recruiter irregularities, including recruiter screening programs and  recruiter training. In addition, the Army and Army National Guard have  established policies requiring more than one person to be present when a  recruiter interacts with an applicant of the opposite gender.", "Screening programs. All service components have recruiter screening  programs to screen their recruiter candidates. For example, the Air  Force Recruiting Service\u2019s screening program includes face-to-face  interviews with recruiter candidates, reviews of the candidates\u2019 history  of meeting physical standards, reviews of performance reports from  the previous 3 years, and a credit check.  Recruiting command officials  acknowledged that recruiting is a stressful job and said that the  rigorous screening of individuals interested in becoming recruiters  helps ensure that only those individuals who are most qualified; are  sufficiently motivated; have a high level of integrity; and are not  burdened by additional external stressors, such as financial debt or  ongoing divorce proceedings, are selected to receive training at the  recruiter schools. Recruiting command officials also stated that these  programs help screen out individuals who may be more susceptible to  committing recruiter irregularities.", "Recruiter training.  Once individuals are selected to become  recruiters, they are required to attend the service component\u2019s or the  National Guard\u2019s recruiter school, as appropriate, for initial recruiter  training. The service components\u2019 recruiting school officials and  recruiters interviewed said that topics on ethical behavior, prohibited  practices, fraternization, and sexual harassment are covered during the  initial training. Additionally, they said that instructors share examples  of actual recruiter irregularities with the new recruiters in order to  inform them of situations to avoid. After graduating from the service  component\u2019s recruiter school, recruiters receive ongoing training,  covering topics such as sexual harassment and the reporting of  suspected recruiter irregularities. For example, the Marine Corps  Recruiting Command developed a new course that all recruiters are  required to take annually, covering ethical and unethical behavior and  case studies of actual recruiter irregularity cases.  Officials stated that  the course, once implemented, will help recruiters identify situations  that can lead to recruiter irregularities and ways they can avoid those  situations.

Because these systems were  not integrated, the service components did not have oversight over all  recruiter irregularities. Since then, the service components have made  progress in establishing systems that have allowed for more consistent  tracking and reporting of the recruiter irregularity data. We found that  local recruiting units responsible for gathering and tracking recruiter  irregularity data have systems and processes in place for passing the data  up the chain of command to the service components\u2019 recruiting command  headquarters on a regular basis.

For example, the Navy is  in the process of procuring a new data system that will allow for functions  such as trend analysis and advanced querying of recruiter irregularity data.  In addition, the Air Force Reserve has recently updated its instruction to  require recruiting personnel to report all actual or suspected recruiter  irregularities to their senior recruiter and to inform the Air Force Reserve  Command Recruiting Service Inspector General of all allegations.", "While all service components regularly provide recruiter irregularity data  to the recruiting command headquarters, with the exception of the Air  Force, they do not regularly make recruiter irregularity data available to  all levels of command. This is because most of the service components do  not have procedures in place to disseminate recruiter irregularity data to  the commanders at levels below the recruiting headquarters. In contrast,  the Air Force Recruiting Service shares recruiter irregularity data with  leadership at all levels of command within the Air Force Recruiting  Service and all recruiting staff through monthly and quarterly reports and  newsletters. These reports contain information on the circumstances of  the recruiter irregularity committed and the actions taken against the  recruiter. Air Force officials we interviewed explained that making this  information available to personnel at all levels within the Air Force  Recruiting Service provides commanders with examples of how others are  addressing recruiter irregularities, promotes consistent application of  actions in substantiated cases of recruiter irregularities across the Air  Force, and serves as a deterrent to committing recruiter irregularities. Air  Force recruiters we interviewed also generally agreed that the recruiter  irregularity reports shared by the recruiting command have a strong  deterring effect because everyone knows what will happen if they commit  an irregularity.", "In order to make improvements and promote knowledge sharing, leaders  at all levels of an organization need to receive information on a regular  basis about the problems that may be occurring across the organization.  Although the other service components have some efforts in place to  communicate and share limited information on recruiter irregularities that  occur within their service component, information on the range of  recruiter irregularities occurring is not included or consistently shared  with all levels within the recruiting command. For example, according to  recruiting command officials, the U.S. Army Recruiting Command holds a  quarterly meeting for headquarters officials, including the Commanding  General and representatives from the Staff Judge Advocate\u2019s office, the  Recruiting Standards Division, and the Inspector General\u2019s office to review  and discuss trends in recruiter irregularities across the recruiting  command and determine if there is a need for additional training or  changes in policies to address any issues found. We also found that all  service components, at a minimum, occasionally share examples of  serious recruiter irregularities that have occurred or have been showcased  by the media as part of the continuous training provided to recruiters on  recruiter irregularity issues. However, without processes that allow for the  regular flow of recruiter irregularity data from the headquarters to all  command levels, commanders may not be able to take full advantage of  servicewide recruiter irregularity data that would enable them to improve  their operations.  Further, commanders may not be able to seize  opportunities to learn from their peers about shared experiences on  handling recruiter irregularities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSD Implemented Recruiter Irregularity Reporting Requirements, but Lacks Complete Oversight over Irregularities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OSD Has Implemented Recruiter Irregularity Reporting Requirements, Sponsored Research, and Provided Information- Sharing Opportunities on Recruiter Irregularity Issues", "paragraphs": ["In December 2006, OSD issued the memorandum regarding the tracking  and reporting of recruiter irregularities by the service components.  The  issuance of the memorandum constituted OSD\u2019s response to our 2006  recommendation for OSD to establish an oversight framework to assess  recruiter irregularities, including criteria and common definitions across  the service components.  Such oversight is needed for OSD to have the  tools for assessing and evaluating recruiting programs to assure itself that  program objectives are being met\u2014consistent with good management  practices outlined in federal internal control standards. The  memorandum defined recruiter irregularities, established specific  categories for classifying irregularities and dispositions, and included a  reporting template for the service components to use when providing  recruiter irregularity data to OSD on a semiannual basis\u2014in January and  July of each year. OSD involved the service components in the  development of the memorandum by convening a meeting of  representatives from each of the service components to obtain their input  on this guidance, including input on the proposed terminology and the  reporting categories. OSD officials said that the issuance of the  memorandum was important to their oversight over recruiter irregularities  because it enabled them to monitor recruiter irregularities across the  service components over time.", "Recruiting command officials we contacted reported familiarity with the  memorandum, and the service components have been providing recruiter  irregularity data to OSD semiannually, as required. Recruiting command  officials we interviewed reported using the definitions in the memorandum  when submitting their recruiter irregularity data to OSD.  In our review of  the service components\u2019 data compiled by OSD, we found that since the  memorandum was issued, all of the service components have been  submitting semiannual reports following the memorandum\u2019s reporting  format.  Recruiting command officials we interviewed also reported  updating data submitted to OSD to reflect recently closed cases in  accordance with the requirements set forth in the memorandum.", "In addition to obtaining and reviewing the recruiter irregularity data  submitted by the service components, OSD contracted with RAND to  conduct an analysis of recruiter irregularities across the service  components. Among the issues that RAND is examining are the effects of  recruiter irregularities on military readiness, public perceptions of the  military, and the effect that factors, such as deployment history and  recruiter incentives, have on the occurrence of recruiter irregularities.  RAND is expected to produce its report in February 2010. OSD officials  said that once they obtain the results of both RAND\u2019s and GAO\u2019s reviews,  they will convene another meeting of stakeholders from each of the  service components to discuss recruiter irregularity issues, including the  service components\u2019 experiences with reporting data on recruiter  irregularities. Following this meeting, OSD officials stated that a DOD  instruction for the reporting of recruiter irregularity data will be issued.", "OSD also provides several opportunities for the sharing of information on  recruiter irregularities. For example, MEPCOM holds an annual  Commanders\u2019 Conference for representatives from the service  components to discuss a variety of issues, including recruiter irregularity  issues. Another example is the annual Leadership Conference, which  brings together recruiting command officials to discuss various recruiting- related issues. Although OSD officials explained that recruiter  irregularities is not the only topic addressed at these events and not every  conference or meeting will have recruiter irregularities on the agenda,  these events provide opportunities for officials from the service  components to share their experiences in addressing recruiter  irregularities.  Some recruiting command officials said that they would like  additional information on what others are doing with respect to recruiter  irregularities. For example, Navy officials said that they would like OSD to  share lessons learned in addressing recruiter irregularities among the  service components, and Air Force officials also said that it would help if  OSD regularly provided the service components with DOD-wide recruiter  irregularity data to enable them to see if the other service components are  experiencing similar problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSD Lacks Complete Oversight over Recruiter Irregularities Due to a Lack of Clarity in the Memorandum", "paragraphs": ["Although issuing the memorandum was an important first step in  providing effective oversight over recruiter irregularities and establishing  the means for assessing OSD\u2019s programs related to recruiter irregularities,  OSD still lacks complete oversight over the recruiter irregularities that are  occurring because of inconsistencies in what is reported to OSD and how  reports are prepared. We found that the inconsistencies in reporting were  the result of differences in how the service components interpreted the  requirements in the memorandum, interpreted the reporting categories in  the memorandum, and reported cases involving more than one type of  irregularity or disposition. Without more clarity, the service components  may not be reporting the recruiter irregularity data in the same manner,  precluding meaningful comparisons among them.", "We found that the service components and the National Guard states do  not all interpret the requirements of the memorandum in the same manner;  specifically, some recruiting officials were uncertain about the types of  issues involving recruiters to include in the reporting. For example, while  the majority of the service components reported only on irregularities  committed by a recruiter when dealing with an applicant or a recruit, the  Air Force Reserve, the Air National Guard States, and five out of seven  Army National Guard States whose files we reviewed reported on all cases  of recruiter irregularities, including cases in which no applicant or recruit  was involved. Examples of these cases included recruiters committing  offenses such as adultery with a non-applicant, inappropriate relationship  with other military personnel, use of a government vehicle for personal  benefit, or submission of fraudulent receipts for travel. OSD officials said  that the memorandum is clear on the need to report only those recruiter  irregularities in which an applicant is involved and the memorandum  defines recruiter irregularities as those willful and unwillful acts of  omission and improprieties that are perpetrated or alleged to be  perpetrated by a recruiter to facilitate the recruiting process for an  applicant. However, in some of our interviews with recruiting command  officials, we found that they were not clear about the need to report only  irregularities in which an applicant or a new recruit was involved. Some  officials explained that they included all cases of recruiter irregularities  because they wanted to be as transparent as possible in reporting every  case of a recruiter irregularity to OSD. In addition, we identified at least  one instance in which a state Air National Guard unit was not reporting  any recruiter irregularity cases that were unsubstantiated, even though the  memorandum specifically includes a category for unsubstantiated cases.  In our discussions with officials in that location, they explained that they  did not believe that those cases should be reported to anyone at the  National Guard Bureau, and that it would help if OSD, through the  National Guard Bureau, provided clear guidance to the States and  Territories on the reporting of unsubstantiated cases.", "We also found that the reporting categories in the memorandum were seen  as too broad and that the service components did not interpret these  categories in the same manner.  First, some recruiting officials said that  the reporting categories in the memorandum are too broad to provide  them with a clear picture of the types of recruiter irregularities that are  occurring. For example, officials at the Recruiting Standards Division of  the U.S. Army Recruiting Command and officials at the Navy Recruiting  Command said that while they use the memorandum\u2019s categories for  reporting to OSD, they continue to rely on their own internal reporting  categories. The Recruiting Standards Division has 12 categories and the  Navy has more than 20 categories that are used internally to provide a  picture of the recruiter irregularities that are occurring within their service  components. For example, while the memorandum has a single category  for all types of concealment or falsification, the Recruiting Standards  Division distinguishes among the specific types of information concealed,  such as medical information, prior police records, information on  dependents, or history of prior service. Likewise, while the memorandum\u2019s  categories do not specifically address cases where the recruiter did not  obtain appropriate parental consent for applicants under the age of 18, the  Navy has a specific category for parental consent issues. Second, officials  associated with the service components that continue to use their internal  reporting categories acknowledged that decisions on how to place cases  into one of the eight reporting categories as required by the memorandum  can be subjective. For example, Navy officials told us that it is generally up  to the individual who compiles the service component\u2019s data for OSD to  decide how cases should be transferred from the Navy categories into the  broader categories outlined in the memorandum. Furthermore, an official  with the Inspector General\u2019s office of the Navy Recruiting Command told  us that the office\u2019s staff found the definitions and the reporting categories  in the memorandum confusing and that the Navy\u2019s interpretation of these  categories would likely differ from that of the other service components.", "Some recruiting officials said that the memorandum also lacks clarity on  how to report cases involving more than one type of irregularity or more  than one type of disposition. OSD officials said that they expect the  service components to report the more serious recruiter irregularity  category when more than one category applies, and although we found  that the service components generally did that, this was not clearly  communicated in the memorandum. For example, Army and Air Force  officials said that while they would handle such situations by reporting the  most egregious type in cases involving more than one type of recruiter  irregularity committed by the same recruiter, they have not received  guidance from OSD on this. Additionally, such determinations will likely  be made subjectively. For example, reasonable officials may differ in their  opinion on whether falsification of documents is a more or less egregious  case of a recruiter irregularity than a false promise made to an applicant.  Similarly, some recruiting officials reported lack of clarity on how to  report cases involving more than one type of disposition. OSD officials  told us they expect the service components to report the final disposition  of a case.  However, several recruiting officials said that this has not been  clearly communicated to them. For example, officials from one of the  Marine Corps recruiting districts that we visited said that the  memorandum is not clear on the reporting of cases where more then one  type of disposition applies, such as a recruiter first receiving punishment  under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and then being  removed from recruiting. Several recruiting officials responsible for  reporting said that they are reporting preliminary actions against the  recruiter even if the data would later need to be changed once the final  action in the case is determined.  For example, a Marine Corps recruiting  official and an official with the U.S. Army Recruiting Command\u2019s Staff  Judge Advocate Office explained that they would report the preliminary  actions at the time of required reporting.  In fact, two Army case files that  we reviewed showed that while the cases were ultimately found to be  unsubstantiated, they were initially reported to OSD as having resulted in  non-adverse administrative action because recruiters were temporarily  suspended from recruiting while charges of inappropriate sexual  relationship and sexual assault against them were investigated.   on  However, other service components may not be approaching this situati in the same manner. For example, Air Force recruiting officials told us thatthey only report the final disposition to OSD and not the preliminary  actions.  The memorandum does not explicitly address how such  situations should be hand led in reporting.", "OSD officials acknowledged that the service components may have  questions related to reporting, particularly given the relative newness of  the memorandum. OSD officials told us that after the memorandum was  issued in December 2006, their plan was to monitor the service  components\u2019 experiences with reporting and issue a DOD instruction that  would incorporate the guidance in the memorandum and clarify any  reporting issues that the service components might be experiencing.  However, 3 years after its issuance, the memorandum has not been turned  into a DOD instruction for the service components to follow when  reporting to OSD. At the time of this reporting, OSD officials told us that  they plan to wait for the issuance of this report and the RAND study before  issuing the instruction. However, the continuing absence of definitive  guidance may result in poor data quality that would prevent OSD from  having complete and consistent information on recruiter irregularities  across the service components and the National Guard and compromise  its ability to maintain appropriate oversight over this important issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSD Also Lacks Complete National Guard Data", "paragraphs": ["OSD does not receive complete information from the National Guard.  The  memorandum applies to all service components, including the Army and  Air National Guards. Officials with the Army National Guard Strength  Maintenance Division and Air National Guard Recruiting and Retention  Service told us that following the issuance of the memorandum, they  began to request recruiter irregularity data from all States and Territories,  and provided them with the definitions and the reporting template from  the memorandum. The data from individual States and Territories are then  aggregated by the Army and Air National Guard officials and forwarded to  OSD. However, not all States and Territories in the Army National Guard  report their recruiter irregularity data. As seen in figure 5, our review of  the recruiter irregularity data that the Army National Guard States and  Territories provided to the Army National Guard Strength Maintenance  Division in January 2009 showed that 18 of the 54 States and Territories  did not provide the data for fiscal year 2008. During the July 2009  reporting cycle, 16 of the 54 States and Territories did not report their  recruiter irregularity data. Of the 38 that reported data, the reporting  period identified by the States and Territories on their reports varied from  State to State. For example, some reports submitted in August 2009  covered the first 3 quarters of fiscal year 2009, others covered only the 2nd  and 3rd quarter of fiscal year 2009, and others only covered the 3rd quarter  of fiscal year 2009. Moreover, two reports were not labeled, making it  unclear what reporting period they covered. Army National Guard officials  acknowledged problems with State reporting, but said that although they  provide guidance based on the memorandum to the States and Territories,  they rely on them to submit their data in accordance with that guidance.", "OSD also lacks a complete picture of the total number of recruiter  irregularities occurring in the Air National Guard because of concerns  regarding the quality of the data. Although, according to the Air National  Guard, all States and Territories report their recruiter irregularity data,  OSD has raised questions about the quality of the Air National Guard data.   For example, when the Air National Guard initially reported zero  irregularities for both fiscal years 2007 and 2008, OSD officials expr doubts about the absence of even a single allegation of a recruiter  irregularity in the Air National Guard, particularly given that the rep should include not only substantiated cases but also those tha ultimately found to be unsubstantiated. Following electronic  communication from OSD regarding this issue, the Air National G reported two cases of recruiter irregularities for fiscal year 2008.  Moreover, Air National Guard officials have not maintained supporting  documentation for the information reported by each State and Territo For example, one Territory did not submit a report (either by mail or  electronically) during the January 2009 reporting cycle. An Air National  Guard official at the Air National Guard Recruiting and Retention Service told us that this Territory reported having no recruiter irregularitie telephone conversation with his office, but documentation of this  conversation does not exist. The absence of such documentation raises  questions about the accuracy and completeness of the data t hat the Air  National Guard Recruiting and Retention Service receives.   ry.", "Both Army and Air National Guard officials told us that although they follow up with the States and Territories, they cannot force them to  comply.

They also follow up if no reports have been sub However, they said that it is ultimately up to individual States and  Territories to submit their reports because the National Guard Bureau no command and control authority over them.

Although instances of recruiter wrongdoing are  infrequent, even a single case can undermine the trust that the American  public has in its military. The service components recognize this realit and all have made substantial progress since 2006 in increasing their  oversight over recruiter irregularities. In particular, all service components have established procedures for reporting cases of recruiter irregularities  up the chain of command. While these systems assure that their recruiting  command headquarters receive regular reports on recruiter irregularities,  the Air Force is unique in sharing recruiter irregularity data regular ly with  all of the different levels of command to provide opportunities for  commanders at all levels to compare their progress in addressing re irregularities with the other recruiting units and to learn from their  experiences. The Army, Navy, and Marine Corps could benefit from doing  likewise. OSD has also taken steps to increase its oversight over recruiterirregularities occurring across the service components by implementing  semiannual reporting requirements and establishing common definitions  for the service components to use. While these are important first step order for the reporting requirements to have a meaningful effect, it is  critical that the services fully understand them and uniformly report  accurate data. Without OSD monitoring and promptly addressing proble that the service components may experience with respect to reporting  their recruiter irregularity data, the quality of the data received by OSD  from the service components could be compromised.

We were unable to present trends in recruiter irregularities  from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2009 and decided not to present  data for fiscal year 2009 because (1) the memorandum issued by OSD in  December 2006 required the service components to retroactively collect  recruiter irregularity data for fiscal year 2006 to report to OSD, which may  have resulted in the fiscal year 2006 data being less complete than the data  in subsequent fiscal years and (2) recruiter irregularity data reported by  the service components for fiscal year 2009 do not include data from the  fourth quarter of the fiscal year, which will not be reported until January  2010.
