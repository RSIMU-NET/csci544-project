To do this work, GAO analyzed data based on national surveys, including the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), and administrative data from the Social Security Administration (SSA). GAO also reviewed published research; interviewed federal, state, and local officials, as well as mental health providers, experts, and advocacy groups; and conducted site visits in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Mississippi --four states that focus on this population.

The actual number is likely to be higher than 2.4 million because homeless, institutionalized, and incarcerated persons were not included in this estimate--groups with potentially high rates of mental illness. Among those with serious mental illness, nearly 90 percent had more than one mental disorder, and they had significantly lower rates of high school graduation and postsecondary education. GAO also found that about 186,000 young adults received SSA disability benefits in 2006 because of a mental illness that prevented them from engaging in substantial, gainful activity. Young adults with serious mental illness can have difficulty finding services that aid in the transition to adulthood, according to researchers, public officials, and mental health advocates. Because available mental health, employment, and housing services are not always suited for young adults with mental illness, these individuals may not opt to receive these services. They also can find it difficult to qualify for adult programs that provide or pay for mental health services, disrupting the continuity of their treatment. Finally, navigating multiple discrete programs that address varied needs can be particularly challenging for them and their families. The four states GAO visited help young adults with serious mental illness transition into adulthood by offering programs that provide multidimensional services intended to be age and developmentally appropriate. These programs integrate mental health treatment with employment and other supports. To deliver these services, states use various strategies. They coordinate across multiple state agencies, leverage federal and state funding sources, and involve young adults and their families in developing policies and aligning supports. The needs of young adults with serious mental illness have also received attention from the federal government, and agencies have been providing some support to states through demonstrations, technical assistance, and research. Federal agencies have also established bodies to coordinate programs to serve those with mental health needs, youth with disabilities, and youth in transition, which may help improve service delivery for young adults with serious mental illness, as well."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a challenging time in  The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a challenging time in  which individuals assume greater responsibility for their independence  which individuals assume greater responsibility for their independence  and make critical decisions about relationships and careers that affect  and make critical decisions about relationships and careers that affect  them long into the future.

We estimated the prevalence of serious  mental illness using the NCS-R, which is based on interviews  conducted from 2001 through 2003. We then applied that prevalence  estimate to the number of young adults aged 18 to 26 nationally in 2006, as  estimated by the CPS, based on the assumption that rates of mental illness  were relatively stable in this age group between 2001 and 2006. We also  analyzed two Social Security Administration (SSA) datasets on individuals  receiving disability benefits: the 2006 Ticket Research File (TRF) and the  National Beneficiary Survey, 2004 (NBS).

This transition can involve completing school; securing full-time  employment; becoming financially independent; establishing a residence;  entering into a stable, long-term relationship; and becoming a parent. To  successfully accomplish these things, young adults must develop good  interpersonal skills, sound judgment, and a sense of personal  responsibility and purpose.", "The transition from child to adult roles can be a challenging one, and  evidence suggests that this period has become longer and more complex  over the years. During the 1950s, young people often completed their  education and secured employment, married, and became parents all in  their early 20s. Since then, the economy has grown increasingly  information-driven, while wages have declined and the cost of living has  increased, when adjusted for inflation. Consequently, young adults require  greater technical skills and education to support themselves and may  alternate living in an educational setting, with their families, or  independently well into their adult years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mental Illness and Disability", "paragraphs": ["As they transition to adulthood, some young people may experience a  mental illness, which is generally defined as a health condition that  changes a person\u2019s thinking, feelings, or behavior and causes the person  distress and difficulty in functioning. Some young adults develop their  mental illness during childhood, while it is typical for others, such as  individuals with schizophrenia, to experience the onset of symptoms as  young adults.  Although research shows that 50 percent of mental  disorders begin by age 14, it can take several years for the illness to be  detected and appropriately treated. Early detection and treatment of  mental disorders can result in a substantially shorter and less disabling  course of mental illness.", "The symptoms associated with a given type of mental illness can vary in  frequency and severity across individuals and for each individual over  time. Mental illnesses with particularly severe symptoms can have a  dramatic impact on an individual\u2019s ability to function in everyday life. The  fatigue experienced by an individual with major depressive disorder can  be so severe that it is difficult to summon the energy to work every day.  The delusions associated with paranoid schizophrenia can make it  impossible to maintain stable personal relationships with spouses, co- workers, or friends. Certain other mental illnesses are known for the  unpredictable and episodic nature of their symptoms and the harmful  effect this has on the ability to function consistently over time. For  example, individuals with bipolar disorder can alternate between periods  of mania, relative normalcy, and profound depression. For a young adult,  such unpredictable mood swings can stymie progress in securing and  maintaining a job or beginning and sustaining a long-term relationship.", "Individuals with mental illnesses who have particularly severe symptoms  can qualify for certain federal supports. The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and  Mental Health Administration Reorganization Act of 1992 uses the term  serious mental illness to identify individuals whom states are allowed to  treat using federal dollars from the Community Mental Health Block Grant  program. In response to the requirements of this Act that HHS develop a  definition, SAMHSA defined \u201cadults with a serious mental illness\u201d as those  who are: \u201cage 18 and over, who currently or at any time during the past  year, have had a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of  sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within DSM-III-R,  that has resulted in functional impairment which substantially interferes  with or limits one or more major life activities.\u201d  These major life activities  can be basic living skills, such as eating or bathing; instrumental living  skills, such as maintaining a household; or functioning in social, family, or  vocational/educational contexts. States are free to establish more  restrictive eligibility guidelines for their treatment population in several  ways: by narrowing the list of qualifying diagnoses, specifying the length of  time the individual must have had symptoms, or requiring that individuals  function below a certain level. As a result, the criteria used by states to  qualify adults for public mental health services can vary.", "Some individuals with a serious mental illness may be unable to work  because of their impairments. These individuals aged 18 or older may  qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Disability Insurance  (DI) provided by SSA if they can demonstrate that their mental illness  results in the inability to engage in any kind of substantial gainful activity  and has lasted or can be expected to last at least 12 months. DI pays  benefits related to prior earnings to those with a work history sufficient to  obtain insured status. Children can receive DI benefits based on their  parent\u2019s work history. SSI provides cash benefits for those who have  limited or no work history and whose income and assets fall below certain  levels. Children can receive SSI benefits if they have a qualifying disability  themselves. Individuals may receive concurrent payments from both DI  and SSI if their work history qualified them to receive DI payments but  their income and assets\u2014including the amount of their DI payments\u2014 were sufficiently low that they also qualified to receive SSI payments. In  fiscal year 2006, approximately 8.6 million individuals received DI  payments and 6.9 million received SSI payments, for a total of $126.4  billion in benefits paid out over the course of the year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Mental Health System", "paragraphs": ["Many people with serious mental illness receive treatment through the  public mental health system, which serves as a safety net for those who  are poor or uninsured or whose private insurance benefits run out in the  course of their illness. State mental health departments have primary  responsibility for administering the public mental health system. In doing  so, they serve multiple roles, including purchaser, regulator, manager, and,  at times, provider of mental health services. Services are delivered by  state-operated or county-operated facilities, nonprofit organizations, and  other private providers. The sources and amounts of the public funds that  mental health departments administer vary from state to state but usually  include state general revenues and funds from Medicaid and other federal  programs.", "The services provided by the public mental health system to individuals  with serious mental illness have changed over time. Historically, state-run  public mental health hospitals were the principal treatment option  available to them. By the 1960s the reliance on inpatient care was viewed  as ineffective and inadequate because of patient overcrowding, staff  shortages, and other factors. At the same time, improved medications  were reducing some of the symptoms of mental illness and increasing the  potential for more individuals to live successfully in the community. A  recovery-oriented, community-based approach to mental health treatment  has since emerged. Under this approach, individuals are to receive  services and supports uniquely designed to help them manage their mental  illness and to maximize their potential to live independently in the  community. These services and supports are to be multidimensional\u2014 intended to address not only mental illness but also employment, housing,  and other issues.

Medicaid is a health insurance program  for certain groups of low-income individuals, including elderly and  disabled individuals and children. Funded jointly by the federal  government and the states, and administered federally by the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid is the primary federal  payer for public mental health services provided by states. In order to  receive federal Medicaid funding, states are required to provide certain  broad categories of services, such as inpatient and outpatient hospital  services and physician care. Reflecting their medical focus, Medicaid  mental health services have traditionally been provided by physicians,  including psychiatrists, who work at hospitals, clinics, and other  institutions. While Medicaid will cover services provided to individuals in  facilities with 16 or fewer beds, the program specifically excludes  coverage provided in large state-run psychiatric institutions for adults  aged 22 through 64. States may choose to provide certain optional  categories of services. For example, states may use the Medicaid  \u201crehabilitation option\u201d to cover a broad range of services related to  rehabilitation from a mental illness or other condition or disability. States  may also participate in certain Medicaid demonstration programs that  allow them greater flexibility in the services they choose to cover.  Medicaid spending by the federal government and the states totaled $317  billion in 2006.", "To supplement the Medicaid program, CMS administers several smaller  grant programs that states can use to fund improvements to their mental  health systems. For example, CMS established Medicaid Infrastructure  Grants to support state efforts to enhance employment options for people  with serious mental illness and other disabilities. States may use these  grants to plan and manage improvements to Medicaid eligibility  determination and service delivery systems or to improve coordination  between the state Medicaid program and employment-related service  agencies. Nearly $43 million was available to states under this grant  program in fiscal year 2008. CMS also administers Real Choice Systems  Change Grants to help states and others build the infrastructure that will  result in improvements in community-integrated services and long-term  care supports for individuals with long-term illnesses and disabilities, such  as serious mental illness. The goal of the program is to help these  individuals live in the most integrated community setting suited to their  needs, have meaningful choices about their living arrangements, and  exercise more control over their services. Nearly $14 million was awarded  to states under this grant program in fiscal year 2007.", "Through the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant program and  other federal grant programs, SAMHSA funds mental health services that  can be used by states to assist young adults with serious mental illness.  The block grants are allocated to states according to a statutory formula  that takes into account each state\u2019s taxable resources, personal income,  population, and service costs. In order to receive the funding, states are  required by SAMHSA to provide data on the mental health services  provided including demographic information annually to SAMHSA on the  number of individuals treated by the state\u2019s mental health system. In  addition, states are required to maintain statewide planning councils that  include consumers, family members, and mental health providers to  oversee the mental health system. In fiscal year 2007, SAMHSA provided  $401 million in block grants to states. According to a SAMHSA official, this  made up an average of between 1 percent and 2 percent of each state\u2019s  budget on community-based mental health services. SAMHSA also  administers smaller targeted grants to support state mental health services  and initiatives.", "Part of SAMHSA\u2019s activities related to the block grant program are to  promote specific practices\u2014known as evidence-based practices\u2014in  mental health treatment. SAMHSA considers a practice evidence-based if it  has been validated by research, such as clinical trials with experimental  designs, and if it reflects expert opinion. On its Web site, SAMHSA  provides toolkits for five types of evidence-based practices that states can  use to design their programs. These five practices are Illness Management  and Recovery, Assertive Community Treatment, Supported Employment,  Family Psychoeducation, and Co-Occurring Disorders: Integrated Dual  Disorders Treatment. (See app. III for details about these practices.)  SAMHSA is also promoting research on evidence-based practices in a  number of other areas, including supported education, and plans on  providing toolkits or other informational materials for these as well. A  condition for receiving Community Mental Health Services Block Grant  funds is that states are required by SAMHSA to report on whether they are  using the evidence-based practices.

These vulnerable populations include young adults transitioning  out of the foster care system\u2014who may have limited family support for  their struggle with serious mental illness\u2014and young adults who become  homeless or incarcerated. The NCS-R does not include individuals who are  homeless or incarcerated, and although individuals in foster care are  included, they are not specifically identified as such in the data.  Additionally, a review of literature on homelessness and the justice and  foster care systems yielded no studies that produced national estimates of  the number of such young adults in those groups. Studies that examine  mental illness in those groups either do not yield estimates specific to  young adults or do not measure serious mental illness in a consistent way  that can be compared across groups.", "Although the prevalence of serious mental illness has not been studied in  these young adult populations nationally, available research suggests that  their rates of mental illness may be high. With respect to young adults in  foster care, a national survey that included 464 individuals aged 12 to 17  who had been placed in foster care found that they were about four times  more likely to have attempted suicide in the preceding year when  compared to those never placed in foster care. In addition, they were  about three times more likely to have experienced significant anxiety and  mood symptoms, such as depression or mania. Research also indicates  that mental health problems among foster care children may persist into  adulthood. For example, the Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study, which  assessed 659 adults aged 20 through 33 in Oregon and Washington who  had been in foster care as children, found that over half had experienced  symptoms of one or more mental disorders in the previous year, and 20  percent had symptoms of three or more mental disorders. The study  compared these results to results from the NCS-R for adults in the same  age range, which found that only three percent of adults in that age range  had symptoms of 3 or more disorders in the previous year.", "Studies also suggest high rates of mental illness among young adults who  are homeless. For example, an Urban Institute study based on the National  Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients estimated that 46  percent of homeless individuals aged 20 through 24 had experienced a  mental health problem in the prior year. Another study of 432 homeless  young people in Los Angeles found that 63 percent of those aged 19  through 24 currently had depressive symptoms and 38 percent had  attempted suicide at some point in their lives.", "Finally, studies have found that young adults involved in the criminal  justice system have high rates of mental illness. According to two national  surveys conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 62.6 percent of  young adults aged 24 or younger in state prisons had a mental health  problem in 2004, and 70.3 percent of those in local jails had a mental  health problem in 2002. Further, a multi-state survey funded by DOJ\u2019s  Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention found that about 70  percent of youth involved with the juvenile justice system had at least one  mental health disorder, and 27 percent had a severe mental health disorder  in 2006."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Young Adults with Serious Mental Illness Face Challenges Accessing Appropriate Support", "paragraphs": ["According to researchers, public officials, and advocates, young adults  with serious mental illness can have difficulty finding services tailored to  their needs, qualifying for adult programs, and navigating multiple  programs and delivery systems. While these young adults need a range of  support services, the existing public mental health, employment, and  housing programs are not necessarily tailored to their disability or their  stage of life, which may lead them to forgo services entirely. Further,  young adults who received free or low-cost mental health services as  children generally face different, and sometimes more stringent, eligibility  requirements as adults.

We have previously reported that directors of programs serving youth  aged 14 through 24 have difficulty finding adequate age-appropriate mental  health services for their clients. A national expert has noted that adult  mental health service providers in one state, for example, were generally  not trained in adolescent development and so were unprepared to treat  young adults with serious mental illness who tend to be relatively  psychosocially immature. Officials in three of the states we visited  similarly reported a need for better training among mental health  providers in issues related to young adults. Other researchers have noted  that group therapy should involve members in the same age range, given  that young adults\u2019 self-esteem can depend significantly on peer  acceptance. However, young adults are often referred to group-oriented  treatment that may include mainly older adults who do not share their  transition-age issues and is therefore often inappropriate for them,  according to mental health advocates with whom we spoke.", "While young adults with serious mental illness can benefit from a variety  of employment programs, these programs are also not necessarily tailored  to the particular needs of this population. For example, state officials in  three of the four states we visited told us that WIA Youth centers in those  states often lack the expertise to help young adults with serious mental  illness find appropriate employment because these centers generally do  not have the capacity to provide the intensive and customized support  these individuals need. Labor officials told us that, as a result, WIA staff  often refer youth they believe have mental illness to vocational  rehabilitation programs. However, according to federal officials,  vocational rehabilitation programs have been traditionally used by those  with physical disabilities and are also not always designed to meet mental  health needs. Advocates working with young adults in most states we  visited likewise noted that the vocational rehabilitation services available  to the youth they work with have not been responsive to their mental  health-related issues. Similarly, officials in one state noted that service  providers for students with disabilities at colleges and universities often  lack the expertise and training to support students with serious mental  illness.", "Finally, while researchers noted that young adults with serious mental  illnesses experience difficulty living independently and in some cases  finding housing, officials in all of the states we visited cited the inability to  find appropriate housing as a key problem for this population. Specifically,  they noted that there are not enough permanent housing options that are  targeted to this age group. Supportive housing-\u2013which often includes a  comprehensive set of supports such as job training and mental health  services-\u2013is recommended by SAMHSA as a resource for those with  mental illness. However, officials in all states we visited said there was a  lack of such housing available. Additionally, where supportive housing is  available, it is not necessarily geared to young adults. For example, HUD  officials reported that the median age of the head of households receiving  HUD supportive housing is 47. One service provider explained that if  housing options are not geared to their age group, young adults with  serious mental illness may end up homeless.", "Researchers and advocates have noted that if services are not suited to  their age or disability, young adults with serious mental illness may choose  not to participate. Young adults are particularly sensitive to the stigma  associated with receiving treatment for their symptoms, and SAMHSA has  reported that they have the lowest \u201chelp-seeking behavior\u201d of any age  group. Furthermore, as they age into the adult mental health system, their  parents are generally no longer responsible for their mental health  treatment, and these young adults then have the option to decline  treatment. In Massachusetts, for example, a state official found that, in one  locality, more than half of the young adults who had received mental  health services as children chose not to receive them as adults. She  attributed this to a lack of services geared to their disability and age."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Eligibility Criteria between Child and Adult Systems Pose Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Researchers and state officials we spoke with noted that young adults who  once received public mental health services, Medicaid, or SSI or DI as  children face different and sometimes more restrictive eligibility  requirements for these programs as adults. They added that ineligibility for  these adult programs can end established relationships with mental health  professionals or otherwise disrupt receipt of mental health services.", "Qualifying for free or low-cost mental health services is often more  difficult for adults than children. The National Conference of State  Legislatures found that, among state programs, the clinical criteria for  receiving adult public mental health services are generally narrower for  adults than for children. Another study has found that in 2001 adult and  child mental health policies were different in 34 states, and in 31 of those  states, the range of qualifying disorders was more limited for adults than  for children. Specifically, in half of the states with different criteria, the  adult requirement was more restrictive by virtue of citing fewer specific  diagnoses to qualify. Similarly, in most states children can qualify for  Medicaid---the major federal funder of public mental health services---at  higher household income levels than adults, who must also meet other  categorical eligibility criteria. In these states, a young person previously  covered by Medicaid as a child who becomes an adult risks losing access  to the mental health treatment and psychiatric rehabilitation services  covered by the program. Advocates, state officials, and researchers all  cited the loss of Medicaid benefits because of different eligibility  requirements between children and adults as a challenge for young adults  with serious mental illness.", "When youth receiving SSI are evaluated using adult rules for SSI within  one year of turning age 18, as required by law, they also find that the adult  eligibility criteria are different and can result in a cessation of payments.  This can also lead to a loss of Medicaid eligibility. SSA officials told us that  25 percent of youth who received SSI because of a mental health--related  condition do not qualify for SSI once they turn 18. Advocates working with  these young adults and their families in the states we visited cited this loss  of SSI benefits as a key concern for young adults with serious mental  illness in their transition to adulthood. SSA officials indicated that the loss  of benefits for these young adults resulted partly from the fact that certain  mental disorders that are considered disabling to children are not  applicable to adults. For example, adult disorders that qualify for SSI do  not include eating disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  However, SSA officials told us that they are currently working on revising  some of the criteria for mental health impairments so that the criteria for  children and adults are more closely aligned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navigating Multiple Programs and Systems Can also Present Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Because young adults with serious mental illness usually have a number of  needs requiring multiple supports, they can find it difficult to receive all  the services they need when programs are administered by different  agencies with varying eligibility requirements.

Labor recently reported, however, that there is no single  system that guides youth, in general, through the process of becoming  productive, self-sufficient adults and that existing services for them are  uncoordinated. Bazelon has similarly found that the programs serving  young adults with mental illness have varying age and income  requirements and may use different definitions of mental illness, which  can make it difficult to obtain multiple services. In addition, according to  state officials with whom we visited, program staff may not collaborate  with or notify one another of the service plans they develop for clients.  For example, the director of a mental health advocacy organization in  Massachusetts told us that when a young person has a serious mental  illness and the secondary school is involved, the staff at the school will  typically not speak with the young person\u2019s doctor or Medicaid provider in  order to coordinate behavior plans or more fully understand the particular  mental illness.", "Navigating the varying eligibility requirements and service plans of  multiple programs across a number of delivery systems can be difficult for  anyone, but young adults with serious mental illness may have fewer  interpersonal and emotional resources with which to do so. Mental health  advocates told us that because young adults with serious mental illness  tend to be involved in different service delivery systems, their parents or  other caring adults must often operate as their de facto case worker,  attempting to organize and coordinate various services. However,  researchers and family advocates have also found that a major challenge  for these parents and caring adults is their need for information related to  availability of supports. For example, one researcher found that families  wanted information related to the young adults\u2019 condition and treatment,  available community resources, and supports for caregivers and that they  generally reported feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the system of  agencies and organizations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected States Provide Multidimensional Services to Young Adults with Serious Mental Illness Using Various Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the challenges faced by young adults with serious mental  illness, the four states we visited\u2014Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts,  and Mississippi\u2014have designed programs with multidimensional services  to help them transition into adulthood.

In addition to health care services, the programs provide a  range of services intended to be age and developmentally appropriate,  including vocational rehabilitation, employment, life-skills development,  and, in some cases, housing. These four states try to tailor these  services so that, to the extent possible, young adults receive services  appropriate for each individual\u2019s transition needs. They also try to  integrate the services so that young adults do not have to navigate multiple  discrete programs. Tailoring and integrating services are both central  tenets of the wraparound approach.

Maryland officials told us they aim to identify and treat individuals so that  they can become meaningful community participants rather than  becoming dependent on the service system.

Some of these  practices involve bringing integrated mental health and social services to  the young adults living in the community rather than expecting them to  navigate multiple discrete programs on their own. For example,  Massachusetts and Connecticut have used the Assertive Community  Treatment model, which employs an interdisciplinary team of  psychiatrists, social workers, and nurses to provide psychiatric,  rehabilitation, and other support services in the community 24 hours per  day. In this model, team members collaborate to tailor services on an  individual basis, taking into account cultural diversity. Assertive  Community Treatment services are designed for individuals who have the  most serious symptoms of mental illness and greatest impairment in  functioning. They often come to the program in crisis or upon release from  inpatient psychiatric care. In Massachusetts, the Assertive Community  Treatment services are available in various locations throughout the state,  including in three sites in the Southeastern Area that specifically target  these services for young adults. Connecticut uses this treatment model in  some of its young adult program sites, often to serve those leaving foster  care and the juvenile justice system.", "Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts provide another evidence- based practice\u2014supported employment\u2014to assist young adults with  serious mental illness. Based on the principle that work is therapeutic,  supported employment programs are designed to help individuals work in  competitive jobs in the community while receiving mental health  treatment and rehabilitation services. These programs focus on rapid job  placement in competitive employment. Once the individual is working, the  program provides supports to retain employment. In Maryland, for  example, the state mental health agency and the state vocational  rehabilitation agency approved 30 evidenced-based supported  employment programs available for young adults with serious mental  illness, although these are not uniformly distributed across the state.  According to state officials, these programs help individuals find and  maintain meaningful jobs that are consistent with the individual\u2019s  preferences and abilities.", "In addition, Connecticut has been providing a type of support that  SAMHSA is beginning to explore as a potential evidence-based practice\u2014 supported education for young adults with serious mental illness who  enroll in higher education. The Connecticut mental health agency provides  funding for a supported education counselor at one of the state  universities, who provides case management services, acts as a liaison  between the university\u2019s disability office and the student with mental  illness, and helps students work with relevant university staff to get  appropriate accommodations for their mental illness in the classroom or  during exams.

In Connecticut,  many young adults are formally referred to the Connecticut mental health  agency by the state agency responsible for foster care, juvenile justice, and  youth mental health services.

These services, which are provided to address daily problems related to  community living and interpersonal relationships, may include psychiatric   rehabilitation program services, symptom management, and counseling.  Further, some of these states have used certain CMS grants to help cover  some expenses of their young adult programs.

Maryland\u2019s mental health agency and  Maryland\u2019s vocational rehabilitation agency have a cooperative agreement  that outlines the funding components. In addition, Maryland requires  individuals in its public mental health system, including young adults, to  apply for SSI or any other applicable public benefit in order to receive  income assistance (to pay for housing and insurance) to pay for services,  according to a state mental health official. In the development of its young  adult program, Maryland also uses part of its CMS Medicaid Infrastructure  Grant to consult with experts on funding strategies and to implement the  web-based mental health and vocational rehabilitation eligibility system.", "In addition to federal funds leveraged at the state level, some local state  agencies obtain services for their clients from other federally funded  programs. Officials from one service provider in Massachusetts told us  that their organization works with state housing authorities to secure  HUD\u2019s Section 8 Rental Voucher Program for adults who were previously  homeless. When we conducted our site visit, the provider was using 10  such vouchers to serve 20 to 30 young adults, according to this provider.  State officials said that this was an important initiative by this provider  because states find it particularly difficult to obtain appropriate housing  for young adults with serious mental illness who have criminal records. In  Maryland, although the state mental health agency does not work directly  with the state WIA Office, a local provider in its young adult program  works with local WIA offices in two counties to coordinate employment  services for young adults with serious mental illness.

The goal of three of the research projects is to assess  the impact of tailoring existing treatment models to the needs of  transition-aged youth. For example, one researcher is planning to adapt an  established family-focused intervention approach for juvenile offenders to  one that gives youth offenders with serious mental illness more control of  their treatment and targets age-relevant social, work, and independent  living skills. Another project examines young adults\u2019 use of primary care,  mental health services, and psychotropic medications, as well as their  overall mental health care costs.

Figure 3 lists these groups, their target population, goals,  and participating agencies.", "While interagency groups have been tasked with coordinating across  agencies, officials from a number of agencies noted that differences in  their missions and goals may make it difficult to coordinate services for  young adults with serious mental illness. For example, according to one  SAMHSA official, mental health agencies are more focused on maintaining  youth in the home or in a community-based setting, whereas juvenile  justice agencies are more focused on protecting the community from  youth offenders. Agency officials also cited differences in eligibility  criteria across programs as a challenge for coordination, stating that age  requirements for receiving benefits-\u2013often written in statute-\u2013vary across  some programs. Despite these limitations, ongoing federal coordination  efforts are beginning to address the needs of this population.", "The Federal Executive Steering Committee on Mental Health was formed  in response to the 2003 President\u2019s New Freedom Commission on Mental  Health, which made recommendations to the federal government to better  coordinate services, such as employment supports and housing, for those  with mental illness. The committee has taken steps to promote access to  supported employment services for young adults with serious mental  illness by reviewing existing federal programs and initiatives for youth  transitioning to the workforce to better coordinate their efforts. To  promote youth leadership and youth-guided policymaking related to  mental health at the federal level, the committee, led by Labor\u2019s Office of  Disability Employment Policy, also held a National Youth Summit in 2007.  The President\u2019s New Freedom Commission recommended actions to  address mental health stigma, and SAMHSA launched a campaign  specifically targeted to young adults.", "The Shared Youth Vision Federal Collaborative Partnership was created to  strengthen coordination among federal youth-serving agencies. It was  formed in response to a report written by the White House Task Force on  Disadvantaged Youth in 2003, which identified challenges related to  coordination among youth-serving programs and prompted federal efforts  to support capacity building and collaboration among those agencies.  Many of the federal officials we spoke with indicated this initiative could  have an impact on young adults, including those with serious mental  illness. Sixteen states have received funding through this initiative to  develop interagency collaboration as well as state and local partnerships  to provide transition assistance to disadvantaged young adults, including  those with serious mental illness. For example, the Oklahoma Youth  Vision Project is working across eight state youth-serving agencies, Job  Corps, as well as local school districts, group homes, and employers to  help disadvantaged youth, particularly those aging out of foster care, aged  16 through 21, graduate from high school and become employed. In  addition, this initiative sponsors technical assistance forums for  participating federal agencies and runs a solutions desk that provides the  16 state grantees with a single point of access to federal resources such as  training and technical assistance in implementing federal grants related to  disadvantaged youth.", "The third coordination initiative, Federal Partners in Transition  Workgroup, led by Labor\u2019s Office of Disability Employment Policy, began  in June 2005 and focuses exclusively on disabled youth transitioning to  adulthood, including young adults with serious mental illness.

In its general comments, HHS indicated that  the report was pertinent and timely. However, HHS stated that the report  should have included a number of other important topics and should have  focused on younger individuals as well as those aged 18 through 26.

In particular, they took issue with our use of the NCS-R to  estimate the number of young adults with serious mental illness. They  believe that data from the NCS-R represent only a subset of those  individuals who would be considered to have a serious mental illness  under the definition used by SAMHSA to determine how states can use  Community Mental Health Block grant (see 58 Fed. Reg. 29422 (May 20,  1993), implementing Pub. L. 102-321). Specifically, they pointed out that  the NCS-R does not include those in institutions and does not identify  those with schizophrenia, or personality disorder. Additionally, HHS stated  that the researchers and consumer organizations that we interviewed were  weighted toward those with expertise in childhood mental illnesses and  did not include experts in schizophrenia or adult mental health consumer  organizations. HHS also stated that the report should have included a  more extensive discussion of serious emotional disturbance and the  degree to which states were providing services specifically for young  adults with serious mental illness.", "Researchers and policy makers have long recognized that defining serious  mental illness in order to estimate its prevalence or to determine eligibility  for services presents a significant challenge. Our report generally uses a  definition of serious mental illness that is based on SAMHSA\u2019s regulation  implementing Pub. L. 102-321. We clarified the text to explain that in  places throughout the report, we may use a slightly broader or narrower  concept of serious mental illness as necessitated by available data as well  as programmatic or administrative definitions. We used NCS-R data to  estimate the prevalence of serious mental illness on the basis of  recommendations from several researchers. In addition, the NCS-R was  identified in a SAMHSA publication as a source of nationally  representative data that measures the severity of mental disorders, which  relates to SAMHSA\u2019s definition of serious mental illness. Our draft clearly  acknowledges the limitations of the NCS-R by stating that our estimate is  likely to be low. It also provides the number of individuals 18 through 26  with serious mental illness who receive SSI and DI benefits due to mental  illness. This number is likely to include young adults who may not have  been included in the NCS-R, such as those living in an institution and many  with schizophrenia or psychosis. To respond to HHS\u2019s comments, we have  further highlighted our discussion of why limitations of the NCS-R result in  an underestimate of the number of young adults with serious mental  illness. With regard to the expertise of researchers and consumer  organizations we interviewed, we chose the individuals and groups we did  primarily because of their expertise in young adults with serious mental  illness and, in many cases, because they were recommended to us by  federal officials or researchers. While most also have an interest in a  younger population, this group included organizations that have a strong  interest in adult mental health issues, such as Mental Health America,  several National Alliance of Mental Illness chapters, and Black Mental  Health Alliance for Education and Consultation, Inc.

Rehabilitation services may extend beyond  the clinical treatment of a person\u2019s mental illness to include helping the person  to acquire the skills that are essential for everyday functioning.", "This grant creates a system of flexible financing for long-term services and  supports that enable available funds to move with the individual to the most  appropriate and preferred setting as the individual\u2019s needs and preferences  change. Populations targeted for transition include individuals of all ages with  disabilities including mental illness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Overview of Programs for Young Adults with SMI in Four States", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides an overview of the key programs that target  services for young adults with serious mental illness in the four states we  visited\u2014Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Mississippi.", "Connecticut\u2019s Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services  administers the Young Adult Services program. Since 1998 in coordination  with the Department of Children and Families and several other state  agencies, this program has provided mental health treatment, supported  employment, vocational or educational support, life skills training, and  supportive housing, with the particular array and level of care varying  slightly by location. Connecticut offers different levels of care, ranging  from basic case management services and employment and educational  support to highly structured group homes or supervised housing programs  with intensive case management, or Assertive Community Treatment  programs. In addition, some programs are gender specific. Sixteen of the  21 local mental health authorities offer the Young Adult Services program.  State officials indicated that they launched the program due to a federal  lawsuit, which resulted in legislative funding for as special group of young  adults who were diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorders and  exhibited high risk sexual behavior issues. The program evolved to  encompass a broader cohort of young adults with severe behavioral health  issues and high risk behavior who, without any services, would have  ended up in jail or homeless. Because many of these young adults spent  most of their lives in institutional settings, such as psychiatric  rehabilitative treatment centers, they had not developed interpersonal  skills to effectively live in the community. In state fiscal year 2007, 716  individuals were served in the Young Adult Services program or about  27 percent of the 2,615 young adults with serious mental illness receiving  any mental health services from the state mental health agency.", "Maryland\u2019s Mental Hygiene Administration, within the Maryland  Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, administers the Transition-Age  Youth Initiative, which consists of various programs that provide mental  health treatment, supported employment, life skills training, residential  services, and, in some cases, supportive housing in the community. Eleven  of the state\u2019s 20 mental health agencies offer services through this  initiative, although the type and number of services offered vary by region.  Some of these programs provide a greater array of services, including  various types of mental health treatment services with supported  employment, residential, and supportive housing, while others provide  more limited case management services. Maryland mental health agency  officials stated that program variety was beneficial, because a particular  program design will work well for some young adults but not others. State  officials told us that Maryland\u2019s Transition-Age Youth programs originated  in the late 1990s when the Governor launched an initiative to expand  services for young adults with disabilities who were transitioning from the  children\u2019s system. As part of the initiative, funds were made available to  the various agencies that serve these youth, including the Mental Hygiene  Administration. With the money, mental health agency officials decided to  fund a variety of types of small programs around the state, with the goal of  evaluating them to identify promising programs that could be expanded. A  Maryland mental health official said that funds were used to leverage and  maximize other types of funds in order to create new services. While these  Transition-Age Youth programs continue, a comprehensive evaluation has  not been done. In fiscal year 2007, 8,753 young adults aged 18 through 24  received services from the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene, of  which 415 received case management and 287 received supported  employment services. In total, the state funded the Transition-Age Youth  Initiative, which has capacity to treat about 250 individuals per year. Age  criteria for individual programs differs, with one program serving  individuals as young as 13 and another covering individuals as old as 25.", "Massachusetts\u2019s Department of Mental Health established the Transition  Age-Youth Initiative in 2005 to assist young adults with serious mental  illness, including those transitioning from the children\u2019s mental health  system to the adult system, as well as those aging out of foster care or the  juvenile justice systems. This initiative provides an array of age- appropriate services to individuals aged 16 through 25 that address their  needs in the areas of mental health treatment, vocational rehabilitation,  employment, housing, peer support, and family psychoeducation. As part  of this effort, as of January 2008, the Massachusetts Department of Mental  Health had trained both child and adult case managers, as well as 36  Transition Age Youth case managers on the special needs of transition-age  youth to better prepare them to assist young adults with serious mental  illness in accessing services from the adult mental health system,  according to a state mental health official. Transition-Age Youth services  are available in all six Massachusetts Mental Health Service Delivery  Areas, but the array of services differs by location. State officials cited  several factors that influenced the development of the Transition-Age  Youth Initiative. One factor was a concern about an area office that  reported a decrease in the number of young adults requesting services  after transitioning out of the children\u2019s mental health system. After  researching the situation, the state found that the adult mental health  program had not been providing the types of transition services that this  age group needed and found appealing. Another factor was the issuance of  the President\u2019s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health report and  various other publications on transition-age youth by mental health  researchers. In 2007, about 2,600 individuals were enrolled in the  Transition-Age Youth Initiative, according to a state mental health official.", "In contrast with other states, Mississippi does not have a centralized and  statewide program for young adults with serious mental illness but has  several small-scale initiatives for this population. One of its key initiatives  is the Transition Outreach Program, which provides mental health,  supported employment, and life skills training to adolescents and young  adults in two locations\u2014Hattiesburg and Jackson. This program assists  young adults in developing healthy relationships that can motivate them to  change their behavior. This program developed because of the gap in  services for the transition-age youth with serious mental illness. According  to the officials, eventually young people would return to the mental health  system, resurfacing at a mental health facility and in crisis. By June 2007,  the Transitional Outreach Program had served more than 150 individuals.  Another key initiative is the \u201cMultidisciplinary Assessment and Planning  Teams,\u201d which consist of officials from various state agencies and  advocates that meet to review cases that include youth ages 14 to 21  transitioning from the child to adult mental health systems, as well as  other youth considered to be high-risk. Established in 1996, these teams  also coordinate the delivery of multiple services including mental health,  education, vocational rehabilitation, health care, and juvenile justice  services. As of November 2007 the teams were operating in 33 of 82  counties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Clarita A.
