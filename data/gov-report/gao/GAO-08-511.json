Local governments see potential uses in law enforcement or firefighting and the private sector sees potential uses, such as real estate photography. An industry survey states that UAS production could increase in the future to meet such government and private-sector uses. Experts predict that UASs could perform some manned aircraft missions with less noise and fewer emissions. UASs pose technological, regulatory, workload, and coordination challenges that affect their ability to operate safely and routinely in the national airspace system. UASs cannot meet aviation safety requirements, such as seeing and avoiding other aircraft. UASs lack security protection--a potential challenge if UASs proliferate as expected after obtaining routine airspace access. The lack of FAA regulations for UASs limits their operation to case-by-case approvals by FAA. Anticipated increases in requests to operate UASs could pose a workload challenge for FAA. Coordinating multiple efforts to address these challenges is yet another challenge. FAA and the Department of Defense (DOD) are addressing technological challenges. DHS has not addressed the national security implications of routine UAS access to the airspace. FAA estimates that completing UAS safety regulations will take 10 or more years, but has not yet issued its program plan to communicate the steps and time frames required for providing routine UAS access. FAA is working to allow small UASs to have airspace access and has designated specific airspace for UAS testing. It plans to use data from this testing and from DOD to develop regulations, but has not yet analyzed data that it has already collected. To address its workload challenge, FAA is using more automation. Aviation stakeholders and experts suggested that an overarching entity could help coordinate and expedite federal, academic, and private-sector efforts. In 2003, Congress created a similar entity in FAA to coordinate planning for the next generation air transportation system among multiple federal agencies and the private sector."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Government and private-sector interest in unmanned aircraft systems  (UAS) is growing, due in large part to the U.S. military\u2019s expanded  development and use of these systems in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Some unmanned aircraft can remain aloft for 30 hours or  more, because there is no need for them to land to change pilots.  Unmanned aircraft can also perform dangerous missions without risking  loss of life.", "The federal government has used UASs for a number of years for various  purposes, such as collecting scientific data, assisting with border security,  and gathering weather data from inside hurricanes.

Potential  commercial uses are also possible, for example, in real estate photography  or pipeline inspection. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is  responsible for ensuring that UASs operate safely in the national airspace  system and is working to develop a regulatory framework to address the  unique characteristics of UASs.  For example, current regulations do not  indicate how, in the absence of an on-board pilot, UASs should detect,  sense, and avoid other aircraft to avoid collisions. FAA\u2019s long-range goal is  to permit, to the greatest extent possible, routine government and  commercial UAS operations in the national airspace system while ensuring  safety. Presently, because of safety concerns, FAA authorizes civil  government and military UAS operations in the national airspace system  on a limited basis after conducting a case-by-case safety review.  Regulations do not currently permit commercial UAS operations.", "You asked us to assess efforts to safely integrate UASs into the national  airspace system and the potential impact of those UASs after such  integration occurs.

(2) What challenges exist in operating UASs safely and  routinely in the national airspace system? (3) What is the federal  government\u2019s response to these challenges? and (4) Assuming that UASs  have routine access to the national airspace system, how might they  impact the system and the environment?", "To address these questions, we reviewed the literature, FAA and  Department of Defense (DOD) documents, and aviation trade association  reports. We also interviewed officials from DOD, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) about their operations and plans to operate UASs  in the national airspace system. We interviewed officials in associations  that represent UAS manufacturers and users of the national airspace  system. To determine the expected growth of UASs, we obtained industry  forecasts. Additionally, we administered a Web-based survey to 23 UAS  experts, selected with the assistance of the National Academies, to obtain  their opinions of the steps that FAA could take to accelerate UAS  integration in the national airspace system and the impact that UASs might  have on the system and the environment after integration occurs. We  conducted this performance audit from October 2006 to May 2008, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

A  UAS can operate for far longer periods than an onboard pilot could safely  operate an aircraft. Future scenarios envision UASs remaining aloft for  weeks or even months using fuel cell technology or airborne refueling  operations. UASs may fly at slower speeds than most manned aircraft;  some operate at low altitude (between buildings) while others fly well  above piloted aircraft altitudes. Some UASs can fly autonomously based  on pre-programmed data or flight paths, while others fly based on  commands from pilot-operated ground stations. UASs also vary widely in  size, shape, and capabilities. Some UASs, such as the Global Hawk, have a  wingspan as large as that of a Boeing 737. Others, because they do not  need the power or physical size to carry a pilot, can be small and light  enough to be launched by hand, as is the case for the SkySeer UAS shown  in figure 2.", "DOD has pioneered UAS applications for wartime use and, in 2007, was  the major user of UASs, primarily for ongoing conflicts in Iraq and  Afghanistan. While many of DOD\u2019s UAS operations currently take place  outside the United States, DOD needs access to the national airspace  system for UASs to, among other things, transit from their home bases for  training in restricted military airspace or for transit to overseas  deployment locations. DOD officials stated that the need for military UAS  access to the national airspace system is under review, and also noted that  increased access would also allow their UASs to be more easily used to aid  in fighting wildfires.", "Several federal agencies have roles related to UASs. FAA is responsible for  ensuring UASs are safely integrated into the national airspace system\u2019s air  traffic control procedures, airport operations, and infrastructure, and with  existing commercial, military, and general aviation users of the system.   When UASs operate in that system, they must meet the safety  requirements of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, parts 61  and 91. FAA approves, on a case-by-case basis, applications from  government agencies and private-sector entities for authority to operate  UASs in the national airspace system. Federal, state, and local government  agencies must apply for Certificates of Waiver or Authorization (COA),  while private-sector entities must apply for special airworthiness  certificates. In either case, FAA examines the facts and circumstances of  proposed UAS operations to ensure that the prospective operator has  acceptably mitigated safety risks. Special airworthiness certificates are the  only means through which private-sector entities can operate UASs in the  national airspace system. Because special airworthiness certificates do not  allow commercial operations, there is currently no means for authorizing  commercial UAS operations.", "NASA has conducted UAS research in the past. NASA led the 9-year  Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology Program that  focused on UAS technology for high altitude, long-endurance aircraft  engines, sensors, and integrated vehicles. NASA also played a key role in a  partnership with other federal agencies and industry called \u201cAccess-5.\u201d", "Access-5 incorporated the efforts of the UAV National Industry Team,  known as UNITE, formed by six private-sector aerospace firms, as well as  FAA, DOD, and other industry participants. The Access-5 partnership  sought to achieve routine operations for high-level, long-endurance UASs  in the national airspace system. NASA contributed about 75 percent of the  funding for this effort and the partnership had laid out plans through 2010.  Although the partnership ended in fiscal year 2006 when NASA cancelled  its funding, the project claimed a number of accomplishments, including  creating productive and cohesive working relationships among key  stakeholders and recommendations to advance the introduction of UASs  into the national airspace system.", "Other agencies and organizations have roles or interests relating to UASs.  For example, DHS\u2019s TSA has authority to regulate security of all  transportation modes, including non-military UASs, to ensure that  appropriate security safeguards are in place. GSA has the responsibility for  maintaining an inventory of all federally-owned or -leased aircraft, as  reported by federal agencies.

NASA also operates a modified Predator B UAS from its Dryden Flight  Research Center, in California, and used it to aid firefighting efforts in  southern California in 2007. During 2005, the Department of Commerce\u2019s  National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  partnered with NASA and industry to use a UAS to fill data gaps in several  areas, including climate research, weather and water resources  forecasting, ecosystem monitoring and management, and coastal mapping.  During 2007, NOAA partnered with NASA to use an Aerosonde\u00ae UAS to  gather data from Hurricane Noel and reported receiving valuable low- altitude data that could aid future weather forecasts and potentially  reduce property damage and save lives.", "Several other federal agencies have benefited from using UASs. DHS\u2019s  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses Predator B UASs to help  conduct surveillance along portions of the U.S. border with Mexico. (See  fig. 3.) CBP credits its UAS operations as helping its agents make over  4,000 arrests and seize nearly 20,000 pounds of illegal drugs between  September 2005 and March 2008. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,  UASs searched for survivors in an otherwise inaccessible area of  Mississippi. Additionally, in 2004, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S.  Forest Service used a UAS to study renewed volcanic activity at Mount St.  Helens, Washington.

For example,  the military recently demonstrated how operators can use UASs as  communications platforms to bridge rugged terrain as shown in figure 4.  Disaster recovery officials could use UASs in a similar manner to help  establish and maintain communications when the infrastructure is  disabled or overloaded. The latter was an issue in the hours immediately  following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.", "An industry forecast anticipates that federal agencies will continue to be  the main users of large UASs for much of the coming decade. CBP is  expanding its fleet of Predator B UASs. The agency received its fourth  aircraft in February 2008 and expects to acquire two more during fiscal  year 2008. CBP also plans to expand its UAS operations along the southern  U.S. border, and in the spring of 2008, begin operations along the northern  U.S. border, and then eventually expand operations to the Great Lakes and  Caribbean. CBP\u2019s Air and Marine Operations Center in Riverside,  California, will eventually control most of the agency\u2019s UASs via satellite  link. DHS\u2019s Coast Guard is evaluating various UAS designs for future use  in maritime border protection, law and treaty enforcement, and search and  rescue.", "Expanded UAS use for scientific applications is also possible. According  to NOAA, UASs have the potential to continue to fill critical observation  gaps in climate change research, weather and water resources forecasting,  ecosystem monitoring and management, and coastal mapping. NOAA also  anticipates further use of UASs for hurricane observation. Figure 5  illustrates how a high-altitude UAS might obtain hurricane data. The  National Academies recently recommended that NASA should increasingly  factor UAS technology into the nation\u2019s strategic plan for Earth science. In  2007, NASA acquired two Global Hawk UASs from the Air Force for  potential use in long endurance missions monitoring polar ice melt or for  gathering data on hurricane development 2,500 miles off the U.S. Atlantic  coast.", "State and local agencies and commercial users envision using smaller UAS  models. To facilitate more rapid resolution of emergency situations, an  official with the International Association of Chiefs of Police envisions  police and firefighting units having small, hand-deployed UASs available to  assist at crime scenes and wildfire locations. According to FAA, as of  January 2008, about a dozen law enforcement agencies had contacted the  agency to discuss potential use of UASs. An industry forecast of UAS  growth from 2008 to 2017 predicts that interest among local law  enforcement agencies in operating UASs could increase late in the forecast  period.", "In the private sector, some entrepreneurs have become interested in  obtaining authorization to use small UASs to provide real estate  photography services. Small UASs could also help companies survey  pipeline or transportation infrastructure. However, an industry forecast  noted that, for commercial applications, manned aircraft continue to be  less costly than UASs. Consequently, demand for commercial applications  will be limited in the near term. While the forecast indicates that civil and  commercial UAS markets will eventually emerge, the forecast notes that,  for the next several years, a more likely scenario would be for a UAS  leasing industry to emerge to serve the needs of businesses that do not  want to invest in UAS ownership.", "UASs also could provide benefits to manned aviation. Efforts to move  toward routine access for UASs could produce technological  improvements in areas such as materials, fuel cells, antennae, and laser  communications, which could also benefit manned aviation, according to  one study of UAS impact. Some experts we surveyed had similar  observations, noting that advancements in see and avoid technology could  lead to reduced aircraft separation requirements and, in turn, to increased  airspace capacity. Five experts indicated that technological improvements  could benefit the airspace, and four indicated that such improvements  could benefit airports. Additionally, five experts predicted that UASs  could provide a variety of benefits by assuming some of the missions  currently performed by manned aircraft or surface vehicles. These experts  predicted that UASs might perform these missions in less congested  airspace or with engines that burn less fuel or produce less air pollution.", "Some experts view the routine use of UASs in the national airspace system  as a revolutionary change in aviation. According to one study, the state of  UASs today resembles the early days of manned aviation where innovation  and entrepreneurial spirit spawned a new market and permanently  changed the transportation landscape. The UAS industry is poised to meet  the potential demand for UASs. A 2004 study, prepared for JPDO, reported  that 49 UAS manufacturers operated in the United States.

These requirements call for a person operating an aircraft to maintain  vigilance so as to see and avoid other aircraft. Without a pilot on board to  scan the sky, UASs do not have an on-board capability to directly \u201csee\u201d  other aircraft. Consequently, the UAS must possess the capability to sense  and avoid the object using on-board equipment, or do so with assistance of  a human on the ground or in a chase aircraft, or by using other means,  such as radar. Many UASs, particularly smaller models, will likely operate  at altitudes below 18,000 feet, sharing airspace with other objects, such as  gliders. Sensing and avoiding these other objects represents a particular  challenge for UASs, since the other objects normally do not transmit an  electronic signal to identify themselves and FAA cannot mandate that all  aircraft or objects possess this capability so that UASs can operate safely.  Many small UAS models do not have equipment to detect such signals and,  in some cases, are too small to carry such equipment. The Aircraft Owners  and Pilots Association, in a 2006 survey of its membership, found that  UASs\u2019 inability to see and avoid manned aircraft is a priority concern.  Additionally, the experts we surveyed suggested, more frequently than any  other alternative, conducting further work on detect, sense, and avoid  technology as an interim step to facilitate UAS integration into the national  airspace system while FAA develops a regulatory structure for routine  UAS operations.", "The effort to develop the Traffic Alert and Collision and Avoidance System  (TCAS), used widely in manned aircraft to help prevent collisions,  demonstrates the challenge of developing a detect, sense, and avoid  capability for UASs. Although FAA, airlines, and several private-sector  companies developed TCAS over a 13-year period, at a cost of more than  $500 million, FAA officials point out that the designers did not intend for  TCAS to act as the sole means of avoiding collisions and that the on board  pilot still has the responsibility for seeing and avoiding other aircraft. FAA  officials also point out that TCAS computes collision avoidance solutions  based on characteristics of manned aircraft, and does not incorporate  UASs\u2019 slower turn and climb rates in developing conflict solutions.  Consequently, FAA officials and stakeholders we interviewed believe that  developing the detect, sense, and avoid technology that UASs would need  to operate routinely in the national airspace system poses an even greater  challenge than TCAS did. FAA officials believe that an acceptable detect,  sense, and avoid system for UASs could cost up to $2 billion to complete  and is still many years away."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UASs Have Communications, Command, Control, and Physical Security Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring uninterrupted command and control for a UAS is important  because without it, the UAS could collide with another aircraft or, if it  crashes to the earth, cause injury or property damage. The lack of  protected radio frequency spectrum for UAS operations heightens the  possibility that an operator could lose command and control of the UAS.  Unlike manned aircraft, which use dedicated, protected radio frequencies,  UASs currently use unprotected radio spectrum and, like any other  wireless technology, remain vulnerable to unintentional or intentional  interference. This remains a key security vulnerability for UASs, because  in contrast to a manned aircraft where the pilot has direct, physical  control of the aircraft, interruption of radio frequency, such as by  jamming, can sever the UASs\u2019 only means of control. One of the experts  we surveyed listed providing security and protected spectrum among the  critical UAS integration technologies.", "To address the potential interruption of command and control, UASs  generally have pre-programmed maneuvers to follow if the command and  control link becomes interrupted (called a \u201clost-link scenario\u201d) and a  means for safe return to the ground if operators cannot reestablish the  communications link before the UAS runs out of fuel. However, these  procedures are not standardized across all types of UASs and, therefore,  remain unpredictable to air traffic controllers. Predictability of UAS  performance under a lost link scenario is particularly important for air  traffic controllers who have responsibility for ensuring safe separation of  aircraft in their airspace.", "Ensuring continuity of UAS command and control also depends on the  physical security provided to UASs. Presently, UAS operations in the  national airspace are limited and take place under closely controlled  conditions. However, this could change if UASs have routine access to the  national airspace. One study identifies security as a significant issue that  could be exacerbated with the proliferation of UASs. TSA notes that in  2004, terrorists flew a UAS over northern Israel. One stakeholder  questioned how we could prevent this from happening in the United  States. UASs have the capability to deliver nuclear, biological, or chemical  payloads, and can be launched undetected from virtually any site. In  response to the events of September 11, 2001, entry doors to passenger  airplane cockpits were hardened to prevent unauthorized entry. However,  no similar security requirements exist to prevent unauthorized access to  UAS ground control stations\u2014the UAS equivalent of the cockpit.

About 65 percent of the accidents resulted  from materiel issues, such as failures of UAS components.", "Studies indicate that a number of factors could contribute to UAS  reliability problems. Many UASs have been designed primarily as  expendable or experimental vehicles, where factors such as cost, weight,  function, and performance outweigh reliability concerns, according to a  2004 study. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2006 that the  lack of reliability stems from the fact that UAS technology is still evolving,  and, consequently, less redundancy is built into the operating system of  UASs than of manned aircraft, and until redundant systems are perfected,  accident rates are expected to remain high. Reliability issues also stem  from the nature of the components used in some UASs. A DOD report  notes that there has been a tendency to design UASs at low cost using  readily available materials that were not intended for use in an aviation  environment.

Researchers noted that UASs, similar to any  new technology, have been designed by engineers who focused on getting  the technology to work, without considering human factors, such as ease  of use by non-engineers. FAA officials noted that UASs today are at a  similar stage as personal computers in their early years before newer,  more user-friendly operating systems became standard. Studies indicate  that human factors issues have contributed to military UAS accidents and  DOD has indicated the need for further work in this area. Our analysis of  DOD\u2019s data on UAS accidents during Operation Enduring Freedom and  Operation Iraqi Freedom showed that 17 percent were due to human  factors issues.", "Several human factors issues have yet to be resolved. For example, the  number of UASs that a single ground-based pilot can safely operate  remains undetermined, as some future scenarios envision a single pilot  operating several UASs simultaneously. Other unresolved issues include  how pilots or air traffic controllers respond to the lag in communication of  information from the UAS, the skill set and medical qualifications required  for UAS pilots, and UAS pilot training requirements.", "The variety of ground control station designs across UASs is another  human factors concern. For example, pilots of the Predator B UAS control  the aircraft by using a stick and pedals, similar to the actions of pilots of  manned aircraft. In contrast, pilots of the Global Hawk UAS use a  keyboard and mouse to control the aircraft. Differences in UAS missions  could require some variation among control station designs, but the extent  to which regulations should require commonalities across all ground  control stations awaits further research.", "The transition from one crew to another while UASs are airborne serves as  another human factors issue needing resolution. Because UASs have the  capability of extended flight, one crew can hand off control to another  during a mission. Several military UAS accidents have occurred during  these handoffs, according to a 2005 research study. The National  Transportation Safety Board cited a similar issue in its report on the April  26, 2006, crash of CBP\u2019s Predator B UAS. According to the report, the pilot  inadvertently cut off the UAS\u2019s fuel supply when he switched from a  malfunctioning console to a functioning one. When the switch was made,  a lever on the second console remained in a position that would cut off the  fuel supply if an operator used the console to control the aircraft.  Although procedures required that the controls on the two consoles be  matched prior to making such a switch, this procedure was not followed.  CBP reports that it has taken action to address this issue and has also  addressed nearly all of the board\u2019s other recommendations stemming from  this accident.", "A remote pilot\u2019s lack of situational awareness serves as another human  factors-related challenge for the safe operation of UASs. For example, FAA  officials have noted that situational awareness remains a key factor for  operators to detect and appropriately respond to turbulence. A pilot on  board an aircraft can physically sense and assess the severity of  turbulence being encountered, whereas a remote pilot cannot. A UAS  could break apart and become a hazard to other aircraft or to persons or  property on the ground if the pilot has no indication of turbulence or its  severity. Even if a remote pilot had an awareness of the turbulence, the  level of risk that the pilot might accept needs further study. Because a  pilot does not risk his own safety when operating a UAS, the pilot may  operate the UAS in situations unsuitable for the aircraft, such as flying  through turbulence strong enough to destroy the UAS\u2019s airframe.", "Although many experts and aviation stakeholders believe that the  technical issues discussed above represent difficult challenges for UAS  integration into the national airspace system, others do not. For example,  DOD\u2019s Unmanned Systems Roadmap asserts that the technology for  detecting and maneuvering to avoid objects does not present a major  obstacle. Some experts responding to our survey expressed similar  opinions. For example, one noted that technology needed to safely  integrate UASs into the national airspace system exists today and that  implementation should be the focus. Another said that FAA is too slow in  adopting new technology and that sense and avoid techniques are  available today that, when used in combination with a qualified pilot at the  ground station\u2019s controls, would be sufficient to allow free access for  larger UASs.

Congress directed  JPDO to prepare an integrated plan that would include, among other  things, a national vision statement and a multiagency research and  development roadmap for creating NextGen. The legislation called for the  roadmap to identify obstacles, the research and development necessary to  overcome them, and the roles of each agency, corporations, and  universities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Impact of Routine UAS Operations Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["The impact of routine UAS operations on the national airspace system and  the environment depends on a number of factors and remains generally  speculative. UAS impact will depend on factors such as the number of  UASs purchased for civil uses and the altitudes and geographic locations  where they are used. Stakeholders whom we interviewed provided a  variety of perspectives on UASs\u2019 potential impact. One official told us that  UASs that use airports will impact air traffic control, while the impact of  small UASs that do not need to use airports is less clear. Officials also  noted that the level of risk depends on factors such as the UAS\u2019s weight  and horsepower. For example, a small, 2- or 3-pound UAS would pose little  risk to aircraft or people on the ground, but UASs weighing more than      20 pounds could do significant damage to an aircraft. Officials also noted  that a UAS used over a sparsely populated area would have less impact  than UAS operations over densely populated areas.", "Predictions of the impact of UASs on the national airspace system are  speculative because there are few data upon which to base predictions.  Predictions become even more speculative in view of RTCA\u2019s recent  estimate that minimum standards for UASs\u2014a prerequisite for routine  UAS access to the national airspace system\u2014will require about another 10  years to complete. One study notes that more needs to be known about the  needs and capabilities of future UASs as well as the potential market, but  concluded that their operations could have a significant and potentially  disruptive impact on aviation by affecting capacity and introducing more  complexity. In 2007, RTCA\u2019s Special Committee 203 reported similar  concerns, indicating that UASs will create some unique challenges  because they operate differently from typical manned aircraft. While  manned aircraft generally go from one location to another, UASs may  hover or circle in one location for a significant time. Additionally, UAS  speed, maneuverability, climb rate and other performance characteristics  may differ substantially from those of conventional aircraft. The  committee believes that these characteristics could affect air traffic flow,  air traffic controller workload, and departure and arrival procedures,  among other things. Similarly, FAA officials noted that UASs pose airport  safety and capacity questions that require further analysis.", "Most of the experts stated that the impact of UAS\u2019s would be at least as  significant as that of additional manned aircraft on airspace, airports, and  air traffic control. For example, they predicted that, as with manned  aircraft, UASs would add to the number of aircraft and, therefore, affect  airspace and airport capacity and add to the workload of air traffic  controllers. However, the experts also predicted that UASs could have a  beneficial impact on the environment. The experts predicted that UASs  could assume some missions currently performed by manned aircraft, but  could perform these missions using engines that burn less fuel or produce  less air pollution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Although ensuring that UASs operate safely in the national airspace  system is a new and complex challenge for FAA, the national airspace  system should be prepared to accommodate them. Understanding the  issues, trends, and influences of UASs will be critical in strategically  planning for the future airspace system. FAA is making progress in  addressing the challenges. Establishing a UAS test center to provide UAS  developers with airspace in which to test, evaluate, and refine their  aircraft designs, and initiating efforts to increase airspace access for small  UASs are significant steps. Moving forward, issuing FAA\u2019s long-awaited  program plan should benefit the aviation community by communicating  FAA\u2019s strategy of how it plans to address the interactive complexities and  unique properties of UASs and how it plans to leverage the resources of  multiple entities that have expertise and experience in this area. FAA\u2019s  efforts to accumulate and analyze data will be important to facilitate the  regulatory development process. However, analyzing the data that it  already has collected from recent UAS operations would further support  decisions on the new regulations. FAA\u2019s new estimate that the regulatory  framework is not likely to be completed until sometime near 2020\u2014about  8 years later than the date assumed by the industry forecast cited in this  report\u2014could further delay the time frame when civil-use UAS production  begins to increase. While TSA\u2019s risk assessment of UASs may be  appropriate for today\u2019s UAS environment, a national airspace system that  allows routine UAS access for all government and private UASs will  require increased safeguards to protect against security vulnerabilities like  those exposed in the events of September 11, 2001. Proactively assessing  and addressing these issues will help ensure that the benefits of UASs are  not further delayed pending resolution of security challenges. Additionally,  it will be important for GSA to follow through and ensure that federal  agencies report all of their owned or leased UASs, so that FAA has a more  accurate basis for workload planning. It remains to be seen whether  Europe will be successful in integrating UASs into its airspace by 2015,  which is considerably sooner than the 2020 time frame expected in the  United States.
