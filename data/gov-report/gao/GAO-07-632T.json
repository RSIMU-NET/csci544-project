US-VISIT is designed to collect, maintain, and share data on selected foreign nationals entering and exiting the United States at air, sea, and land POEs. These data, including biometric identifiers like digital fingerprints, are to be used to screen persons against watch lists, verify identities, and record arrival and departure. This testimony addresses DHS's efforts to (1) implement US-VISIT entry capability, (2) implement US-VISIT exit capability, and (3) resolve longstanding management challenges that could impair DHS's ability to effectively implement the US-VISIT program. GAO analyzed DHS and US-VISIT documents, interviewed program officials, and visited 21 land POEs with varied traffic levels on both borders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS is operating US-VISIT entry capabilities at most POEs and has begun to work to move from 2 to 10 fingerprint biometric capabilities and expand electronic information sharing with stakeholders. Of particular note is the fact that a US-VISIT biometric-based entry screening capability is operating at 115 airports, 14 seaports, and 154 land POEs. While US-VISIT has improved DHS's ability to process visitors and verify identities upon entry, we found that management controls in place to identify and evaluate computer and other operational problems at land POEs were insufficient and inconsistently administered. Although US-VISIT has conducted various exit demonstration projects at a small number of POEs, a biometric exit capability is not currently available. According to program officials, this is due to a number of factors. For example, at this time the only proven technology available for biometric land exit verification would necessitate mirroring the processes currently in use for entry at these POEs, which would create costly staffing demands and infrastructure requirements, and introduce potential trade, commerce, and environmental impacts. Further, a pilot project to examine an alternative technology at land POEs did not produce a viable solution. By statute, DHS was to have reported to Congress by June 2005 on how it intended to fully implement a comprehensive, biometric entry/exit program, but DHS had not yet reported how it intended to do so, or use nonbiometric solutions. DHS continues to face longstanding US-VISIT management challenges and future uncertainties. For example, DHS had not articulated how US-VISIT is to strategically fit with other land border security initiatives and mandates and could not ensure that these programs work in harmony to meet mission goals and operate cost effectively. DHS had drafted a strategic plan defining an overall immigration and border management strategy but, as of February 2007, the plan was under review by the Office of Management and Budget. Further, critical acquisition management processes need to be established and followed to ensure that program capabilities and expected mission outcomes are delivered on time and within budget. These processes include effective project planning, requirements management, contract tracking and oversight, test management, and financial management. Until these issues are addressed, the risk of US-VISIT continuing to fall short of expectations is increased."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide a summary of our  work on the challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) as it implements United States Visitor and Immigrant Status  Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) at air, sea, and land ports of entry  (POE).", "In the years since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the need to secure U.S.  borders has taken on added importance and has received increasing  attention from Congress and the public. In an effort to avoid repetition of  such attacks, and improve overall national security, Congress and the  Administration have sought better ways to record and track the entry and  departure of foreign visitors who pass through U.S. POEs by air, land, or  sea; to verify their identities; and to authenticate their travel  documentation. Pursuant to several statutory mandates, DHS, in  consultation with the Department of State, established an automated  visitor system to integrate information on the entry and exit from the  United States of foreign nationals, called the US-VISIT Program. According  to DHS, the purpose of US-VISIT is to enhance the security of U.S. citizens  and visitors, facilitate legitimate travel and trade, ensure the integrity of  the U.S. immigration system, and protect visitors\u2019 privacy. The program is  managed by the US-VISIT Program Office, which is headed by the US- VISIT Director, who currently reports to the DHS Deputy Secretary.  However, as of March 31, 2007, the US-VISIT Program Office is expected  to report to the newly established Under Secretary for the National  Protection and Program Directorate.  US-VISIT is used in the field by  officers with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a separate DHS  component.", "US-VISIT is designed to use biographic information (e.g., name,  nationality, and date of birth) and biometric information (e.g., digital  fingerprint scans and photographs) to verify the identity of those covered  by the program. The program applies to certain visitors whether they hold  a nonimmigrant visa or are traveling from a country that has a visa waiver  agreement with the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. U.S.  citizens, lawful permanent residents, and most Canadian and Mexican  citizens are currently exempt from being processed under US-VISIT upon  entering and exiting the country.", "Many aspects of US-VISIT program implementation have been driven or  defined by various legislative mandates. These include a 2001 statutory  requirement to focus particularly on the use of biometric technology in  developing the integrated entry-exit system subsequently named US-VISIT;  a 2002 statutory requirement to develop biometric identifier standards to  be used to verify the identity of persons seeking to enter the United States  at POEs; and a requirement to install at all POEs equipment and software  to allow biometric comparison and authentication of U.S. visas and other  travel and entry documents issued to aliens, as well as Visa Waiver  Program participant passports. In addition, by law, an integrated entry and  exit data system was to be implemented at all U.S. POEs, including land  POEs, by December 31, 2005, but there was no specific requirement to  collect any new data on foreign nationals departing at land POEs by that  date. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, on  the other hand, did require the collection of biometric exit data for all  individuals subject to US-VISIT, but it did not set a deadline for  implementation of this requirement.", "My testimony today draws on this body of completed work to provide a  snapshot of what US-VISIT capabilities have and have not been delivered,  what work has recently begun to enhance already delivered capabilities,  and the range of longstanding challenges that hamper DHS efforts to  establish and live up to program expectations and commitments. All the  work on which this testimony is based was performed in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["US-VISIT is a large, complex governmentwide program intended to    collect, maintain, and share information on certain foreign nationals  who enter and exit the United States;  identify foreign nationals who (1) have overstayed or violated the terms  of their visit; (2) can receive, extend, or adjust their immigration status;  or (3) should be apprehended or detained by law enforcement officials;    detect fraudulent travel documents, verify visitor identity, and  determine visitor admissibility through the use of biometrics (digital  fingerprints and a digital photograph); and  facilitate information sharing and coordination within the immigration  and border management community.", "The US-VISIT Program Office has responsibility for managing the  acquisition, deployment, operation, and sustainment of US-VISIT and has  been delivering US-VISIT capability incrementally based, in part, on  statutory deadlines for implementing specific portions of US-VISIT. For  example, the statutory deadline for implementing US-VISIT at the 50  busiest land POEs was December 31, 2004, and at the remaining POEs,  December 31, 2005. From fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2007, total  funding for the US-VISIT program has been about $1.7 billion.  According  to program officials, as of January 31, 2007, almost $1.3 billion has been  obligated to acquire, develop, deploy, enhance, operate, and maintain US- VISIT entry capabilities, and to test and evaluate exit capability options.", "Since 2003, DHS has planned to deliver US-VISIT capability in four  increments: Increment 1 (air and sea entry and exit), Increment 2 (air, sea,  and land entry and exit), Increment 3 (land entry), and Increment 4, which  is to define, design, build, and implement more strategic program  capability, and which program officials stated will consist of a series of  incremental releases or mission capability enhancements that will support  business outcomes. In Increments 1 through 3, the program has built  interfaces among existing (\u201clegacy\u201d) systems, enhanced the capabilities of  these systems, and deployed these capabilities to air, sea, and land POEs.  The capabilities that DHS currently has regarding the first three  increments have been largely acquired and implemented through existing  system contracts and task orders.", "In reports on US-VISIT over the last several years, we have identified  numerous challenges that DHS faces in delivering program capabilities  and benefits on time and within budget. In September 2003, we reported  that the US-VISIT program is a risky endeavor, both because of the type of  program it is (large, complex, and potentially costly) and because of the  way that it was being managed. We reported, for example, that the  program\u2019s acquisition management process had not been established, and  that US-VISIT lacked a governance structure. In March 2004, we testified  that DHS faces a major challenge maintaining border security while still  welcoming visitors. Preventing the entry of persons who pose a threat to  the United States cannot be guaranteed, and the missed entry of just one  can have severe consequences. Also, US-VISIT is to achieve the important  law enforcement goal of identifying those who overstay or otherwise  violate the terms of their visas. Complicating the achievement of these  security and law enforcement goals are other key US-VISIT goals:  facilitating trade and travel through POEs and providing for enforcement  of U.S. privacy laws and regulations. Subsequently, in May 2004, we  reported that DHS had not employed the kind of rigorous and disciplined  management controls typically associated with successful programs.  Moreover, in February 2006, we reported that while DHS had taken steps  to implement most of the recommendations from our 2003 and 2004  reports, progress in critical areas had been slow. As of February 2006, of  18 recommendations we made since 2003, only 2 had been fully  implemented, 11 had been partially implemented, and 5 were in the  process of being implemented, although the extent to which they would be  fully carried out is not yet known.  In addition, in June 2006, we reported  that US-VISIT contract and financial management needed to be  strengthened; in December 2006, we reported that the US-VISIT program  faced strategic, operational and technological challenges at land ports of  entry; and in February 2007, we reported that planned expenditures for the  US-VISIT program needed to be adequately defined and justified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "US-VISIT Scope, Operations, and Processing at POEs", "paragraphs": ["Currently, US-VISIT\u2019s scope includes the pre-entry, entry, status, and exit  of hundreds of millions of foreign national travelers who enter and leave  the United States at over 300 air, sea, and land POEs. Most land border  crossers\u2014including U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and most  Canadian and Mexican citizens\u2014are, by regulation or statute, not required  to enroll into US-VISIT. In fiscal year 2004, for example, U.S. citizens and  lawful permanent residents constituted about 57 percent of land border  crossers; Canadian and Mexican citizens constituted about 41 percent; and  less than 2 percent were US-VISIT enrollees. Figure 1 shows the number  and percentage of persons processed under US-VISIT as a percentage of  all border crossings at land, air, and sea POEs in fiscal year 2004.", "Foreign nationals subject to US-VISIT who intend to enter the country  encounter different inspection processes at different types of POEs  depending on their mode of travel. Those who intend to enter the United  States at an air or sea POE are to be processed, for purposes of US-VISIT,  in the primary inspection area upon arrival. Generally, these visitors are  subject to prescreening, before they arrive, via passenger manifests, which  are forwarded to CBP by commercial air or sea carrier in advance of  arrival. By contrast, foreign nationals intending to enter the United States  at land POEs are generally not subject to prescreening because they arrive  in private vehicles or on foot and there is no manifest to record their  pending arrival. Thus, when foreign nationals subject to US-VISIT arrive at  a land POE in vehicles, they initially enter the primary inspection area  where CBP officers, often located in booths, are to visually inspect travel  documents and query the visitors about such matters as their place of birth  and proposed destination. Visitors arriving as pedestrians enter an  equivalent primary inspection area, generally inside a CBP building. If the  CBP officer believes a more detailed inspection is needed or if the visitors  are required to be processed under US-VISIT, the visitors are to be  referred to the secondary inspection area\u2014an area away from the primary  inspection area\u2014which is generally inside a facility. The secondary  inspection area inside the facility generally contains office space, waiting  areas, and space to process visitors, including US-VISIT enrollees.  Equipment used for US-VISIT processing includes a computer, printer,  digital camera, and a two-fingerprint scanner. Visitors covered by US- VISIT who are determined to be admissible are issued an I-94  arrival/departure form, which, among other things, records their date of  arrival and the date their authorized period of admission expires."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Installed US- VISIT Biometric Entry Capability at Nearly All POEs, but Faces Challenges Identifying and Monitoring the Operational Impacts on Land POE Facilities", "paragraphs": ["The US-VISIT program office has largely met its expectations relative to a  biometric entry capability. For example, on January 5, 2004, it deployed  and began operating most aspects of its planned biometric entry capability  at 115 airports and 14 seaports for selected foreign nationals, including  those from visa waiver countries; as of December 2006, the program  office had deployed and began operating this entry capability in the  secondary inspection areas of 154 of 170 land POEs. According to program  officials, 14 of the remaining 16 POEs have no operational need to deploy  US-VISIT because visitors who are required to be processed through US- VISIT are, by regulation, not authorized to enter into the United States at  these locations. The other two POEs do not have entry capability  deployed because they do not have the necessary transmission lines to  operate US-VISIT; CBP officers at those sites have continued to process  visitors manually.  CBP officials told us that US-VISIT\u2019s entry capability  has generally enhanced their ability to process visitors subject to US-VISIT  by providing assurance that visitors\u2019 identities can be confirmed through  biometric identifiers and by automating the paperwork associated with  processing I-94 arrival/departure forms.", "To the department\u2019s credit, the development and deployment of this entry  capability was largely in accordance with legislative time lines and has  occurred during a period of considerable organizational change, starting  with the creation of DHS from 23 separate agencies in early 2003, followed  by the birth of a US-VISIT program office shortly thereafter\u2014which was  only about 5 months before the program had to meet its first legislative  milestone. Compounding these program challenges was the fact that the  systems that were to be used in building and deploying a biometric entry  capability were managed and operated by a number of the separate  agencies that had been merged to form the new department, each of which  was governed by different policies, procedures, and standards.", "Moreover, DHS reports that US-VISIT entry capabilities have produced  results. According to US-VISIT's Consolidated Weekly Summary Report, as  of December 28, 2006, there have been more than 5,400 biometric hits in  primary entry, resulting in more than 1,300 people having adverse actions,  such as denial of entry, taken against them. According to the report, about  4,100 of these hits occurred at air and sea ports of entry and over 1,300 at  land ports of entry. Further, the report indicates that more than 1,800  biometric hits have been referred to DHS's immigration enforcement unit,  resulting in 293 arrests. We did not verify the information in the  consolidated report.", "Another potential consequence, although difficult to demonstrate, is the  deterrent effect of having an operational entry capability. Although  deterrence is not an expressly stated goal of the program, officials have  cited it as a potential byproduct of having a publicized capability at the  border to screen entry on the basis of identity verification and matching  against watch lists of known and suspected terrorists. Accordingly, the  deterrent potential of the knowledge that unwanted entry may be thwarted  and the perpetrators caught is arguably a layer of security that should not  be overlooked.", "Despite these results, US-VISIT\u2019s entry capability at land POEs has not  been without operational and system performance problems. During  recent visits to land POEs, we identified some space constraints and other  capacity issues. For example, at the Nogales-Morley Gate POE in Arizona,  where up to 6,000 visitors are processed daily (and up to 10,000 on  holidays), equipment was installed but not used because of CBP concerns  about its ability to carry out the US-VISIT process in a constrained space  while thousands of other people not subject to US-VISIT are processed  through the facility daily. Thus, visitors that are to be processed into US- VISIT from Morley Gate are directed to return to Mexico (a few feet away)  and to walk approximately 100 yards to the Nogales-DeConcini POE  facility, which has the capability to handle secondary inspections of this  kind.", "Going forward, DHS plans to introduce changes and enhancements to US- VISIT at land POEs intended to further bolster CBP\u2019s ability to verify the  identity of individuals entering the country, including a transition from  digitally scanning 2 fingerprints to scanning 10. While such changes are  intended to further enhance border security, deploying them may have an  impact on aging and space-constrained land POE facilities because they  could increase inspection times and adversely affect POE operations. Our  site visits, interviews with US-VISIT and CBP officials, and the work of  others suggest that both before and after US-VISIT entry capability was  installed at land POEs, these facilities faced a number of challenges\u2014 operational and physical\u2014including space constraints complicated by the  logistics of processing high volumes of visitors and associated traffic  congestion. Moreover, our work over the past 3 years showed that the US- VISIT program office had not taken necessary steps to help ensure that  US-VISIT entry capability operates as intended. For example, in February  2006 we reported that the approach taken by the US-VISIT Program Office  to evaluate the impact of US-VISIT on land POE facilities focused on  changes in I-94 processing time at 5 POEs and did not examine other  operational factors, such as US-VISIT\u2019s impact on physical facilities or  work force requirements. As a result, program officials did not always  have the information they needed to anticipate problems that occurred,  such as problems processing high volumes of visitors in space-constrained  facilities.", "In addition, we found that management controls did not always alert US- VISIT and CBP to operational problems. Our standards for internal  controls in the federal government state that it is important for agencies to  have controls in place to help ensure that policies and procedures are  applied and that managers be made aware of problems so that that they  can be addressed and resolved in a timely fashion. CBP officials at 12 of  21 land POE sites we visited told us about US-VISIT-related computer  slowdowns and freezes that adversely affected visitor processing and  inspection times, and at 9 of the 12 sites, computer processing problems  were not always reported to CBP\u2019s computer help desk, as required by  CBP guidelines. Although various controls are in place to alert US-VISIT  and CBP officials to problems as they occur, these controls did not alert  officials to all problems, given that they had been unaware of the problems  we identified before we brought them to their attention. These computer  processing problems have the potential to not only inconvenience  travelers because of the increased time needed to complete the inspection  process, but to compromise security, particularly if CBP officers are  unable to perform biometric checks\u2014one of the critical reasons US-VISIT  was installed at POEs.", "Our internal control standards also call for agencies to establish  performance measures throughout the organization so that actual  performance can be compared to expected results. While the US-VISIT  Program Office established performance measures for fiscal years 2005  and 2006 intended to gauge performance of various aspects of US-VISIT at  air, sea, and land POEs in the aggregate, performance measures  specifically for land POEs had not been developed. It is important to do so,  given that there are significant operational and facility differences among  these different types of POEs. Additional performance measures that  consider operational and facility differences at land POEs would put US- VISIT program officials in a better position to identify problems, trends,  and areas needing improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing a Biometric US-VISIT Exit Capability has Been a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["DHS has devoted considerable time and resources toward establishing an  operational exit capability. Over the last 4 years, it has committed over  $160 million to pilot test and evaluate an exit solution at 12 air, 2 sea, and 5   land POEs.  Despite this considerable investment of time and resources,  the US-VISIT program still does not have either an operational exit  capability or a viable exit solution to deploy to all air, sea, and land POEs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Biometric Exit Capability is being Tested at Air and Sea POEs, But Operational Concerns Need to be Addressed", "paragraphs": ["Although US-VISIT is pilot testing a biometric exit capability for air and  sea POEs, it is not currently available at all ports.  In January 2004, devices  for collecting biometric data were deployed to one airport and one seaport  on a pilot basis. Subsequently, this pilot was expanded to 12 airports and 2  seaports.  The pilot tested several exit alternatives, including an enhanced  kiosk (a self-service device that captures a digital photograph and  fingerprint, and prints out an encoded receipt), a mobile device (a hand- held device operated by a workstation attendant that captures a digital  photograph and fingerprint), and a validator (a hand-held device operated  by a workstation attendant that captures a digital photograph and  fingerprint and then matches the captured photograph and fingerprint to  the ones originally captured via the kiosk and encoded in the receipt).", "Each alternative required the traveler to comply with inspection  processes.  The pilot was completed in May 2005, and established the  technical feasibility of a biometric exit solution. However, it identified  issues that limited the operational effectiveness of the solution, such as  the lack of traveler compliance with the processes.", "The fiscal year 2006 expenditure plan allocated $33.5 million to continue  the exit pilots for air and sea POEs. According to program officials, US- VISIT is now developing a plan for deploying a comprehensive, affordable  exit solution.  However, no time frame has been established for this plan  being approved or implemented. Meanwhile, US-VISIT plans to conduct a  second pilot phase at air and sea POEs that will involve multiple  operational scenarios which would compel greater traveler compliance,  such as repositioning the kiosks, integrating biometric exit into airport  check-in processes, integrating biometric exit into existing airline  processes, integrating biometric exit into Transportation Security  Administration screening checkpoints, and enhancing the use of  Immigration and Customs Enforcement programs intended for  enforcement, such as screening of targeted flights at selected airports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Factors Have Prevented US-VISIT from Implementing a Biometric Exit Capability at Land POEs", "paragraphs": ["Various factors have prevented US-VISIT from implementing a biometric  exit capability at land POEs. Federal laws require the creation of a US- VISIT exit capability using biometric verification methods to ensure that  the identity of visitors leaving the country can be matched biometrically  against their entry records. However, according to officials at the US- VISIT Program Office and CBP and US-VISIT program documentation,  there are interrelated logistical, technological, and infrastructure  constraints that have precluded DHS from achieving this mandate, and  there are cost factors related to the feasibility of implementation of such a  solution. The major constraint to performing biometric verification upon  exit at this time, in the US-VISIT Program Office\u2019s view, is that the only  proven technology available would necessitate mirroring the processes  currently in use for US-VISIT at entry. A mirror image system for exit  would, like one for entry, require CBP officers at land POEs to examine  the travel documents of those leaving the country, take fingerprints,  compare visitors\u2019 facial features to photographs, and, if questions about  identity arise, direct the departing visitor to secondary inspection for  additional questioning. These steps would be carried out for exiting  pedestrians as well as for persons exiting in vehicles. The US-VISIT  Program Office concluded in January 2005 that the mirror-imaging  solution was \u201can infeasible alternative for numerous reasons, including but  not limited to, the additional staffing demands, new infrastructure  requirements, and potential trade and commerce impacts.\u201d", "US-VISIT officials told us that they anticipated that a biometric exit  process mirroring that used for entry could result in delays at land POEs  with heavy daily volumes of visitors. And they stated that in order to  implement a mirror image biometric exit capability, additional lanes for  exiting vehicles and additional inspection booths and staff would be  needed, though they had not determined precisely how many. According  to these officials, it is unclear how new traffic lanes and new facilities  could be built at land POEs where space constraints already exist, such as  those in congested urban areas. (For example, San Ysidro, California,  currently has 24 entry lanes, each with its own staffed booth and 6  unstaffed exit lanes. Thus, if full biometric exit capability were  implemented using a mirror image approach, San Ysidro\u2019s current capacity  of 6 exit lanes would have to be expanded to 24 exit lanes.) As shown in  figure 3, based on observations during our site visit to the San Ysidro POE,  the facility is surrounded by dense urban infrastructure, leaving little, if  any, room to expand in place. Some of the 24 entry lanes for vehicle traffic  heading northward from Mexico into the United States appear in the  bottom left portion of the photograph, where vehicles are shown waiting  to approach primary inspection at the facility; the 6 exit lanes (traffic  toward Mexico), which do not have fixed inspection facilities, are at the  upper left.", "Other POE facilities are similarly space-constrained. At the POE at  Nogales-DeConcini, Arizona, for example, we observed that the facility is  bordered by railroad tracks, a parking lot, and industrial or commercial  buildings. In addition, CBP has identified space constraints at some rural  POEs. For example, the Thousand Islands Bridge POE at Alexandria Bay,  New York, is situated in what POE officials described as a \u201cgeological  bowl,\u201d with tall rock outcroppings potentially hindering the ability to  expand facilities at the current location. Officials told us that in order to  accommodate existing and anticipated traffic volume upon entry, they are  in the early stages of planning to build an entirely new POE on a hill about  a half-mile south of the present facility. CBP officials at the Blaine-Peace  Arch POE in Washington state said that CBP also is considering whether  to relocate and expand the POE facility, within the next 5 to 10 years, to  better handle existing and projected traffic volume. According to the US- VISIT program officials, none of the plans for any expanded, renovated, or  relocated POE include a mirror image addition of exit lanes or facilities  comparable to those existing for entry.", "In 2003, the US-VISIT Program Office estimated that it would cost  approximately $3 billion to implement US-VISIT entry and exit capability  at land POEs where US-VISIT was likely to be installed and that such an  effort would have a major impact on facility infrastructure at land POEs.  We did not assess the reliability of the 2003 estimate. The cost estimate did  not separately break out costs for entry and exit construction, but did  factor in the cost for building additional exit vehicle lanes and booths as  well as buildings and other infrastructure that would be required to  accommodate a mirror imaging at exit of the capabilities required for entry  processing. US-VISIT program officials told us that they provided this  estimate to congressional staff during a briefing, but that the reaction to  this projected cost was negative and that they therefore did not move  ahead with this option. No subsequent cost estimate updates had been  prepared, and DHS\u2019s annual budget requests have not included funds to  build the infrastructure that would be associated with the required  facilities.", "US-VISIT officials stated that they believe that technological advances  over the next 5 to 10 years will make it possible to utilize alternative  technologies that provide biometric verification of persons exiting the  country without major changes to facility infrastructure and without  requiring those exiting to stop and/or exit their vehicles, thereby  precluding traffic backup, congestion, and resulting delays. US-VISIT\u2019s  report assessing biometric alternatives noted that although limitations in  technology currently preclude the use of biometric identification because  visitors would have to be stopped, the use of the as yet undeveloped  biometric verification technology supports the long-term vision of the US- VISIT program. However, no such technology or device currently exists  that would not have a major impact on facilities. The prospects for its  development, manufacture, deployment, and reliable utilization are  currently uncertain or unknown, although a prototype device that would  permit a fingerprint to be read remotely without requiring the visitor to  come to a full stop is under development.", "While logistical, technical, and cost constraints may prevent  implementation of a biometrically based exit technology for US-VISIT at  this time, it is important to note that there currently is not a legislatively  mandated date for implementation of such a solution. The Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires US-VISIT to collect  biometric exit data from all individuals who are required to provide  biometric entry data. The act did not set a deadline, however, for  requiring collection of biometric exit data from all individuals who are  required to provide biometric entry data. Although US-VISIT had set  a  December 2007 deadline for implementing exit capability at the 50 busiest  land POEs, US-VISIT has since determined that implementing exit  capability by this date is no longer feasible, and a new date for doing so  has not been set.", "US-VISIT has tested nonbiometric technology to record travelers\u2019  departure, but testing showed numerous performance and reliability  problems. Because there is at present no biometric technology that can be  used to verify a traveler\u2019s exit from the country at land POEs without also  making major and costly changes to POE infrastructure and facilities, US- VISIT tested radio frequency identification (RFID) technology as a  nonbiometric means of recording visitors as they exit. RFID technology  can be used to electronically identify and gather information contained on  a tag\u2014in this case, a unique identifying number embedded in a tag on a  visitor\u2019s arrival/departure form\u2014which an electronic reader at the POE is  intended to detect. While RFID technology required few facility and  infrastructure changes, US-VISIT\u2019s testing and analysis at five land POEs at  the northern and southern borders identified numerous performance and  reliability problems, such as the failure of RFID readers to detect a  majority of travelers\u2019 tags during testing. For example, according to US- VISIT, at the Blaine-Pacific Highway test site, of 166 vehicles tested during  a 1-week period, RFID readers correctly identified 14 percent\u2014a sizable  departure from the target read rate of 70 percent.", "Another problem that arose was that of cross-reads, in which multiple  RFID readers installed on poles or structures over roads, called gantries,  picked up information from the same visitor, regardless of whether the  individual was entering or exiting in a vehicle or on foot. Thus, cross-reads  resulted in inaccurate record keeping.", "Even if RFID deficiencies were to be fully addressed and deadlines set,  questions remain. For example, the RFID solution did not meet the  congressional requirement for a biometric exit capability because the  technology that had been tested cannot meet a key goal of US-VISIT\u2014 ensuring that visitors who enter the country are the same ones who leave.  By design, an RFID tag embedded in an I-94 arrival/departure form cannot  provide the biometric identity-matching capability that is envisioned as  part of a comprehensive entry/exit border security system using biometric  identifiers for tracking overstays and others entering, exiting, and re- entering the country. Specifically, the RFID tag in the I-94 form cannot be  physically tied to an individual.

In September 2003, we  reported that DHS had not defined key aspects of the larger homeland  security environment in which US-VISIT would need to operate. In the  absence of a DHS-wide operational and technological context, program  officials were making assumptions about certain policy and standards  decisions that had not been made, such as whether official travel  documents would be required for all persons who enter and exit the  country\u2014including U.S. and Canadian citizens\u2014and how many  fingerprints would be collected for biometric comparisons.

According to this official,  the vision provides for an immigration and border management enterprise  that unifies multiple departmental and external stakeholders around  common objectives, strategies, processes, and infrastructures. As of  February 2007, about 2 years later, we were told that this strategic plan  has not yet been approved, although the program\u2019s Acting Director stated  that the plan is currently with OMB and should be provided to the House  and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security by  March 2007.", "However, at the same time, US-VISIT has not taken steps to ensure that  the direction that it is taking is both operationally and technologically  aligned with DHS\u2019s enterprise architecture (EA). As the report that we  issued this week states, the DHS Enterprise Architecture Board, which is  the DHS entity that determines EA compliance, has not reviewed the US- VISIT architecture compliance for more than 2 years. However, since  August 2004, both US-VISIT and the EA have changed. For example,  additional functionality, such as the interoperability of US-VISIT\u2019s  Automated Biometric Information System (IDENT) and the Department of  Justice\u2019s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS),  and the expansion of IDENT to collect t10 rather than 2 fingerprints, has  been added. Also, two versions of the DHS EA have been issued since  August 2004.", "While the strategic plan has not been approved or disseminated, the  program office has developed a strategic vision and blueprint and begun to  implement it. According to program officials, this future vision is to be  delivered through a number of planned mission capability enhancements.  Of these, the first enhancement is underway and is to provide several new  capabilities, including what the program refers to as \u201cUnique Identity,\u201d  which is to include the migration from the 2-fingerprint to 10-fingerprint  collection at program enrollment. It is also to interoperate US-VISIT\u2019s  IDENT system and the Department of Justice\u2019s IAFIS system. Currently,  the US-VISIT officials plan to complete Unique Identity in several phases  and have it fully operational by December 2009, although these plans have  not yet approved by DHS.", "At this same time, DHS has launched other major border security  programs without adequately defining the relationships to US-VISIT and  each other. For example, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2004 directs DHS and the Department of State to  develop and implement a plan, no later than June 2009, that requires U.S.  citizens and foreign nationals of Canada, Bermuda, and Mexico to present  a passport or other document or combination of documents deemed  sufficient to show identity and citizenship to enter the United States (this  is currently not a requirement for these individuals entering the United  States via sea and land POEs from most countries within the western  hemisphere). This effort, known as the Western Hemisphere Travel  Initiative, was first announced in 2005. In May 2006, we reported that DHS  and the Department of State had taken some steps to carry out the  initiative, but they had a long way to go to implement their proposed  plans. Among other things, key decisions had yet to be made about what  documents other than a passport would be acceptable when U.S. citizens  and citizens of Canada enter or return to the United States. Further, while  DHS and Department of State had proposed an alternative form of  passport, called a PASS card, that would rely on RFID technology to help  DHS process U.S. citizens re-entering the country, DHS had not made  decisions involving a broad set of considerations that include (1) utilizing  security features to protect personal information, (2) ensuring that proper  equipment and facilities are in place to facilitate crossings at land borders,  and (3) enhancing compatibility with other border crossing technology  already in use.", "DHS has also initiated another border security program, known as the  Secure Border Initiative (SBI)\u2014a multi-year, multi-billion dollar program,   to secure the borders and reduce illegal immigration by installing state-of- the-art surveillance technologies along the border, increasing border  security personnel, and ensuring information access to DHS personnel at  and between POEs. Under SBI and its component, called SBInet, DHS  plans to integrate personnel, infrastructures, technologies, and rapid  response capability into a comprehensive border protection capability.  DHS reports that, among other things, SBInet is to encompass both the  northern and southern land borders, including the Great Lakes, under a  unified border control strategy whereby CBP is to focus on the  interdiction of cross-border violations between and at the land POEs,  funneling traffic to the land POEs. As part of SBI, DHS also plans to focus  on interior enforcement\u2014disrupting and dismantling cross-border crime  into the interior of the United States while locating and removing aliens  who are present in the United States in violation of law. However, it is  unclear how SBInet will be linked, if at all, to US-VISIT so that the two can  share technology, infrastructure, and data.", "Clearly defining the dependencies among US-VISIT and programs like the  Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative and SBI is important because there  is commonality among their strategic goals and operational environments.  For example, both US-VISIT and SBI share the goal of securing the POEs.  Moreover, there is overlap in the data that each is to produce and use. For  example, both US-VISIT and the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative will  require identification data for travelers at POEs.", "Despite these dependencies, DHS has yet to define these relationships or  how they will be managed. Further, according to a March 6, 2006 memo  from the DHS Joint Requirements Council, the US-VISIT strategic plan did  not provide evidence of sufficient coordination between the program and  the other entities involved in border security and immigration efforts. The  council\u2019s recommendation was that the strategic plan not be approved  until greater coordination between US-VISIT and other components was  addressed.", "According to the Acting Program Director, a number of efforts are  underway to coordinate with other entities, such as with CBP on RFID,  with the Coast Guard on development of a mobile biometric reader, and  with State on standards for document readers.

Thus far, DHS has yet to  develop an adequate basis for knowing whether its incrementally deployed  US-VISIT capabilities represent a good return on investment, particularly  in light of shortfalls in DHS\u2019s assessments of the program\u2019s operational  impacts, including costs of proposed capabilities.

Further, we reported that the cost estimates on which the cost-benefit  analysis was based were of questionable reliability because effective cost- estimating practices were not followed. Most recently, in February 2006,  we reported again that the program office had not justified its investment  in its air and sea exit capability. For example, we reported that while the  cost-benefit analysis explained why the investment was needed, and  considered at least two alternatives to the status quo, which is consistent  with OMB guidance for cost-benefit analyses, it did not include a complete  uncertainty analysis for the three exit alternatives evaluated. Specifically,  it did not include a sensitivity analysis for the three alternatives, which is  a major part of an uncertainty analysis. A complete analysis of uncertainty  is important because it provides decision makers with a perspective on the  potential variability of the cost and benefit estimates should the facts,  circumstances, and assumptions change. Further, the cost estimate upon  which the analysis was based did not meet key criteria for reliable cost  estimating. For example, it did not include a detailed work breakdown  structure, which serves to organize and define the work to be performed  so that associated costs can be identified and estimated.", "Further, as we state in our February 2007 report, DHS has devoted  considerable time and resources toward establishing an operational exit  capability at land, air, and sea POEs. For example, over the last 4 years,  DHS has committed over $160 million to evaluate and operate exit pilots at  selected air, sea, and land POEs. Notwithstanding this considerable  investment of time and resources, the US-VISIT program still does not  have either an operational exit capability or a viable exit solution to  deploy to all air, sea, and land POEs.", "Moreover, US-VISIT exit pilot reports have raised concerns and  limitations. For example, as we previously stated, land exit pilots  experienced several performance problems, such as the failure of RFID  readers to detect a majority of travelers\u2019 tags during testing and cross- reads, in which multiple RFID readers installed on poles or structures over  roads, called gantries, picked up information from the same visitor.", "Notwithstanding these results, we reported in February 2007 that the  program office planned to invest another $33.5 million to continue its air  and sea exit pilots. However, neither the fiscal year 2006 expenditure plan  nor other exit-related program documentation adequately defined what  these efforts entail or what they will accomplish. In particular, the plan  and other exit-related documentation merely state that $33.5 million will  be used to continue air and sea exit pilots while a comprehensive exit  solution is developed. They do not adequately describe measurable  outcomes (benefits and results) from the pilot efforts, or related cost,  schedule, and capability commitments that will be met. Further, the plan  does not recognize the challenges revealed from the prior exit efforts, nor  does it show how proposed exit investments address these challenges. In  addition, the plan allocates more funding for continuing the air and sea  exit pilots ($33.5 million) than the prior year\u2019s plan said would be needed  to fully deploy an operational air and sea exit solution ($32 million).  According to program officials, the air and sea exit pilots are being  continued to maintain a presence intended to provide a deterrent effect at  exit locations, and to gather additional data that could help support  planning for a comprehensive exit solution.", "Moreover, US-VISIT reported in August 2006 that it planned to spend an  additional $21.5 million to continue its land exit demonstration project  without adequate justification. However, we reported in February 2007  that these plans lacked adequate justification in light of the problems we  discussed earlier in this statement. Accordingly, program officials told us  that they intend to terminate the land exit project until a comprehensive  exit strategy can be developed.

We questioned the  validity of the program\u2019s assumptions and plans concerning workforce and  facilities, since the program lacked a basis for determining whether its  assumptions were correct and thus whether its plans were adequate.  Subsequently, the program office evaluated the operational performance  of the land entry capability with the stated purpose of determining the  effectiveness of its performance at the 50 busiest land POEs. For this  evaluation, the program office established a baseline for comparing the  average time it takes to issue and process entry/exit forms at 3 of these 50  POEs, and then conducted two evaluations of the processing times at the  three POEs, one after the entry capability was deployed as a pilot, and  another one 3 months later, after the entry capability was deployed to all  50 POEs. The evaluation results showed that the average processing times  decreased for all three sites.

For example, the selection of the three sites, according to  program officials, was based on a number of factors, including whether  the sites already had sufficient staff to support the pilot. Selecting sites  based on this factor is problematic because it presupposes that all not  POEs have the staff needed to support the land entry capability. In  addition, evaluation conditions were not always held constant:  specifically, fewer workstations were used to process travelers in  establishing the baseline processing times at two of the POEs than were  used during the pilot evaluations.", "Moreover, CBP officials from a land port of entry that was not an  evaluation site (San Ysidro) told us that US-VISIT deployment had not  reduced but actually lengthened processing times.

While such changes are intended to further  enhance border security, deploying them may have an impact on aging and  spatially-constrained land POEs facilities because they could increase  inspection times and adversely affect POEs operations.

In  May 2006, the program conducted a second internal assessment of the six  key process areas, and according to the results of this assessment,  improvements were made, but weaknesses remained in all six process  areas.

But doing so also poses significant challenges; foremost among them  is striking a reasonable balance between US-VISIT\u2019s goals of providing  security to U.S. citizens and visitors while facilitating legitimate trade and  travel.", "DHS has made considerable progress making the entry portion of the US- VISIT program at air, sea and land POEs operational, but our work raised  questions whether DHS has adequately assessed how US-VISIT has  affected operations at land POEs. Because US-VISIT will likely continue to  have an impact on land POE facilities as it evolves\u2014especially as new  technology and equipment are introduced\u2014it is important for US-VISIT  and CBP officials to have sufficient management controls for identifying  and reporting potential computer and other operational problems that  could affect the ability of US-VISIT entry capability to operate as intended.", "With respect to DHS\u2019s effort to create an exit verification capability,  developing and deploying this capability at land POEs has posed a set of  challenges that are distinct from those associated with entry. US-VISIT has  not determined whether it can achieve, in a realistic time frame, or at an  acceptable cost, the legislatively mandated capability to record the exit of  travelers at land POEs using biometric technology. Apart from acquiring  new facilities and infrastructure at an estimated cost of billions of dollars,  US-VISIT officials have acknowledged that no technology now exists to  reliably record travelers\u2019 exit from the country, and to ensure that the  person leaving the country is the same person who entered, without  requiring that person to stop upon exit\u2014potentially imposing a substantial  burden on travelers and commerce. US-VISIT officials stated that they  believe a biometrically based solution that does not require those exiting  the country to stop for processing, that minimizes the need for major  facility changes, and that can be used to definitively match a visitor\u2019s entry  and exit will be available in 5 to 10 years. In the interim, it remains unclear  how DHS plans to proceed. According to statute, DHS was required to  report more than a year ago on its plans for developing a comprehensive  biometric entry and exit system, but DHS has yet to finalize this road map  for Congress. Until DHS finalizes such a plan, neither Congress nor DHS is  likely to have sufficient information as a basis for decisions about various  factors relevant to the success of US-VISIT, ranging from funding needed  for any land POE facility modifications in support of the installation of exit  technology to the trade-offs associated with ensuring traveler convenience  while providing verification of travelers\u2019 departure consistent with US- VISIT\u2019s national security and law enforcement goals.", "Fundamental questions about the program\u2019s future direction and fit within  the larger homeland security context as well as its return on investment  remain unanswered. Moreover, the program is overdue in establishing the  means to ensure that it is pursuing the right US-VISIT solution, and that it  is managing it the right way.  The longer the program proceeds without  these, the greater the risk that the program will not optimally support  mission operations and will fall short of commitments. Measuring and  disclosing the extent to which these commitments are being met are also  essential to holding the department accountable. We look forward to  continuing to work constructively with the US-VISIT program to better  ensure the program\u2019s success.", "This concludes my prepared testimony.
