Medicaid enrollment and expenditures are expected to  increase in states that choose to expand eligibility in response to the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and may increase in  other states as well. The Congressional Budget Office projected that, as  a result of PPACA, about 8 million additional people could be enrolled in  Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) by 2016  compared with 2012.

We obtained from CMS the  data for three fiscal years\u20142009, 2010, and 2011, the most recent years  for which data from almost all states were available as of December  2014. For fiscal year 2011, data on expenditures and enrollee  characteristics were not available from Maine, and data on expenditures  were not available from Florida. We assessed the reliability of these data  by performing appropriate electronic data checks and reviewing relevant  documentation, and we made several changes to ensure that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes; these changes are detailed in  appendix I. We determined that the data from Idaho for 2010 were not  sufficiently reliable for our purposes and therefore excluded them. We  determined that the remaining data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. Because our objectives focused on Medicaid-only enrollees,  we excluded those who were dually eligible for both Medicaid and  Medicare\u2014about 13 percent of each year\u2019s records. We previously  reported that dually eligible enrollees accounted for about 35 percent of  total Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year 2009.

For  one analysis, we categorized enrollees into five mutually exclusive  eligibility groups\u2014child, adult, aged, disabled, and unknown. For a  second analysis, we examined the percentages of enrollees with any of  the five chronic conditions and the two services that are recorded in the  MSIS summary file.

Within these  requirements, however, the Medicaid program allows for significant  flexibility for states to design and implement their programs, resulting in  more than 50 distinct state-based programs. These variations in design  have implications for program eligibility and services offered, as well as  how expenditures are reported and services are delivered.", "Specifically, in administering their own programs, states make decisions  regarding populations or health services to cover beyond what are  mandated by law. States must cover certain groups of individuals, such  as pregnant women with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal  poverty level (FPL), but may elect to cover them above this required  minimum income level. For example, as of March 2011, some states  covered pregnant women with incomes at or above 250 percent of the  FPL. Similarly, while states\u2019 Medicaid programs generally must cover  certain mandatory services\u2014including inpatient and outpatient hospital  services, physician services, laboratory and X-ray services, and nursing  facility services for those age 21 and older\u2014states may also elect to  cover additional optional benefits and services. These optional benefits  and services include prescription drugs, dental care, hospice care, home-  and community-based services, and rehabilitative services. In addition,  even among states that offer a particular benefit, the breadth of coverage  (i.e., amount, duration, and scope) of that benefit can vary greatly. For  example, most states cover some dental services, but some limit this  benefit to trauma care and/or emergency treatment for pain relief and  infection, while others also cover annual dental exams.", "States also have flexibility, within general federal requirements, to  determine how the services they cover will be delivered to Medicaid  enrollees\u2014whether on a fee-for-service basis or through managed care  arrangements. For example, under some managed care arrangements,  the state pays managed care organizations a fixed amount, known as a  capitation payment, to provide a package of services. States vary in terms  of the types of managed care arrangements used and the eligibility  groups enrolled. For example, while 12 states enrolled 50 percent or  more of their disabled enrollees in comprehensive risk-based managed  care in fiscal year 2011, 20 states enrolled fewer than 5 percent of  disabled enrollees in such arrangements. States may also operate  premium assistance programs to subsidize the purchase of private health  insurance\u2014such as employer-sponsored insurance\u2014for Medicaid  enrollees. In 2009, 35 states reported using Medicaid funds to provide  premium assistance. These differences in covered services and delivery  systems can affect the distribution of states\u2019 spending across categories  of services. For example, states that rely heavily on managed care  arrangements to provide hospital care and acute care services to their  enrollees are likely to have a greater proportion of their expenditures  devoted to managed care, and a lower proportion to the covered services,  than states that do not have such managed care arrangements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Among Medicaid- Only Enrollees, a Small Percentage Consistently Accounted for a Large Percentage of Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["A small percentage of Medicaid-only enrollees consistently accounted for  a large percentage of total Medicaid expenditures for Medicaid-only  enrollees.

In a state such as Tennessee, for  example, in which all Medicaid enrollees are in managed care plans that  are responsible for providing hospital care and a broad array of acute  care services, the state\u2019s low percentages of expenditures in those  service categories reflect the delivery system structure of the state  Medicaid program, not enrollees\u2019 utilization of services.", "The greatest variation among states in their expenditures for specific  service categories was for managed care and premium assistance.
