GAO has previously reported that federal agencies can enhance and sustain collaboration of efforts by using key practices, such as agreeing on roles and responsibilities and establishing the means to operate across organizational boundaries. In 2010, DOD established a planning committee to coordinate the efforts of organizations conducting combat casualty care research. The committee developed a draft charter in 2010 identifying members respective roles and responsibilities. DOD issued the final charter in early January 2013, while GAO was conducting its review. DOD also facilitated operation across organizational boundaries by colocating most of the organizations conducting combat casualty care research. However, DOD organizations that typically do not conduct biomedical research, such as the Army Research Laboratory, are not involved in DOD's efforts to coordinate this research. When these organizations conduct research relevant to combat casualty care they do not always share information with appropriate officials early in the research process, as they are not aware of the need to coordinate early and may not fully understand medical research requirements. As a result, some researchers have had to repeat some work to adhere to these requirements. DOD has also taken steps to coordinate with other federal agencies that are involved in this research.", "The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (Health Affairs) and the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) assess the progress of combat casualty care research and development projects, but they have not assessed the extent to which this research fills gaps in DOD's capability to provide this care or achieves other DOD goals. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should assess their performance to ensure they meet the agency's objectives. Health Affairs and Army MRMC--the two organizations that fund most combat casualty care research and development--monitor research projects to determine whether to continue funding, make necessary corrections, or terminate these projects. However, in 2008 DOD identified gaps in its capability to provide combat casualty care, and although Health Affairs and Army MRMC have completed 44 research projects since then designed to address these gaps, they have not assessed whether the results of this research fill the gaps identified in 2008. In addition, Health Affairs and Army MRMC established other goals for this research portfolio to improve combat casualty care. For example, in 2010, Health Affairs set goals to improve DOD's ability to control bleeding. However, neither organization has developed an assessment that comprehensively identifies each of the goals for the portfolio and includes information about the extent to which each goal has been met. Health Affairs and Army MRMC officials stated that they intend to complete a strategic roadmap for the portfolio, but GAO was unable to determine if the roadmap will include a plan for a comprehensive assessment of this portfolio.

Specifically, DOD concurred  with our first recommendation to communicate to nonmedical research  organizations the importance of coordination with the JPC-6 chair and  require this coordination early in the research process. DOD also  concurred with our second recommendation to develop and implement a  plan to assess the extent to which combat casualty care research  addresses DOD\u2019s capability gaps and achieves its other goals. In its  comments on our second recommendation, DOD stated that it planned to  revise its process to better assess the extent to which each combat  casualty care research project closes capability gaps. Moreover, when we  sent our draft report to DOD for comment in December 2012, Health  Affairs and Army MRMC had not yet finalized the JPC-6 charter.  Therefore, we included a recommendation in our draft report that DOD  issue the final charter. In early January 2013, after we sent the draft  report to DOD, the commanding general of Army MRMC signed and  issued the final JPC-6 charter. As a result, we did not include the  recommendation to finalize the charter in our final report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": ["In its written comments, HHS responded to a statement in the draft report  that DOD, NIH, and VA could improve their ability to efficiently identify  potentially duplicative research with improved access to each agency\u2019s  electronic health research information, as noted in a 2012 GAO report.  HHS stated that DOD has access, to varying degrees, to NIH and VA  medical research information.
