Despite these limitations, HHS officials stated that they will  continue to work with states and explore options to allow for future  estimates for the program. For fiscal year 2011, the TANF program  reported outlays of about $17 billion.

Data mining is a computer-based control activity that  analyzes diverse data for relationships that have not previously been  discovered. The central repository of data commonly used to perform  data mining is called a data warehouse. Data warehouses store tables  of historical and current information that are logically grouped. As a  tool in managing improper payments, applying data mining to a data  warehouse allows an organization to efficiently query the system to  identify potential improper payments, such as multiple payments for  an individual invoice to an individual recipient on a certain date, or to  the same address. For example, in the Medicare and Medicaid  program, data on claims are stored in geographically disbursed  systems and databases and are not readily available to CMS\u2019s  program integrity analysts. CMS has been working for most of the  past decade to consolidate program integrity data and analytical tools  for detecting fraud, waste, and abuse.

In fiscal year 2011,  HHS reported that the Medicare Fee-for-Service recovery audit  program identified $961 million in overpayments and recovered $797  million nationwide.
