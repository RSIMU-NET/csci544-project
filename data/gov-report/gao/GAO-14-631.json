This report examines (1) the SLS program's progress toward and risks for its first test flight in 2017 and (2) the extent to which the SLS program has plans in place to achieve its long-term goals and promote affordability. To do this, GAO reviewed relevant design, development, cost, and schedule documents; interviewed program officials; and evaluated SLS program actions using acquisition and cost estimating best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Space Launch System (SLS) program is making solid progress on the SLS design. However, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has not developed an executable business case based on matching the program's cost and schedule resources with the requirement to develop the vehicle and conduct the first flight test in December 2017 at the required confidence level of 70 percent. NASA uses a calculation referred to as the \u201cjoint cost and schedule confidence level\u201d to estimate the probable success of a program meeting its cost and schedule targets. NASA policy usually requires a 70 percent confidence level for a program to proceed with final design and fabrication. GAO's work on best practices has shown that programs that do not establish an executable business case that matches requirements\u2014or customer needs\u2014to resources, such as schedule and funding\u2014are at increased risk of cost and schedule growth. The program is satisfying many of NASA's metrics that measure progress against design goals, such as requirements for design maturity. According to the program's risk analysis, however, the agency's current funding plan for SLS may be $400 million short of what the program needs to launch by 2017. Furthermore, the development schedule of the core stage\u2014which drives the SLS schedule\u2014is compressed to meet the 2017 launch date. NASA also faces challenges integrating existing hardware that was not originally designed to fly on SLS. For example, SLS is using solid rocket boosters from the Constellation program, but integrating a new non-asbestos insulating material into the booster design has proven difficult and required changes to the booster manufacturing processes.", "The SLS program has not yet defined specific mission requirements beyond the second flight test in 2021 or defined specific plans for achieving long-term goals, but the program has opportunities to promote affordability moving forward. NASA plans to incrementally develop more capable SLS launch vehicles to satisfy long-term goals, but future missions have not been determined, which will directly affect the program's future development path and flight schedule. Mission selection will likely determine which element the program decides to develop next, as the program can afford to develop only one element at a time. The magnitude of these development efforts could be significant but is currently unknown as the program has not developed complete life-cycle cost estimates for the initial or future SLS launch vehicles. In May 2014, GAO recommended that NASA address this issue, and NASA partially concurred, citing that actions taken to structure the programs and track costs met the intent of the recommendations. However, GAO believes NASA's responses do not fully address the concerns about the program's cost estimates. There are opportunities, however, to improve long-term affordability through competition once the development path has been determined and NASA can finalize its acquisition approach. For example, the program plans to compete the procurement of one element; however, the agency has not finalized assessments of options for competitively procuring other future elements. Such assessments could better position NASA to sustain competition, control costs, and better inform Congress about the long-term affordability of the program. GAO's body of work on contracting has shown that competition in contracting is a key factor in controlling cost."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other actions to reduce risk and allow for continued assessment of SLS progress and affordability, GAO recommends that NASA develop an executable business case for SLS that matches resources to requirements, and provide to the Congress an assessment of the SLS elements that could be competitively procured for future SLS variants before finalizing acquisition plans for those variants.

NASA expects to conduct two test flights of the Block I  vehicle\u2014the first in 2017 and the second in 2021. The vehicle is  scheduled to fly an uncrewed Orion some 70,000 kilometers beyond the  moon during the first test flight, known as Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1),  and to fly a second mission known as Exploration Mission-2 (EM-2)  beyond the moon to further test performance with a crewed Orion vehicle.

In its simplest form, a  business case requires a balance between the concept selected to satisfy  customer needs and the resources\u2014technologies, design knowledge,  funding, time, and management capacity\u2014needed to transform the  concept into a product. At the heart of a business case is a knowledge- based approach that requires that managers demonstrate high levels of  knowledge as the program proceeds from technology development to  system development and, finally, production. Ideally, with such an  approach, key technologies are demonstrated before development  begins, the design is stabilized before prototypes are built or production  begins, and testing is used to validate product maturity at each level. At  each decision point, the balance among time, money, and capacity is  confirmed. In essence, knowledge supplants risk over time.

NASA\u2019s Systems  Engineering Policy states that this review demonstrates that the  preliminary design meets all system requirements with acceptable risk  and within the cost and schedule constraints. After a project is confirmed  following PDR, it begins implementation during which time senior NASA  officials periodically review the programmatic and technical status of  projects and verify the project\u2019s readiness to proceed forward. For  example, a critical design review (CDR) before the project\u2019s subsystems  are integrated evaluates the integrity of the project design and its ability to  meet mission requirements, with appropriate margins and acceptable risk,  within defined project constraints, including available resources. In short,  the CDR determines if the design is appropriately mature to support  proceeding with the final design and fabrication phase. Our past work  on product development best practices has found that programs having at  least 90 percent of engineering drawings releasable by the critical design  review lower their risk of subsequent cost growth and schedule delays,  and guidance in NASA\u2019s Systems Engineering Handbook mirrors this  metric. NASA also tracks both mass margin and resolution of requests  for action, which are technical, safety, and programmatic comments from  independent reviewers, as additional measures of design maturity.

Agency officials indicated the program is  encountering difficulties acquiring feeder lines from available suppliers to  meet the core stage development schedule because the feeder lines are  larger and will be used in more stressful environments than the lines that  suppliers have manufactured in the past. The feeder lines must still be  designed, built, and tested for operation in the SLS environment before  they can be delivered for integration into the system. While these  challenges are not overly complex from a technical viewpoint, resolving  such threats to the schedule is critical because the element is in early  development phases and still has several significant milestones and  developmental activities ahead. For example, the core stage has CDR  currently scheduled for July 2014 that will assess the program\u2019s design  maturity.

The two currently scheduled flights, EM-1 and EM-2, are  developmental test flights designed to demonstrate and test the  capabilities of the 70-mt launch vehicle and the capability of the core  stage in particular. Office of Management and Budget guidance indicates  that agencies should develop long range objectives, supported by  detailed budgets and plans that identify the agency\u2019s performance gaps  and the resources needed to close them.beyond the two scheduled test flights, no future mission destinations have  been determined. In the absence of specific mission requirements,  officials indicated the SLS program is developing the variants based on  top-level requirements derived from NASA\u2019s Design Reference  Architectures that lay out the technical and scientific framework for  conducting missions in line with the agency\u2019s strategic plan. NASA\u2019s 2014  strategic plan, for example, identifies sending humans to Mars as one of  the agency\u2019s long-term goals; in turn, the agency\u2019s Mars Design  Reference Architecture indicates that multiple missions using a vehicle  with a lift capability of about 130 mt will be necessary to support that goal.", "According to agency officials,  Although NASA is considering long-term Mars missions and asteroid  redirect missions, NASA has not yet finalized plans for the next step in  evolving the SLS and risks investing limited available resources in  systems and designs that are not yet needed. The agency intends to use  the same core stage design for all variants of the SLS, but it will be faced  with replacing all the other major hardware elements used on the 70-mt  vehicle\u2014that is, the upper stage, boosters, and engines\u2014so that the 105-  and 130-mt vehicles can perform missions that support the agency\u2019s  strategic goals of carrying heavier payloads and traveling deeper into  space. To that end, NASA is working on analyses and concept designs  for a new upper stage and for advanced boosters. Because mission  requirements for the 105-mt variant are not yet defined, however, NASA  faces the possibility that it will spend time and money developing systems  and designs that may not be needed for the specific mission that will be  defined. For example, according to program officials and as illustrated in  figure 5, in order to have a 105-mt capability ready to launch soon after  2021, the agency must make a decision not later than 2016 about  whether it will first pursue development of the upper stage or advanced  boosters as the next step in increasing SLS capability beyond the 70-mt  variant.", "Program officials stated that the agency does not have resources to  conduct more than one development effort at a time and that it is difficult  to determine which system to develop first because each improves SLS  lift capability in different ways. A new upper stage would provide more  capability beyond Earth orbit and better support missions that require  more in-space propulsion, such as missions to a near-Earth asteroid or  other distant locations. Advanced boosters would provide more capability  to low-Earth orbit and better support missions that require the SLS to  place a larger payload in orbit around the Earth. No matter which effort  NASA pursues, in order for the agency to begin full-scale development  after 2016, it is confronted with requesting related funding in the year  before it plans to begin work. For example, if NASA intends to initiate full- scale upper stage development in 2017, including the related funding  request in its fiscal year 2016 budget submission would be prudent. The  sooner NASA makes a decision about which development to pursue first,  the sooner it will be able to focus its limited resources on the chosen  effort. Conversely, the longer the agency delays the decision, the more  likely it will expend those resources on a design that might not yet be  needed.", "Regardless of when the mission requirements are established and what  development NASA first pursues, those future development efforts are  likely to be of sufficient cost and scope to constitute programs or projects  in and of themselves. According to NASA officials, the advanced booster  and new upper stage, for example, will involve distinct development,  integration, qualification, and testing efforts. As such, they meet NASA\u2019s  own criteria for a new project in that they will represent a specific effort  with defined requirements, a life-cycle cost estimate, and a beginning and  end, and will result in new or revised products, in the form of improved  boosters and stages, to address strategic goals. Further, these efforts are  likely to far exceed the $250 million life-cycle cost established in NASA  policy as the threshold for requiring the NASA Associate Administrator  approval of cost and schedule baseline commitments. These projects  are subject to oversight by senior agency officials through periodic  programmatic reviews that assess technical and programmatic readiness  to move forward at various decision points. At this time, future SLS  development efforts are not planned to be managed as separate projects,  though NASA has indicated that it plans to hold design reviews for these  efforts consistent with its acquisition policies and practices. Best practices  for system acquisition and cost estimating advocate an evolutionary  approach wherein each capability increment has its own cost, schedule,  and performance baselines and methods to report progress against these  baselines. In addition, we have previously concluded that it is prudent  for an agency to manage increasing capabilities of an existing program on  par with the level of investments yet to come and in a way that is  beneficial for oversight. For example, we have recommended that  agencies developing weapon systems in increments consider establishing  each increment of increased capability with its own cost and schedule  baseline. Establishing cost, schedule, and performance baselines for  each increment that has costs exceeding $250 million could provide  decision makers with additional insights into the progress and long-term  affordability of each increment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Program\u2019s Long-Term Affordability Is Unknown Because SLS Cost Estimate Does Not Capture Life Cycle Costs", "paragraphs": ["The long-term affordability of the SLS program is also unknown, as we  found in May 2014, because NASA\u2019s baseline cost estimate for the  program will not provide any information about the longer-term, life cycle  costs of developing, manufacturing, and operating the launch vehicle.  NASA does not plan for that baseline estimate, which will be established  when SLS moves into implementation, to cover program costs after EM-1  or costs to design, develop, build, and produce the 105- or 130-mt  variants.", "Based on the tenets of widely-accepted best practices for cost estimation  as well as NASA\u2019s own requirements and guidance regarding life cycle  costs, in May 2014 we made recommendations to enhance transparency,  assist congressional oversight, and ensure insight into affordability as the  agency moves ahead with the SLS, Orion, and related ground support   In terms of SLS, we recommended that NASA establish a  programs. separate cost and schedule baseline for work required to support SLS  Block I EM-2 and report that information via its annual budget submission.  As part of that recommendation, we noted that, if NASA decides to fly the  SLS Block I 70-mt variant beyond EM-2, the agency should then establish  separate life cycle cost and schedule baseline estimates for that variant  and report this information via its annual budget submission. Additionally,  we recommended that NASA establish life cycle cost and schedule  baselines for each upgraded block of the SLS, Orion, and associated  ground support. We stated that, if the agency believed it could not do so  because missions and flight manifests were unknown, then it should  forecast minimum and maximum ranges for the increased capabilities\u2019 life  cycle costs in its annual budget submission. NASA partially concurred  with our recommendations, citing among other reasons that actions  already in place such as establishing SLS, Orion, and related ground  support as separate programs and a block upgrade approach for SLS\u2014 and actions it plans to take to track costs\u2014met the intent of our  recommendations.", "GAO-09-3SP; NPR 7120.5E \u00a7 2.4(Aug. 14, 2012); 2008 NASA Cost Estimating  Handbook; and GAO-14-385.", "In our evaluation of NASA\u2019s comments, we acknowledged that these  actions were a step in the right direction, but noted that NASA\u2019s actions  do not fully address our concerns. Specifically, we pointed out that  establishing cost and schedule at the broader program level was unlikely  to provide the detail necessary to monitor the progress of each block  against a baseline; it was unclear from NASA\u2019s response whether cost  commitments the agency plans within the SLS design review process  would serve the same purpose as establishing a cost baseline for each  respective upgrade; and reporting costs associated with EM-2 and  subsequent variants of SLS via the agency\u2019s annual budget submission  would not provide information about potential costs over the long term  because budget requests neither offer all the same information as life- cycle cost estimates nor are necessarily linked to an established baseline  that indicates how much NASA expects to invest to develop, operate, and  sustain a capability over the long-term. We stated that, as NASA  establishes parameters for the additional flights of the first SLS capability  and upgraded capabilities, including flight rates, mission destinations, and  other requirements, it will be well-poised to move from reporting costs in  budget submissions to establishing baseline cost and schedule estimates  for each capability and reporting progress against these respective  baselines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Taking Steps for Long-Term Affordability but Additional Opportunities May Exist", "paragraphs": ["NASA has taken some steps that may promote the long-term affordability  of the SLS program as directed in the National Space Transportation  Policy. The policy requires that human space flight development efforts  such as the SLS program identify and implement measures to enhance  affordability. To promote affordability, SLS has funded a series of studies  and assessments on advanced boosters by both potential industry  partners and universities. According to program officials, these  activities\u2014which include improved welding procedures, simulation of  material performance, and demonstration of potential propellants\u2014may  provide better understanding of the processes, structures, and risk levels  of various booster development options, which may in turn reduce the  cost or schedule necessary to design and develop an advanced booster.  Program officials also indicated that such activities may provide better  insight into which contractors may compete for future booster  development contracts.", "The program, however, could promote longer term affordability by  introducing competition in the development and production contracts for  other hardware elements. Our body of work on contracting has shown  that competition in contracting is a key element for maintaining cost  control. We have found that promoting competition increases the  potential for acquiring quality goods and services at a lower price and that  noncompetitive contracts carry the risk of overspending because, among  other reasons, they have been negotiated without the benefit of  competition to help establish pricing. NASA has structured other launch  programs, such as the Commercial Crew and Launch Services Program,  based on the premise that competition will lower costs. In addition, the  NASA Authorization Act of 2010 requires that NASA compete sub- elements of the SLS. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, full and open  competition in soliciting offers and awarding contracts is generally a  requirement of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 and the  Federal Acquisition Regulation. Given the long-term planned use of  SLS, using non-competitive procedures to acquire any portion of the SLS  vehicle may lead to higher costs that could be felt for years or decades.", "As it replaces hardware elements used on the 70-mt variant with  elements necessary to support NASA\u2019s anticipated uses of the 105- and  130-mt variants, the SLS program will likely have several opportunities to  promote long-term affordability through competing contracts for the new  elements. The program plans to use only the core stage and main  engines for all flights beyond EM-2. Program briefings indicate that the  SLS program optimized the design of the core stage, which will be used  with all vehicle variants, to utilize the RS-25 engines remaining from the  Space Shuttle program. According to agency officials, a natural  consequence of finalizing the core stage design based on the RS-25 is  that the only engine-related efforts open to future competition will be RS- 25 subsystems and components. The program could be in a favorable  position, however, to compete contracts for the exploration upper stage,  the upper stage engine, and advanced boosters that it expects to use on  the 105- and 130-mt variants. According to SLS program officials, it  currently plans to compete contracts for the development and production  of new advanced boosters that will be more capable than the current five- segment boosters. The program is considering multiple design solutions  including metallic or composite casings and liquid or solid fuel. Based on  our review of program documentation and discussions with agency  officials, however, additional opportunities exist to compete the  procurement of other sub-elements needed for the 105- and 130-mt  vehicles. In some cases other programs, both within and outside of  NASA, use alternative hardware that serves similar purposes.", "According to program officials, the program plans to procure a new  upper stage through the existing core stage contract to replace the  ICPS, which the program is using as an interim solution, for all  missions following EM-2. They also stated that the program does not  plan to compete the upper stage development because its initial  award to Boeing in 2007 under the Constellation program was done  competitively. Since that award, however, our work indicates that the  marketplace for spacecraft development has shifted considerably as  new commercial providers have since developed and have launched,  or are currently developing, upper stages. These providers may offer  viable competition for the new upper stage. For example, in recent  years Orbital Sciences Corporation and SpaceX have successfully  flown upper stages for NASA\u2019s Commercial Cargo program and  SpaceX and Boeing will need to human-rate upper stages as part of  NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew program with flights expected to begin  around 2017.", "The SLS program must also procure a new upper stage engine.", "According to NASA officials, the upper stage engine will be selected  based on mission need. Potential competitors include Aerojet  Rocketdyne\u2019s J-2X, the Evolved Expandable Launch Vehicle\u2019s RL10,  and the BE-3 engine that Blue Origin is developing for the  Commercial Crew program, among other options.", "Because, except for the RS-25 engines, NASA\u2019s current contracting  approach for the SLS program, does not commit the program beyond the  hardware needed for EM-2, moving forward the agency will be in the  position to take advantage of the evolving launch vehicle market.

While the technical challenges associated with those efforts appear  manageable, the compressed development schedule in conjunction with  the agency\u2019s relatively flat funding profile for SLS through 2017 place the  program at high risk of missing the planned December 2017 launch date  for the EM-1 initial test flight.", "Beyond the SLS second flight in 2021, the program\u2019s path is unclear.  NASA is waiting for additional policy direction on future missions, but the  agency is approaching a crossroads wherein it is confronted with defining  a developmental path forward to the more capable variants of SLS.  Without identifying a range of mission possibilities and their required  funding, the program is at risk of making uninformed decisions and  pursuing development paths that may not make the most efficient use of  limited resources in the near term and could negatively impact longer  term affordability. Furthermore, without this information the agency\u2019s  ability to make important decisions about the affordability of the program  in the context of the agency\u2019s overall budget and competing priorities is  limited. Additionally, it is unclear how the agency plans to manage the  upgraded capability efforts. Without carefully structuring the approach for  future variants, decision makers will lack transparency into costs and will  be limited in their ability to assess long-term affordability and progress.
