Based on recently issued work, GAO (1) examined the extent to which UN funding arrangements for its Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) ensure independent oversight and the consistency of OIOS's practices with key international auditing standards and (2) assessed the UN's procurement processes according to key standards for internal controls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The effective implementation of the planned UN renovation is vulnerable due to a range of weaknesses in existing internal oversight and procurement practices. In particular, UN funding arrangements adversely affect OIOS's budgetary independence and compromise OIOS's ability to investigate high-risk areas. In addition, while the UN has yet to finalize a specific procurement process for the UN Capital Master Plan, to the extent that it relies on UN procurement processes, it remains vulnerable to the numerous procurement weaknesses that GAO have previously identified. First, UN funding arrangements constrain OIOS's ability to operate independently as mandated by the General Assembly and required by international auditing standards. While OIOS is funded by a regular budget and 12 other revenue streams, UN financial regulations and rules severely limit OIOS's ability to respond to changing circumstances and reallocate resources among revenue streams, locations, and operating divisions. Thus, OIOS cannot always direct resources to high-risk areas that may emerge after its budget is approved. Second, OIOS depends on the resources of the funds, programs, and other entities it audits. The managers of these programs can deny OIOS permission to perform work or not pay OIOS for services. UN entities could thus avoid OIOS audits or investigations, and high-risk areas can be and have been excluded from timely examination. OIOS has begun to implement key measures for effective oversight, but some of its practices fall short of the applicable international auditing standards it has adopted. OIOS develops an annual work plan, but the risk management framework on which the work plans are based is not fully implemented. OIOS officials report the office does not have adequate resources, but they also lack a mechanism to determine appropriate staffing levels. Furthermore, OIOS has no mandatory training curriculum for staff. While the UN has yet to finalize its Capital Master Plan procurement strategy, to the extent that it relies on the current process, implementation of the Capital Master Plan remains vulnerable to numerous procurement weaknesses. For example, the UN has not established an independent process to consider vendor protests that could alert senior UN officials of failures by procurement staff to comply with stated procedures. Also, the chairman of the UN procurement contract review committee has stated that his committee does not have the resources to keep up with its expanding workload. In addition, the UN does not consistently implement its process for helping to ensure that it is conducting business with qualified vendors. GAO also found that the UN has not demonstrated a commitment to improving its professional procurement staff despite long-standing shortcomings and has yet to complete action on specific ethics guidance for procurement officers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the United Nations\u2019 (UN) internal  oversight unit and procurement process in the context of the UN Capital  Master Plan (CMP).

In our review of the Oil for Food Program, we found that management  problems allowed the former Iraqi regime to manipulate the program and  circumvent sanctions to obtain illicit payments ranging from $7.4 billion to  $12.8 billion. The UN\u2019s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS)  audited some aspects of the Oil for Food program and identified hundreds  of weaknesses and irregularities. However, OIOS lacked the resources and  independence needed to provide full and effective oversight of this large,  costly, and complex UN effort. In addition, experts have called on the UN  to correct serious weaknesses in its procurement process for more than a  decade, including the lack of an independent process for considering  vendor protests and ensuring selection of qualified venders. However,  recent audits and investigations have uncovered evidence of corruption  and mismanagement in the UN\u2019s procurement activities.", "In 2005, UN member states approved an agenda to reform many of the UN\u2019s  management practices, in particular to strengthen internal oversight and  accountability; help ensure ethical conduct; and review budgetary,  financial, and human resources policies.

Accordingly, my statement is based  on two reports that we released on these topics in April 2006. First, I will  focus on the need to strengthen OIOS\u2019s budgetary independence and its full  implementation of key components for effective oversight. Second, I will  also focus on our assessment of the UN\u2019s procurement processes according  to key standards for internal controls.", "The work for these reports and this testimony was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards  between April 2005 and March 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The UN headquarters buildings are in need of renovation. The original UN  headquarters complex, located in New York City and constructed between  1949 and 1952, no longer conforms to current safety, fire and building codes  and does not meet UN technology or security requirements. Over the last  50 years there have been no major renovations or upgrades to the buildings  or their systems. For example, the UN headquarters complex lacks fire  sprinklers, has a deteriorating window structure, and is vulnerable to  catastrophic electrical failures. In September 2005, the headquarters  complex was shut down and the staff sent home because a main breaker  for electrical power to the top floors of the Secretariat building failed,  causing it to fuse to the electrical panel. This failure could have resulted in  a major fire.", "As host country, the United States financed construction of the original  complex by providing the UN with a no-interest loan. The rest of the  complex was built between 1960 and 1982 and funded through the UN\u2019s  regular budget or private donations. In December 2002, the General  Assembly endorsed the CMP to renovate the UN headquarters complex and  approved funds to further develop the conceptual designs and cost  estimate. In May 2003, we reported that the resulting renovation planning  was reasonable, but that additional management controls and oversight  were needed. Since our last report, the UN has completed design  development of the renovation. In April 2006, the UN appropriated $23.5  million to finance the renovation\u2019s preconstruction phase and committed  $77 million to finance the construction of temporary conference space and  supplementary office space rental (swing space). However, the General  Assembly has not yet decided whether to approve implementation of the  CMP.", "In a February 2003 resolution, the General Assembly stressed the  importance of oversight in implementing the CMP and requested that all  relevant oversight bodies, such as OIOS, initiate immediate oversight  activities. In our 2003 report on the CMP, we noted that OIOS assigned  one staff member to begin researching the CMP on a part-time basis. OIOS  officials also stated that they had requested funding for OIOS to hire  contractors to help evaluate the CMP, project management plan, and security upgrades. In July 2005, OIOS reported that it had two auditors  reviewing the CMP.", "OIOS\u2019s authority spans all UN activities under the Secretary-General. OIOS  derives its funding from (1) regular budget resources, which are funds from  assessed contributions from member states that cover normal, recurrent  activities such as the core functions of the UN Secretariat and (2)  extrabudgetary resources, which come from the budgets for UN  peacekeeping missions financed through assessments from member states,  voluntary contributions from member states for a variety of specific  projects and activities, and budgets for the voluntarily financed UN funds  and programs. Our work on the Oil for Food program demonstrates the  weakness inherent in OIOS\u2019s reliance on extrabudgetary resources. OIOS  audited some aspects of the Oil for Food program and identified hundreds  of weaknesses and irregularities, but it lacked the resources and  independence needed to provide full and effective oversight of this large,  costly, and complex UN effort. As the program was implemented, the Oil  for Food program was further weakened by inadequate attention to  internal controls, including establishing clear responsibility and authority  and identifying and addressing program risks.", "In addition to oversight, an effective procurement process is one of the  keys to success for any large scale construction project. For more than a  decade, experts have called on the UN to correct serious weaknesses in its  procurement process. In addition, the UN procurement process has been  under increasing stress in recent years as procurement spending has more  than tripled to keep pace with a rapidly growing peacekeeping program.  The UN Department of Management, through its 70-person UN  Procurement Service, is ultimately responsible for developing UN  procurement policies.", "Because the UN is a multilateral institution, our oversight authority does  not directly extend to the UN, but instead extends through the United  States\u2019 membership in the organization. In recognition of this factor, we  conduct UN-related work only in response to specific requests from  committees with jurisdiction over UN matters.

In addition, the movement of staff positions or funds between  regular and extrabudgetary resources is not allowed. For example, one  section in the Internal Audit Division may have exhausted its regular  budget travel funds, while another section in the same division may have  travel funds available that are financed by extrabudgetary peacekeeping  resources.

OIOS negotiates the  terms of work and payment for services with the manager of the program it  intends to examine, and heads of these entities have the right to deny  funding for oversight work proposed by OIOS. By denying OIOS funding,  UN entities could avoid OIOS audits or investigations, and high-risk areas  could potentially be excluded from timely examination. For example, the  practice of allowing the heads of programs the right to deny funding to  internal audit activities prevented OIOS from examining high-risk areas in  the UN Oil for Food program, where billions of dollars were subsequently  found to have been misused. Moreover, in some cases, fund and program  managers have disputed fees charged by OIOS for investigative services  rendered. For example, 40 percent of the $2 million billed by OIOS after it  completed its work is currently in dispute, and since 2001, less than half of  the entities have paid OIOS in full for investigative services it has provided.

OIOS is now at a critical point, particularly given the initiatives to  strengthen UN oversight launched as a result of the World Summit in the  fall of 2005. In moving forward, the degree to which the UN and OIOS  embrace international auditing standards and practices will demonstrate  their commitment to addressing the monumental management and  oversight tasks that lie ahead. Failure to address these long-standing  concerns would diminish the efficacy and impact of other management  reforms to strengthen oversight at the UN.", "While the UN has yet to finalize its CMP procurement strategy, to the extent  that it relies on the current process, we have identified numerous  weaknesses with the existing procurement process that could impact  implementation of the CMP. Long-standing weaknesses in the UN\u2019s  procurement office have left UN procurement funds highly vulnerable to  fraud, waste, and abuse. Many of these weaknesses have been identified  and documented by outside experts and the UN\u2019s own auditors for more  than a decade. Sustained leadership at the UN will be needed to correct  these weaknesses and establish a procurement system capable of fully  supporting the UN\u2019s expanding needs.", "This concludes my testimony.
