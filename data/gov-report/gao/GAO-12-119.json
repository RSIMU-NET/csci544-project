About 400 miles of priced highway lanes including nearly 150 miles on the New Jersey Turnpike are in operation today with current tolls varying from 25 cents to $14.", "All U.S. projects in operation are either High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes, which charge solo drivers to use newly constructed lanes or carpool lanes, or peak-period pricing projects, which charge a lower toll on already tolled roads, bridges and tunnels during offpeak periods.

Eight project sponsors have current and completed evaluations on at least 1 project, for a total of 14 evaluated projects, all of which GAO reviewed.

Nearly all HOT lane projects and most peak-period pricing projects in operation today received federal funds at one time or another. DOT\u0092s largest programs for congestion relief, the Urban Partnership Agreement and Congestion Reduction Demonstration programs, have provided grant funds totaling nearly $800 million since 2006 to six metropolitan areas to implement pricing and other strategies. DOT requires sponsors of congestion pricing projects to monitor and evaluate performance and, for HOT lanes when applicable, ensure that a federal standard for minimum traffic speeds is met.", "The 14 congestion pricing projects that have current and complete evaluations generally show that pricing can help reduce congestion, although other results are mixed, and not all possible relevant impacts have been assessed. HOT lane projects, which aim to reduce congestion by decreasing travel time and increasing speed and the number of vehicles using the lane, have reduced congestion, but some HOT lane projects also added new lanes, and studies did not distinguish the extent to which performance improvements were due to added lanes or pricing. In addition, although the number of cars using HOT lanes has risen, there were fewer people in those cars because of an increase in the proportion of toll-paying solo drivers or a decrease in carpools. Peak-period pricing projects, which aim to reduce congestion by encouraging drivers to travel at off-peak times, have shifted some travel to those times. Other congestion pricing effects\u0097such as equity income impacts\u0097have not always been evaluated. Potential concerns include income equity (whether low-income drivers are disproportionately affected by congestion pricing) and geographic equity (whether one geographic area is more negatively affected than another, such as when traffic diversion occurs). These impacts are important to assess as they address the public and elected officials\u0092 concerns about the effects of pricing on travelers and communities. Ongoing multi-year evaluations across six metropolitan areas will assess the performance and effects of congestion pricing projects using a specific set of measures to assess the effectiveness of congestion reduction strategies.", "Concerns about equity may grow as pricing projects become more widespread. New projects are under construction, and several metropolitan areas have networks of HOT lanes planned that will expand the relatively limited use of pricing today. Equity concerns may become more acute where sponsors are using pricing not only to manage congestion, but also to raise revenue to build new projects. Raising revenue can be at odds with managing congestion (e.g., increasing passenger throughput) if higher tolls can produce more revenue from fewer paying vehicles. Options to address equity issues include using a portion of toll revenues to finance public transit service."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many Americans spend frustrating hours each year stuck in congested  traffic, a situation that costs the country billions of dollars annually and  influences people\u2019s decisions about where to live and work.

Estimates of the cost of congestion vary; according to the Department of  Transportation (DOT), congestion costs America an estimated $200  billion each year in lost travel time and fuel, and drivers in metropolitan  areas spent more than one-quarter of their total annual travel time in  congested conditions.", "Metropolitan areas have undertaken several approaches to reduce  congestion, but some approaches are becoming impractical and too  costly. For example, metropolitan areas have widened or extended roads  to add physical capacity, yet this option may not be feasible in some  densely populated urban areas or could have significant social and  environmental impacts. Furthermore, adding roadway capacity is costly at  a time when governments at all levels are facing fiscal constraints.  Metropolitan areas have also attempted to reduce congestion by  managing existing infrastructure more efficiently, through traffic  management strategies such as timed traffic signals, signs that warn  drivers of congestion ahead, and improved responses to accidents. Other  strategies, such as carpool or bus-only lanes, have been designed to  reduce the number of vehicles on roadways by encouraging people not to  drive alone.", "Another strategy to reduce congestion is road pricing or congestion  pricing\u2014assessing tolls that vary with the level of congestion and time of  day.

To  address these objectives, we reviewed relevant legislation, literature,  reports, and studies.

For example, bottlenecks at highway interchanges or on bridges and  tunnels can worsen congestion. Vehicles traveling at different speeds can  increase the average amount of space between cars, thus not efficiently  using all space available in a lane. Stop-and-go traffic leads to increased  queuing and periodic events such as traffic accidents and roadway  construction can compound already congested conditions. Although a  transportation system is designed to handle a certain number of vehicles,  the flow of traffic can be improved at certain times and places such as  during rush hours or at bottlenecks.", "Congestion pricing is designed to improve the flow of traffic by charging  drivers a toll that can vary with the level of congestion or time of day.  Drivers pay a higher price for using a lane or roadway at times of heavy  traffic, and a lower price when and where traffic is light. To avoid toll  payment, drivers may choose to share rides, use transit, travel at less  congested (generally off-peak) times, or travel on less congested routes.  Drivers who place a high value on time may choose to pay the toll to use  the priced lane during congested times in return for a faster and more  reliable trip. Alternatively, drivers who wish to pay a discounted toll on an  already tolled roadway can travel at off-peak times.", "Economists generally believe that congestion pricing has the potential to  alleviate congestion on roadways in an economically efficient way. Those  who value a fast and reliable trip will pay for the option. Drivers who place  a lower value on time will choose to stay in the unpriced and potentially  more congested roadways. Economists believe that congestion pricing  can also enhance economic efficiency by making drivers take into  account the external costs they impose on others when making their  travel choices. Any given driver\u2019s highway use entails extra costs that the  driver does not bear, in the form of congestion, noise, and pollution. Thus,  paying a toll that reflects a driver\u2019s value of time and covers external costs  can potentially reduce congestion and the demand for road space at peak  periods. We have reported that the existing infrastructure can be  managed more efficiently and that congestion pricing could be one  method to do so.", "All congestion pricing projects in the United States have used either (1)  High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes or (2) peak-period pricing on already  tolled facilities. HOT lanes have been created by constructing new lanes  or converting existing carpool or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes,  some of which had been previously underused, and allowing solo drivers  to use these lanes if they pay a toll. Users of the prior HOV-only lanes,  such as carpools and express buses, generally continue to use the lanes  for free and are allowed to use newly constructed HOT lanes for free as  well. HOT lane operators seek to influence the number of vehicles in the  HOT lane and maintain 45- to 55-mile-per-hour travel speeds through  \u201cdynamic\u201d pricing\u2014that is, increasing or decreasing tolls in real time  depending on traffic in the HOT lane. Peak-period pricing on already  tolled highways, bridges, and tunnels or on new or planned replacement  facilities is another type of congestion pricing project in the United States.  In this type of pricing, tolls are fixed higher during peak travel times and  lower during off-peak times to encourage drivers to use the roadway off- peak. Three HOT lane projects have used a hybrid approach to dynamic  and peak-period pricing called \u201cvariable\u201d pricing. Variable pricing uses a  pre-set schedule of tolls that is periodically revised to account for changes  in congestion or other factors.", "Since the first U.S. congestion pricing project was implemented in Orange  County, California, in 1995, 19 project sponsors have initiated 41 pricing  projects on highways, bridges, and tunnels. Projects operate in Georgia,  Utah, Colorado, Maryland, and New Jersey with multiple projects in  California, Florida, New York, Texas, Virginia, Minnesota, and  Washington State. Of the 41 pricing projects, 30 are completed and open  to traffic. The 30 opened projects include 12 HOT lane projects and 18  peak-period priced facilities, covering about 400 miles of priced lanes.  Projects range in length from 4.1 miles on the State Route (SR) 133 in  Orange County, California, to nearly 150 miles on the New Jersey  Turnpike, and charge tolls varying from 25 cents to $14. Eleven HOT  lane projects are under construction; in addition, 2 of the 12 HOT lane  projects in operation are extending the length of their tolled lanes. Figure  1 shows congestion pricing projects in operation and under construction  including extensions to existing projects. Appendix II provides additional  details on congestion pricing projects and toll rates.", "More metropolitan areas across the country are using or plan to use  pricing as a way to relieve congestion on highways and bridges, and  some regions are planning to implement networks of HOT lanes. Dallas- Ft. Worth, Atlanta, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Seattle, and the San Francisco  Bay Area have networks of HOT lanes in their long-term plans. For  example, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San  Francisco Bay Area proposes to add a 570-mile HOT lane network by  2025 as part of its 35-year regional plan. The Washington State  Department of Transportation proposes to convert carpool lanes to HOT  lanes on nearly 300 miles in the Seattle/Puget Sound area. Such  networks are also being considered in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C.,  and the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale area.", "Congestion pricing has raised equity concerns among the public and  elected officials. In general, an analysis of equity issues examines how  costs and benefits of projects are distributed among members of society. In  the transportation economics literature, four concepts of equity are cited.", "The extent to which members of the same group are treated equally;  for example, whether some people with the same income pay a larger  amount in taxes or fees.", "The extent to which those who benefit from a project, such as a new  lane, pay for those benefits; for example, is the lane paid for by a toll  on users or by a state sales tax paid in part by persons who may not  use or benefit from the lane?", "How the costs and benefits of a project are distributed across  members of different groups such as high- and low-income people; for  example, whether all groups pay in proportion to their income or  whether low-income people pay proportionally more of their income  for tolls than high-income people.", "The extent to which those who impose social costs bear those costs;  for example, whether polluters or drivers on crowded highways pay  the full social cost of their driving, or, if a toll causes diversion from the  tolled highway to adjacent neighborhoods, those neighborhoods incur  the costs of pollution and crowding.", "While recognizing that all of these concepts of equity cited in the literature  may be important, public and elected officials\u2019 concerns regarding  congestion pricing have been primarily with the latter two concepts of  equity, in particular, what is termed income equity and geographic equity.", "Income equity refers to whether the costs of congestion pricing that  users incur are proportional to their incomes, or whether low-income  drivers are disproportionately affected. For example, low-income  drivers may spend a greater proportion of their income to pay to travel  at preferred times or incur greater costs in travel time by choosing  alternate unpriced routes. High-income drivers, who, economists  generally believe, place a higher value on their time, may be more  likely to pay the toll and benefit from a faster trip than low-income  drivers, thus possibly generating income equity concerns.", "Geographic equity refers to how equally the costs and benefits  associated with congestion pricing are distributed within an affected  metropolitan area. For example, if one corridor in a metropolitan area  has congestion pricing and another does not, drivers in the tolled  corridor may incur greater costs than drivers in the untolled corridor  because of the tolls they pay or the increase in travel time they incur  by choosing an alternate route. Furthermore, drivers who choose to  avoid the tolls and take an alternate route may contribute to  congestion on the alternate route. Such diversion of traffic from tolled  routes within a corridor can reduce the performance of the alternate  untolled routes and negatively affect surrounding neighborhoods.  Issues of equity are further complicated if this traffic is diverted  through low-income and minority communities.", "The transportation economics literature also suggests that the equity  impacts of congestion pricing be assessed in comparison to  alternatives\u2014namely the predominant sources of funding roadways, such  as motor fuel and sales taxes. Comparing these sources could address  whether those who benefit from a project, such as a new lane, pay for  those benefits; for example, is the lane paid for by users of the facility or  by persons who may not use or benefit from the lane? According to the  Transportation Research Board, it may be the case that tolling and pricing  provide a more equitable means of funding roadways than these other  alternatives. We have reported that tolling is consistent with the \u201cuser  pay\u201d principle because tolling a particular road and using the tolls  collected to build and maintain that road more closely link the costs with  the distribution of the benefits that users derive from it.", "As a general rule, charging tolls on highways constructed with federal  funds is prohibited.

Both travel time and travel  speed improved on at least some sections of all five HOT lane projects  that were evaluated. Sometimes the improved travel times in the HOT  lanes also led to improved travel times in the adjacent unpriced lanes  because solo drivers paid to switch to the HOT lanes.

Evaluations of the  I-95 and SR 91 projects did not, however, isolate the effects of the added  lane and pricing on performance.

In  addition, evaluations of two projects assessed passenger throughput  which takes into account the number of people riding buses as well as the  average vehicle occupancy rate to estimate the total number of people  moved through the roadway. According to the evaluations, passenger  throughput on I-15 in San Diego increased slightly between 1997 and  1998, and then decreased between 1998 and 1999, and passenger  throughput on I-95 in Miami increased 42 percent between 2008 and  2010 on the HOT lanes\u2014a result the evaluation attributed to an increase  in toll-paying solo drivers, transit ridership, and the addition of two HOT  lanes.", "Evaluations of peak-period pricing projects found no increase in  throughput due to congestion pricing. Specifically, evaluations of the New  Jersey Turnpike and Lee County bridges assessed the impact of pricing  on traffic volume and found no changes in vehicle throughput or average  vehicle occupancy due to pricing that differed from overall traffic trends.", "To evaluate two of the five HOT lane projects\u2014I-15 in San Diego and SR  91 in Orange County\u2014project sponsors surveyed drivers to determine  whether they changed their trips to travel at off-peak times. According to  the I-15 survey results, some traffic shifted from the middle of the peak  rush hour to the \u201cpeak-shoulder\u201d times\u2014the times directly before and  after peak periods. However, the sponsors did not explain why this shift  occurred. Drivers surveyed for the SR 91 evaluation said that the level of  congestion affected their travel time decisions more than the presence of  the toll. Project sponsors that did not study shifts to off-peak travel times  said they did not do so because, in one case, the sponsor did not see the  HOT lanes as offering incentives that would encourage peak-period  travelers to shift their travel to off-peak periods, and, in another case, the  sponsor was not required to study shifts to off-peak travel but would  consider doing so in the future.", "Sponsors of peak-period pricing projects conducted more robust studies  of off-peak travel because it was a more explicit goal of their projects.  These studies showed some success in reducing congestion during peak  times. Evaluations for two of the three peak-period pricing projects  showed that drivers chose to take trips at off-peak times on highways,  bridges, and tunnels to take advantage of discounted tolls. For example,  according to a 2005 performance evaluation of traffic on bridges and  tunnels into New York City conducted by the City University of New York  for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, car and truck traffic  increased in off-peak periods for most crossings. The evaluation  reported more significant improvements in the morning before the peak  periods than after the peak periods at the end of the day, which the  evaluation attributed to drivers finding it easier to arrive at work early than  to arrive at work later. According to this survey, a majority of drivers had  little flexibility to change their schedule to travel at off-peak times. For  example, truck drivers said that they could not adjust their delivery  schedules to travel at off-peak times. Furthermore, drivers said that the  toll difference of $1 was not great enough to influence them to change  their travel time. Despite this, a significant minority could alter their travel  departure times between 30 minutes and 2 hours. Thirty-five of the 505  surveyed drivers representing 7.4 percent of passenger trips said that  they changed their travel behavior as a result of the project. According to  the Port Authority, the 7.4 percent change in passenger trips to off-peak  times is significant, since small changes can have exponential effects  because of traffic queuing.", "An evaluation of peak-period pricing on the New Jersey Turnpike based  on a driver survey found that work schedules or a desire to avoid traffic  created a greater incentive for determining when to travel than a slightly  lower toll for off-peak travel. Thus, it appears that drivers chose to travel  at off-peak times because of congestion and not because of modest  differences in price.", "Evaluations of four of the five HOT lane projects assessed changes in  transit ridership, but results were mixed. I-95 in Miami was the only one  with demonstrated increases in transit ridership. Between 2008 and 2010,  the average weekday ridership on the I-95 express bus increased by 57  percent, from about 1,800 riders in 2008 to more than 2,800 in 2010.  About 38 percent of these riders reported in a transit rider survey that  they used to drive alone. The other three HOT lane project evaluations  found no increase in transit ridership on buses using the HOT lanes as a  result of the project. While transit ridership reportedly increased on I-15 in  San Diego, the evaluation stated that this increase was not linked to the  project. Evaluations of all three peak-period pricing projects assessed  whether drivers shifted to transit, but none found evidence of any  changes in transit ridership.", "Many efforts have been made to assess the effects of congestion pricing  projects on equity, including income equity (the distribution of costs and  benefits of congestion pricing between low- and high-income drivers) and  geographic equity (the relative effects of congestion pricing on two  geographic areas, including the effects of any traffic diversion). Three of  the eight evaluations, covering one HOT lane project and three peak- period projects, attempted to assess both income and geographic equity,  and none attempted to assess other effects on equity, such as whether  members of the same group are treated differently or to what extent the  beneficiaries of a project, such as a new lane, pay for those benefits.", "Evaluations for four of the five HOT lane projects attempted to assess  equity through surveys or focus groups of travelers concerning their use  of congestion pricing projects; however, different elements of equity were  evaluated. For example, three of the four HOT lane project evaluations  that assessed equity did so by considering the effects of congestion  pricing on drivers of different income levels. Results for these three  projects\u2014SR 91 in Orange County, I-394 in Minneapolis, and SR 167 in  Seattle\u2014indicated that drivers of all incomes used the HOT lanes, but  high-income drivers used them more often than low-income drivers.addition, evaluations for all four HOT lane projects\u2014SR 91 in Orange  County, I-394 in Minneapolis, SR 167 in Seattle, and I-15 in San Diego\u2014 found that drivers liked having the option of using the HOT lanes and thus  were supportive of them. The fifth HOT lane project\u2014I-95 in Miami\u2014has  not undergone an assessment of the effect of congestion pricing on low-  In  income drivers because, according to the project sponsor, the benefits of  congestion pricing\u2014including increased travel speeds\u2014accrue to all  users.", "Evaluations of the nine peak-period pricing projects considered different  elements of equity and found few impacts. However, all three projects  were previously tolled and toll discounts were offered for travel at off-peak  times. Thus, no tolls, including those for peak periods, were raised. The  New Jersey Turnpike Authority evaluated the income and ethnicity of  those who shifted to the off-peak times, while the Lee County Department  of Transportation assessed the age, gender, and work schedules of those  who shifted to the off-peak times. Both project sponsors also surveyed  drivers, who said they thought the off-peak discounts were equitable and  the pricing program fair. However, the sample sizes for both these  surveys were small; thus, the results may not provide reliable estimates  for the various subgroups they measured.", "Evaluating geographic equity\u2014or the effects of any traffic diverted from  HOT lanes or from peak-period priced highways, bridges and tunnels  onto unpriced lanes and roads\u2014would provide decision makers with  information about potential negative effects, such as whether traffic on the  unpriced alternatives increased. The sponsor of one of the five HOT lanes  projects\u2014SR 91 in Orange County\u2014studied diversion and reported that  traffic was drawn to the roadway and its HOT lanes because the priced  lanes were new and added capacity. Sponsors of the other four HOT lane  projects did not evaluate traffic diversion for several reasons, according to  the sponsors. First, drivers can choose to drive in the unpriced lanes and  none of the projects took away an unpriced lane\u2014only HOV lanes were  converted. Furthermore, two of the HOT lane projects added a lane to the  roadway and allowed solo drivers to use a previously underused HOV  lane. As a result, the sponsors said they expected drivers to be diverted  to the HOT lanes, not away from them. Second, even if they had  anticipated traffic diversion to alternative roads, the sponsors said they  would not have surveyed drivers or asked them to maintain travel diaries  because these methods were expensive and challenging to implement.  They added that electronic data collection methods, such as GPS  tracking in vehicles, transponder tracking, and license plate tracking, can  be expensive and raise privacy issues.", "Two peak-period pricing project sponsors\u2014the New Jersey Turnpike  Authority and the Lee County Department of Transportation\u2014studied  traffic diversion to adjacent unpriced roads and found no evidence of  diversion. According to the studies, such diversion would not be likely for  these roadways because there are no comparable alternative routes.", "Furthermore, the projects were previously tolled and congestion pricing  was implemented with off-peak discounts. As for the HOT lane projects,  traffic diversion may be less of a concern if a highway, bridge, or tunnel  was previously priced than if it was previously unpriced.", "Sponsors of one HOT lane project\u2014SR 167 in Seattle\u2014and one peak- period pricing project\u2014the New Jersey Turnpike\u2014evaluated the impact of  pricing on minorities. An environmental justice assessment for SR 167  found that there would not be a disproportionate effect on minorities  because there was a small minority population in the area, the project  was limited to 9 miles southbound and 11 miles northbound, and there  were unpriced alternatives\u2014adjacent lanes and roads\u2014that could be  used.be no disproportionate effect on minority populations; however, as  mentioned before, the survey sample size was small and therefore its  results cannot be generalized to all users.", "The 2005 New Jersey Turnpike evaluation found that there would  Evaluations of three HOT lane projects\u2014I-15 in San Diego, SR 91 in  Orange County, and I-394 in Minneapolis\u2014and one peak-period pricing  project\u2014the New Jersey Turnpike\u2014assessed environmental effects.

The UPA  and CRD evaluations which began in 2009 will collect data on UPA and  CRD projects in the six metropolitan areas for 1 year before a project is  implemented and then for another year after it has been implemented to  assess its effects. The evaluation framework will provide standard  performance measures such as travel times and vehicle throughput and  help develop a more comprehensive study of congestion pricing,  including increased monitoring of passenger throughput and socio- economic information of HOT lane users. Performance measures and  detailed metrics will be used to assess individual projects and across  projects, which has not been consistently done so far. The evaluation  framework will also assess the impacts of pricing on low-income drivers  and changes in their travel time and distance traveled as a result of  pricing.

Such concerns could be  particularly relevant for HOT lane projects with a potential for large toll  increases, such as projects that must meet HOV Facilities program  performance requirements to maintain traffic speeds of 45 to 55 miles per  hour. Tolls on pricing projects in operation are relatively low, but can be as  high as a dollar per mile. Though currently capped, these tolls could be  raised if necessary to maintain the required traffic speeds. In turn, higher  toll rates could lead to more traffic diversion if drivers chose not to pay for  HOT lanes and took adjacent unpriced lanes or roads instead.", "These concerns may be particularly acute in the future for projects  designed to use pricing not only to manage congestion but also to meet  toll revenue targets. SR 520 in Seattle, which began pricing in December  2011, will generate toll revenues to pay for bonds to build a replacement  bridge. All cars, including carpools, pay a toll that varies up to $5.00.  Registered vanpools, express buses, and emergency vehicles have free  use. Because this is the first project to toll a previously untolled bridge  and there are parallel alternative routes, traffic diversion may become a  concern. According to traffic models from the area\u2019s transportation  planning council, traffic could increase on the parallel Interstate route by 5  to 8 percent and on an alternative state road by 5 percent. Geographic  equity concerns could be minimized by introducing tolling on both the  Interstate and state road because drivers on all three routes would then  pay a toll and diversion from tolled routes to untolled routes would be less  of a concern. However, according to officials in the Seattle metropolitan  area, the public and elected officials are opposed to tolling these other  routes.", "Several other projects under construction involve public-private  partnerships that plan to use toll revenues to pay for construction debt,  operations, maintenance, and provide a return to private investors.  However, meeting revenue targets can be at odds with policies to  increase throughput on highways and bridges by encouraging more  people to use carpools and express bus service. According to one expert,  project sponsors seeking to maximize revenue could in theory charge a  higher toll and make more money off of fewer paying vehicles. Raising  revenue could be at odds with managing congestion (e.g., increasing  passenger throughput) if higher tolls can produce more revenue from  fewer paying vehicles. In addition, as we have previously reported, tolls  on roadways operated by private concessionaires can be expected to be  higher than on comparable facilities operated by public agencies. Three  projects\u2014I-495 in Northern Virginia and the LBJ Express (I-635/I-35E)  and North Tarrant Express (I-820-SH 121/183) in Dallas-Ft.

I-595 project in Broward County, Florida, is also a public-private  partnership, but the state department of transportation has retained the  authority to set the toll rate.", "In addition, I-95 in Miami has raised its carpool occupancy requirements for free use  from two to three passengers. Thus, two-passenger carpools pay a toll to use the HOT  lanes or use the adjacent unpriced lanes. According to the Florida Department of  Transportation, it has not studied the impact of pricing on two-passenger carpools and  therefore does not know how many people have been affected. conversion of HOV lanes or the addition of new lanes.bridge in Seattle is the only previously unpriced facility to be fully priced.  According to experts, pricing existing unpriced lanes and roadways could  lead to geographic equity concerns as drivers divert to alternate routes to  avoid tolls.", "While future pricing projects may raise equity concerns, these concerns  should be weighed against the potential benefits, including enhancing  economic efficiency, increasing throughput, and reducing congestion. For  example, greater use of pricing could enhance economic efficiency by  discouraging solo driving and making alternatives such as carpooling or  taking transit more appealing, thus resulting in more efficient use of existing  roadways. Such changes in drivers\u2019 behavior could also improve  throughput and reduce congestion. In addition, as previously discussed,  the equity impacts of congestion pricing can also be assessed in  comparison to the equity concerns raised by the alternatives\u2014namely the  prevalent sources of funding roadways such as motor fuel and sales taxes.", "A number of options are also available to address equity issues. One  such option is to use a portion of toll revenues for alternative  transportation modes in the highway corridor, such as express bus  service on HOT lanes. In general, bus riders are disproportionately lower- income individuals who would benefit from both reduced congestion on  the HOT lanes and increased transit investments from toll revenues. In a  survey of Seattle residents, public support for tolling the SR 520 bridge  grew substantially if a portion of the toll revenue was dedicated to transit,  even if tolls had to be significantly higher to pay for transit service. As part  of its UPA program funding, Seattle has received grant funds for new  buses to begin service on the SR 520 bridge. Other UPA program  participants, including Minnesota and Miami, have received DOT grants  for express bus service on HOT lanes. Under the ELD program, Federal  law permits the use of excess toll revenue for eligible highway and/or  transit service; however, pricing projects generally have not had excess  revenues. Officials with the transportation planning council for the  Minneapolis-St. Paul area told us that revenues from the I-394 project  have generally not exceeded the project\u2019s operational costs and therefore  local transit funds are being used, as they were before the project was  initiated, to provide express bus service on the HOT lanes. The San  Diego Association of Governments also has used bus fare revenue to  fund express bus service on I-15 in San Diego because the HOT lanes  have not generated enough toll revenues to pay for bus service. In  addition to the availability of revenues, the effectiveness of providing  revenues to transit to address equity also depends on the availability of  transit service and traveler commuting patterns. Transit may not be an  option for some travelers given the location of homes, jobs, and other  travel destinations.", "I-25 in Denver has taken steps to address equity among passengers and  drivers on the HOT lanes by setting its peak period toll rate based on the  fare charged to express bus passengers on the HOT lanes. Thus, as the  fare for express bus passengers increases, the toll rate for drivers to use  the HOT lanes also increases.", "An additional option to address equity issues would be to use toll  revenues to reimburse low-income drivers, whether by exempting them  from paying tolls or by providing them with a tax credit for the difference  between the toll and transit fares. However, such reimbursement  programs would involve complex efforts to determine and verify drivers\u2019  low-income status. Nonetheless, some states such as California offer  discounted utility rates for eligible households and in these states,  transportation agencies have considered whether to use these preexisting  mechanisms for eligibility and enforcement to provide discounted toll  rates. However, no pricing project has used this option. Some experts  have noted that discounts on tolls for low-income drivers would  counteract the goal of reducing congestion because the discounts would  encourage continued driving. Instead, they propose charging the same  tolls to all users, but returning revenues to affected groups, such as  groups of vehicle owners or a class of residents. VPPP federal funds  were used to study the potential of providing credits for low-income  highway users in Alameda County, California but no pricing project has  used this option.", "To provide insight on environmental justice issues, DOT approved two  VPPP grants for fiscal year 2010-2011 to assess the impacts of pricing on  low-income drivers. One grant, for I-30 in Dallas-Ft. Worth is to examine  environmental justice issues related to pricing I-30 through the use of  Intelligent Transportation Systems technology. According to DOT, \u201cthe  project is important because it will provide more data on environmental  justice and pricing, given that there is little experience with strategies  designed to address these issues related to the introduction of pricing.\u201d  The other grant, for a pricing project in Hartford, Connecticut, is to study  the application of pricing and the impacts of environmental justice issues  that resulted from the original construction of a project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Safety Issues May Occur with Pricing Converted Shoulder Lanes and Narrowing Lanes", "paragraphs": ["Many highway projects increase the capacity of a roadway by converting  shoulders or narrowing lanes which has the advantage of eliminating the  need to widen highway and acquire additional property\u2014of particular  advantage in urban areas. Several congestion pricing projects have  employed this strategy. For example, the Minnesota Department of  Transportation has converted bus-only shoulder lanes on I-35W in  Minneapolis to serve as HOT lanes during peak periods and has  narrowed traffic lanes from 12 feet to 11 feet. In addition, as previously  noted, the Florida Department of Transportation has incorporated portions  of its medians and shoulders and narrowed traffic lanes from 12 feet to 11  feet to create two HOT lanes on I-95 in Miami. Moreover, two new  projects\u2014Loop 1 in Austin and I-94 in Minneapolis\u2014will create new  capacity by using shoulders and narrowing traffic lanes. The Loop 1  project will reduce shoulder width and incorporate parts of the shoulders  to create an express lane, while the I-94 project may, if implemented, use  shoulders and narrowed traffic lanes to create a HOT lane between  Minneapolis and St. Paul. According to the project sponsor, I-94 does not  have the space to build new HOT lanes if shoulders are not incorporated.", "Projects that convert shoulders and narrow lanes to create new lanes,  including congestion pricing projects, raise concerns about driver safety  and highway operations that transportation planners must address.  Additional lanes on converted shoulders remove the safety refuge areas  for motorists during vehicle breakdowns and emergencies and must be  approved by DOT. According to the American Association of State  Highway Transportation Officials, highways with paved shoulders have  lower accident rates. Paved shoulders provide space to make evasive  maneuvers; accommodate driver error; and add a recovery area to regain  control of a vehicle, among other things. In addition, an analysis by the  Highway Safety Information System sponsored by DOT reported that  narrowing lanes or using shoulders to expand urban highways increased  accidents by 10 percent. With traffic moving faster in the additional (or  HOT) lane and slower in the unpriced lanes, the potential for sideswiping  and lane-changing accidents increases. Another study conducted by the  Texas Transportation Institute found that maintaining a shoulder and a  wider HOV lane than adjacent unpriced lanes can help mitigate safety  concerns.", "FHWA officials in Florida suggested that some of these safety issues  could be mitigated using an incident management system, such as the  one the Florida Department of Transportation has used on I-95 since  2008. As a condition of approving several design exceptions, FHWA  required the Florida Department of Transportation to implement Intelligent  Transportation Systems to mitigate safety issues related to incorporating  a shoulder and narrowing lanes on I-95 in Miami. While using an incident  management system does not prevent incidents from occurring, cameras  can survey highways and detect incidents such as accidents, debris, and  stalled vehicles. Highway message signs then convey information to  drivers about the incidents and traffic conditions. Florida Department of  Transportation staff can summon emergency, police, and tow truck crews  to resolve problems and direct traffic. Thus, in the event of an incident on  the HOT lanes, the lanes can be closed and, because there are no  permanent barriers between the HOT lanes and the adjacent unpriced  lanes, traffic can be diverted to the adjacent unpriced lanes. In the event  of an accident in the unpriced lanes, the lanes can be closed and traffic  diverted to the HOT lanes and tolls temporarily lifted.", "Since the HOT lanes on I-95 opened for traffic in December 2008,  preliminary safety data found that the number of reported incidents  involving accidents, debris, and stalled vehicles in the northbound  express lanes increased from 132 in fiscal year 2009 to 209 in fiscal year  2010. Florida Department of Transportation officials have suggested,  however, that the actual number of incidents may not have increased but  that incidents are now tracked more accurately. In addition, according to  FHWA officials in Florida, the number and severity of crashes declined  after the I-95 HOT lanes became operational. In their view, the HOT lanes  decreased congestion, and as a result, fewer rear-end crashes occurred.  Additionally, FHWA officials stated that they have not seen evidence of  more sideswiping since the traffic lanes were narrowed to form the HOT  lanes.

Pricing has the potential  to reduce congestion by influencing drivers to carpool, use transit, or drive  at off-peak travel times. Congestion pricing has, where evaluated, helped  reduce congestion. However, it is difficult to draw overall conclusions about  the effectiveness of pricing because only half the sponsors with projects  now open to traffic have evaluated their projects. Other results, where  available, are mixed, as project sponsors have used different measures to  assess performance and little has been done to compare performance  across projects. Where congestion pricing projects have also added lanes,  the results of pricing have not been distinguished from the results of adding  capacity.

Two  project sponsors (one sponsor of the SR 261, SR 241, and SR 133 in  Orange County, California and one sponsor of the SR 73 in Orange County,  California) did not perform evaluations of their peak-period priced highways.  Two project sponsors (one for I-15 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and one for I-10  and US 290 in Houston, Texas) completed performance evaluations,  however these three highways have significantly changed in character since  then and thus the original evaluations are no longer relevant. For example, I- 15 in Salt Lake City currently uses electronic tolling with dynamic pricing  whereas when the project was evaluated a monthly decal with a static toll  was used. I-10 was evaluated as one HOT lane with free access of carpools  of 3 passengers but is now 2 HOT lanes with free access for carpools of 2  passengers. In addition, although US 290 was assessed in the I-10  evaluation, no pre- and post-data were used to measure the impact of pricing  on performance. The project sponsor of I-25 in Denver, Colorado reported on  monthly counts of traffic volumes and other measures but did not do so  before and after pricing was introduced; therefore, we were unable to use the  data to compare with other projects. Three project sponsors (I-680 in  Alameda County, California; the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in  California; and MD-200 in Montgomery County, Maryland) implemented  projects recently and have not had adequate time to evaluate the projects.  Three other projects\u2014I-35 W in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which has the  same project sponsor as I-394; SR 520 in Seattle, Washington, which has  the same project sponsor as SR 167; and I-85 in Atlanta, Georgia\u2014became  operational recently and have also not been evaluated. I-35W, SR 520, and  I-85 will be assessed as part of the UPA evaluations.", "The eight project sponsors with current and completed evaluations we  reviewed were I-95 in Miami, Florida; I-15 in San Diego, California; SR 91  in Orange County, California; SR 167 in Seattle, Washington; I-394 in  Minneapolis, Minnesota; the New Jersey Turnpike, New Jersey; two  bridges in Lee County, Florida; and four bridges and two tunnels  managed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, New York.  For each, we assessed the studies\u2019 methodology to determine whether or  not the data reported was valid and sufficient for our analysis. However,  we did not conduct a thorough assessment of the quality of the  evaluations\u2019 methods as our objective was to assess the projects\u2019  performance results where available. Once we determined which data  was sufficiently reliable for our uses, we summarized the results reported  in each performance evaluation for each project. The eight performance  evaluations assessed various performance measures such as traffic  speed, travel time, throughput, and transit ridership. The performance  measures we focused our analysis on were: travel time and speed,  throughput, off-peak travel, transit ridership, and equity. As a basis for  assessing what performance measures we should review, we used a list  of performance measures, some of which are outlined in the DOT\u2019s UPA  and CRD National Evaluation Framework. We chose these measurement  areas because they were the most commonly reported in the evaluations  and because they are the most commonly required measures for projects  with federal monitoring requirements. We corroborated our choice of  measures with FHWA and the Battelle Memorial Institute which is  conducting the UPA evaluations using similar measures. We then  compared the projects by qualitatively assessing the results for the five  performance measures listed above and counting how many of the  projects reported positive or negative results in each performance  measurement category. We could not quantitatively compare results  across projects because they did not use the same metrics and thus were  assessed and reported differently according to project sponsor preference  and resources. Project evaluations covered specific time periods and thus  performance results are only for those time periods. Projects\u2019  performance results may have changed since evaluations were  completed.", "We discussed with Battelle Memorial Institute, Texas Transportation  Institute, and the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center the UPA  and CRD evaluation framework including its performance measures and  metrics as well as challenges of conducting an evaluation across multiple  projects.", "We also conducted site visits for the SR 167 and SR 520 projects in  Seattle, Washington; I-95 project in Miami, Florida; and I-394 and I-35W  in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. We selected our site visits based on  a judgmental sample of projects with completed evaluations; these sites  included both HOT lanes and peak-period priced projects in different  geographical areas of the United States. For each site visit, we met with  relevant officials from state DOT, officials from the FHWA division office,  project sponsors, and officials from local agencies such as the MPO and  transit agencies. Discussion with project sponsors included clarifying the  goal of the pricing projects and evaluations of the project performance. In  addition to conducting interviews, we collected relevant documents,  including environmental analyses, performance evaluations, and traveler  surveys, and analyzed these documents as necessary. Where  appropriate, we corroborated the interviews with documents obtained  from project sponsors and FHWA.", "To identify the emerging issues in congestion pricing projects, we  reviewed literature on congestion pricing, equity, environmental justice,  traffic diversion, safety and other topics related to the benefits, costs, and  trade-offs associated with congestion pricing. We reviewed prior GAO  reports and analyses and reports from the FHWA, CRS, CBO, and  industry experts and organizations that have evaluated the impacts of  congestion pricing projects. We discussed our review of the reports with  FHWA and FTA officials, officials from state DOTs and MPOs, and  transportation experts from academia and think-tanks. We identified and  interviewed experts with published work on congestion pricing and its  impacts. Discussions with officials and experts included the costs and  benefits of congestion pricing projects, trends in pricing designs and  implementation, and methods to mitigate negative impacts. We also  provided a copy of the draft report to a group of experts for an  independent review. We selected these experts because they have  published numerous studies analyzing the benefits and challenges of  congestion pricing and its effects that are prominent in the transportation  literature, and come from a cross section of institutions including  academia, research organizations, and the private sector. We considered  and incorporated their comments into the final report as appropriate.", "Group of Experts that Reviewed Draft Congestion Pricing Report  Tod Litman, Researcher, Victoria Transport Policy Institute  Lee Munnich, Professor, Senior Fellow and Director, State and Local  Policy Program, Hubert H.
