Money transmitters transfer money for their customers to recipients domestically or internationally. Common reasons given for terminating accounts included the customer not providing information needed to satisfy the banks' due diligence requirements under Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and that the cost of BSA/AML compliance made these customers unprofitable. However, banks also cited concerns that these customers drew heightened regulatory oversight; this may indicate \u201cderisking,\u201d the practice of banks limiting services or closing accounts with customers to avoid any perceived regulatory concerns about facilitating money laundering.", "Federal bank examiners in some of GAO's discussion groups identified challenges in assessing banks' compliance with due diligence requirements. In 2005, the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the federal banking regulators issued interagency interpretive guidance to clarify BSA/AML requirements and supervisory expectations for banks providing banking services to money transmitters. The guidance was incorporated in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council BSA/AML examination manual. However, examiners from some discussion groups said it was unclear how much due diligence is reasonable to expect banks to conduct for their money transmitter customers. For example, while the manual's examination guidance pertaining to money transmitters states that due diligence on higher-risk accounts can include reviewing the money transmitter's BSA/AML compliance program or conducting on-site visits, the related examination procedures do not clarify what these reviews or visits might entail. Unless federal banking regulators take steps to improve examiners' ability to evaluate banks' compliance with BSA/AML requirements as applied to money transmitter accounts, examiners may not be fully achieving examination objectives.", "In response to derisking concerns associated with money transmitters, FinCEN and the federal banking regulators have issued general guidance that discourages banks from terminating accounts with any particular customer type without evaluating individual customers' risks. In prior work, GAO noted that regulators had not fully evaluated how banks' regulatory concerns may be influencing decisions to derisk. GAO recommended that FinCEN and the federal banking regulators conduct a retrospective review of BSA regulations and their implementation, with a focus on how banks' regulatory concerns may affect their decisions to provide services. According to federal banking regulators and FinCEN, they and Treasury established an interagency working group in early 2018 that they believe will address the recommendation. The working group has taken important steps toward improving the efficiency and effectiveness of BSA/AML supervision, including issuing an interagency statement intended to improve the transparency of the risk-focused approach examiners use to plan and conduct BSA examinations. However, the working group has not yet evaluated the full range of factors that may influence banks to derisk."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making a total of four recommendations to the federal banking regulators that each regulator improve examiners' ability to evaluate banks' BSA/AML compliance as applied to money transmitter accounts.

We conducted eight discussion groups with  BSA/AML examiners (six to 14 examiners in each group) from the federal  banking regulators to understand how they assess BSA/AML compliance  controls around money transmitter customers.", "To address our second objective, we asked examiners in our discussion  groups to identify any challenges they encountered when assessing these  compliance controls. We also reviewed examination guidance and  procedures for assessing BSA/AML compliance controls around money  transmitters. We assessed this information against federal internal control  standards related to identifying risks and communicating information. We  also reviewed documentation from BSA/AML examinations of a  nongeneralizable sample of 56 banks and credit unions that reflected a  mix of asset sizes from each federal banking regulator. We also included  banks that had enforcement actions taken against them to gain additional  context about BSA/AML examinations, including BSA/AML violations.", "To address our third objective, we administered a web-based survey to a  nationally representative sample of banks in the United States for a total  survey sample of 406 banks. In the survey, we asked banks about  terminations of money transmitter accounts and limitations on account  offerings related to BSA/AML risk and the reasons for these decisions for  the period January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016. We obtained a  weighted survey response rate of 46.5 percent. While we designed the  survey to be nationally representative of all banks in the United States,  some results are statistically nongeneralizable because of the relatively  small number of banks that reported having money transmitters as  customers. For survey questions that are statistically nongeneralizable,  we present only the number of responses to each survey question, and  the results are not generalizable to the population of banks. See appendix  I for more information on our survey methodology and appendix II for our  survey results.

In complying with  BSA/AML requirements, U.S. financial institutions assist government  agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorist  financing by, among other things, establishing and maintaining  compliance programs, conducting ongoing monitoring of customers and  transactions, and reporting suspicious activity. Oversight and  enforcement of compliance with the BSA involve several federal  agencies, including FinCEN and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  FinCEN has overall authority for administering and enforcing compliance  under the BSA and may seek civil penalties and injunctions to compel  compliance. In addition, each of the federal banking regulators has  independent authority to initiate enforcement actions against supervised  institutions for violations of law and to seek civil money penalties for BSA  violations, among other things. FinCEN has delegated authority to IRS to  investigate most criminal violations of the BSA. The Department of  Justice prosecutes violations of federal criminal money-laundering  statutes, including violations of the BSA, and several law enforcement  agencies conduct BSA-related criminal investigations.", "The federal banking regulators have also issued BSA/AML regulations  that require banks to establish and maintain a BSA/AML compliance  program that includes, among other things, policies, procedures, and  processes to identify and report suspicious activity. The banking  regulators are required to review banks\u2019 compliance with BSA/AML  requirements and regulations, which they generally do every 1 to 2 years  as a part of their routine safety and soundness examinations. FinCEN has  also delegated examination authority for BSA/AML compliance for certain  entities, including money transmitters, to IRS. In general, money  transmitters must register with FinCEN and provide certain information on  their structure and ownership. According to Treasury, in all but one state,  money transmitters are required to obtain licenses from states in which  they are incorporated or conduct business. State supervisory agencies  also may conduct BSA/AML examinations of licensed money transmitters.", "To ensure consistency in the application of BSA/AML requirements, in  2005 the federal banking regulators collaborated with FinCEN on  developing an examination manual that was issued by FFIEC for federal  bank examiners conducting BSA/AML examinations of banks. The  examination manual has been revised several times since its release, and  the most recent comprehensive revision was released in 2014. According  to the examination manual, a key function of the federal banking  regulators\u2019 BSA/AML examinations is to assess whether banks have  established the appropriate policies, procedures, and processes based on  their BSA/AML risk to identify and report suspicious activity. The  supervisory process also assesses whether banks provide sufficient detail  in reports to law enforcement agencies to make the reports useful for  investigating suspicious transactions that are reported. Moreover, federal  banking regulators conduct risk-focused BSA/AML examinations of  banks\u2014that is, they review key BSA/AML risks or specific risk areas  identified by the bank and tailor examination procedures based on each  bank\u2019s risk profile. Among other things, examiners review whether banks have an adequate system of internal controls to ensure ongoing  compliance with BSA/AML regulations. Similarly, in 2008 FinCEN issued  a BSA examination manual to guide reviews of money transmitters and  other types of MSBs, including reviews by IRS and state regulators.

Banks must have written  procedures for opening accounts and must specify what identifying  information they will obtain from each customer. At a minimum, the  bank must obtain the following identifying information from each  customer before opening the account: name, date of birth, address,  and identification number, such as a Social Security number or a  passport number. Banks\u2019 customer identification programs must also  include risk-based procedures for verifying the identity of each  customer to the extent reasonable and practicable. Additionally, a  bank\u2019s customer identification program should contain procedures for  circumstances when a bank cannot verify the customer\u2019s identity,  including procedures for when the bank should not open an account  and when the bank should close an account.", "Customer due diligence procedures. These procedures assist  banks in determining when transactions are potentially suspicious.  Procedures must be designed to achieve two minimum regulatory  requirements: (1) understanding the nature and purpose of customer  relationships so customer risk profiles can be developed and (2)  conducting ongoing monitoring, based on the level of risk associated  with the customer, to identify and report suspicious activity and to  maintain and update customer information on a risk-basis.", "Additional due diligence procedures. Due diligence procedures  also should define when and what additional customer information will  be collected for customers who banks determine may pose a higher  risk for money laundering or terrorist financing. Procedures should be  based on each customer\u2019s risk profile and specific risks posed. Banks  review higher-risk customers and their transactions more closely at  account opening and more frequently throughout the term of their  relationship with the bank.", "In addition, banks and money transmitters must also have policies and  procedures to monitor transactions and identify suspicious activity.  Monitoring generally includes (1) manual review of transaction summary  reports to identify suspicious transactions or (2) automated monitoring  systems that use computer algorithms to identify patterns of unusual  activity. As we previously reported, banks with large transaction volumes  typically use automated monitoring systems.", "Banks and money transmitters also must comply with certain reporting  requirements:", "Currency Transaction Reports.

These agents present money- laundering risks if they knowingly or unknowingly fail to follow  BSA/AML requirements or the policies and programs established by  the money transmitter. For example, an agent may not follow the  recordkeeping requirements for transfers above the regulatory funds  transfer threshold or above lower thresholds that a money transmitter  has self-imposed. MSB principals are required to conduct risk-based  monitoring of their agents.", "Customers. Certain customers may pose heightened risk because of  the nature of their business, occupation, or anticipated transaction  activity. Additionally, in certain instances, they may be able to launder  money while remaining anonymous. For example, customers may use  false identities or straw men (individuals hired to conduct transfers on  behalf of others) to keep from being identified as the original source of  the funds. Examples of suspicious customer activity that may indicate  money laundering include identification documents that cannot be  easily verified; the use of different taxpayer identification numbers with variations of the same name; frequent or large transactions with no  record of past or present employment; and reluctance to provide  identification for transactions subject to identification requirements.", "Geographic location. Certain geographic locations may be more  vulnerable to money laundering or terrorist financing via money  transfers. High-risk geographic locations can be either international or  domestic. According to FinCEN\u2019s MSB examination manual,  examples of international high-risk geographic locations include  countries subject to sanctions by the Office of Foreign Assets Control  or countries and territories identified as being noncooperative.  Domestic high-risk geographic locations include High Intensity Drug  Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) and High Intensity Financial Crime Areas  (HIFCA).", "Products. According to the FFIEC and FinCEN MSB examination  manuals, certain products and services, such as money transfers,  may pose a higher risk of money laundering because of the degree of  anonymity they can offer. For example, the Financial Action Task  Force identified money-laundering and terrorist-financing risks  associated with mobile payments because these services can  sometimes allow for anonymous transactions, depending on the level  of AML measures the mobile payments provider has in place.

According to the interagency guidance, a  bank\u2019s level and extent of due diligence beyond the minimum  expectations should be based on an assessment of the individual  customer\u2019s BSA/AML risks. If a particular MSB relationship indicates a  low risk of money laundering or other illicit activity, the bank may not be  routinely expected to perform further due diligence beyond minimum  expectations. Minimum expectations include applying the bank\u2019s  customer identification program and confirming FinCEN registration (if  required), agent status (if applicable), and state and local licensing  requirements (if applicable). Banks are also to conduct a basic BSA/AML  risk assessment to determine the level of risk associated with the account  and whether further due diligence is necessary. In order to properly  assess risks, the interpretive guidance clarifies that banks should  consider the purpose of the account, the types of products and services  offered by the MSB, the locations and markets it serves, and the  anticipated account activity (see text box).", "Examples of Basic Information Banks Should Consider When Assessing a Money  Transmitter\u2019s Money-Laundering Risk, According to the Interagency Guidance  Purpose of account: Whether the money transmitter needs the bank account to  transfer funds to its principal U.S. account or to foreign-based agents in other countries.", "Products and services offered: Whether the money transmitter is a principal with a  fleet of agents, or is it an agent itself, and whether money transmission the customer\u2019s  primary or ancillary business (such as a grocery store that derives a small fraction of its  overall revenue from providing money transmission services).", "Locations served: Whether the money transmitter\u2019s market domestic or international  and whether it targets local residents or broad markets.", "Anticipated account activity: Relevant considerations include the expected transaction  amounts and whether the money transmitter is operating out of one location and using  one bank branch, or whether it has several agents making deposits at multiple branches  throughout the bank\u2019s network.", "If a bank concludes from its risk assessment that the MSB customer  presents a higher level of money-laundering or terrorist-financing risk, it  will be expected to conduct additional due diligence in a manner  commensurate with the heightened risk. According to the interagency  guidance, the appropriate amount of due diligence depends in part on the  level of perceived risk and the size and sophistication of the particular  MSB. Appropriate due diligence can include reviewing the MSB\u2019s  BSA/AML compliance program, the results of the MSB\u2019s independent  testing of its program, and written agent management and termination  practices for the MSB, as well as conducting on-site visits to the MSB.", "The interagency guidance also provides examples of \u201crisk indicators\u201d to  assist banks with their risk assessments. Examples of potentially lower- risk indicators include a money transmitter that primarily markets to  customers that conduct routine transactions with moderate frequency in  low dollar amounts; is an established business with an operating history;  or only remits funds to domestic entities. Examples of potentially higher- risk indicators include a money transmitter that allows customers to  conduct transactions in higher dollar amounts with moderate to high  frequency; is a new business without an established operating history;  offers only, or specializes in, cross-border transactions, particularly to  countries posing heightened risk for money laundering or terrorism  financing; or is located in an area designated as a HIFCA or HIDTA. The  guidance notes that in determining the level of risk, a bank should not  focus on any single indicator. Rather, an effective risk assessment should  be a composite of multiple factors, and depending on the circumstances,  certain factors may be weighed more heavily than others.", "Banks\u2019 customer risk assessments also determine the level of ongoing  monitoring for suspicious activity they must perform on each customer.  The interagency guidance states that, based on the bank\u2019s assessment of  the risks of its MSB customers (including money transmitters), monitoring  should include periodic confirmation that initial projections of account  activity have remained reasonably consistent over time. Examples of  potentially suspicious activity include a money transmitter transferring  funds to a different jurisdiction than expected or depositing currency  significantly in excess of expected amounts without any justifiable  explanation, such as an expansion of business activity or new locations.", "Officials from several banks we spoke with described their additional due  diligence procedures for implementing BSA/AML requirements when  accepting new money transmitter customers or monitoring existing ones.

After reviewing the information, the bank\u2019s  BSA/AML compliance department may choose to speak one-on-one with  the potential money transmitter customer or conduct a site visit. When  monitoring a new money transmitter customer for suspicious activity,  compliance staff compare answers from the due diligence questionnaire  against the customer\u2019s cash log and wire activity to determine if the  activity is outside normal parameters.

In  discussion groups held with federal bank examiners, examiners from all  discussion groups noted that their review of the transaction activity of  money transmitter accounts is essential to determining whether the bank  understands the money transmitter\u2019s business and has appropriately  assessed the risk. For example, one examiner said that customer due  diligence procedures at account opening should include the appropriate  qualitative and quantitative questions so that the bank can make a  reasonable determination of the types and volumes of transactions that  will be flowing in and out of the account.", "Examiners from all discussion groups said that when assessing the  bank\u2019s risk assessment of a money transmitter, they focus on whether the  bank has considered the risk factors discussed in the examination  manual, including geography, customer type, products, services, and  transactional volume. In some discussion groups, examiners noted that  they may review money transmitter accounts if these accounts are  included in the sampling of bank customer accounts as part of the core  examination procedures. One examiner said that because banks in her  region do not tend to specialize in money transmitters or have a  significant degree of risk from them, the only time she reviews money  transmitter accounts is if they are included in her sample for transaction  testing. Examiners from one discussion group said that they may review  money transmitters as part of expanded examination review procedures  for nonbank financial institutions if the bank has a large portfolio of money  transmitter accounts. For example, one examiner said he generally does  not set out to look for and review money transmitter accounts when  conducting a BSA/AML examination, but in one case his examination  team learned that during the course of a merger, a bank acquired a  number of nonbank financial institutions, including MSBs. As this bank did  not have prior experience with these kinds of customers, the examination  team decided to include them in the scope of their review. Examiners in  all discussion groups said that they neither instruct nor recommend that  banks close accounts with money transmitters or other types of MSBs.", "Although IRS and state agencies also examine money transmitters and  other MSBs, examiners from all discussion groups said that BSA/AML  requirements and guidance do not allow banks to rely on IRS or state  oversight. These examiners said these reports could provide banks with a  useful additional source of information when conducting their due  diligence on MSB customers. However, these examiners added that the  reports would not substitute for or reduce the due diligence expected of  banks in complying with BSA/AML compliance program requirements..  Examiners from most discussion groups observed that they know very  little about the quality of state or IRS examinations of MSBs and their  frequency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examiners Identified BSA/AML Compliance Challenges for Some Banks with MSB Customers, Including Money Transmitters", "paragraphs": ["Examiners in our discussion groups said the challenges that some banks  face in ensuring BSA/AML compliance for their MSB customers include  those related to customer due diligence, risk assessments, customer  identification, and BSA/AML compliance staff and resources.", "Customer due diligence. Examiners from most discussion groups  said that some banks do not fully understand the customer due  diligence requirements for banking MSBs. Examiners in some  discussion groups said that banks do not always fully review or  understand the documents and information obtained from their MSB  customers in conducting due diligence. One examiner described an  instance where bank staff could not understand documentation  collected from MSB customers in a foreign language. Examiners in  some discussion groups said banks do not understand the need to  conduct ongoing monitoring of MSB accounts, including of the flow  and volume of customers\u2019 transactions. For example, one examiner in  a different discussion group described an instance of a community  bank that was unaware that an MSB account had $2 billion flowing  through annually even though the bank had only $1 billion in assets.  Examiners in some discussion groups said that banks also may not  fully understand their automated software for monitoring suspicious  activity or how to set the proper software parameters for capturing  potentially suspicious transactions. One examiner in a different  discussion group said that without proper monitoring, a bank would  not know when sudden changes in MSB customers\u2019 transaction types  or volumes would be considered suspicious and should be reported.", "Risk assessment. Examiners in many discussion groups said some  banks do not appropriately assess their MSB customers\u2019 risk, either  because they do not consider relevant risk factors or they rate all MSB  customers at the same risk level. One examiner in a discussion group  said he examined a bank with many money transmitter customers that  transmitted funds to several countries and found that the bank did not  assess the risk levels of the countries to which the money transmitters  sent funds. An examiner in a different discussion group said that  banks often assess all MSBs at the same level of risk because they  do not understand the difference between the various risk levels.  Another examiner in the same discussion group added that banks  often do not understand the guidance clarifying that banks should  assess each customer\u2019s risk individually. This statement was  corroborated by our review of several banks\u2019 BSA policies that  stipulated that all money transmitters and other MSBs should be  considered high risk, contrary to the 2005 guidance.", "Customer identification. Examiners from many discussion groups  said banks do not always identify their MSB customers\u2014for example,  when a bank acquires another bank without being aware that the  acquired bank has MSB customers. Examiners in some discussion  groups said that failure to properly identify MSB customers stems  partly from inadequate due diligence or risk assessment.", "BSA/AML compliance staff and resources. Examiners in many  discussion groups said that some banks do not have sufficient  BSA/AML compliance staff or resources to manage their BSA/AML  compliance programs. For example, an examiner in one discussion  group described a bank with nearly 70 money transmitters and more  than 200 check cashers but only four staff in its BSA/AML compliance  department, which the examiner considered inadequate.", "Examiners in many discussion groups said that BSA/AML deficiencies  generally stem from overall weakness in a bank\u2019s BSA/AML compliance  program or internal controls, and not from providing services to money  transmitters or any particular customer type. An examiner from one  discussion group noted that a bank with weak internal controls around  money transmitters likely has weak internal controls across its BSA/AML  compliance program. Examples of deficiencies provided by examiners  across discussion groups include banks failing to follow written policies  and procedures, rating entire categories of customers as high-risk rather  than assessing individual customer risk, not conducting on-site customer  reviews, failing to conduct other due diligence, and not properly  monitoring and reporting suspicious activities. Moreover, our review of  bank examination documents found that BSA/AML-related deficiencies  mostly stemmed from weakness in banks\u2019 BSA/AML compliance  programs and internal controls overall\u2014for example, in customer  identification programs, customer due diligence procedures and practices,  and risk assessments\u2014and not from a bank providing services to MSBs  or any other customer type.", "According to examiner discussion groups and examination documents we  reviewed, not all banks with MSB customers experience BSA/AML  compliance challenges. Examiners in some discussion groups noted that  banks that successfully provide accounts to MSBs, including money  transmitters, tend to have a strong BSA/AML compliance program. For  example, examiners in some discussion groups said that such banks  have internal controls commensurate with the BSA/AML risks of the MSB  customers, including conducting appropriate monitoring and due diligence  of customers, and understand the full scope of MSB customers\u2019 activities.", "The examiners stated that these banks also have sufficient BSA/AML  compliance staff who received training. Similarly, our review of bank  examination documents included examples of banks with MSB customers  that complied with BSA/AML compliance program requirements, such as  a community bank with 80 money transmitters. In the examination  documents we reviewed, examiners noted that although the bank  engaged in higher-risk business, it was managing the risk appropriately."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Examiners Identified Challenges in Assessing Banks\u2019 Due Diligence for Money Transmitters", "paragraphs": ["While views among examiners in our discussion groups varied,  examiners in some discussion groups identified challenges in assessing  banks\u2019 customer due diligence for money transmitters and other MSB  customers. As discussed earlier, the FFIEC examination manual includes  an expanded examination section for nonbank financial institutions that  provides procedures and guidance for examiners when assessing banks\u2019  compliance controls for MSB customers, including money transmitters.  The procedures direct examiners to determine whether the banks\u2019  policies, procedures, and processes to assess risks posed by MSB  customers allow the banks to effectively identify higher-risk accounts and  the amount of further due diligence that is necessary. The expanded  examination guidance provides examples of actions banks can take to  meet the additional due diligence requirement for customers they deem to  be higher risk. Examiners from many discussion groups said they believe  these procedures and guidance are sufficient. One examiner noted that  assessing controls is the same for a bank\u2019s MSB customers as for any  other type of customer.", "However, examiners from some discussion groups said it was unclear  how much due diligence is reasonable to expect banks to conduct for  their money transmitters and other MSB customers. An examiner in one  discussion group said it was not clear from the examination procedures  and guidance how much banks were expected to question and request  information from their MSB customers or monitor their MSB customers\u2019  due diligence efforts without expecting banks to act as the de facto  regulator for MSBs. Other examiners noted that although banks are  responsible for understanding the kinds of transactions that flow through  an MSB, to some extent banks do not have visibility into these individual  transactions, as they are aggregated before flowing into the account at  the bank. Similarly, another examiner said there was uncertainty about  how critical an examiner should be of a bank\u2019s due diligence efforts in  cases where a bank\u2019s documentation on an MSB customer\u2019s BSA/AML  compliance program is lacking. One examiner noted that while the  examination guidance provides examples of due diligence actions banks  can consider performing, those actions are not requirements. The  examiner said it was therefore not clear to what extent examiners should  apply these examples as criteria and expect banks to have implemented  them.", "Further, examiners in some discussion groups said that it can be difficult  to evaluate banks\u2019 risk assessments, including processes for identifying  higher-risk customers that require additional due diligence. One examiner  said that it is unclear from the examination procedures how to determine  whether banks\u2019 risk assessment processes for identifying higher-risk  customers are adequate. An examiner in a different discussion group said  that in evaluating banks\u2019 risk assessment of new money transmitter  customers, he looks for whether banks ask why new customers switched  banks. However, other examiners in the same discussion group noted  that this is not a standard question.", "Our review of the expanded examination section found a lack of  examples of specific steps or processes that examiners can take in  assessing banks\u2019 compliance for additional due diligence. For example,  this section\u2019s procedures contain only a general reference that examiners  should determine whether the banks\u2019 policies, procedures, and processes  effectively allow the banks to identify and conduct risk-based due  diligence for higher-risk customers and lack specific examples to assist  examiners in evaluating additional due diligence activities. The section\u2019s  guidance states that examiners could take actions, including reviewing an  MSB\u2019s BSA/AML compliance program or conducting on-site visits to help  evaluate a bank\u2019s compliance. But neither the guidance nor the  procedures clarify what these reviews or visits might entail. In  comparison, the expanded section\u2019s guidance and procedures include  examples of specific steps that examiners can take when assessing  banks\u2019 compliance with minimum due diligence requirements for MSB  accounts, such as applying the bank\u2019s customer identification program  and confirming FinCEN registration status and state licensing, if  applicable.", "Officials from the Federal Reserve and OCC said that the examination  manual is not intended to provide explicit criteria for examiners when they  are assessing the adequacy of a bank\u2019s program. They said that  establishing explicit criteria would result in a \u201ccheck the box\u201d approach to  BSA/AML compliance, such that banks are given a uniform set of  requirements to follow, irrespective of the money-laundering or terrorism- financing risks associated with their banking activities. They said that if  banks only needed to meet specific requirements, such an approach  would encourage banks to do the minimum to establish a BSA/AML  compliance program and would not effectively detect and deter money  laundering and terrorism financing. As discussed earlier, the examination  manual is instead structured to allow examiners to tailor the BSA/AML  examination scope and procedures to the specific risk profile of the bank.  Staff from the federal banking regulators said that as a result, examiners  are expected to apply their judgment in evaluating banks\u2019 BSA/AML  compliance programs.", "However, while regulators want compliance programs to be tailored to the  unique risks a bank\u2019s operations present, examiners need sufficient  guidance to determine whether a given bank\u2019s BSA/AML-related policies,  processes, and procedures are adequate. Regulators and FinCEN issued  the 2005 interagency guidance to clarify BSA/AML requirements and  supervisory expectations for banks when providing banking services to  money transmitters and other MSBs. Since then, examiners have relied  on this guidance when reviewing banks\u2019 MSB customer accounts.  However, the examination procedures and related guidance may not  provide all of the information examiners need to conduct their  assessments, as indicated by the examiners in some of our discussion  groups who reported that it is not clear to them how to determine whether  banks\u2019 due diligence efforts are adequate. Providing clarifying information  would not compromise examiners\u2019 ability to exercise judgement during an  examination. Rather, it would provide them with greater certainty that they  are evaluating banks\u2019 compliance with BSA/AML requirements  appropriately.", "Federal internal control standards state that agencies should identify,  analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined  objectives. Unless federal banking regulators take steps to improve  examiners\u2019 ability to evaluate banks\u2019 compliance controls with respect to  money transmitter accounts, examiners may not be fully achieving the  BSA/AML examination objectives of identifying and assessing risks and  banks\u2019 ability to manage risks, as set out in the examination manual in  assessing banks\u2019 compliance with BSA/AML requirements.

Some banks also reported terminating accounts to reduce the  risk that a customer\u2019s activity could harm a bank\u2019s reputation, known as  reputational risk (see table 4). These survey results are consistent with  the results of our prior work on banks in the Southwest border region.", "The most commonly cited reason in our survey for terminating accounts  was the filing of SARs. Officials we interviewed from one bank told us that  they investigate customers that have triggered multiple SAR filings and  considered setting up controls to limit account activities. Officials of  another bank told us that a federal bank examiner suggested that the  bank consider closing an account with a money transmitter customer  because of SAR filings associated with it.", "The second most commonly cited reason for terminating accounts was  that a customer failed to provide information requested by a bank for  conducting BSA/AML due diligence. Officials we interviewed from two  banks told us that customers may not be able to provide information and  documentation or may not disclose that they are an MSB when opening  new accounts. Officials of a bank that maintained accounts with money  transmitters told us they terminated accounts in instances where a money  transmitter did not submit required documentation.", "Another commonly cited reason for terminating accounts was reputational  risk\u2014the potential that negative publicity regarding an institution\u2019s  business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the  customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. One bank\u2019s  officials said in an interview that when examiners inquired as to whether  bank officials factor reputational risk into their decision-making about  money transmitters, they viewed such inquiries as implicit suggestions  that the bank had an issue with reputational risk that needed to be  addressed.", "Examiners in our discussion groups also shared similar comments on  suspicious activity monitoring and banks\u2019 requests for information.  Specific to suspicious activities, one examiner noted that banks generally  have an internal policy stating that if a specific number of SARs are filed  on the customer, the bank will automatically terminate the account.  Regarding banks\u2019 information requests, examiners in some discussion  groups said they observed that banks may terminate an MSB\u2019s account if  the MSB does not comply with the bank\u2019s request for due-diligence- related documentation.", "Three of the most common reasons banks reported for limiting accounts  with money transmitters were that (1) the cost of BSA/AML compliance  made the customer type unprofitable, (2) the banks were unable to  manage the BSA/AML risk associated with the customer type, and (3) the  customer type fell outside of a bank\u2019s risk tolerance (see table 5).", "One of the most commonly cited reasons for limiting the number of  accounts with money transmitters was compliance costs associated with  managing BSA/AML risk. Officials of about two-thirds of the banks we  interviewed said their BSA/AML compliance costs had increased over  time, with eight institutions specifically citing past or planned upgrades to  their monitoring software systems as one source of increasing costs.  Moreover, officials of one bank said their compliance costs had increased  in recent years as a result of regulatory scrutiny, which they said had  increased as MSBs came to comprise a larger portion of their customer  base. In response to this heightened scrutiny, officials said the bank had  installed a new transaction-monitoring platform, which incurred a one-time  migration cost and would incur higher monthly fees, and was considering  expanding its compliance department.", "Officials of three banks told us in interviews that 50 percent of their  compliance costs stem from BSA/AML compliance. As we have reported  previously, money transmitters are generally low-profit customers for  banks, in that the revenue from their accounts may not be sufficient for  some banks to offset the associated costs of BSA/AML compliance. For  example, officials of one bank said the bank spent about $250,000  annually to maintain its BSA-related monitoring software and training,  which they believed was a significant portion of the bank\u2019s $25 million  annual income. These officials told us that unlike the bank\u2019s other  customers, which use the bank\u2019s other products and refer business,  money transmitters are not the bank\u2019s core customers and do not use  other products or services, so the bank would rather focus its time and  resources on its core customers. Similarly, officials of another bank said  they decided not to bank MSBs because any revenue generated would  not cover the additional resource and compliance costs.", "Banks\u2019 inability to manage BSA/AML risks associated with money  transmitter customers was another commonly cited reason for limiting the  number of accounts. For example, officials of one bank we interviewed  said they did not accept any MSB customers, including money  transmitters, because they were not willing or able to take on the required  risk and level of BSA/AML monitoring. Another commonly cited reason for  limiting accounts was that a customer type fell outside of a bank\u2019s risk  tolerance. In interviews, banks expressed concerns about their MSB  customers\u2019 ability to maintain an adequate BSA/AML compliance  program. One bank\u2019s officials told us that owners of gas stations may  offer check cashing or money transmission services to generate  additional revenue, but they may not be aware that offering such services  would subject their business to BSA/AML compliance requirements.  Another bank\u2019s officials also said that many business owners do not know  that they have to register with FinCEN to operate as an MSB. Officials  from a third bank said that some MSBs may not understand the BSA/AML  regulations and, at their customers\u2019 request, may inadvertently commit a  violation such as structuring that may generate a SAR (for example, by  breaking up a money transfer in excess of $10,000 into multiple transfers  to avoid generating a Currency Transaction Report).", "Similarly, examiners in many discussion groups said that the staffing and  resource costs required for adequate monitoring and due diligence on  MSB customers, including money transmitters, are reasons why some  banks may choose not to bank MSBs. Moreover, examiners in many  discussion groups also said some banks offer MSBs accounts and then  find out that they do not have the necessary BSA/AML expertise or that  the business is not profitable for them. For example, one examiner said  that when a larger bank in his area terminated all of its money transmitter  accounts, a number of smaller banks looking for profit offered accounts to  these money transmitters. However, the examiner added that the smaller  banks did not understand the level of customer due diligence and  monitoring that was required for these accounts and the associated costs,  and they terminated the accounts. In contrast, examiners in some  discussion groups said that some community banks have accepted  money transmitter customers as a way to generate potentially substantial  fee income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Account Terminations and Limitations Raise Derisking Concerns", "paragraphs": ["According to survey responses from banks, the most commonly cited  reason for limiting the number of money transmitter accounts was that the  customer type drew heightened BSA/AML regulatory oversight\u2014behavior  that would indicate derisking. Banks also commonly cited this reason for  terminating money transmitter accounts.", "For example, officials from one bank told us that the bank no longer  offered services to MSBs because it wanted to be viewed favorably by  regulators. Officials of another bank said that money transmitter account closures were generally the result of onerous regulatory requirements and  increased regulatory scrutiny. Officials from two banks we spoke with said  that they received greater regulatory scrutiny after increasing their  number of MSB customers, which affected their willingness to open  additional accounts with MSBs. According to officials of one of the two  banks, when the bank increased its MSB customers from one to two, the  institution was assessed as high risk by examiners.", "Related to heightened regulatory oversight, some banks\u2019 officials we  interviewed also expressed concerns that some examiners\u2019 expectations  go beyond what is described in the examination manual. For example,  they said examiners expected banks to know their customers\u2019  customers\u2014although BSA/AML regulations do not require banks to  obtain information on their customers\u2019 customers. Bank officials said  ascertaining such information was difficult because money transmitters\u2019  customers are one step removed from the bank. Some banks\u2019 officials  also told us that they felt obligated to follow examiners\u2019 verbal  suggestions, even when the suggestions did not appear in the final  examination report as recommendations. Other banks\u2019 officials we  interviewed stated that although examiners did not explicitly recommend  that banks exit certain lines of business, officials felt pressure from the  examiners to do so. For example, officials from one bank said examiners  suggested that if the bank exited certain lines of business, the bank would  not have deficiencies in its BSA/AML compliance program.", "We reported similar concerns in our March 2018 report. About half of the  banks we interviewed for that report said that the fear of regulatory  scrutiny served as a disincentive for banks to maintain accounts with  money transmitters. Some banks\u2019 officials expressed uncertainty about  the amount of due diligence required for regulatory purposes because  regulations included ambiguous language or because examiner practices  exceeded regulations. These bank officials suggested that regulators  could provide more specific guidance for banks on risk management,  such as by including example scenarios and answers to frequently asked  questions.", "Conversely, some banks we interviewed had a different experience. For  example, officials of one bank told us that examiners\u2019 interpretation of  BSA/AML principles did not differ from the bank\u2019s understanding of those  principles. Officials added that when they initially began preparing risk  assessments, they sought feedback and advice from their examiners and  that examiners now use the bank\u2019s risk assessment as an example for  other banks. Moreover, these officials said that if they need clarification  on BSA/AML compliance requirements, they contact FinCEN, which has  been responsive to their questions. Officials of another bank told us they  have a good relationship with their federal regulator and said that  examiners follow BSA guidance and have been consistent in conducting  their examinations. Officials of two other banks told us that their BSA/AML  examinations have been consistent with guidance and requirements and  that examiners have not told officials what types of customers to avoid.", "We also reported in February 2018 that recent BSA/AML law enforcement  and regulatory enforcement actions have caused some banks to become  more conservative in the types of businesses to which they offer  accounts. In our interviews for the February 2018 report, officials of  three banks and an industry group expressed concerns about potential  enforcement actions, including civil penalties, if banks\u2019 employees make  mistakes in BSA/AML monitoring. In 2012, federal regulators assessed  civil money penalties\u2014including a $500 million penalty assessed by OCC  and a $165 million penalty by the Federal Reserve\u2014against HSBC Bank  for, among other things, failing to maintain an effective BSA/AML  compliance program and failing to conduct appropriate due diligence on  foreign correspondent bank account holders. As another example, in  March 2018, OCC issued consent orders for civil penalties against three  senior executives of the Merchants Bank of California for violations of  consent orders related to monitoring BSA/AML compliance. In our  interviews, officials of an industry association told us that fines associated  with BSA violations are especially difficult for community banks to absorb  and could result in the bank going out of business.", "Similarly, examiners from a discussion group said some banks may  decide not to offer accounts to MSBs to avoid heightened regulatory  scrutiny. For example, examiners said some banks likely want to avoid  BSA/AML risk entirely when they decide not to offer MSBs accounts. One  examiner thought that some banks lack understanding regarding the  business models of MSBs and that it is easier for them not to provide  them accounts. In some cases, banks offer MSBs bank accounts but on a  limited basis. For example, examiners from one discussion group said  that in some cases, banks manage their BSA/AML risks by maintaining  existing MSB accounts but not offering accounts to new MSB customers.", "In a 2015 speech, a senior Treasury official noted banks\u2019 concerns about  the cost of complying with BSA/AML requirements, uncertainty about  supervisors\u2019 expectations regarding appropriate due diligence, and the  nature of the enforcement and supervisory response if they make a  mistake. Moreover, the official stated that the banks held the perception  that supervisory and enforcement expectations lack transparency,  predictability, and consistency. The official also said that this perception  feeds into higher anticipated compliance costs and may eclipse any  potential economic gains of taking on new MSB customers. To address  these concerns, the senior official stated that policymakers needed to  continue to improve their understanding of the scope, nature, and drivers  of the problem through better data collection and continue to explore  ways to improve the effectiveness of their communication."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Effects of Account Terminations and Limitations on Money Transmitters Include Ceasing of Operations and Higher Costs for Services", "paragraphs": ["According to money transmitters we spoke with, effects of account  terminations due to derisking include ceasing of operations, loss of  revenue, higher costs for services provided, and failure of the business.  For example, officials from one large money transmitter that operates in  the United States and internationally said that in recent years, about 100  of the money transmitter\u2019s agents have lost accounts with their local and  regional banks each month. The officials added that when banks  terminate accounts with the money transmitter or its agents, the money  transmitter cannot conduct the necessary transactions with its agents to  facilitate the cash transfer. As a result, officials told us, account  terminations can cause the money transmitter to cease operations in a  particular country or cause the agents to go out of business. These  officials also told us that some banks have terminated accounts with their  institution while maintaining accounts with other money transmitters.  These officials said they obtained legal injunctions for unfair competitor  treatment in some of these cases.", "Officials of a smaller, regional money transmitter said that they have  experienced 10 account terminations since 2006. Moreover, the officials  said that they have to switch banks every 2 to 3 years because of account  terminations and that it is getting more difficult to find a bank willing to  take on money transmitters as customers. For example, the officials said  that they called about 300 banks in a state and only two banks were willing to open accounts with them. The money transmitter\u2019s officials said  it has had to cease operations in three states due to account  terminations. The officials said that the money transmitter now focuses on  opening accounts with community banks and credit unions, but these  institutions may be too small to handle the money transmitter\u2019s volume of  deposits. Another money transmitter told us that it takes about 3 months  to open an account with a bank. Moreover, as a result of account  terminations and limitations by banks, the money transmitter has had to  reduce its number of employees from 220 to 180 and has not been able  to open new locations. Another money transmitter said that account  terminations have affected its ability to obtain accounts with other banks.", "In our March 2018 report, we found that some money transmitters\u2014those  that may be considered higher risk based on the 2005 interagency  guidance\u2014may utilize nonbank channels for transferring money as a  response to account terminations. Specifically, we reported that as a  result of banks\u2019 account terminations and limitations, some money  transmitters serving fragile nations have relied on nonbank channels,  such as cash couriers and armored trucks, to transfer money domestically  and abroad. We further reported that using cash couriers or armored  trucks to move money increases costs and risks of theft and safety.", "Account terminations and limitations by banks also affect money  transmitters that do not serve customers abroad\u2014money transmitters that  could be considered lower risk based on the 2005 interagency BSA  guidance. For example, a company that acquired another business  offering money transmission services to customers within the United  States also experienced account terminations. When the company  acquired the new business and thus the business\u2019s money transmission  license, its bank refused to service the company because of its newly  acquired status as a money transmitter. In another example, officials of a  money transmitter that serves only U.S. customers told us they have  difficulty opening accounts and have experienced account terminations  often. Officials said that their business has stopped at times because they  did not have any bank accounts to facilitate money transmission.", "Additionally, account closures also may affect money transmitters\u2019  customers. For example, some money transmitters we interviewed said  they passed on increased costs resulting from account closures to their  customers. Specifically, officials of one large money transmitter said that  because of derisking, banks that still do business with them are charging  higher fees. The officials added that they try to absorb the higher fees but  have passed on the increased costs to their customers in some markets.  In contrast, some money transmitters told us in interviews that although  their costs have increased, they have not increased customer fees.", "Several money transmitters told us that banks did not always provide  reasons for terminating their accounts. Some said they believe that banks  terminate accounts due to regulatory pressure, compliance costs, or  changes in a bank\u2019s policy or risk appetite. One money transmitter stated  that the problem of account terminations due to derisking stems from  banks being too afraid to bank MSBs, including money transmitters.", "In response to banks\u2019 account terminations and limitations, some money  transmitters\u2014including those with characteristics considered to be higher  and lower risk according to the 2005 interagency guidance\u2014now  maintain accounts with multiple banks to help ensure they can continue  operating should a bank close their account. For example, officials of the  company that acquired another business offering domestic money  transmission services told us they maintain accounts with more than one  bank, but they said it is difficult and costly to do so. Officials of another  money transmitter said that to help prevent disruptions to their ability to  transfer funds when they experience an account closure, they try to have  back-up accounts at other banks.", "Some money transmitters also engage with their banks\u2019 management to  better understand what banks expect from them in meeting compliance  requirements. For example, an official from one money transmitter said  the money transmitter tries to meet with its banks\u2019 financial crimes teams  to better understand how it can help minimize the risk of facilitating  money transfers for terrorist-financing and money-laundering purposes.  Officials of another money transmitter told us that as a result of meeting  with bank management, the money transmitter added additional  employees to its compliance department and bought new monitoring  software to fulfill its bank\u2019s requirement for monthly monitoring of  transactions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FinCEN and the Federal Regulators Have Taken Some Steps to Address Derisking Concerns but Have Not Fully Addressed Our Prior Recommendation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FinCEN and the Federal Regulators Have Issued Guidance to Banks Related to the Derisking of Money Transmitters", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN and the federal banking regulators have responded to concerns  about the derisking of money transmitters and other MSBs on a national  level by issuing guidance to banks to clarify expectations for providing  banking services to these customer types. In March 2005, the federal  banking regulators and FinCEN issued a joint statement noting that MSBs  were losing access to banking services as a result of concerns about  regulatory scrutiny, the risks presented by MSB accounts, and the costs  and burdens associated with maintaining such accounts. According to  the joint statement, these concerns might have stemmed, in part, from  banks\u2019 misperception of the requirements of the BSA and the erroneous  view that MSBs present a uniform and unacceptably high risk of money  laundering or other illicit activity. The joint statement recognized that the  MSB industry provides valuable financial services, especially to  individuals who may not have ready access to the formal banking sector.  It further noted that it is important that MSBs comply with the  requirements of the BSA and applicable state laws and remain within the  formal financial sector and be subject to appropriate AML controls. The  joint statement announced the intent of the regulators and FinCEN to  issue the interagency guidance for banks on providing services to MSBs,  which, as previously discussed, was intended to clarify BSA requirements  and supervisory expectations as applied to accounts opened or  maintained for MSBs.", "More recently, in November 2014, FinCEN issued a statement reiterating  that banks can serve the MSB industry while meeting their BSA  obligations and referring to the interagency guidance to banks on  providing services to MSBs. The statement noted concerns that banks  were indiscriminately terminating the accounts of all MSBs, or refusing to  open accounts for any MSBs, thereby eliminating them as a category of  customers. It noted, similar to the March 2005 joint statement, that  regulatory scrutiny, the perceived risks presented by MSB accounts, and  the costs and burdens associated with maintaining such accounts  appeared to play a part in these decisions.", "In the 2014 statement, FinCEN cautioned that a wholesale approach to  MSB customers runs counter to the expectation that financial institutions  can and should assess the risks of customers on a case-by-case basis.  Similarly, it noted that a blanket direction by U.S. banks to their foreign  correspondents not to process fund transfers of any foreign MSBs, simply  because they are MSBs, runs counter to the risk-based approach.  FinCEN stated that refusing financial services to an entire segment of the  industry can lead to an overall reduction in financial sector transparency,  and that such transparency is critical to making the sector resistant to the  efforts of illicit actors. Federal banking regulators also issued separate  statements addressing BSA/AML risk posed by MSBs and foreign banks.  See table 6 for a summary of key statements and guidance related to  MSBs issued in recent years by FinCEN and the federal banking  regulators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Taken Some Steps to Address Concerns That May Be Influencing Banks to Derisk but Have Not Reviewed the Full Range of Factors", "paragraphs": ["In 2018, we reported that regulators had taken only limited steps to  understand how banks\u2019 regulatory concerns and BSA/AML compliance  efforts may be influencing banks to derisk. We reported that regulators  had taken some actions in response to derisking, including issuing the  guidance previously discussed, and that some agencies took steps aimed  at trying to determine why banks may be terminating accounts. We also  reported that regulators had conducted retrospective reviews on some  BSA/AML requirements. We noted that actions regulators had taken to  address concerns raised in BSA/AML retrospective reviews had focused  primarily on the burden resulting from the filing of Currency Transaction  Reports and SARs. However, we noted that these actions had not been  aimed at addressing\u2014and, if possible, ameliorating\u2014the full range of  factors that influence banks to engage in derisking, particularly how  banks\u2019 regulatory concerns and BSA/AML compliance efforts may be  influencing their willingness to provide services.", "We concluded that without a broader assessment of the full range of  BSA/AML factors that may be influencing banks to derisk, FinCEN, the  federal banking regulators, and Congress do not have the information  needed to determine if BSA/AML regulations and their implementation are  achieving their regulatory objectives in the most effective and least  burdensome way. Therefore, we recommended that FinCEN and the  federal banking regulators conduct a retrospective review of BSA  regulations and their implementation for banks, with a focus on how  banks\u2019 regulatory concerns may be influencing their willingness to provide  services.", "According to the federal banking regulators and FinCEN, they and  Treasury established an interagency working group in early 2018 that  they believe will address our recommendation. The interagency working  group is intended to identify ways to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of BSA/AML regulations, supervision, and examinations  while continuing to meet the requirements of the BSA and its  implementing regulations, supporting law enforcement, and reducing  BSA/AML compliance burden. Staff from FinCEN and the federal banking  regulators identified several interagency statements that the working  group has completed.", "Interagency Statement on Sharing BSA Resources (issued on  October 3, 2018): This statement clarified how banks may reduce the  costs of meeting BSA requirements effectively by sharing employees  or other resources in a collaborative arrangement with one or more  banks. The statement highlighted potential benefits to sharing  resources and provided examples of resources that may be  appropriate to share, such as certain internal controls, independent  testing, and BSA/AML training functions. The statement also  highlighted potential risks of sharing resources and cautioned that any  collaborative arrangements should be designed and implemented  according to each bank\u2019s risk profile.", "Joint Statement on Innovative Efforts to Combat Money  Laundering and Terrorist Financing (issued on December 3,  2018): This statement clarified the working group\u2019s position with  respect to innovative approaches in BSA/AML compliance and  encouraged banks to consider such approaches. For example,  some banks are experimenting with artificial intelligence and digital  identity technologies applicable to their BSA/AML compliance  programs. The statement notes that these innovations and  technologies can strengthen BSA/AML compliance approaches and  that the regulators welcome these types of innovative approaches to  further efforts to protect the financial system against illicit financial  activity. According to the statement, pilot programs undertaken by  banks to test and validate the effectiveness of innovative approaches  should not subject banks to supervisory criticism even if the pilot  programs ultimately prove unsuccessful.", "Joint Statement on Risk-Focused Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money  Laundering Supervision (issued on July 22, 2019): This statement  was intended to improve the transparency of the risk-focused  approach used for planning and performing BSA/AML examinations.  In this statement, FinCEN and the banking regulators emphasized  that they scope their examinations in response to the unique risk  profile for each bank because banks vary in focus and complexity.  The regulators also clarified common practices for assessing a bank\u2019s  risk profile, including leveraging available information such as the  bank\u2019s own risk assessment, contacting the banks between  examinations, and considering the bank\u2019s ability to identify, measure,  monitor, and control risks.", "Federal banking regulators and FinCEN staff said the working group\u2019s  focus on regulatory reform and on reducing the burden associated with  BSA/AML compliance may indirectly address derisking concerns,  including those related to money transmitters. In particular, they said  these efforts may help agencies as they clarify their supervisory  expectations for banks with respect to managing BSA/AML risk. For  example, the staff said that the joint statement on the risk-focused  approach to supervision clarifies that the role of the examiner is not to  determine what level of risk a bank should assume. Instead, the  examiners should review risk management practices to evaluate whether  a bank has effective processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control  risks and to assess the effectiveness of a bank\u2019s processes. They said  that reminding examiners and institutions of the risk-focused approach  will help dispel the perception that banks will be criticized for taking certain higher-risk customers when the bank is properly managing that  risk. Similarly, they said that the joint statement on innovation could help  address derisking concerns because it allows banks to leverage new  technologies and innovative approaches to help reduce costs of  implementing the strong risk management practices that may be  necessary to provide banking services to some higher-risk customers.", "The actions taken to date by the interagency working group are important  steps toward improving the efficiency and effectiveness of BSA/AML  regulations and supervision. As previously discussed, one reason some  banks reported terminating or limiting money transmitter accounts was  because of the cost associated with BSA/AML compliance. The  interagency statements on sharing BSA resources and innovative efforts  to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could help reduce  banks\u2019 implementation costs associated with providing banking services  to potentially higher-risk customers.", "However, consistent with our prior work, our evidence demonstrates that  banks terminate or limit customer accounts not only as a way to address  legitimate money-laundering and terrorist-financing threats, but also as a  way to manage regulatory concerns, which may indicate derisking.  Reminding examiners and banks of the risk-focused examination  approach may help to dispel the perception that banks will be criticized for  taking certain higher-risk customers when the bank is properly managing  that risk and may indirectly address some factors that influence banks to  derisk. Nevertheless, the working group has not yet considered whether  there are other supervisory concerns that factor into banks\u2019 decisions to  derisk. As we stated in our prior work, it is important to evaluate and  address the full range of factors that may be influencing banks to derisk.

Further, we  interviewed representatives of 16 banks, six credit unions, and relevant  industry groups and trade associations. Because of our judgmental  sampling, the views expressed by these groups may not be  representative. To identify the universe of banks for interviews, we used  data from FDIC\u2019s Statistics on Depository Institutions database as of  December 31, 2016. Next, we excluded banks that did not offer the  product types relevant to our study, including credit card banks and banks  that offer nontraditional accounts; multiple subsidiaries of large holding  companies; and federal branches of foreign banks. We also excluded  banks with insufficient information to determine the types of accounts  offered. In addition, we excluded banks selected to participate in a web- based survey (we describe our survey methodology below). After these  exclusions, our initial list consisted of 5,922 banks.", "Because the primary regulators (Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC) do  not track which banks have money transmitter customers, we used a  judgmental sample to randomly select banks to interview from each of the  primary regulators based on asset size (small, medium, and large). For  small and medium banks, we interviewed one bank of each size from  each of the three regulators. For large banks, all were regulated by OCC,  and we interviewed two of these banks. We defined banks\u2019 asset-size  categories as follows: (1) \u201csmall\u201d consisted of banks with assets of less  than $1 billion, (2) \u201cmedium\u201d consisted of banks with assets of $1 billion to  less than $10 billion, and (3) \u201clarge\u201d consisted of banks with assets of $10  billion to less than $50 billion.", "Once we selected our sample, we contacted each bank to confirm that it  had money transmitter or other types of MSB customers.

We  chose three credit unions with the largest numbers of money transmitter  customers and randomly selected one credit union from each asset-size  category, for a total of six credit unions. From our initial selection, we  emailed or called each of the six credit unions to ascertain if it had a  money transmitter customer. If a credit union did not have a money  transmitter customer or declined to speak with us, we selected another  credit union in the same asset-size category.", "We then conducted two discussion groups per regulator with bank  examiners from the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, and NCUA to  understand how they applied the FFIEC manual in assessing BSA/AML  compliance controls of banks with money transmitter customers. To  determine the composition of the discussion groups, we identified  BSA/AML specialists or subject-matter experts from the district and  regional offices of each federal banking regulator located in geographic  areas with relatively large numbers of money transmitters. To do this, we  first identified the states with the largest numbers of registered money  transmitters by analyzing FinCEN money transmitter registration data  from January 2015 through May 2017. We then requested rosters of staff  designated as BSA/AML subject-matter experts and specialists from each  regulator for each district or regional office in those states.", "We administered a questionnaire to the individuals on each roster asking  about their experience with examining banks with money transmitter  customers and other questions, such as years of experience in  conducting bank examinations.

We then randomized and selected  BSA/AML subject-matter experts and specialists for participation in our  discussion groups. Depending on scheduling and availability, the number  of participants for each discussion group ranged from six to 14. Each  session was digitally recorded and transcribed by an outside vendor, and  we used the transcripts to summarize participants\u2019 responses. An initial  coder assigned a code that best summarized the statements from  discussion group participants and provided an explanation of the types of  statements that should be assigned to a particular code.

For the documentation review, we  selected a nongeneralizable sample of banks and credit unions based on  asset-size categories and geographic location (based on each regulator\u2019s  field, district, or regional offices) from each federal banking regulator. For  banks, we used the same asset-size categories described earlier for our  interview selection process.

For credit  unions, we selected randomly from the same asset-size categories we  used for selecting credit unions for interviews\u2014along with geographic  locations\u2014and randomly selected four credit unions from each asset-size  category, for a total of 12 credit unions. To obtain geographic  representation, we ensured that each bank and credit union selected  within each asset-size category also represented multiple geographic  locations.", "For each of the 56 banks and credit unions, we requested and reviewed  bank examination reports and related workpaper documentation for 2014,  2015, and 2016, including scoping and planning memorandums, bank- or  examiner-prepared BSA/AML risk assessments, and conclusion  memorandums or documents that summarized BSA examiner findings.  For some banks, we also received banks\u2019 BSA policies as part of the  examination report and supplemental documentation package.", "To examine the extent to which banks are terminating or limiting money  transmitters\u2019 access to banking services and their reasons why, we administered a web-based survey to a nationally representative sample of  banks in the United States for a total survey sample of 406 banks. We did  not include credit unions in our sample. In the survey, we asked banks  about terminations of money transmitter accounts and limitations on  account offerings related to BSA/AML risk and the reasons for these  decisions for the 3-year period from January 1, 2014, to December 31,  2016. We obtained a weighted survey response rate of 46.5 percent.

For survey questions that are  statistically nongeneralizable, we present only the number of responses  to each survey question, and these results are not generalizable to the  population of banks.

To select the money transmitters, we obtained money  transmitter licensure data from the Conference of State Banking  Supervisors\u2019 Nationwide Multistate Licensing System. Using the number  of state licenses as a proxy for the size of the money transmitter, we  developed five size categories and selected the top four money  transmitters in the first stratum (40 or more licenses) along with one  money transmitter in the second, third, and fourth strata (20\u201339, 10\u201319,  and 2\u20139 licenses, respectively) and four money transmitters in the fifth  stratum (one license).", "To evaluate how FinCEN and the federal banking regulators have  assessed and responded to concerns about derisking of money  transmitters, we reviewed agency documentation and guidance the  agencies issued to banks related to derisking and MSBs, and we  interviewed agency management.

Furthermore, we used  NCUA data that track which credit unions bank money transmitters, the  Nationwide Multistate Licensing System, and FinCEN\u2019s MSB registration  database to help select our nongeneralizable samples of credit unions  and money transmitters to interview. We did not assess the data reliability  of these sources because we used these data purely to inform our  sampling population, and once we selected our samples, we took  additional steps to confirm that the institutions we selected had MSB or  money transmitter customers and were willing to speak to us.", "For FinCEN\u2019s MSB registration database, as previously discussed, we  used the data to help identify which states had the most money  transmitters registered. In analyzing the data, we found a clear difference  in the number of MSB registrations between the top five states (California,  Texas, Michigan, Florida, and Illinois) with the most MSBs (ranging from  close to 800 to almost 4,000 MSBs) and the remaining states (all with  fewer than 500 MSBs). Because we used these data to help facilitate the  identification of BSA/AML subject-matter experts and specialists who had  experience examining banks with money transmitter customers, we did  not need to confirm the exact number of MSBs registered.
