As a result, most of DOE's expenditures in the past 2 years went to functions other than securing buildings, such as maintaining previously installed equipment and developing nuclear security regulations. While important, these efforts do not advance DOE's objective of protecting all buildings with weapons-usable nuclear material. DOD and DOE have pursued different approaches to securing nuclear warhead sites. DOE recently scaled back its plans, and the two agencies will face coordination issues, such as deciding which agency will secure sites in both of their plans. DOD has made little progress in securing dangerous pathogens at the 49 sites where Russia and the United States have collaborative programs. Russia has consistently refused DOD access to sites and has closed some sites to U.S. security programs. Negotiations on a bilateral agreement to implement this assistance have also stalled.

The Soviets relied on closed cities and  physical security measures to stem any threats posed by outsiders.  However, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and subsequent social,  political, and economic changes in Russia not only revealed gaps in the  physical security surrounding sites containing WMD but made evident  weaknesses in Russia\u2019s ability to deter threats from inside those  complexes. A senior member of the Russian Ministry of Defense stated in  1999 that the greatest threat to nuclear warhead security stems from  insider knowledge of security systems and procedures.

Rather, they said that whichever agency has the best access and  cooperation from their Russian counterpart should install security  improvements. These decisions will be made on a site-by-site basis in the  interagency working group. Since DOD has already purchased perimeter  fencing for the Strategic Rocket Forces sites, DOD officials said that if DOE  provides assistance to those sites, it should avoid duplication of assistance  and use DOD equipment. In addition, under the current policy guidelines, it  is possible that DOD and DOE could both help secure sites for the Strategic  Rocket Forces.", "DOD and DOE are also using different vendors to purchase security  equipment for Russian warhead storage sites. For example, DOD and DOE  used different vendors to purchase different alarm communication and  display systems that will perform essentially the same function. According  to agency officials, using different vendors and different systems can have  advantages such as accounting for different weather conditions. However,  they also stated that more training and maintenance are required if  agencies provide multiple, nonstandardized systems.

According to DOD officials, an implementing agreement  between all the relevant Russian ministries and DOD would expedite the  installation of security projects because DOD could work directly with the  institutes.", "Multiple Russian organizations and ministries have jurisdiction over the  military and civilian centers that were part of the former biological  weapons complex in Russia. Jurisdiction resides in nine Russian  government organizations: The Ministries of Defense, Health, Science,  Agriculture, and Education; the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; the  Russian Academy of Agricultural Science; the Russian Academy of Natural  Sciences; and Biopreparat, an organization that now develops  pharmaceuticals but previously controlled the Soviet Union\u2019s biological  weapons technology centers. In addition, the Ministry of Health has five  antiplague institutes and numerous regional field stations that maintain  pathogen collections and had a lead role in the Soviet Union\u2019s bioweapons  program.", "The lack of a single Russian focal point for DOD\u2019s bioweapons security  projects is a major barrier to successfully negotiating an agreement  between the United States and Russia. Since 1992, an umbrella agreement  between the United States and Russia has allowed U.S. Cooperative Threat  Reduction projects for biosecurity, biosafety, and dangerous pathogens, as  it has for nuclear and chemical projects in Russia. However, additional  interministerial implementation agreements are needed to facilitate DOD\u2019s  biosecurity assistance. In 1999, the Russian Government rejected a draft  implementing agreement between DOD and the Ministry of Health on the  grounds that it was not appropriate for that ministry to enter into an  exclusive agreement with DOD. The Russian government similarly rejected  a subsequent U.S.-proposed implementing agreement between the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services and the Russian Ministry of  Health. The Department of State approached individual Russian ministries  directly and also suggested that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sign  a separate agreement with the United States that would allow  implementing agreements with multiple Russian ministries. None of these  efforts has been successful. Without an interministerial implementing  agreement, DOD cannot begin to directly secure Russia\u2019s former biological  weapons facilities. As a result, DOD has to provide assistance through an  intermediary organization that has an agreement with the Russian  government. DOD has negotiated implementing agreements and avoided  this problem in three Eurasian republics, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and  Uzbekistan, and is finalizing an agreement with Ukraine.", "As an alternative to an implementing agreement, DOD has used an existing  program, the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC), to begin  security projects at Russian biological sites. However, ISTC was  implementing hundreds of research projects and was unable to accord  DOD projects as high a priority as DOD wished. ISTC is an international  organization in Moscow founded by the United States, Russia, the  European Union and Japan to engage former weapon scientists in peaceful  scientific research. ISTC was created to prevent the proliferation of former  Soviet WMD expertise by offering nuclear, biological and chemical  weapons and missile scientists peaceful research opportunities and thus  discouraging them from selling their expertise to countries of concern or  terrorist groups. The bulk of ISTC\u2019s funding pays scientists for their work,  with some limited spending for laboratory equipment or computers.", "ISTC agreed to facilitate DOD\u2019s biosecurity projects in Russia because the  U.S. government had an existing agreement with ISTC that allowed it to  finance a range of research projects and other activities. However, ISTC\u2019s  procurement system was not set up to handle the large contracts necessary  for engineering and construction projects. In addition, approval of all ISTC  proposals, including the biosecurity proposals, took time, partly because  ISTC had to obtain host-government concurrence for each proposal from  the Ministry of Atomic Energy; the Ministry of Industry, Science and  Technology; the Ministry of Defense or the Academy of Science. Also,  according to DOD officials, a shortage of administrative and managerial  staff at ISTC impeded ISTC\u2019s efforts to process DOD\u2019s biosecurity projects.  In 2001, DOD funded additional staff positions at ISTC to help expedite the  processing of its security projects.", "According to DOD officials, until an interministerial implementing  agreement is negotiated, DOD biosecurity projects will continue to be  managed through ISTC.

For example, the Russian Ministry of Health maintains five antiplague  institutes and a network of numerous antiplague field stations. These  institutes and stations were part of the former Soviet system of medical  facilities housing dangerous pathogen collections for research and are  completely closed to U.S. assistance programs. Bioweapons experts have  reported that, as part of the Soviet bioweapons program, the anti-plague  network helped identify new virulent strains of pathogens and participated  in research on defensive measures. These facilities specialized in animal  diseases that are communicable to man, such as plague, tularemia, anthrax,  and cholera. According to DOD officials, the ministry was concerned that  participation in Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programs would be  an admission that the antiplague centers had taken part in the Soviet  biological weapons program. DOD also lacks access to four former  Ministry of Defense biological weapons sites. These laboratories were  involved in pathogen- and toxin-related research and maintained large  pathogen collections. A major animal pathogen institute of the Ministry of  Agriculture also remains closed to biosecurity assistance.", "DOD has made some progress in gaining access to one of the four Ministry  of Defense facilities.

By targeting sites where it has access, DOD  maintains relationships with the Russian bioweapons establishment, which  is an important objective.

DOD  could benefit from DOE\u2019s past experience in assessing site security  requirements around buildings with weapons-usable nuclear material.  Specifically, DOE developed a categorization scheme for ranking the  relative threat posed by different types of material, which it used to decide  on the extent of upgrades to be installed at specific buildings.

DOD officials stated that two of these sites, Kizner and  Shchuch\u2019ye, pose the greatest threat to U.S. national security interests  because they house nerve agent stored in small artillery shells, some light  enough to be transported by an individual. The three other nerve agent  sites store large air-delivered bombs and spray tanks. Two remaining sites  store blister agents in bulk containers, which are considered less of a threat  to U.S. national security interests.

Planning began in 1994, and completion of the  facility is scheduled for 2006. Russia plans to destroy all its nerve agent  munitions at the facility. As of November 2002, DOD had obligated more  than $218 million on the design and preliminary construction of the  destruction facility. Although the Russian Munitions Agency, which is  charged with the safe storage and destruction of Russia\u2019s chemical  weapons stockpile, plans to destroy all of its declared chemical weapons  by the CWC mandated deadline of 2012, the lack of progress and financial  difficulties thus far make it doubtful that this deadline will be met.

These upgrades cost  $220,000 per site and were installed at both Kizner and Shchuch\u2019ye. The  sensors are the primary deterrent to proliferators because they alert guards  to any access to the protected buildings. During our visit to these sites, we  observed that the U.S.-funded fences around individual buildings were  approximately 3 feet high and were primarily designed to reduce the  number of false alarms caused by animals.
