However, the potential impact of these changes on taxpayers in either the short- or long-term is unclear, because IRS has not provided details of proposed taxpayer service reductions, and although it is developing longterm goals, they are not yet finalized. Because of the proposed reductions and new and improved taxpayer services in recent years, this is an opportune time to examine the menu of services IRS provides. It may be possible to maintain the overall level of service to taxpayers by offsetting reductions in some areas with new and improved service in other areas. Taxpayers and IRS are seeing some payoff from the BSM program, with the deployment of initial phases of several modernized systems in 2004. Nevertheless, the BSM program continues to be high-risk, in part, because projects have incurred significant cost increases and schedule delays and the program faces major challenges in areas such as human capital and requirements management. As a result of budget reductions and other factors, IRS has made major adjustments. It is too early to tell what effect these adjustments will have on the program, but they are not without risk and could potentially impact future budgets. Further, the BSM program is based on strategies developed years ago, which, coupled with the delays and changes brought on by budget reductions, indicates that it is time for IRS to revisit its long-term goals, strategy, and plans for BSM. Because of these challenges, IRS is redefining and refocusing the BSM program. IRS has generally maintained or improved its filing season performance in 2005. Processing is more efficient, the accuracy of answers provided by telephone assistors is improved, and telephone access is relatively comparable to last year. This is particularly noteworthy, because IRS received less funding for taxpayer service in 2005 than it spent in 2004. Because the filing season is not over, the full impact on taxpayers and IRS operations is not yet known. However, there are indications of slippage in telephone access such as more abandoned calls and longer wait times."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s hearing on the Internal  Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) fiscal year 2006 budget request and performance  during the 2005 tax filing season.", "IRS is in the midst of making significant adjustments to its modernization  strategy to better serve taxpayers and ensure their compliance with the  nation\u2019s tax laws.  It is now seven years since the passage of the Internal  Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98) and IRS  is shifting its priorities from improving taxpayer service to strengthening  tax law enforcement efforts.   IRS is also adjusting its strategy for managing  its Business Systems Modernization (BSM) effort by shifting significant  program management responsibilities from contractor to IRS staff.   Although there are sound reasons for these adjustments, they also involve  risk.", "We have reported that IRS has made progress improving taxpayer service  since the passage of RRA 98.  For example, IRS\u2019s telephone assistance is  now more accessible and accurate.  Further, IRS is more efficient at  processing tax returns, in part, because of the growth of electronic filing,  and has cut processing staff.  IRS has also implemented some modernized  information systems and increased its capacity to manage large systems  acquisition and development programs.", "However, progress has not been uniform. We have reported on large and  pervasive declines in IRS\u2019s tax law enforcement programs after 1998.  We  have also reported that a number of systems modernization projects were  over budget and behind schedule.", "As noted, IRS is shifting its priorities to better address these problems.  The  risk, as IRS shifts its priorities towards enforcement, is that some of the  gains in the quality of taxpayer service could be surrendered.  There are  analogous risks associated with moving more of the management of BSM  in-house.", "With these risks in mind, our statement discusses both IRS\u2019s fiscal year  2006 budget request and 2005 filing season performance to date.  To  address your request, we assessed (1) how IRS proposes to balance its  resources between taxpayer service and enforcement programs and the  potential impact on taxpayers, (2) the status of IRS\u2019s efforts to develop and  implement the BSM program, and (3) the progress IRS has made in  implementing best practices for developing its information technology (IT)  operations and maintenance budget.  With respect to the interim results of  key 2005 filing season activities, we compared IRS\u2019s performance to past  years\u2019 and goals it set for this year.", "Our assessment of the budget request and BSM is based on a comparative  analysis of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2002 through 2006 budget requests, funding,  expenditures, other documentation, and interviews with IRS officials.  Our  assessment of the interim results of the filing season is based on comparing  IRS\u2019s performance this year to previous filing seasons, viewing operations  at a processing center, call sites, and walk-in sites, monitoring various  production meetings, interviewing IRS and Treasury Inspector General for  Tax Administration (TIGTA) officials and paid tax practitioners and other  external stakeholders, reviewing TIGTA and other external reports, and  reviewing IRS\u2019s Web site.  For both assessments, we used historical budget  and performance data from reports and budget requests used by IRS,  Department of Treasury, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  In  past work, we assessed IRS\u2019s budget and performance data. Since the data  sources and procedures for producing this year\u2019s budget and performance  data have not significantly changed from prior years, we determined that  the budget data and filing season performance data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.  The budget and performance data  for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 are subject to change. Regarding our analysis  of IRS\u2019s BSM program, we primarily used the agency\u2019s BSM expenditure  plans to determine the status of the program.  To assess the reliability of  the cost and schedule information contained in these plans, we interviewed  applicable IRS officials to gain an understanding of the data and discuss  our use of that data. In addition, we checked that information in the plans  was consistent with information contained in IRS internal briefings.   Accordingly, we determined that the data in the plans were sufficiently  reliable for purposes of this statement. We performed our work in  Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia from December 2004 through March  2005, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, our assessment shows that:  IRS\u2019s 2006 fiscal year budget request reflects a continuing shift in  priorities from improving taxpayer service to strengthening  enforcement efforts, but the potential impact of these changes on  taxpayers in both the short- and long-term is unclear.  IRS is requesting  $10.9 billion, an increase of 3.7 percent over fiscal year 2005 enacted  levels.  This includes an 8 percent increase for enforcement, and a 1  percent and 2 percent decrease for taxpayer service and BSM,  respectively.  IRS has not finalized the details on where reductions in  taxpayer service would occur.  In addition, IRS is developing, but  currently lacks, long-term goals that can help IRS inform stakeholders,  including the Congress, and aid them in assessing performance and  making budget decisions. In light of the current budget environment and  IRS\u2019s improvements in taxpayer service over the last several years, this  is an opportune time to reconsider the menu of services it provides. It  may be possible to maintain the overall level of assistance to taxpayers  by changing the menu of services offered, offsetting reductions in some  areas with new and improved service in other areas.", "IRS has taken important steps forward towards implementing the BSM  program by delivering the initial phases of several modernized systems  in 2004 and early 2005. Nevertheless, BSM continues to be high risk  because, in part, its projects have incurred significant cost increases and  schedule delays, and the program continues to face major challenges. As  a result of funding reductions and other factors, IRS has made major  adjustments to the BSM program, including reducing the management  reserve and changing the mix and roles of contractor versus federal staff  used to manage the program. It is too early to tell what effect these  adjustments will ultimately have on the BSM program, but they are not  without risk, could potentially impact future budget requests, and will  delay the implementation of certain functionality that was intended to  provide benefit to IRS operations and taxpayers. Finally, the BSM  program is based on visions and strategies developed years ago, which,  coupled with the already significant delays the program has experienced  and the changes brought on by the budget reductions, indicates that it is  time for IRS to revisit its long-term goals, strategy, and plans for BSM,  including an assessment of when significant future BSM functionality  would be delivered. According to the Associate Chief Information  Officer (CIO) for BSM, IRS is redefining and refocusing this program.", "IRS has made progress toward implementing investment management  best practices that would improve its budget development and support  for its IT operations and maintenance funding requests. For example,  the recent release of a new accounting system included an activity- based cost module, which IRS considered to be a necessary action to  implement these best practices. However, Office of the Chief Financial  Officer officials stated that IRS needs 3 years of actual costs to have the  historical data necessary to provide a basis for future budget estimates.  Accordingly, they expect that IRS will begin using the activity-based cost  module in formulating the fiscal year 2008 budget and will have the  requisite 3 years of historical data in time to develop the fiscal year 2010  budget.", "Our assessment of the 2005 filing season to date shows that:  IRS has generally maintained or improved its 2005 filing season  performance compared to last year.  Electronic filing continues to  increase, allowing IRS to continue reducing resources devoted to  processing.  However, IRS may not meet this year\u2019s electronic filing goal  and is likely to not to meet its goal of 80 percent of all individual tax  returns filed electronically by 2007.  Access to telephone assistors  remains relatively comparable to last year, although there are other  indications of slippage in telephone access such as more abandoned  calls and longer wait times.  The tax law accuracy rate for answers  provided via telephone or IRS\u2019s Web site has improved.  IRS\u2019s  performance so far in 2005 is good news, considering IRS received  $104 million less in fiscal year 2005 than 2004 for taxpayer services.  IRS  plans to absorb this reduction, in part, by consolidating paper-  processing operations, shifting resources from service to enforcement,  and reducing some services\u2014for example, reducing access to telephone  assistors\u2014in 2005.

In comparison to the fiscal year 2004 enacted budget, the 2006  budget request proposes almost 4 percent less for service, almost 49  percent less for BSM, and nearly 14 percent more for enforcement.", "As table 1 also shows, taxpayer service sustained a reduction of $104  million or 2.8 percent between fiscal years 2004 and 2005.  According to IRS  officials, the majority of this reduction was the result of consolidating  paper-processing operations, shifting resources from service to  enforcement, and reducing some services.  IRS officials said that this  reduction is not expected to adversely impact the services they provide to  taxpayers but added that the agency cannot continue to absorb reductions  in taxpayer service without beginning to compromise some services.", "For fiscal years 2005 and 2006, table 2 shows some details of changes in  both dollars and full-time equivalents (FTE). Both are shown because  funding changes do not translate into proportional changes in FTEs due to  cost increases for salaries, rent, and other items.  For example, the $39  million or 1.1 percent reduction in taxpayer service translates into a  reduction of 1,385 FTEs or 3.6 percent.  Similarly, the over $500 million or  7.8 percent increase in enforcement spending translates into an increase of  1,961 FTEs or 3.4 percent.", "The difference between changes in dollars and FTEs could be even larger  because of unbudgeted expenses.  Unbudgeted expenses have consumed  some of IRS\u2019s budget increases and internal savings increases over the last  few years.  Unbudgeted expenses include unfunded portions of annual  salary increases, which can be substantial given IRS\u2019s large workforce, and  other costs such as higher-than-budgeted rent increases.  According to IRS  officials, these unbudgeted expenses accounted for over $150 million in  each of the last 4 years.", "An IRS official also told us they anticipate having to cover unbudgeted  expenses in 2006.  As of March 2005, IRS officials were projecting  unbudgeted salary increases of at least $40 million.

IRS is proposing a gross  reduction of over $134 million in taxpayer service from reexamining the  budget\u2019s base and plans to use more than $95 million of it to cover annual  increases such as salaries.  This leaves a net reduction of nearly $39 million  or 1.1 percent in the taxpayer service budget.  The extent to which IRS is  able to achieve the gross reductions will impact its ability to use the funds  as anticipated.", "Decisions on how the $134 million gross reduction would be absorbed were  not finalized prior to releasing the budget.  According to IRS officials, some  of the reductions would result from efficiency gains such as reducing  printing and postage costs; however, others would result from reductions  in the services provided to taxpayers such as shortening the hours of toll- free telephone service operations.  The officials also said most decisions  have now been made about general areas for reduction and most changes  will not be readily apparent to taxpayers.", "Although IRS has made general decisions about the reductions, many of the  details have yet to be determined.  Therefore, the extent of the impact on  taxpayers in the short term is unclear.  For example, IRS plans to reduce  dependence on field assistance, including walk-in sites, but has not reached  a final decision on how to reduce services. Table 3 provides further detail  on how IRS is proposing to reduce funding and resources for taxpayer  service.", "IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request is the sixth consecutive year the  agency has requested additional staffing for enforcement. However, up  until last year, IRS was unable to increase enforcement staffing;  unbudgeted costs and other priorities consumed the budget increase.", "IRS\u2019s proposal for fiscal year 2006, if implemented as planned, would return  enforcement staffing in these occupations to their highest levels since 1999.   Of the more than $500 million increase requested for 2006, about $265  million would fund enforcement initiatives, over $182 million would be  used in part for salary increases, and over $55 million is a proposal to  transfer funding authority from the Department of Justice\u2019s Interagency  Crime and Drug Enforcement. The $500 million increase would be  supplemented by internal enforcement savings of $88 million.  As is the  case with taxpayer service savings, the extent to which IRS achieves  enforcement savings will affect its ability to fund the new enforcement  initiatives.", "The $265 million for new enforcement initiatives consist of:  $149.7 million and 920 FTEs to attack corrosive non-compliance activity  driving the tax gap such as abusive trusts and shelters, including  offshore credit cards and organized tax resistance;  $51.8 million and 236 FTEs to detect and deter corrosive corporate non- compliance to attack complex abusive tax avoidance transactions on a  global basis and challenge those who promote their use;  $37.9 million and 417 FTEs to increase individual taxpayer compliance  by identifying and implementing actions to address non-compliance  with filing requirements; increasing Automated Underreporter  resources to address the reporting compliance tax gap; increasing audit  coverage; and expanding collection work in walk-in sites;  $14.5 million and 77 FTEs to combat abusive transactions by entities  with special tax status by initiating examinations more promptly,  safeguarding compliant customers from unscrupulous promoters, and  increasing vigilance to ensure that the assets of tax-exempt  organizations are put to their intended tax-preferred purpose and not  misdirected to fund terrorism or for private gain; and  $10.8 million and 22 FTEs to curtail fraudulent refund crimes.", "The $88 million in internal savings would be reinvested to perform the  following activities:  $66.7 million and 585 FTEs to devote resources to front-line   $14.9 million and 156 FTEs to, in part, address bankruptcy-related   $6.7 million and 52 FTEs to address complex, high-risk issues such as  compliance among tax professionals.", "In the past, IRS has had trouble achieving enforcement staffing increases  because other priorities, including unbudgeted expenses, have absorbed  additional funds.  IRS achieved some gains in 2004 and expects modest  gains in 2005.  Figure 1 shows that the number of revenue agents (those  who audit complex returns), revenue officers (those who do field  collection work), and special agents (those who perform criminal  investigations) decreased over 21 percent between 1998 and 2003, but  increased almost 6 percent from 2003 to 2004.", "IRS\u2019s recent gains in enforcement staffing are encouraging, as tax law  enforcement continues to remain an area of high risk for the federal  government because the resources IRS has dedicated to enforcing the tax  laws have declined, while IRS\u2019s enforcement workload\u2014measured by the  number of taxpayer returns filed\u2014has continually increased.  Figure 2  shows the trend in field, correspondence, and total audit rates since 1995.   Field audits involve face-to-face audits and correspondence audits are  typically less complex involving communication through notices.  IRS  experienced steep declines in audit rates from 1995 to 1999, but the audit  rate\u2014the proportion of tax returns that IRS audits each year\u2014has slowly  increased since 2000.  The figure shows that the increase in total audit rates  of individual filers has been driven mostly by correspondence audits, while  more complex field audits, continue to decline.", "The link between the decline in enforcement staff and the decline in  enforcement actions, such as audits, is complicated, and the real impact on  taxpayers\u2019 rate of voluntary compliance is not known.  This leaves open the  question of whether the declines in IRS\u2019s enforcement programs are  eroding taxpayers\u2019 incentives to voluntarily comply.  IRS\u2019s National  Research Program (NRP) recently completed a study on compliance by  individual tax filers based on tax data provided on 2001 tax returns.  The  study estimated that the tax gap\u2014the difference between what taxpayers  owe and what they pay\u2014is at least $312 billion per year as of 2001 and  could be as large as $353 billion.  This study is important for several  reasons beyond measuring compliance.

As already discussed, these reductions have forced IRS to propose  scaling back some services.  Second, as we have reported, IRS has made  significant progress in improving the quality of its taxpayer services.  For  example, IRS now provides many Internet services that did not exist a few  years ago and has noticeably improved the quality of telephone services.    This opens up the possibility of maintaining the overall level of taxpayer  service but with a different menu of service choices.  Cuts in selected  services could be offset by the new and improved services.", "Generally, as indicated in the budget, the menu of taxpayer services that  IRS provides covers assistance, outreach, and processing.  Assistance  includes answering taxpayer questions via telephone, correspondence, and  face-to-face at its walk-in sites. Outreach includes educational programs  and the development of partnerships.  Processing includes issuing millions  of tax refunds.", "When considering program reductions, we support a targeted approach  rather than across-the-board cuts.  A targeted approach helps reduce the  risk that effective programs are reduced or eliminated while ineffective or  lower priority programs are maintained.", "With the above reasons in mind for reconsidering IRS\u2019s menu of services,  we have compiled a list of options for targeted reductions in taxpayer  service.  The options on this list are not recommendations but are intended  to contribute to a dialogue about the tradeoffs faced when setting IRS\u2019s  budget.   The options presented meet at least one of the following criteria  that we generally use to evaluate programs or budget requests.  These  criteria include that the activity   duplicates other efforts that may be more effective and/or efficient;   historically does not meet performance goals or provide intended  results as reported by GAO, TIGTA, IRS, or others;   experiences a continued decrease in demand;   lacks adequate oversight, implementation and management plans, or  structures and systems to be implemented effectively;   has been the subject of actual or requested funding increases that  cannot be adequately justified; or  has the potential to make an agency more self-sustaining by charging  user fees for services provided.", "We recognize that the options listed below involve tradeoffs.  In each case,  some taxpayers would lose a service they use.  However, the savings could  be used to help maintain the quality of other services.   We also want to give  IRS credit for identifying savings, including some on this list.   The options  include  closing walk-in sites.  As the filing season section of this testimony  discusses, taxpayer demand for walk-in services has continued to  decrease and staff answer a more limited number of tax law questions in  person than staff answer via telephone.    limiting the type of telephone questions answered by IRS assistors.  IRS  assistors still answer some refund status questions even though IRS  provides automated answers via telephone and its Web site.    mandating electronic filing for some filers such as paid preparers or  businesses.

These actions may ultimately result in  more realistic cost and schedule estimates, but our analysis of IRS\u2019s  expenditure plans over the last few years shows continued increases in  estimated project life-cycle costs (see fig. 3).", "The Associate CIO for BSM stated that he believes that IRS\u2019s cost and  schedule estimating has improved in the past year. In particular, he pointed  out that IRS met its cost and schedule goals for the implementation of the  latest release of CADE, which allowed the agency to use this system to  process certain 1040EZ forms in the 2005 filing season. It is too early to tell  whether this signals a fundamental improvement in IRS\u2019s ability to  accurately forecast project costs and schedules.", "The reasons for IRS\u2019s cost increases and schedule delays vary. However, we  have previously reported that they are due, in part, to weaknesses in  management controls and capabilities. We have previously made  recommendations to improve BSM management controls, and IRS has  implemented or begun to implement these recommendations. For example,  in February 2002, we reported that IRS had not yet defined or implemented  an IT human capital strategy, and recommended that IRS develop plans for  obtaining, developing, and retaining requisite human capital resources. In  September 2003, TIGTA reported that IRS had made significant progress in  developing a human capital strategy but that it needed further  development. In August 2004, the current Associate CIO for BSM identified  the completion of a human capital strategy as a high priority. Among the  activities that IRS is implementing are prioritizing its BSM staffing needs  and developing a recruiting plan. IRS has also identified, and is addressing,  other major management challenges in areas such as requirements,  contract, and program management. For example, poorly defined  requirements have been among the significant weaknesses that have been  identified as contributing to project cost overruns and schedule delays. As  part of addressing this problem, in March 2005, the IRS BSM office  established a requirements management office, although a leader has not  yet been hired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Is Adjusting the BSM Program in Response to Budget Reductions", "paragraphs": ["The BSM program is undergoing significant changes as it adjusts to  reductions in its budget.

For fiscal year  2005, IRS received about 29 percent less funding than it requested (from  $285 million to $203.4 million). According to the Senate report for the fiscal  year 2005 Transportation, Treasury, and General Government  appropriations bill, in making its recommendation to reduce BSM funding,  the Senate Appropriations Committee was concerned about the program\u2019s  cost overruns and schedule delays. In addition, the committee emphasized  that in providing fewer funds, it wanted IRS to focus on its highest priority  projects, particularly CADE. In addition, IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget  request reflects an additional reduction of about 2 percent, or about $4.4  million, from the fiscal year 2005 appropriation.", "It is too early to tell what effect the budget reductions will ultimately have  on the BSM program. However, the significant adjustments that IRS is  making to the program to address these reductions are not without risk,  could potentially impact future budget requests, and will delay the  implementation of certain functionality that was intended to provide  benefit to IRS operations and the taxpayer. For example:  Reductions in Management reserve/project risk adjustments. In  response to the fiscal year 2005 budget reduction, IRS reduced the  amount that it had allotted to program management reserve and project  risk adjustments by about 62 percent (from about $49.1 million to about  $18.6 million). If BSM projects have future cost overruns that cannot  be covered by the depleted reserve, this reduction could result in  (1) increased budget requests in future years or (2) delays in planned  future activities (e.g., delays in delivering promised functionality) to use  those allocated funds to cover the overruns.", "Shifts of BSM management responsibility from the PRIME contractor  to IRS.  Due to budget reductions and IRS\u2019s assessment of the PRIME  contractor\u2019s performance, IRS decided to shift significant BSM  responsibilities for program management, systems engineering, and  business integration from the PRIME contractor to IRS staff. For  example, IRS staff are assuming responsibility for cost and schedule  estimation and measurement, risk management, integration test and  deployment, and transition management. There are risks associated  with this decision. To successfully accomplish this transfer, IRS must  have the management capability to perform this role. Although the BSM  program office has been attempting to improve this capability through,  for example, implementation of a new governance structure and hiring  staff with specific technical and management expertise, IRS has had  significant problems in the past managing this and other large  development projects, and acknowledges that it has major challenges to  overcome in this area.", "Suspension of the Custodial Accounting Project (CAP). Although the  initial release of CAP went into production in September 2004, IRS has  decided not to use this system and to stop work on planned  improvements due to budget constraints. According to IRS, it made this  decision after it evaluated the business benefits and costs to develop  and maintain CAP versus the benefits expected to be provided by other  projects, such as CADE. Among the functionality that the initial releases  of CAP were expected to provide were (1) critical control and reporting  capabilities mandated by federal financial management laws; (2) a  traceable audit trail to support financial reporting; and (3) a subsidiary  ledger to accurately and promptly identify, classify, track, and report  custodial revenue transactions and unpaid assessments. With the  suspension of CAP, it is now unclear how IRS plans to replace the  functionality this system was expected to provide, which was intended  to allow the agency to make meaningful progress toward addressing  long-standing financial management weaknesses. IRS is currently  evaluating alternative approaches to addressing these weaknesses.", "Reductions in planned functionality. According to IRS, the fiscal year  2006 funding reduction will result in delays in planned functionality for  some of its BSM projects.

The age of these plans, in conjunction with the significant delays  already experienced by the program and the substantive changes brought  on by budget reductions, indicate that it is time for IRS to revisit its long- term goals, strategy, and plans for BSM. Such an assessment would include  an evaluation of when significant future BSM functionality would be  delivered. IRS\u2019s Associate CIO for BSM has recognized that it is time to  recast the agency\u2019s BSM strategy because of changes that have occurred  subsequent to the development of the program\u2019s initial plans.

We recommended that IRS  prepare its future budget requests in accordance with these best  practices. To address our recommendation, IRS agreed to take a variety of  actions, which it has made progress in implementing.

As we reported last year, IRS officials believe that  achieving the goal would require additional measures to convert the tens of  millions of taxpayers and tax practitioners who prepare individual income  tax returns on a computer, but filed on paper to e-filing. IRS officials also  stated that the additional measures might need to include legislation that  mandates e-filing for certain classes of returns, such as those prepared by  practitioners.

However, IRS has been able to achieve a relatively stable CSR level of  service of 83 percent since last year.  According to IRS officials, this level of  performance is due to  staff plans being made before the level of service goal was reduced;  the agency receiving fewer calls due to fewer tax law changes than in   the agency  improving methods for handling calls; and   an increased use of IRS\u2019s Web site.", "Although CSR level of service is about the same as last year, down one  percentage point, there are other indications of slippage in telephone  access.

Similarly, long-term goals could help identify priorities within the taxpayer  service and enforcement functions.
