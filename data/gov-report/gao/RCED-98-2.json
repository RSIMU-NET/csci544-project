However, each year, lenders foreclose on a portion of the FHA-insured mortgages that go into default and file insurance claims with HUD for their losses. With few exceptions, HUD takes ownership of the foreclosed properties, which generally remain vacant until HUD sells them. Critics of FHA contend that the unsound underwriting of FHA-insured loans in low-income urban communities has contributed to large numbers of foreclosures and vacant HUD-owned homes in these areas. They further contend that these homes remain vacant for long periods, attracting crime, reducing local property values, and contributing to neighborhood blight.", "To provide some insights into the concerns raised by FHA\u2019s critics, we examined \u201cearly foreclosures\u201d\u2014those occurring within 18 months of the loan endorsement date.

However, FHA fulfills an even larger role in providing insurance for some groups of borrowers, particularly low-income home buyers, minorities, and central city residents.", "FHA provides most of its single-family mortgage insurance through the Section 203(b) program, which covers loans for purchasing a new or existing one- to four-family home. The 203(b) program, among other programs, is supported by the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund), which is funded by revenue from insurance premiums and foreclosed property sales. By law, the fund must meet or endeavor to meet statutory capital ratio requirements: that is, it must contain sufficient reserves to cover the estimated future payments of claims on foreclosed mortgages and other costs. Other FHA insurance programs for single-family home loans include the Section 203(k) program, for purchasing or refinancing and rehabilitating a home at least 1 year old, and the Section 234(c) program, for purchasing a unit in a condominium project.", "A mortgage loan is commonly considered \u201cin default\u201d when the borrower misses three consecutive monthly payments and a fourth payment is due. At that point, foreclosure proceedings against the borrower become a serious possibility. In the case of FHA-insured loans, once the foreclosure process is completed, the lender files an insurance claim with HUD for its losses (unpaid mortgage balance and interest, along with the costs of foreclosure and other expenses). After the claim is paid, the lender transfers the title to the home to HUD, which is responsible for managing and selling the property. HUD-owned properties generally remain vacant until they are resold.", "At the end of fiscal year 1996, HUD had about 24,700 single-family properties in its inventory. The purpose of HUD\u2019s property disposition program is to reduce the inventory of acquired property in a manner that expands homeownership opportunities, strengthens neighborhoods and communities, and ensures a maximum return to the mortgage insurance fund. Although FHA has always received enough in premiums from borrowers and other revenues to cover the costs of foreclosed MMI Fund loans, losses totaled about $12.8 billion in 1994 dollars, or about $24,400 for each foreclosed and subsequently sold single-family home over the 19-year period ending in 1993.", "To mitigate losses to FHA and hold lenders accountable for the quality of the loans they make, FHA performs several activities related to the approval, monitoring, and recertification of mortgage lenders participating in FHA\u2019s programs. For example, FHA monitors, by mortgage lender, the percentage of loans in default or on which FHA has paid the lender a claim. FHA also conducts on-site reviews of the loan origination and servicing practices of selected lenders. In addition, in 1996, FHA issued guidelines intended to promote the use of special forbearance plans, mortgage modifications, and other tools to help FHA borrowers in default remain in their homes whenever possible and to mitigate losses to FHA resulting from loan foreclosures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Foreclosure Rates Were Highest in Low-Income Areas", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, early foreclosures did not occur for 99.68 percent of the FHA-insured single-family loans made during calendar years 1992 through 1994.

For example, the odds change factor for the interest rate variable is 1.16, which means that the odds of early foreclosure increase by 16 percent for each percentage point the interest rate increases. Confidence intervals were also calculated for the original logistic regression coefficients at the 95-percent confidence level and then transformed into the more interpretable form. This means that we would expect the lower and upper bound to include the true odds change factor 95 times out of 100.", "We found statistically significant associations between increased rates of early foreclosure and (1) a lower per capita income for a census tract, (2) higher loan-to-value ratios, (3) higher loan interest rates, (4) smaller loan amounts, and (5) loans made for properties located in San Bernadino. We also found that early foreclosure was less likely for loans made for properties in Chicago.", "As the per capita income in the census tract in which the property was located increased relative to the per capita income in the entire city, the odds of early foreclosure decreased. For example, the odds of foreclosure for loans on properties located in areas whose per capita income was 91 percent of the citywide per capita income were about 1 percent lower than the odds for properties in areas whose per capita income was 90 percent of the citywide income. Larger mortgages were negatively correlated with the probability of early foreclosure. The odds of early foreclosure were estimated to decrease by about 1 percent for each additional $1,000 borrowed.", "The loan-to-value ratio was significantly and positively correlated with the odds of early foreclosure. When the loan-to-value ratio increased by 1 percentage point, the odds of early foreclosure increased by about 6 percent. The odds of early foreclosure for loans with a loan-to-value ratio of zero\u2014mostly streamlined financed loans\u2014were about the same as the odds for loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 90 percent and were about 25 percent lower than the odds for loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 95 percent.", "Higher interest rates are associated with an increase in early foreclosures. Holding other things constant, an increase of 1 percentage point in the interest rate was found to increase the odds of early foreclosure by about 16 percent.", "We also found that the odds of early foreclosure differed with the city being tested. For example, the odds of early foreclosure were lower than average for Chicago and about twice as high as the six-city average for San Bernadino. We did not obtain statistically significant results for Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, or Washington, D.C."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Time in Inventory for Single-Family Properties in Six Cities That Remained Unsold as of December 31, 1996, by Income Areas", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to (1) compare early foreclosure rates on FHA-insured single-family loans made in low-, medium-, and high-income areas nationwide and in the six cities; (2) compare across income areas the proportion of loans made in the six cities by FHA-approved mortgage lenders with and without early foreclosures; (3) identify factors that influence early foreclosure rates; and (4) compare the length of time HUD-owned single-family properties remained unsold in low-, medium-, and high-income areas in the six cities.", "In reporting information relating to early foreclosures on FHA-insured single-family loans endorsed during calendar years 1992 through 1994 in low-, medium-, and high-income areas nationwide, we relied on HUD\u2019s analysis of the number of loans made, the number of early foreclosures, and the early foreclosure rates in the three income areas. To determine early foreclosure rates for the same period in the six cities reviewed, we obtained data from HUD\u2019s database on loans insured by FHA in calendar years 1992 through 1994 and merged this information with 1990 census data. Detailed information on the data we used are provided in the section of appendix III that discusses the data used in this analysis.", "We defined a census tract\u2019s income level as \u201clow\u201d if the per capita income was at or below 80 percent of the city\u2019s per capita income, \u201cmedium\u201d if the per capita income was greater than 80 percent but at or below 120 percent of the city\u2019s level, and \u201chigh\u201d if the per capita income was greater than 120 percent of the city\u2019s level. Although HUD usually uses the median family income to identify low-, medium-, and high-income census tracts, we were unable to compute the median family income for the six cities from the data we extracted from census records. We therefore used the per capita income as our income measure.", "HUD computed early foreclosure rates by income level nationwide for this report using the average household income as the income measure for each MSA. As indicated above, we used the per capita income for each city as the income measure to calculate early foreclosure rates by income level for the six cities. Therefore, our classification of census tracts as low-, medium-, or high-income may differ from HUD\u2019s classification because (1) the average income for the MSA may differ from the per capita income for the city, and (2) the per capita income does not take into account differences in the average household size among the three income groups. While our classification of census tracts differed from HUD\u2019s classification, the relationship between early foreclosure rates and census tract income levels for both computations was similar.", "We limited our analysis to early foreclosures, that is, to those occurring within 18 months of the loan endorsement date. To determine whether a foreclosure occurred within that time period, we measured the time elapsed between FHA\u2019s endorsement of the loan and the date the lender foreclosed on the loan. For this report, we included in our calculation of early foreclosure rates loans on which the lender did not actually foreclose but on which FHA paid an insurance claim to the lender within 18 months of the loan endorsement date. We excluded from our calculation of early foreclosure rates nonconveyance foreclosures, such as instances during which a foreclosure occurs but an insurance claim is not paid. In some cases, early foreclosures may not have been reflected in the data from HUD that we used because of the lag between the date of the actual foreclosure and the date it was recorded in HUD\u2019s database. As a result, our analysis may understate the number of early foreclosures by the number of these unrecorded cases.", "To further analyze lending and early foreclosure patterns in the six cities, we divided the lenders into two groups\u2014those with no early foreclosures and those with one or more early foreclosures during the periods reviewed\u2014and compared these groups with respect to the distribution of the loans they made across income areas. We determined whether a lender had one or more early foreclosures on a city-by-city basis. Therefore, any lender that made loans in more than one of the six cities could be classified in the group of lenders with early foreclosures in one city and in the group of lenders without early foreclosures in another city.", "To obtain information on factors that contribute to differences in early foreclosure rates among income areas, we performed an analysis to show the extent to which certain variables were associated with differences in the probability of early foreclosure. Appendix III provides information on the model we built to estimate relationships between early foreclosures and factors that contribute to such foreclosures. In addition, we reviewed the mortgage finance literature and interviewed officials from HUD\u2019s Office of Insured Single-Family Housing and HUD field office officials in each of the six cities. We also interviewed local government officials and nonprofit housing executives familiar with FHA\u2019s role in the real estate markets in each of the six cities.", "To compare the length of time HUD-owned properties remained unsold in low-, medium-, and high-income areas in the six cities, we obtained data from HUD\u2019s Single-Family Accounting Management System (SAMS), which tracks properties acquired and sold by HUD. Our analysis focused on single-family properties that remained in HUD\u2019s inventory as of December 31, 1996. We measured the time in inventory from the date that HUD acquired the property. We excluded properties held off the market as of May 17, 1997 (the date our data extract was created), but we were unable to determine if the remaining properties had been held off the market for any time in the past.", "For the six cities reviewed, we matched (both electronically and manually) the property addresses in SAMS to the addresses in the Bureau of the Census\u2019 street address file to identify corresponding census tracts. When an exact match for the zip code and street address did not exist, we manually selected the closest reasonable match. When no reasonable match existed or multiple choices were possible, we excluded the property from our analysis. For the six cities combined, we were able to match about 90 percent (1,232 of 1,374) of the properties in HUD\u2019s inventory with a census tract and data on valid time in inventory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chicago Field Office", "paragraphs": ["Glenn G.
