Software development has been identified by many experts as one of the riskiest and most costly aspects of systems development. In June 1996, we reported and testified that VBA was operating at a level 1 software development capability, defined as ad hoc and chaotic. In its response to that report, VBA stated it would take actions to address the weaknesses we identified.", "At your request, we conducted a follow-up review to determine the actions taken by VBA to address management and technical weaknesses identified in the June 19, 1996, hearing on the agency\u2019s modernization effort.

It reportedly spent an estimated $294 million on these activities between October 1, 1986, and February 29, 1996. The modernization program can have a major impact on the efficiency and accuracy with which about $20 billion in benefits and other services is paid annually to our nation\u2019s veterans and their dependents. Software development is a critical component of this modernization effort. Also, a mature software development capability will provide added assurance that software developers will be able to effectively make changes to the software needed to address the Year 2000 computing problem.", "To evaluate VBA\u2019s software development processes, in 1996, we applied the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI) software capability evaluation methodology to those projects identified by VBA as using the best development processes. This evaluation compares agencies\u2019 and contractors\u2019 software development processes against SEI\u2019s five-level software capability maturity model, with 5 being the highest level of maturity and 1 being the lowest. In June 1996, we reported that VBA was operating at a level 1 capability. At this level, VBA cannot reliably develop and maintain high-quality software on any major project within existing cost and schedule constraints, which places VBA software development projects at significant risk. Accordingly, VBA must rely on the various capabilities of individuals rather than on an institutional process that will yield repeatable, or level 2, results. VBA did not satisfy any of the criteria for a repeatable or level 2 capability, the minimum level necessary to significantly improve productivity and return on investment. For example, VBA is extremely weak in the requirements management, software project planning, and software subcontract management areas, with no identifiable strengths or improvement activities.", "Because of VBA\u2019s software development weaknesses, we recommended that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs obtain expert advice to improve VBA\u2019s ability to develop high-quality develop and expeditiously implement an action plan that describes a strategy for reaching the repeatable (level 2) level of process maturity; ensure that any future contracts for software development require the contractor to have a software development capability of at least level 2; and delay any major investment in new software development\u2014beyond what is needed to sustain critical day-to-day operations\u2014until the repeatable level of process maturity is attained.", "In commenting on a draft of the June 1996 report, VBA agreed with three of our recommendations but disagreed with delaying major investments in software development. VBA stated that while it agreed that a repeatable level of process maturity is a goal that must be attained, it disagreed that \u201call software development beyond that which is day-to-day critical must be curtailed.\u201d VBA stated that the payment system replacement projects, the migration of legacy systems, and other activities to address the change of century must continue. In our response to VBA\u2019s comments, we agreed that the change of century and changes to legislation must be continued, and we characterized these changes as sustaining day-to-day operations. However, for those projects that do not meet this criterion, we continue to believe that VBA should delay software development investments until a maturity of level 2 is reached."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To assess actions taken by VBA to improve its software capability, we reviewed VBA documents, such as its \u201cSoftware Process Improvement Initiative Strategic Plan,\u201d dated March 1997; the Best Practices Round Up Method; and the Interagency Agreement with the Air Force, dated September 1996, to obtain expert software process improvement assistance.

SEI is also expected to provide expertise in strategic and tactical planning, training, policy preparation, and action planning.", "In addition, in response to our recommendation that it develop and implement an action plan describing a strategy for reaching the repeatable level, VBA launched a software process improvement initiative in June 1996 to lay the foundation and build the context for sustainable, measurable improvements to its software development capability. It has developed a strategic plan that describes the purpose and goals of this improvement initiative.
