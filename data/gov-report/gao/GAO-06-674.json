To address these objectives, GAO analyzed documents and interviewed representatives from 10 information resellers, 14 financial institutions, 11 regulators, industry and consumer groups, and others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Financial institutions such as banks, credit card companies, securities firms, and insurance companies use personal data obtained from information resellers to help make eligibility determinations, comply with legal requirements, prevent fraud, and market their products. For example, lenders rely on credit reports sold by the three nationwide credit bureaus to help decide whether to offer credit and on what terms. Some companies also use reseller products to comply with PATRIOT Act rules, to investigate fraud, and to identify customers with specific characteristics for marketing purposes. GAO found that the applicability of the primary federal privacy and data security laws--the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)--to information resellers is limited. FCRA applies to information collected or used to help determine eligibility for such things as credit or insurance, while GLBA only applies to information obtained by or from a GLBA-defined financial institution. Although these laws include data security provisions, consumers could benefit from the expansion of such requirements to all sensitive personal information held by resellers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the primary federal agency responsible for enforcing information resellers' compliance with FCRA's and GLBA's privacy and security provisions. Since 1972, the agency has initiated formal enforcement actions against more than 20 resellers, including the three nationwide credit bureaus, for violating FCRA. However, FTC does not have civil penalty authority under the privacy and safeguarding provisions of GLBA, which may reduce its ability to enforce that law most effectively against certain violations, such as breaches of mass consumer data. In overseeing compliance with privacy and data security laws, federal banking and securities regulators have issued guidance, conducted examinations, and taken formal and informal enforcement actions. A recent national survey sponsored by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) identified some noncompliance with GLBA by insurance companies, but state regulators have not laid out clear plans with NAIC for following up to ensure these issues are adequately addressed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The growth in recent years of information resellers\u2014companies that  collect, aggregate, and resell publicly available and private information on  individuals\u2014has raised privacy and security concerns related to this  industry.

The industry  has grown considerably over the past two decades, in large part due to  advances in computer technology and electronic storage. Courthouses and  other government offices previously stored personal information in paper- based public records that were relatively difficult to obtain, usually  requiring a personal visit to inspect the records. Nonpublic information,  such as personal information contained in product registrations or  insurance applications was also generally inaccessible. In recent years,  however, the electronic storage of public and private records along with  increased computer processing speeds and decreased data storage costs  have fostered information reseller businesses that collect, organize, and  sell vast amounts of personal information on virtually all American  consumers.", "The information reseller industry is large and complex, and these  businesses vary in many ways. What constitutes an information reseller is  not always clearly defined and little data exist on the total number of firms  that offer information products. FTC and other federal agencies do not  keep comprehensive lists of companies that resell personal information,  and experts say that characterizing the precise size and nature of the  information reseller industry can be difficult because it is evolving and  lacks a clear definition. Although no comprehensive data exist, industry  representatives say there are at least hundreds of information resellers in  total, including some companies that provide services over the Internet.", "We include in our definition of information resellers the three nationwide  credit bureaus\u2014Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, which primarily  collect and sell information about the creditworthiness of individuals\u2014as  well as other resellers such as ChoicePoint, Acxiom, and LexisNexis,  which sell information for a variety of purposes, including marketing.  Other companies that sell information products include eFunds, which  provides depository institutions with information on deposit account  histories; Thompson West and Regulatory DataCorp, which help  companies mitigate fraud and other risks; and ISO, which provides  insurers with insurance claims histories and fraud prevention products.  Information resellers sell their products to a broad spectrum of customers,  including private companies, individuals, law enforcement bureaus and  other government agencies. Although major information resellers  generally offer their products only to customers who have successfully  completed a credentialing process, some resellers offer certain products,  such as compilations of telephone directory information, to the public at  large. All of these businesses differ in nature, and they do not all focus  exclusively on aggregating and reselling personal information. For  example, Acxiom primarily provides customized computer services, and  its information products represent a relatively small portion of the overall  activities of the company.", "Information resellers obtain their information from many different sources  (see fig. 1). Generally, three types of information are collected: public  records, publicly available information, and nonpublic information.", "Public records are a primary source of information about consumers,  available to anyone, and can be obtained from governmental entities. What  constitutes public records is dependent upon state and federal laws, but  generally these include birth and death records, property records, tax lien  records, voter registrations, licensing records, and court records  (including criminal records, bankruptcy filings, civil case files, and legal  judgments).", "Publicly available information is information not found in public records  but nevertheless publicly available through other sources. These sources  include telephone directories, business directories, print publications such  as classified ads or magazines, Internet sites, and other sources accessible  by the general public.", "Nonpublic information is derived from proprietary or nonpublic sources,  such as credit header data, product warranty registrations, lists of  magazine or catalog subscribers, and other application information  provided to private businesses directly by consumers.", "Information resellers hold or have access to databases containing a large  variety of information about individuals. Although each reseller varies in  the specific personal information it maintains, it can include names,  aliases, Social Security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, motor  vehicle records, family members, neighbors, insurance claims, deposit  account histories, criminal records, employment histories, credit histories,  bankruptcy records, professional licenses, household incomes, home  values, automobile values, occupations, ethnicities, and hobbies.", "The various products offered by different types of information resellers  are used for a wide range of purposes, including credit and background  checks, fraud prevention, and marketing. Resellers often sell their data to  each other\u2014for example, the credit bureaus sell credit header data to  other resellers for use in identity verification and fraud prevention  products. Resellers might also purchase publicly available information  from one another, rather than gathering the information themselves. The  nature of the databases maintained and products offered by information  resellers vary. Credit bureaus maintain an individual file on most  Americans containing financial information related to that person\u2019s  creditworthiness.

Banks use credit reports to help assess the  credit risk of new customers before opening a new deposit account or  providing a mortgage or other loan. Credit card companies use credit  reports to determine whether to grant a credit card to an applicant,  determine the terms of that card, and to adjust the account terms of  current cardholders whose creditworthiness may have changed. In  addition to lenders, insurance companies often use scores generated from  credit report information to help determine premiums for the policies they  underwrite.", "Credit bureaus receive the information in credit reports from the financial  institutions themselves, among other sources. Credit reports consist of a  \u201ccredit header\u201d\u2014 identifying information such as name, current and  previous addresses, Social Security number, and telephone number\u2014and  a credit history, or other payment history, designed to provide information  on the individual\u2019s creditworthiness. The credit history might contain  information on an individual\u2019s current and past credit accounts, including  amounts borrowed and owed, credit limits, relevant dates, and payment  histories, including any record of late payments. Credit reports also may  include public record information on tax liens, bankruptcies, and other  court judgments related to the payment of debts. Credit bureaus also sell  credit scores, which are numerical representations of predicted  creditworthiness based on information in credit reports, and are often  used instead of full credit reports. For example, all three credit bureaus  sell FICO\u00ae credit scores, which use factors such as payment history,  amount owed, and length of credit history to help financial institutions  predict the likelihood that a person will repay a loan.", "Some financial institutions also use specialty CRAs, which maintain  specific types of files on consumers, to help make eligibility decisions.  Insurance companies commonly use products from ChoicePoint and ISO,  which compile data from insurance companies on the claims that  individuals have made against their homeowner\u2019s or automobile insurance  policies. Most insurance companies provide these CRAs with claim and  loss information about their customers, including names, driver\u2019s license  information, type of loss, date of loss, and amount the insurance company  paid to settle the claim. The CRAs aggregate this information from  multiple insurance companies to create either full reports or risk scores  designed to help assess the likelihood that an individual will file a claim.  Insurance companies purchase reports, or in some cases scores,  associated with individuals applying for insurance and the property being  insured to help decide whether to provide coverage and at what rate.  Insurance companies also use this information to help determine whether  to extend coverage and set premiums for existing policy holders. (See app.  II for a sample insurance claims history report.) Insurance industry  representatives told us aggregated claims data provided by specialty CRAs  are extremely useful in making coverage and rate determinations. They  noted, for example, that past losses are the best indicator of future driving  risk and thus are useful to firms that underwrite auto insurance.", "Banks and credit unions frequently assess applicants of new checking and  other deposit accounts using products offered by resellers such as  ChexSystems, a specialty CRA that is a subsidiary of eFunds. ChexSystems  compiles information from banks and credit unions on accounts that have  been closed due to account misconduct such as overdrafts, insufficient  funds activity, returned checks, bank fraud, and check forgery. The  company also aggregates available driver\u2019s license information from state  departments of motor vehicles, and receives information from check- printing companies on check order histories, which can help identify  fraud. Banks we spoke with said that the name and identifying information  of a customer seeking to open a new deposit account is typically run  through the ChexSystems database. The reports provided back to the  financial institution by ChexSystems typically include identifying  information, as well as information useful in assessing an applicant\u2019s risk,  such as the applicant\u2019s history of check orders and the source and details  of any account misconduct.

Congress intended these provisions to help prevent terrorists and other  criminals from using the U.S. financial system to fund terrorism and  launder money. The act requires financial institutions to develop  procedures to assure the identity of new customers. Many resellers offer  products that verify and validate a new customer\u2019s identity by comparing  information the customer provided to the financial institution with  information aggregated from public and private sources. Some financial  institutions, particularly those that offer services by telephone, mail, or the  Internet, often confirm customers\u2019 identities using these reseller products.  Other companies may verify their customers\u2019 identity from a driver\u2019s  license, passport, or other paper document, but use information resellers  for additional verification.", "Financial institutions must also screen their customers to ensure they are  not on the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control  (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. The list  includes individuals and entities that financial institutions are generally  prohibited from conducting transactions with because they have been  identified as potential terrorists, money launderers, international narcotics  traffickers, or other criminals. Many information resellers offer products  to financial institutions that screen new customers against the OFAC list;  often this screening is packaged with identity verification in a single  product. (See app. II for a sample identity verification and OFAC screening  report.) The OFAC list is a publicly available government document, but  financial institutions told us they use resellers for their screening because  it allows them to do so more quickly and helps distinguish between  common names on the list that might result in false matches. Some  financial institutions use resellers to screen new customers against the  OFAC list, while others periodically screen all of their existing customers.  Some companies told us they do most of their OFAC screening internally,  but sometimes use a reseller to gather additional information confirming  whether a potential match is indeed an individual that is on the OFAC list.", "To verify a customer\u2019s identity or conduct an OFAC screening, a financial  institution typically uses a Web-based portal to provide an information  reseller with basic information about the individual being screened\u2014such  as the person\u2019s name, Social Security number, address, driver\u2019s license  number, phone number, and date of birth. The reseller then checks the  information against its own records, and typically provides a \u201cpass\u201d  response if the information matches, or a \u201cfail\u201d response if, for example,  the date of birth does not match the name. Resellers\u2019 screening products  generally draw on credit header data purchased from the credit bureaus,  along with publicly available data such as address and telephone records  and drivers\u2019 license records from state agencies.

Authentication products usually draw on information similar to that used  for verification products, most commonly credit header data and public  records. Some resellers offer products that also allow the financial  institution to access the customers\u2019 credit history with their permission,  which provides additional personal information that can be used to verify  identity. For example, a customer might be asked the year an automobile  loan was originated or the credit limit on a credit card.", "Fraud departments of financial institutions in our review also use more  detailed products from information resellers to investigate suspected  identity theft or account fraud, such as the use of a stolen credit card  number. (See app. II for a sample fraud investigation report.) In these  cases, a company\u2019s fraud department often purchases from information  resellers detailed background information on a suspect\u2019s current and prior  residences, vehicles, relatives, aliases, criminal records (in certain states),  and other information that can be useful in directing an investigation.  Examples of the uses of fraud products offered by resellers include    obtaining detailed personal information about people associated with  potential fraud, or their relatives and associates;    detecting links between individuals who may be co-conspirators in fraud  identifying multiple insurance claims made by the same person; identifying individuals who are associated with multiple addresses,  telephone numbers, or vehicles in ways that indicate potential fraud;   obtaining contact information for key individuals, such as witnesses to car  accidents identified in police reports; or  identifying instances where insurance policy applicants have failed to  disclose certain required information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing Risk and Locating Individuals", "paragraphs": ["Financial institutions also sometimes use reseller products to help identify  potential reputational risk or other risks associated with new customers or  business partners.

For example, lenders use reseller products to find  customers who have defaulted on debts, and some mutual fund companies  use these products to locate lost shareholders. The information provided  by products used for this purpose is derived largely from credit header  data, telephone records, and public records data, and may include an  individual\u2019s aliases, addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security  number, motor vehicle records, as well as the names of neighbors and  associates.

Databases held by resellers  offering marketing products include a variety of information on individuals  and households, such as household size, number and ages of children,  estimated household income, homeownership status, demographic data,  and lifestyle interests and activities. These databases derive their  information from public records as well as nonpublic sources such as self- reported marketing surveys, product warranty cards, and lists of magazine  subscribers, which may be used to provide financial institutions and other  companies with lists of consumers meeting certain criteria. For example,  a bank marketing a college savings account might request the names and  addresses of all households in certain ZIP codes that have children under  the age of 18 and household incomes of $100,000 or more. Financial  institutions we studied also use certain reseller products to gather  additional information on their existing customers to market additional  products and services. For example, we spoke with an insurance company  that used an information reseller to learn which of its existing customers  owned boats, so those customers could be targeted for boat insurance.  Similarly, one bank we spoke with used an information reseller to help  market a sailing credit card to current customers who lived near bodies of  water.", "Many companies that solicit new credit card accounts and insurance  policies use nationwide credit bureaus for \u201cprescreening\u201d to identify  potential customers for the products they offer. A lender or insurance  company establishes criteria, such as a minimum credit score, and then  purchases from a credit bureau a list of people in the bureau\u2019s database  who meet those criteria. In some cases, the financial institution already  has a list of potential customers that it provides to the credit bureau to  identify individuals on the list who meet the criteria. Financial institutions  sometimes also use a second information reseller to help them obtain from  a credit bureau a list that includes only consumers meeting specific  demographic or lifestyle criteria. For example, in marketing a home equity  line of credit, a lender may use a second information reseller to work with  a credit bureau to identify creditworthy individuals that are also  homeowners and live in certain geographic areas, to which the lender will  then make a firm offer of credit. Financial institutions sometimes use data  from information resellers for models\u2014developed by either the institution  or the reseller\u2014that seek to predict consumers likely to be interested in a  new product and unlikely to present a credit risk. For example, a firm we  spoke with that was marketing credit cards to college students used  reseller data to determine the characteristics of college students that  indicate they will be successful credit card borrowers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Privacy and Information Security Laws Apply to Many Information Reseller Products, Depending on Their Use and Source", "paragraphs": ["The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act  (GLBA) are the primary federal laws governing the privacy and security of  personal data collected and shared by information resellers.

Instead, a variety of different laws  govern the use, sharing, and protection of personal information that is  maintained for specific purposes or by specific types of entities. The two  primary federal laws that protect personal information maintained by  private sector companies are FCRA and GLBA. FCRA protects the security  and confidentiality of personal information that is collected or used to  help make decisions about individuals\u2019 eligibility for, among other things,  credit, insurance, or employment, while GLBA is designed to protect  personal financial information that individuals provide to or that is  maintained by financial institutions.", "In addition to FCRA and GLBA, other federal laws that directly or  indirectly address privacy and data security may also cover some  information reseller products. The Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act of 1994  regulates the use and disclosure by state motor vehicle departments of  personal information from motor vehicle records. Personal motor vehicle  records may be purchased and sold only for certain purposes\u2014such as  insurance claims investigations and other anti-fraud activities\u2014unless a  state motor vehicle agency has received express consent from the  individual indicating otherwise. In addition, the Federal Trade  Commission Act (FTC Act), enacted in 1914 and amended on numerous  occasions, gives FTC the authority to prohibit and act against unfair or  deceptive acts or practices. The failure by a commercial entity, such as an  information reseller, to reasonably protect personal information could be  a violation of the FTC Act if the company\u2019s actions constitute an unfair or  deceptive act or practice. Finally, some federal banking regulators have  authority to oversee their institutions\u2019 third-party service providers to  ensure the safety and soundness of financial institutions. For example, if  a vendor such as an information reseller did not employ reasonable  safeguards to maintain a bank\u2019s records, federal banking regulators could  examine the vendor to identify and remedy the risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCRA Applies Only to Consumer Information Used to Determine Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), enacted in 1970, protects the  confidentiality and accuracy of personal information used to make certain  types of decisions about consumers.

Businesses  that evaluate consumer information or assemble such reports for third  parties are known as consumer reporting agencies, or CRAs. Consumer  reports covered by FCRA comprise a significant portion of consumer data  transactions in the United States. For example, according to an industry  association that represents CRAs, the three nationwide credit bureaus sell  over 2.5 billion credit reports each year on average. FCRA places certain  restrictions and obligations on CRAs that issue these reports. For example,  the law restricts the use of consumer reports to certain permissible  purposes, such as approving credit, imposes certain disclosure  requirements, and requires that CRAs take steps to ensure that  information in these reports is not misused. It also provides consumers  with certain rights in relation to their credit reports, such as the right to  dispute the accuracy or completeness of items in the reports. Congress has  amended FCRA a number of times, most recently with the Fair and  Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which sought to  promote more-accurate credit reports and expand consumers\u2019 access to  their credit information.", "Information resellers are subject to FCRA\u2019s requirements only with regard  to information used to compile consumer reports\u2014that is, reports used to  help determine eligibility for certain purposes, including credit, insurance,  or employment. Thus, FCRA applies to databases used to compile credit  reports sold by the three nationwide credit bureaus, and its provisions  apply both to the credit bureaus themselves as well as to other information  resellers that purchase and resell credit reports for use by others. FCRA  also applies to databases used to generate specialty consumer reports\u2014 which consist of such things as tenant history, check writing history,  employment history, medical information, or insurance claims\u2014that are  used to help make eligibility determinations. For example, according to  ChoicePoint, FCRA applies to the data used in most of its WorkPlace  Solutions products, which employers use to make hiring decisions.  Similarly, according to LexisNexis, FCRA applies to its Electronic  Bankruptcy Notifier product data, which financial institutions use to  determine whether to offer customers credit or other financial services.  Overall, 8 of the 10 information resellers we spoke with said that at least  some of their products are consumer reports as defined by FCRA. They  said their contracts prohibit their customers from using their non-FCRA  products for purposes related to making eligibility determinations.", "According to the information resellers included in our review, FCRA does  not cover many databases used to create other products they offer  because, as defined by the law, the information was not collected for  making eligibility determinations and the products are not intended to be  used for making eligibility determinations. For example, some of the  information resellers we spoke with did not treat data in some products  used to identify and prevent fraud as subject to FCRA. Similarly, resellers  do not typically consider databases used solely for marketing purposes to  be covered by FCRA. Because the definition of a consumer report under  FCRA depends on the purpose for which the information is collected and  on the reports\u2019 intended and actual use, an information reseller apparently  may have two essentially identical databases with only one of them  subject to FCRA.", "FCRA also restricts financial institutions and other companies that use  consumer reports from using them for purposes other than those  permitted in the law. Financial institutions must also notify consumers if  they take an adverse action\u2014such as denying an applicant a credit card\u2014 based on information in a consumer report. Under FCRA, companies that  furnish information to CRAs also must take steps to ensure the accuracy  of information they report.

Under FCRA, as recently amended by  the FACT Act, consumers have the right to    obtain all of the information about themselves contained in the files of a  CRA upon request, including their credit history; receive one free copy of their credit file from nationwide CRAs and  nationwide specialty CRAs once a year or under certain other  circumstances;   dispute information that is incomplete or inaccurate, and have their claims  investigated and any errors deleted or corrected, as provided by the law;  and   opt out of allowing CRAs to provide their personal information to third  parties for prescreened marketing offers.", "Most of FCRA\u2019s access, correction, and opt-out rights apply not just to the  three nationwide credit bureaus\u2014Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax\u2014 but also to other CRAs, including nationwide specialty CRAs that provide  reports on such things as insurance claims and tenant histories. The law  imposes slightly different requirements on these entities with respect to  free annual reports. For example, FCRA\u2019s implementing regulation  requires Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax to create a centralized source  for accepting consumer requests for free credit reports, which must  include a single dedicated Web site, a toll-free telephone number, and mail  directed to a single postal address where consumers can order credit  reports from all three nationwide CRAs. Nationwide specialty CRAs are  individually required to maintain a toll-free number and a streamlined  process for accepting and processing consumer requests for file  disclosures. Other CRAs must provide consumers with a copy of their  report upon request (although in most cases they may charge a reasonable  fee for it), and they must allow consumers to dispute information they  believe to be inaccurate. In practice, consumers may find it difficult in  some cases to effectively access and correct information held by  nationwide specialty CRAs because there may be hundreds of such CRAs  and no master list exists. For example, job seekers who want to confirm  the accuracy of information about themselves in background-screening  products would need to request their consumer reports from the dozens of  such companies that offer such products.", "Consumers generally do not have the legal right to access or correct  information about them contained in non-FCRA databases, such as those  used for marketing purposes or, in some cases, fraud detection. The  information resellers we studied varied in the extent to which they  voluntarily provide consumers with additional opportunities to view,  correct, and opt out of the sharing of information beyond what the law  requires. The three nationwide credit bureaus allowed consumers to view  only information that is subject to FCRA. However, three other  information resellers we spoke with allowed consumers to order summary  reports of some data maintained about them that was not subject to FCRA.  These reports varied in length and detail but typically contained consumer  data obtained from public records, publicly available information, and  credit header information. Consumers did not typically have the right to  see data maintained about them related to marketing, such as information  on their household income, interests, or hobbies, which was often  obtained from warranty cards or self-reported survey questionnaires.", "Information resellers told us that consumers who request correction of  inaccurate data not covered by FCRA are typically referred to the  government or private entity that was the source of the data. Many  resellers told us that because their databases are so frequently updated,  simply correcting their own databases would not be effective because it  would soon be refreshed by new erroneous data from the original source.  However, one reseller told us it has procedures that prevent such  corrections from being overwritten. Some resellers offered limited  opportunities for consumers to opt out of their databases even for data not  covered by FCRA, but they typically allow this only for data used for  marketing purposes. The five resellers we spoke with that maintain  personal data used for marketing allowed consumers to request that their  information not be shared with third parties. None of the resellers we  spoke with offered all consumers the ability to opt out of identity  verification or fraud products. They noted that it would undermine the  effectiveness of the databases if, for example, criminals could remove  themselves from lists of fraudsters. Some resellers do allow opt-out  opportunities to certain individuals, such as judges or identity-theft  victims, who may face potential harm from having their information  included in reseller databases.", "Industry representatives, consumer advocates, and others offer differing  views on whether the access, correction, and opt-out rights provided  under FCRA should be expanded. Many consumer advocates and others  have argued that these rights should not be limited to consumer  information used for eligibility purposes, but should explicitly extend as  well to databases not currently considered by resellers to be subject to  FCRA, such as those used for some anti-fraud products. Proponents of this  view argue that basic privacy principles dictate that consumers should  have the right to know what information is being collected and maintained  about them. In addition, they argue that errors in these databases have the  potential to harm consumers. For example, an individual could be denied a  volunteer opportunity or falsely pursued as a crime suspect due to  erroneous information in a reseller database not covered under FCRA.", "In contrast, some information resellers, financial services firms, and law  enforcement representatives have argued that providing individuals  expanded access, correction, and opt-out rights is unnecessary and could  harm fraud prevention and criminal investigations by providing individuals  with the opportunity to see and manipulate the information that exists  about them. They also note that expanding these rights could create new  regulatory burdens. For example, firms maintaining databases for  marketing purposes could face substantial costs and complications  developing and implementing processes for consumers to see, challenge,  and correct the data held on them.

GLBA distinguishes between a financial institution\u2019s \u201ccustomers\u201d  and other individuals the financial institution may interact less with, which  the law refers to as \u201cconsumers.\u201d Specifically, a consumer is an individual  who obtains a financial product or service from a financial institution. On  the other hand, a customer is a consumer who has an ongoing relationship  with a financial institution. For example, someone who engages in an  isolated transaction with a financial institution, such as obtaining an ATM  withdrawal, is a consumer, whereas someone who has a deposit account  with a bank would be a customer. While some GLBA requirements, such  as the privacy requirements, apply broadly to cover consumer information  in many cases, other provisions of GLBA apply only to customer  information. For example, GLBA\u2019s safeguarding requirements oblige  financial institutions to protect only customer information.", "GLBA requires financial institutions to provide their customers with a  notice at the start of the customer relationship and annually thereafter for  the duration of that relationship. The notice must describe the company\u2019s  sharing practices and give customers, and in some cases consumers, the  right to opt out of some sharing. GLBA exempts companies from notice  and opt-out requirements under certain circumstances. For example,  financial institutions and CRAs may share personal information for credit- reporting purposes without providing opt-out opportunities, and financial  institutions and others may also share this information to protect against  or prevent actual or potential fraud and unauthorized transactions. Thus,  financial institutions are not required to provide their customers with opt- out rights before reporting their information to credit bureaus or sharing  their information with information resellers for identity verification and  fraud purposes. Under another GLBA exception, financial institutions are  also not required to provide consumers with an opportunity to opt out of  the sharing of information with companies that perform services for the  financial institution.", "GLBA\u2019s privacy provisions apply to information resellers only if (1) the  reseller is a GLBA \u201cfinancial institution\u201d or (2) the reseller receives  nonpublic personal information from such a financial institution (see fig.  2). The determination of whether a company is a financial institution  under GLBA is complex and, for an information reseller, depends on  whether the company\u2019s activities are included in implementing regulations  issued by FTC. GLBA defines \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d as entities that are in  the business of engaging in certain financial activities. Such activities  include, among other things, traditional banking services, activities that  are financial in nature on the FRB list of permissible activities for financial  holding companies in effect as of the date of GLBA\u2019s enactment, and new  permissible activities. While new financial activities may be identified,  those activities are not automatically included in FTC\u2019s definition.

For example, FRB\u2019s list of \u201cfinancial  activities\u201d includes not only the activity of extending credit, but also  related activities such as credit bureau services.

They said they determine whether GLBA applies  to an entity on a case-by-case basis and that it is difficult to generalize  what types of information resellers are GLBA financial institutions. For  example, CRAs other than the three nationwide credit bureaus may not  necessarily be subject to GLBA if, for example, their activities do not fall  under FRB\u2019s definition of credit bureau services or they do not otherwise  engage in any financial activity included in the 1999 FRB list. Only four  resellers with whom we spoke\u2014the three nationwide credit bureaus and a  specialty CRA that collects deposit account information\u2014told us they  consider themselves financial institutions subject to GLBA\u2019s privacy and  safeguarding provisions. Moreover, we were told that these provisions do  not apply to the entire company but rather only to those activities of the  company that are deemed financial in nature. For example, one credit  bureau told us that its credit reporting activities fall under GLBA, but that  its marketing products, which are not deemed financial in nature, do not  fall under GLBA.", "GLBA not only limits how financial institutions share nonpublic personal  information with other companies, but it also restricts what those  companies subsequently do with the information.

If a company receives information  under a GLBA exception, then the reseller can only reuse and redisclose  the information for activities that fall under the exception under which the  information was received. Alternatively, if a company receives  information from a financial institution in a way not covered by an  exception\u2014where an individual has been provided with a GLBA notice  and has chosen not to opt out of sharing\u2014then the information may be  reused and redisclosed in any way the original financial institution would  have been permitted.", "As noted earlier, the nationwide credit bureaus sell credit header data\u2014 identifying information at the top of a credit report\u2014to other information  resellers for use in fraud prevention products.

Credit bureau representatives said they  receive the information from financial institutions under both the  consumer reporting and fraud prevention exceptions, and then sell it  under the fraud prevention exception.", "Also, some old credit header data may not be subject to GLBA at all.

This raises concerns given that identity theft has emerged  as a serious problem and that breaches of sensitive personal data have  occurred at a variety of companies that are not financial institutions. For  example, in 2005, BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, which is not considered a GLBA  financial institution, settled FTC charges that it engaged in an unfair or  deceptive act or practice in violation of the FTC Act by failing to take  appropriate security measures to protect the sensitive information of  thousands of its customers. FTC alleged that the company\u2019s failure to  secure sensitive information was an unfair practice because it caused  substantial injury not reasonably avoidable by consumers and not  outweighed by offsetting benefits to consumers or competition. Some  policymakers, consumer advocates, and industry representatives have  advocated explicit statutory requirements that would expand more  broadly the number and types of companies that must safeguard their  data. Had there been a statutory requirement for BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club to  safeguard sensitive information, FTC would have had authority to file a  complaint based on the company\u2019s failure to safeguard information.  Expanding the class of entities subject to safeguarding laws would impose  explicit data security provisions on a larger group of organizations that are  maintaining sensitive personal information. FTC has testified that should  Congress enact new data security requirements, FTC\u2019s safeguards rule  should serve as a model for an effective enforcement standard because it  provides sufficient flexibility to apply to a wide range of companies rather  than mandate specific technical requirements that may not be appropriate  for all entities. To be most effective, new data security provisions would  need to apply both to customer and noncustomer data because the nature  of information reseller businesses is such that they hold large amounts of  sensitive personal information on individuals who are not their customers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "No Federal Statute Requires Notification of Data Breaches", "paragraphs": ["Currently, there is no federal statute requiring information resellers or  most other companies to disclose breaches of sensitive personal  information, although at least 32 states have enacted some form of breach  notification law.

These concerns have been  triggered in part by increased public awareness of the problem of identity  theft and by a large number of data breaches at a wide variety of public  and private sector entities, including major financial services firms,  information resellers, universities, and government agencies. In 2005,  ChoicePoint acknowledged that the personal records it held on  approximately 162,000 consumers had been compromised. As part of a  settlement with the company in January 2006, FTC alleged that  ChoicePoint did not have reasonable procedures to screen prospective  subscribers to its data products, and provided consumers\u2019 sensitive  personal information to subscribers whose applications should have  raised obvious suspicions. A December 2005 report by the Congressional  Research Service noted that personal data security breaches were  occurring with increasing regularity, and listed 97 recent breaches, five of  which had occurred at information resellers.

The bills vary in many ways,  including differences in who must be notified, the level of risk that triggers  a notice, the nature of the notification, exceptions to the requirement, and  the extent to which federal law preempts state law. Breach notification  requirements have two primary benefits. First, they provide companies or  other entities with incentives to follow good security practices so as to  avoid the legal liability or public relations risks that may result from a  publicized breach of customer data. Second, consumers who are informed  of a breach of their personal data can take actions to mitigate potential  risk, such as reviewing the accuracy of their credit reports or credit card  statements. However, FTC and others have noted that any federal  requirements should ensure that customers receive notices only when they  are at risk of identity theft or other related harm. To require notices when  consumers are not at true risk could create an undue burden on  businesses that may be required to provide notices for minor and  insignificant breaches. It could also overwhelm consumers with frequent  notifications about breaches that have no impact on them, reducing the  chance they will pay attention when a meaningful breach occurs.

In addition to  the guidelines that implement GLBA safeguarding requirements, these  regulators have in some cases issued guidance to provide further  assistance to their institutions. For example, the banking agencies issued a  guide on small entities\u2019 compliance with GLBA\u2019s privacy provision to help  companies identify and comply with the requirements. The banking  agencies also have issued additional written interagency guidance for  financial institutions relating to notification of their customers in the event  of unauthorized access to their information where misuse of the  information has occurred or is reasonably possible.", "The banking regulators have also issued rules and regulations for their  institutions to implement certain provisions of the Fair and Accurate  Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which amends FCRA.

However, they said that, to date, SEC has not seen sufficient problems  with third-party vendors to justify requesting the authority to examine  them at this time. They noted that in their examinations, they hold entities  accountable for ensuring that personal information is appropriately  safeguarded whether the information is managed in-house or by a vendor.

The information maintained by resellers commonly includes  sensitive personal information, such as purchasing habits, estimated  incomes, and Social Security numbers. The expansion in the past few  decades in the sale of personal information has raised concerns about  both personal privacy and data security. Many consumers may not be  aware how much of their personal information is maintained and how  frequently it is disseminated. In addition, identity theft has emerged as a  serious problem, and data security breaches have occurred at some major  resellers. At the same time, however, information resellers also provide  some important benefits to both individuals and businesses. Financial  institutions rely heavily on these resellers for a variety of vital purposes,  including credit reporting (which reduces the cost of credit), PATRIOT Act  compliance, and fraud detection. As Congress weighs various legislative  options, it will need to consider the appropriate balance between  protecting consumers\u2019 privacy and security interests and the benefits  conferred by the current regime that allows a relatively free flow of  information between companies.", "No federal law explicitly requires all information resellers to safeguard all  of the sensitive personal information they may hold. As we have discussed,  FCRA applies only to consumer information used or intended to be used  to help determine eligibility, and GLBA\u2019s safeguarding requirements apply  only to customer data held by GLBA-defined financial institutions. Much of  the personal information maintained by information resellers that does not  fall under FCRA or GLBA is not necessarily required by federal law to be  safeguarded, even when the information is sensitive and subject to misuse  by identity thieves. Given financial institutions\u2019 widespread reliance on  information resellers to comply with legal requirements, detect fraud, and  market their products, the possibility for misuse of this sensitive personal  information is heightened. Requiring information resellers to safeguard all  of the sensitive personal information they hold would help ensure that  explicit data security requirements apply more comprehensively to a class  of companies that maintains large amounts of such data. Further, although  the scope of this report focused on information resellers, this work has  made clear to us that a wide range of retailers and other entities also  maintain sensitive personal information on consumers. As Congress  considers requiring information resellers to better ensure that all of the  sensitive personal information they maintain is safeguarded, it may also  wish to consider the potential costs and benefits of expanding more  broadly the class of entities explicitly required to safeguard sensitive  personal information. Any new safeguarding requirements would likely be  more effectively implemented and least burdensome if, as with FTC\u2019s  Safeguards Rule, they provided sufficient flexibility to account for the  widely varying size and nature of businesses that hold sensitive personal  information.", "The proliferation of sensitive personal information in the marketplace and  increasing numbers of high-profile data breaches have motivated many  states to enact data security laws with breach notification requirements.  No federal statute currently requires breach notification, but such  legislation could have certain benefits. Companies would have incentives  to improve data safeguarding to reduce the reputational risk of a  publicized breach, and consumers would know to take potential action  against a risk of identity theft or other related harm. Congress has held  many hearings related to data breaches, and several bills have been  introduced that would require breach notification. We support  congressional actions to require information resellers, and other  companies, to notify individuals when breaches of sensitive information  occur. In previous work, we have also identified key benefits and  challenges of notifying the public about security breaches that occur at  federal agencies. To be cost effective and reduce unnecessary burden on  consumers, agencies, and industry, it would be important for Congress to  identify a threshold for notification that would allow individuals to take  steps to protect themselves where the risk of identity theft or other related  harm exists, while ensuring they are only notified in cases where the level  of risk warrants such action. Objective criteria for when notification is  required and appropriate enforcement mechanisms are also important  considerations. Congress should also consider whether and when a federal  breach notification law would preempt state laws.", "FTC has taken many significant enforcement actions against information  resellers and other companies that have violated federal privacy laws, and  it is important that the agency have the appropriate enforcement remedies.

Providing FTC with the authority to seek civil penalties for  violations of GLBA could help the agency more effectively enforce that  law\u2019s safeguarding provisions.", "Federal financial regulators generally appear to provide suitable oversight  of their regulated entities\u2019 compliance with privacy and information  security laws governing consumer information.

The three  nationwide credit bureaus were included in this definition. Our audit work  focused primarily on larger information resellers and did not cover smaller  Internet-based resellers because these companies were rarely or never  used by financial institutions from which we collected information. Our  scope was limited to resellers\u2019 use and sale of personal information about  individuals; it did not include other information that resellers may provide,  such as data on commercial enterprises. Our review of financial  institutions covered the banking, securities, property and casualty  insurance, and consumer lending and finance industries, but excluded life  insurance and health insurance companies because they use health data  that are covered by federal laws that were outside the scope of our work.  In addition, we included financial institutions\u2019 use of reseller information  for purposes related to customers and other consumers, but excluded  their use of reseller products for screening their own employees or making  business decisions such as where to locate a facility.", "To address all of the objectives, we interviewed or received written  responses from 10 information resellers\u2014Acxiom, eFunds, ChoicePoint,  Equifax, Experian, LexisNexis, ISO, Regulatory DataCorp, Thompson  West, and TransUnion. We also reviewed marketing materials, sample  contracts, sample reports, and other items from these companies that  provided detailed information on the data contained in their products.  These companies were selected because, according to the financial  institutions, trade associations, and industry experts we spoke with, they  constitute most of the largest and most significant information resellers  offering services to the financial industry sector, and collectively they  represent a variety of different products. The information resellers we  included and the products they offer do not necessarily represent the full  scope of the industry. We also spoke with representatives of the Consumer  Data Industry Association and the Direct Marketing Association, trade  associations that represent portions of the information reseller industry.", "To determine how financial institutions use data products supplied by  information resellers and the types and sources of the data, we also  interviewed or received written responses, and collected and analyzed  documents, from knowledgeable representatives at financial institutions in  the banking, securities, property and casualty insurance, and consumer  lending and finance industries. We gathered information from Bank of  America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, which are the three largest U.S.  bank holding companies by asset size, as well as Goldman Sachs, Morgan  Stanley, and Merrill Lynch, which are the three largest global securities  firms by revenue. We also interviewed representatives at American  International Group, State Farm, and Allstate, which are the three largest  U.S. insurance companies and include the two largest property/casualty  insurers. We also interviewed representatives at GE Consumer Finance,  one of the world\u2019s 10 largest consumer finance companies, and four other  financial institutions\u2014American Express, Wells Fargo Financial, Security  Finance, and Check into Cash\u2014which together offer a variety of consumer  lending products, including automobile financing, credit cards, and payday  loans. We also interviewed officials at trade associations representing  these financial services industries, including the American Bankers  Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, Securities  Industry Association, Investment Company Institute, American Insurance  Association, and American Financial Services Association.", "These financial institutions from which we gathered information conduct a  significant portion of the transactions in the financial services sector. For  example, they collectively own 9 of the 50 largest commercial depository  institutions, holding about 20 percent of total domestic deposits, as well as  8 of the 10 largest credit card issuers. The insurance companies we spoke  with represent about a quarter of the U.S. property and casualty insurer  market share. In most cases, we selected these financial institutions by  determining the largest companies in each of the four industries, based on  data from reputable sources. In two cases, we spoke with firms because  they were recommended by representatives of their trade association. Our  findings on how financial institutions use information resellers are not  representative of the entire financial services industry. However, we  believe they accurately represent institutions\u2019 use of resellers because our  findings from discussions with these companies and their representatives  were corroborated by discussions with information resellers, regulators,  legal experts, and privacy and consumer advocacy groups.", "To identify how federal privacy and data security laws and regulations  apply to information resellers and individuals\u2019 rights and opportunities to  view and correct reseller data, we reviewed and analyzed relevant federal  laws, regulations, and guidance. We also met with staff of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, Federal Trade Commission, National Credit Union  Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Office of  Thrift Supervision, and Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), NASD  (formerly known as the National Association of Securities Dealers), New  York Stock Exchange Regulation (NYSE Regulation), and the District of  Columbia\u2019s Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking (DISB). In  addition, we interviewed three legal experts in the area of privacy law that  work in academia or represent financial institutions and information  resellers. We also interviewed and collected documents from information  resellers, financial institutions, federal regulators, and a variety of privacy  and consumer advocacy groups, to gather views on the applicability of  laws to information resellers and the adequacy of existing laws.", "To describe how regulators oversee information resellers\u2019 and financial  institutions\u2019 compliance with federal privacy and data security laws, we  met with the federal agencies, financial institutions, information resellers,  and other parties listed above. We also reviewed federal agencies\u2019  guidance, examination procedures, settlement agreements, and other  documents, as well as relevant reports and documents from NAIC, NASD,  and NYSE Regulation. To help illustrate regulators\u2019 examination activities  in this area, we also met with OCC staff who conduct examinations at  three national banks and reviewed their examination workpapers. We also  gathered data from regulators about the number and nature of  examination findings, where applicable.", "To describe the efforts of state insurance regulators to oversee insurance  companies\u2019 compliance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), we also  reviewed the DISB survey report of insurance companies\u2019 implementation  of GLBA policies and procedures. DISB used the survey responses to  determine findings for each company on the level of compliance with  GLBA and related NAIC model rule provisions. The DISB review defined a  \u201cfinding\u201d as an occurrence of a perceived gap between a company\u2019s  privacy practices and procedures and the guidelines outlined in one of the  model acts or regulations of NAIC. The findings were derived from  responses to the survey questions. The companies DISB surveyed  comprised major companies, including property and casualty insurance  groups with 2002 gross written premiums of approximately $250 million or  more; life insurance groups with 2002 gross written premiums of  approximately $200 million or more; and health insurance groups with  2002 gross written premiums of approximately $500 million or more. This  initial list contained 129 insurance groups. After the initial list was  compiled, 26 groups were exempted from the survey examination for one  of three reasons: (1) there was a prior, ongoing, or upcoming examination  of the group that included (or would include) a comprehensive review of  the group\u2019s privacy policy (23 groups); (2) the group engaged primarily or  solely in reinsurance (2 groups); or (3) the state insurance regulator for  the company\u2019s state of domicile requested that the group be exempted (1  group). The survey questionnaire included 93 questions asking for detailed  documentary and testimonial evidence of companies\u2019 level of compliance  with GLBA and related NAIC model rule provisions.", "We conducted our review from June 2005 through May 2006 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Sample Information Reseller Reports", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides examples of reports from different types of  products sold by information resellers.
