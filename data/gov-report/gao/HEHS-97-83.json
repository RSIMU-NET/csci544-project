As physicians, however, psychiatrists are trained in and licensed to practice medicine and are therefore qualified to prescribe medication for both mental and physical conditions. Because no medical training is required to practice clinical psychology, clinical psychologists, whether in the military or the civilian sector, historically have not been permitted to prescribe drugs.", "This changed for some clinical psychologists in the military when the MHSS instituted the Psychopharmacology Demonstration Project (PDP) in 1991. The PDP has trained military psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication for mental conditions such as depressive and adjustment disorders. Before the PDP, MHSS psychologists were not allowed to prescribe medication. The first PDP participants completed the program in 1994. To date, seven psychologists have finished the PDP training, and the MHSS has authorized all of them to prescribe certain medications for mental conditions. An additional three psychologists are expected to complete the PDP in June 1997.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (P.L. 104-106) required that the PDP end by June 30, 1997, and that we evaluate the project.

To develop this information, we reviewed the military\u2019s needs determinations for psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. We examined reports and assessments of the PDP by the Army, the Army Surgeon General\u2019s blue ribbon panels, and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) as well as several articles on the issue of psychologists prescribing drugs. We also reviewed both a feasibility study and a cost-effectiveness analysis conducted by Vector Research, Inc.

This mission requires the MHSS to (1) provide medical support to active-duty military personnel in preparation for and during combat and (2) maintain the health of the active-duty force during peacetime. The Army, Navy, and Air Force all maintain uniformed health care providers to fill their MHSS medical readiness needs.", "To the extent that military space, staff, and other resources are available, the MHSS may also support DOD\u2019s mission to care for nonactive-duty beneficiaries (dependents of active-duty members, retired members and their dependents, and survivors of deceased members). Whenever nonactive-duty beneficiaries\u2019 need for health care exceeds the MHSS\u2019 resources available to them, DOD purchases services for them from the civilian health care sector.", "The role of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in meeting the MHSS medical readiness mission is to provide mental health care that helps military active-duty personnel perform their duties before, during, and after combat or some other military operation. Both psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, whether in the military or civilian sector, provide a variety of mental health services, some of which are similar. Both can diagnose mental conditions and treat these conditions with psychotherapy. A degree in medicine is required to practice psychiatry, however, so psychiatrists may treat mental disorders medically, that is, with medication. Because medical training is not required to practice clinical psychology, psychologists are not qualified to prescribe medication.", "To practice medicine, psychiatrists complete 4 years of medical school and a 1-year clinical internship during which they are trained to evaluate and treat all types of organic conditions and to perform general surgery. After this, they complete a 3-year psychiatric residency during which they learn to evaluate and treat mental conditions and the organic conditions associated with them. Because psychiatrists practice medicine, they can diagnose organic as well as mental conditions and treat each with medication. They consider a full range of possible organic causes for abnormal behavior when diagnosing a condition. Therefore, they can distinguish between mental conditions with an organic cause, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and organic conditions, such as diabetes and thyroid disease, which have symptoms that mimic a mental disorder. Organic mental disorders are best treated through a combination of medication and psychotherapy, according to DOD officials.", "Clinical psychologists, on the other hand, practice psychology, not medicine. Typically, they complete 6 years of graduate school leading to a doctoral degree and 1 to 2 years of postdoctoral clinical experience. Clinical psychologists are trained in theories of human development and behavior, so their general approach to diagnosing and treating mental illness is psychosocial rather than medical. They are trained to diagnose and treat all mental conditions and rely on the behavior a patient displays to diagnose these conditions.", "The MHSS created the PDP to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists in the military so they could treat their patients with psychotropic medication when needed. DOD established this project in response to a conference report dated September 28, 1988, which accompanied the fiscal year 1989 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 100-463). The report specified that, \u201cgiven the importance of addressing \u2018battle fatigue,\u2019 the conferees agreed that the Department should establish a demonstration pilot training program in which military psychologists may be trained and authorized to issue appropriate psychotropic medications under certain circumstances.\u201d", "The Army\u2019s Office of the Surgeon General was tasked with designing and implementing the PDP. A blue ribbon panel was formed by the Army Surgeon General in February 1990 to determine the best method for implementing the PDP. After considering various models, the panel endorsed a training model that included course work at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences (USUHS). In February 1991, the Chairmen of the Senate and House Subcommittees on Defense of the respective Committees on Appropriations then recommended that DOD develop a 2-year training model for the PDP in accordance with the panel\u2019s recommendations. DOD later formed a committee to develop a suitable training program to provide clinical psychologists with the knowledge required for safely and effectively using a limited list or formulary of psychotropic medication. This committee recommended a special 3-year postdoctoral fellowship program for the PDP with (1) 2 years of course work at USUHS, followed by (2) 1 year of clinical experience at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.", "This training began in August 1991 with four participants. For subsequent classes, however, the PDP consisted of 2 years of training\u20141 year of classroom and 1 year of clinical training. Classroom training included courses at USUHS in subjects such as anatomy, pharmacology, and physiology. PDP participants\u2019 clinical experience took place on inpatient wards and outpatient clinics at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., or the Malcolm Grow Medical Center at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. There, participants were trained to take medical histories and incorporate them into treatment plans and to prescribe medication for patients with certain types of mental disorders. After their clinical year, participants received a certificate of \u201cFellowship in Psychopharmacology for Psychologists\u201d and became known as \u201cprescribing psychologists.\u201d", "Once PDP participants graduated from training, they completed 1 year of supervised or proctored practice; their respective services assigned participants to military medical facilities for this 1 year of practice. These facilities authorized participants to prescribe a specified formulary of psychotropic drugs. Although the medical education received under the PDP qualified clinical psychologists to treat mental conditions with medication, it was less extensive than psychiatrists\u2019 medical training. Therefore, the MHSS limits prescribing psychologists\u2019 scope of practice. They may only treat patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who have mental conditions without medical complications as determined by their supervisors.", "ACNP helped develop and evaluate the PDP. ACNP is a professional association of about 600 scientists from disciplines such as behavioral pharmacology, neurology, pharmacology, psychiatry, and psychology. ACNP\u2019s principal functions are research and education. It conducted several assessments of the PDP under contract to the Army and made a number of recommendations on the project\u2019s goals and implementation. One of them was for DOD to establish a PDP Advisory Council to help develop criteria and procedures on implementing the PDP. DOD established this council in 1994.", "The American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, and literature on this topic have noted the possible advantages or disadvantages of allowing psychologists in the civilian sector to prescribe medication. One article has suggested that training psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication could be particularly beneficial if they were permitted to practice this skill in clinical settings such as nursing homes, mental institutions, or medically underserved areas. Some have suggested that using prescribing psychologists could reduce the cost of care and maintain the continuity of patient care by eliminating the need to switch patients from psychologists to psychiatrists when drug therapy is indicated. On the other hand, because prescribing psychologists would receive only partial training in medicine, some are concerned about the quality of care these psychologists would be able to provide.", "No state licensing authority allows psychologists to prescribe medication. A few states are considering legislation, however, that would allow those already licensed by the state\u2019s psychologist licensing board to be certified to prescribe medication after completing certain courses in medicine and gaining clinical experience. Under legislation introduced in Hawaii in 1997, psychologists seeking authority to prescribe would have to pass a standard examination. Legislation proposed in Missouri would require the development of a specified formulary of drugs for certified prescribing psychologists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Mental Health Care Providers Is Adequate for Readiness Requirements", "paragraphs": ["None of the services needs additional mental health providers capable of prescribing medication to meet either current or upcoming medical readiness requirements, according to our review of DOD\u2019s health care needs.

Given this surplus, spending resources to provide psychologists with additional skill does not seem justified.", "Each of the three services has a model and procedures to determine the number of specific types of health care providers needed to support its MHSS medical readiness mission. These are based on the types and number of casualties anticipated under a wartime scenario. About one out of eight casualties would involve combat stress, according to an Army official.Caring for combat stress requires skill in (1) diagnosing combat stress, including the ability to distinguish it from neurological or other psychological disorders with like signs and symptoms, and (2) treating a range of severity levels of combat stress. Psychologists have many but not all of the skills necessary to treat combat stress and are therefore included, along with psychiatrists, in the services\u2019 staffing of those who treat anticipated wartime casualties. Psychologists cannot be substituted for psychiatrists, however. Even if trained to prescribe drugs, psychologists are not as equipped as psychiatrists to distinguish between actual combat stress and certain neurological disorders that appear to be combat stress. Psychiatrists are also better able to treat more severe or complicated combat stress cases.", "The services have separate requirements for psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. None of the services has a separate readiness requirement for prescribing psychologists. Table 1 shows the number of MHSS psychiatrists each service has determined it needs and the number assigned or on board for fiscal years 1995 through 1998. Table 2 shows the number of clinical psychologists each service has determined it needs and the number assigned for fiscal years 1995 through 1998.", "As these tables show, the MHSS has at least as many uniformed psychiatrists and clinical psychologists as it needs to meet its current and upcoming readiness requirements. Our discussions with psychiatry consultants to the Surgeons General of the three services confirm the picture these numbers portray, and testimony of DOD officials at congressional hearings is consistent with the views expressed by these consultants. At a March 1995 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs stated that on the basis of DOD staffing guidelines, the MHSS has no shortage of active-duty physicians in general. The Navy Surgeon General also testified at this hearing that the Navy has no shortage of psychiatrists. In addition, an official from the DOD Office of Health Affairs said that DOD has a surplus of psychiatrists.", "Although training psychologists to prescribe medication enables them to perform functions they do not normally perform, it does not give them all the skills needed to enable them to substitute for psychiatrists. Furthermore, the MHSS\u2019 current staffing level of psychiatrists and psychologists is more than enough to meet its readiness requirements for caring for psychiatric cases without adding to some psychologists\u2019 capabilities.

We used a productivity factor of 50 percent for the clinical year and 100 percent for the proctored year. On the basis of these productivity factors, total participant salary costs for the clinical portion of the PDP were $333,154, according to our estimates. This accounts for one participant who dropped out approximately halfway through the clinical year and another who received an additional year of clinical training.", "To estimate faculty and supervisor salaries for the PDP for the clinical and proctored years, we assumed that one faculty member per psychologist would devote 40 percent of his or her time per clinical year of training.

For this estimate, VRI assumed that (1) each PDP class would have three psychologists, (2) prescribing psychologists would be supervised for the remainder of their military service, (3) supervisory costs after the proctored year would amount to 5 percent of a physician\u2019s annual salary per prescribing psychologist per year, and (4) prescribing psychologists would remain in the military an average of 10.2 years after completing the PDP.", "The validity of VRI\u2019s predictions about the circumstances under which the PDP would be cost-effective depends on how realistic VRI\u2019s cost estimates are as well as the other assumptions it used to estimate the annual life cycle cost of MHSS psychiatrists, psychologists, and prescribing psychologists. Some of VRI\u2019s estimates were based on scant MHSS experience in training and employing psychologists to prescribe. Information about the PDP\u2019s overhead cost that we collected after VRI completed its work, for example, indicated that overhead cost was lower than originally thought. Also, VRI\u2019s estimate of the cost of training at USUHS was lower than our estimate of the cost of this training.", "For a more realistic prediction of the circumstances under which the PDP would be cost-effective, we asked VRI to redo its analysis, replacing its estimate of $2.89 million for total overhead cost during the start-up period with an updated estimate of $2.58 million.

A potential benefit of the PDP, therefore, is the savings associated with prescribing psychologists delivering some of the services that psychologists in conjunction with psychiatrists have traditionally provided. These savings result because a prescribing psychologist can deliver this care with lower personnel-related costs than the combination of a psychologist and a psychiatrist.", "To realize these savings, however, DOD must (1) use a prescribing psychologist to treat patients who normally would have been treated by a psychiatrist and a psychologist and (2) replace higher priced providers in the MHSS with prescribing psychologists.
