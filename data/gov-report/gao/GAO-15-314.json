GAO did not develop an estimate for Perkins Loan Teacher Cancellation because U.S. Department of Education (Education) budget documents indicate that federal funds for cancellations were last appropriated in fiscal year 2009. About 36,000 of the TEACH Grant's more than 112,000 recipients have not fulfilled grant requirements, according to GAO's analysis of servicer data, and have had their grants converted to loans, known as grant-to-loan conversions, as required by regulation. Education has a stated goal to take a data-driven approach to better understand its customers, but does not collect information on why recipients do not meet requirements. Absent this data, Education is hindered in taking steps to reduce grant-to-loan conversions and improve participant outcomes.", "Key benefits of the TEACH Grant and the two loan forgiveness programs are helping to recruit needed teachers and helping teachers pay for their education, while key challenges include participants' lack of knowledge about the programs' requirements, according to GAO's focus groups with college officials and interviews with other stakeholders. Regarding challenges, college officials said TEACH recipients may have difficulty finding and keeping an eligible teaching position and that annual certification requirements are confusing. GAO's review of data from Education's Federal Student Aid Ombudsman corroborates these challenges: 64 percent of the 212 requests for TEACH assistance from October 2011 through March 2014 cited problems submitting certification paperwork. Further, some college administrators said a key reason their schools do not participate in the program is the grant-to-loan conversion issue.", "Education tracks participation in all three programs, but lacks clear, consistent guidance to help recipients understand the TEACH grant-to-loan conversion dispute process. As of September 2014, GAO's analysis of TEACH servicer data shows that 2,252 grants were erroneously converted to loans. Education officials said they now monitor the servicer more closely and plan to review all of the nearly 36,000 of the program's grant-to-loan conversions, but the agency has not systemically reviewed the cause of the errors. Federal internal control standards emphasize ongoing monitoring and absent a review, Education lacks reasonable assurance that it has taken steps to minimize future erroneous conversions. Education established a dispute process to address concerns about TEACH grants converted to loans in error; however, GAO found that Education and the servicer provide incomplete and inconsistent information to recipients about the availability of and criteria for disputing conversions. This is inconsistent with federal internal control standards that highlight effective external communication. Absent clear and complete information, recipients are unlikely to understand the dispute process. Education also has not established performance measures for the three programs nor used available data to systematically evaluate them. Managing for results includes setting meaningful performance goals and measuring progress toward them. Absent those, Education is unlikely to be able to use data to improve program administration and participant outcomes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that Education assess TEACH Grant participants' failure to meet grant requirements, examine why erroneous TEACH grant-to-loan conversions occurred, disseminate information on the TEACH grant-to-loan dispute process, and establish program performance measures.

Therefore, qualifying teachers must choose between a set  amount of forgiveness through the Stafford program after 5 years, or wait  and receive a potentially greater amount through PSLF after 10 years.  Loan repayment options can also affect the total amount of loan  forgiveness a teacher could receive across the programs. Stafford loan  borrowers are automatically placed in a standard 10-year repayment plan,  the same length of time needed to qualify for PSLF. Consequently, a  teacher who pays off the loan through the Standard plan would have  repaid the loan in full at the time he is eligible to receive PSLF. If,  however, borrowers choose a repayment plan that spreads the payments  over a longer period of time, they are likely to have a balance to be  forgiven through PSLF at 10 years, provided the borrower qualifies for  lower payments because of income and family size.", "Further, decisions about repayment plans and whether to participate in  Stafford loan forgiveness or PSLF, which have to be made soon after  graduation and throughout the life of the loan, can affect a teacher\u2019s total  payment toward the loan, according on our analysis of Education data.For example, a typical teacher at a low-income school with a master\u2019s  degree incurs about $41,500 in federal student loan debt, and would pay  about $57,300 in total loan payments under the default standard 10-year  repayment plan. However, the \u201ctypical teacher\u201d in our example could pay  more or less than $57,300 over the life of the loan depending on the  repayment plan and loan forgiveness option he chooses.

Students and teachers,  therefore, may not fully understand their options or the tradeoffs of  participating in one program over another.

The erroneous conversions were identified  when recipients contacted the current servicer or Education to dispute  their conversion, or when, after investigating specific errors related to  particular loans\u2014some of which were discovered when recipients  disputed their loan conversions\u2014the loan servicer performed system  queries to more systemically investigate these particular errors. The  overall scope of the problem is unknown. Our analysis of servicer data  shows that the majority of the erroneous conversions\u201456 percent\u2014 occurred because the servicer did not give the recipient 30 days from the  final notification to certify that the recipient was teaching or intended to  teach (see fig. 5). Rather, the servicer converted the grant to a loan within  the 30-day window when a recipient is permitted to respond. According to  the current servicer, recipients did not get the full 30 days to submit the  paperwork because of time required to process and mail the letter. The  servicer classified another 19 percent as erroneously converted because,  according to the servicer, a recipient did not understand the terms of the  grant and certification requirements\u2014including paperwork needed to  document teaching service\u2014or the servicer provided inaccurate, unclear,  confusing, or misleading explanations of program and certification  requirements to the recipient.", "As a result of the errors discovered to date, Education officials said they  plan to review accounts for all of the approximately 36,000 TEACH grant  recipients who had grants converted to loans by the current and previous  servicer since the program\u2019s inception. Education officials said the review  will include transferring the approximately 2,600 TEACH loans held by  other servicers to the current servicer, but according to officials,  discussions are ongoing and the agency has not yet established a time  frame for when the transfer or overall review will be completed. Federal  internal control standards call for establishing time frames as part of  ongoing monitoring and such time frames would allow Education and  others to assess Education\u2019s progress towards reviewing all recipient  accounts including those currently held by other servicers.", "The current servicer managing the program has also taken steps to  address servicer error moving forward. Specifically, the servicer reported  that it now conducts additional system checks and manually reviews all  accounts flagged for conversion to determine whether the required  certification forms were submitted by the recipient according to regulation.  Over the course of 1 month (May 2014), for example, this manual review  prevented erroneous conversions for 108 recipients. Education also  expanded the servicer\u2019s authority, so that it can reconvert loans to grants  in some circumstances without elevating a dispute to Education.  According to the servicer officials, this allowed the servicer to evaluate the  cases more efficiently and contributed to the number of loans reviewed  and reconverted to grants over the past year. According to Education  officials, the high number of recent reconversions from loans back to  grants is the result of addressing errors that occurred in the past under  the previous servicer, and officials do not expect this volume to continue.", "In October 2012\u2014about 4 years after the first TEACH grants were  awarded and before the new servicer began managing the program\u2014 Education initiated quarterly monitoring of a sample of grants to ensure  they had been appropriately converted to loans. Three of these four  quarterly monitoring reports in fiscal year 2013 did not include  observations of or issues with servicing error, although 541 of the 2,252  (24 percent) erroneous conversions discovered as of September 30, 2014  occurred with the previous servicer. Further, Education provided us with  incomplete documentation regarding how it provided oversight prior to  October 2012. For example, officials said they received quarterly briefings  from the previous servicer on the status of the TEACH Grant portfolio,  including information on grant and loan volume, but they could not locate  documentation for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. While agencies have  flexibility in how they oversee contractor performance, Office of  Management and Budget best practices for contract administration cite  the importance of documenting monitoring activities.", "Education officials said that in July 2013, they established a more formal  and comprehensive monitoring process when the new servicer began  managing the program, which includes monthly reports and weekly  meetings. According to officials, Education became aware of the errors  through this increased monitoring, including more detailed system checks  independently initiated by the current servicer. Further, while the current  servicer initiated the majority of the erroneous conversions, some of these  errors may have occurred as a result of inaccurate data provided by the  previous servicer. Officials with the current servicer stated that data  received from the previous servicer contained a large number of  anomalies that resulted in confusion and servicing issues when they  began servicing the contract. As a result, the current servicer said it  proposed a 60-day hold on grant-to-loan conversions (July 23, 2013,  through October 10, 2013) to allow the servicer to work with the data and  give recipients more time to submit required paperwork.", "To date, Education and the current servicer have identified, for each  corrected erroneous conversion, whether the error was caused by a data  issue or a communication issue with recipients. However, Education has  not assessed why the data or communication issues occurred or how the  errors went undetected by Education, nor has it outlined plans to do so.  Therefore, we are unable to assess whether the changes Education  made to its monitoring process are sufficient to address any systemic  problems. Further, federal internal control standards highlight the need for  ongoing monitoring and our body of work on performance measures  and evaluations has shown that successful organizations conduct  periodic or ad hoc program evaluations to examine how well a program is  working. These types of evaluations allow agencies to more closely  examine aspects of program operations, factors in the program  environment that may impede or contribute to its success, and the extent  to which the program is operating as intended.

However, while  the TEACH Grant and the loan forgiveness programs could be key drivers  in Education\u2019s efforts to increase teacher recruitment, a current lack of  program awareness among teachers and students may undermine the  agency\u2019s teacher recruitment goals. Without exploring and implementing  ways to increase awareness of these programs, Education is missing an  opportunity to widen the pool of prospective educators and reduce levels  of student debt that may drive teachers away from the profession. By  accepting a TEACH grant award, students make a significant service  commitment to teach in schools and subjects that have the greatest need  for qualified and dedicated teachers. In recognition of this commitment,  Education could take additional steps to ensure that the program is well- managed and give new teachers every opportunity to succeed. While  over 112,000 students have committed to teaching in America\u2019s neediest  schools by accepting a TEACH grant award, a significant portion are not  meeting the terms of the grant.

For the TEACH Grant program, we analyzed IPEDS  academic program completion data to obtain the number of students who  graduated or completed a potentially eligible program in participating  schools. Specifically, we matched the Office of Postsecondary Education  Identification number of schools that offered TEACH Grants during the  2013 though 2014 academic year to IPEDS completion data for the prior  year because this is the most recent IPEDS data available. We reviewed  the Classification of Instructional Programs codes\u2014which identifies  instructional program specialties within educational institutions\u2014in the  IPEDS Completion Data file for academic year 2012-2013. We identified  96 potentially eligible program types. Schools have discretion to choose  which programs are eligible to participate and the federal government,  states, and local educational agencies have discretion to designate high- needs subjects; therefore we identified programs that could be included in  teacher preparation programs such as general education and secondary  education and teaching. We also included those with a concentration in  math, science, special education, foreign language, bilingual education,  and reading specialists because those programs are specifically listed in  TEACH Grant statute as qualifying subjects. In developing our estimate,  we included those who graduated with qualifying bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s  degrees and those who completed post-baccalaureate certificate  programs since students graduating with these degree types are also  eligible to receive TEACH Grants. Our analysis of the TEACH Grant  eligible population is limited in a number of ways: (1) schools have  discretion on which students and grade levels are eligible to participate in  the program, therefore not all who graduated from eligible programs could  necessarily apply; (2) students who graduated may also have not reached  or maintained the 3.25 GPA often needed to participate. Further, we only  counted those who graduated from eligible programs, not those who were  enrolled in any given year. We focused on graduating seniors and  graduate students because, according to our focus groups and  interviews, some schools limit eligibility to juniors, seniors, and graduate  students.", "To estimate the population of teachers potentially eligible for the Stafford  Teacher Loan Forgiveness program, we reviewed program eligibility  requirements and analyzed SASS data to identify the number of full-time  teachers in public and private low-income schools during the 2011  through 2012 academic year; the most recent year of SASS data  available. Because this is a probability sample, estimates based on this  survey are subject to sampling error. Unless otherwise noted, percentage  estimates based on this survey have 95 percent confidence intervals  within +/- 5 percentage points of the estimate itself. We determined that  NSLDS, SASS, IPEDS, and TEACH Grant servicer data are sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report by testing it for accuracy and  completeness, reviewing documentation about systems used to produce  the data, and interviewing agency officials.", "To illustrate a typical teacher\u2019s loan repayment and forgiveness options  and the choices teachers must make to take advantage of the forgiveness  programs, we used data from Education\u2019s Baccalaureate and Beyond  Longitudinal Study (B&B) from the 2008 cohort to create a typical teacher  in terms of debt and salary with a master\u2019s degree teaching at a low- income school. The study included approximately 19,000 sample  members interviewed in 2009 and 2012. For the purposes of our analysis,  we focused on responses from the 2012 follow-up for those teachers  teaching at Title I schools who earned their master\u2019s degree because this  survey year includes the most recent debt and salary information  available. Because this is a probability sample, estimates based on this  survey are subject to sampling error. Unless otherwise noted, percentage  estimates based on this survey have 95 percent confidence intervals  within +/- 5 percentage points of the estimate itself. To determine the debt  amount for this typical teacher, we analyzed the cumulative total amount  borrowed in federal loans through 2012 assuming the teacher would  consolidate the federal loans they incurred. We assumed half of their debt  was incurred as an undergraduate and half pursing their master\u2019s degree.  Therefore, when we applied the general Stafford subsidized loan limits to  the overall debt amount ($23,000 for undergraduate and $65,500 for  graduate) the entire debt amount for the typical teacher in our scenario  was subsidized. Because the typical teacher in our example works at a  low-income school, we assumed the teacher would receive $5,000  forgiveness under the Stafford Loan Forgiveness Program. We  determined the salary amount for those teachers by examining the  average initial salary in 2012 and assumed a 5 percent salary growth rate  and a 3.3 percent growth of the poverty threshold to coincide with  assumptions made by Education as part of its repayment calculator. We  also used the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan thresholds for loans  made before July 1, 2014; for new loans made on or after July 1, 2014  new IBR thresholds apply. Under these new IBR thresholds, a teacher  with similar income and debt amounts could see larger benefits. We also  assumed a 6.8 percent interest rate because teachers responding to the  B&B survey would have undergraduate and graduate Direct Subsidized  Loans disbursed between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2012, when that  interest rate applied. Teachers could have had additional loans disbursed  before July 1, 2006, but for ease of reporting, we assumed a consistent  interest rate. We also assumed the teacher would not receive loan  forbearance. We assumed that the teacher was single and without  children (which affects the poverty threshold and the income based  amount due). After discussion with loan servicers, we assumed that even  after the teacher loan forgiveness was applied, the monthly amount due  did not change. This had the effect of shortening the term of the loan.  Finally, we applied the observed loan level and income data to the  various loan forgiveness programs to simulate what the total payments  would be under the different programs. To the extent possible, we  validated our results against the online repayment estimator provided on  Education\u2019s website. These simulations are intended for illustrative  purposes only, as they do not incorporate the experiences of individual  borrowers. For example, individual borrowers may experience periods of  unemployment (reducing income temporarily), or marry and form families  (changing the appropriate poverty threshold). We determined that B&B  data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report by testing it for  accuracy and completeness and reviewing documentation about systems  used to produce the data.", "To learn more about the challenges participants face, and the steps  Education has taken to resolve them, we analyzed customer complaint  data from Education\u2019s FSA Ombudsman.

This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95  percent of the samples we could have drawn. In this report we present  confidence intervals for estimates based on this sample along with the  estimate itself. Using content analysis, we developed categories to  characterize the types of assistance TEACH grant recipients and  borrowers requested or complaints they expressed about the programs.  An analyst then reviewed the requests and recorded each request by  category.

The Stafford Teacher Loan  Forgiveness program is administered by servicers contracted by  Education; therefore we did not ask school officials about challenges  administering the program. Four focus groups were with college  administrators whose institutions offered the TEACH Grant program to  their students while the remaining four were with college administrators  whose institutions did not offer the program. These sessions involved  structured small-group discussions designed to gain more in-depth  information about (1) the benefits and challenges associated with the  TEACH Grant and Perkins Loan Teacher Cancellation programs, (2)  outreach and guidance the institutions provided to students or others  about these programs, and (3) any guidance Education provided to these  administrators about the programs. We also asked about program  improvements and to what extent these programs succeed in recruiting  and retaining teachers in high-need subjects and low-income schools.", "Consistent with typical focus group methodologies, our design included  multiple groups with varying characteristics but shared one or two  homogenous characteristics. As the primary homogenous characteristic,  each focus group contained either representatives of colleges of  education or financial aid administrators. All but one of the focus groups  involved 6 to 10 participants while the remaining group had 5 participants.  By including college of education representatives and financial aid  administrators from institutions that do and do not offer TEACH grants,  we intended to gather a range of perspectives about how well these  programs are working or why institutions chose not to participate.", "To select focus group participants, we obtained membership lists from  professional associations of colleges of education and financial aid  administrators and invited representatives from 235 institutions of higher  education to participate. The primary selection criteria included whether  the institution offered TEACH grants, and, for those that did, the number  of students that received them. To obtain input from a wide variety of  institutions, we also considered the size of the school in terms of total  enrollment and whether the institution was public, private, or for-profit. As  all focus groups were conducted via teleconference, we were able to  include participants from across the United States.", "Focus group discussions were structured and guided by a moderator who  used a script with a standardized list of questions to encourage  participants to share their thoughts and experiences. During the sessions,  we informed participants that their names would not be used in the  published report. Each of the eight focus groups was recorded and  transcriptions were created, which served as the record for each group.  Using content analysis, we then evaluated these transcripts to develop  our findings. Our analysis was conducted in three steps. In the first step,  two analysts developed a set of themes and categories to track the  incidence of various responses during focus group sessions. In the  second step, each transcript was tagged by an analyst and recorded by  theme and category. In the third step, these tags were verified by a  second analyst and any discrepancies were resolved by both analysts  agreeing to the tagged theme and category.", "Methodologically, focus groups are intended to generate in-depth  information about the reasons for the focus group participants\u2019 attitudes  on specific topics and to offer insights into their concerns about and  support for an issue. Focus groups are not designed to (1) demonstrate  the extent of a problem or to generalize results to a larger population, (2)  develop a consensus to arrive at an agreed-upon plan or make decisions  about what actions to take, or (3) provide statistically representative  samples or reliable quantitative estimates. The projectability of the  information produced by our focus groups is limited for several reasons.  First, the information includes only the responses from college of  education and financial aid administrators from among the eight selected  groups. Second, while the composition of the groups was designed to  ensure a range of stakeholders from institutions of varying size and  geographic diversity, the groups were not randomly sampled. Third,  participants were asked questions about their experiences with the  programs, and other college of education representatives and financial  aid administrators not in the focus groups may have had other  experiences. Because of these limitations, we did not rely entirely on  focus groups, but rather used several different methods to corroborate  and support our findings and conclusions.", "In-depth interviews with individual schools. We supplemented  information obtained through focus groups with non-generalizable in- depth interviews with selected representatives of four institutions of higher  education that offered the TEACH Grant program. Specifically, we spoke  with representatives from each of the institutions\u2019 (1) college of education,  (2) financial aid office, and (3) bursar\u2019s office to obtain their perspectives,  particularly regarding the benefits and challenges of administering the  TEACH Grant program. Institutions were primarily chosen based on  whether they offered TEACH grants and, if so, the number of students  who received the grant and whether the school participated in the Perkins  loan program. Secondary selection criteria included whether the  institution was public, private, or for-profit. In advance of each interview,  we reviewed materials each selected institution made publicly available  via their websites including information on the TEACH Grant program.  During interviews, we discussed how these institutions administer and  conduct outreach on the TEACH Grant and Perkins cancellation  programs and the benefits and challenges associated with the programs.", "Students and recent graduates. To obtain the students\u2019 perspective  particularly around awareness of the TEACH Grant and the loan  forgiveness programs and their benefits and challenges participating in  them, we spoke with 23 students enrolled in or recently graduated from  teacher training programs at 21 institutions, 14 of whom had attended or  had graduated from institutions that offer TEACH grants. To select  participants, the National Education Association contacted students or  recent graduates on a list of state and national student leaders they  shared with us and requested that each participate in one of two  conference calls. Evidence gained through these group interviews is not  generalizable to all students.", "Higher education associations and teacher unions. To gain further  insights on teacher financial aid programs, we interviewed officials from  seven higher education associations and organizations, and the two  largest teacher unions on the benefits and challenges of these programs.  We selected higher education associations and organizations  representing a range of public and private degree granting institutions and  organizations that represent colleges of education and financial aid  administrators including: the American Association of Colleges for  Teacher Education; National Association of Student Financial Aid  Administrators; National Direct Student Loan Coalition; Student Aid  Alliance; American Association of State Colleges and Universities;  Coalition of State University Aid Administrators; and Coalition of Higher  Education Assistance Organizations. We also interviewed representatives  from the two largest national teacher unions: the National Education  Association and the American Federation of Teachers. While information  obtained from these interviews are not generalizable, they provide  valuable insights from college administrators, teachers, and other  stakeholders about these programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Janet Mascia, Assistant Director;  Rachel Beers, Analyst-in-Charge; Justin Dunleavy, and Robin Marion  made significant contributions to this report.
