While CMS has developed guidance for MACs and qualified entities, it has not developed equivalent guidance for researchers. Researchers must adhere to broad governmentwide standards, but are not given guidance on which specific controls to implement. According to CMS, the lack of specific guidance gives the researchers more flexibility to independently assess their security risks and determine which controls are appropriate to implement; however, without providing comprehensive, risk-based security guidance to researchers, CMS increases the risk that external entities possessing agency data may not have applied security controls that meet CMS standards.", "Additionally, CMS has established an oversight program for the security of MAC data, but has not established a corresponding program to oversee security implementation by researchers and qualified entities. Without effective oversight measures in place for researchers and qualified entities, CMS cannot fully ensure that the security of Medicare beneficiary data is being adequately protected. Regarding MACs, although they are subject to two types of independent annual assessments, which have regularly identified weaknesses in their implementation of security controls, the weaknesses that have been assessed as low-risk have not been consistently tracked in the CMS finding tracking system.

Of the six assessments that reported that MACs did not have a complete  and accurate listing of systems and devices supporting Medicare claims  processing, three classified this weakness as medium-risk and created a  plan of action and milestones, while the other three assessed a low-risk  level and did not create a plan of action and milestones. Similarly, eight  assessments reported that MACs either did not have malicious software  protections installed or they were not up-to-date. Of these eight, CMS  officials stated that three were classified as medium-risk and were tracked  by CMS, while the other five were assigned a low-risk level and not  tracked.", "The inventory and malicious software protection weaknesses that were  tracked inconsistently are related to categories of weaknesses that have  posed recurring challenges for the MACs in recent years. Since 2009,  both the MMA and FISMA assessments have reported incomplete  implementation of several types of high-risk security requirements across  all the MACs. The weaknesses identified during these assessments\u2014 which generally involved configuration management, system security  plans, and system inventories\u2014have yet to be fully resolved. Table 3  describes these key categories of weaknesses.", "According to CMS officials, weaknesses identified in the annual MMA  assessments may be ranked at different risk levels because the specific  circumstances of each finding can vary. However, documentation of the  specific weaknesses identified in the 2016 MMA assessment reports does  not make clear why findings that are characterized in similar terms or  have the same name may have been assigned different risk levels.", "CMS officials who oversee the information security testing at MACs  stated that they are aware of the recurring areas of weaknesses identified  in the annual assessments and have been taking actions to address  them. For example, in 2009, CMS began requiring MACs to submit  evidence that their configuration management programs complied with  CMS requirements. According to the officials, since this program has  been put into place, configuration management processes at the MACs  have become more consistent and more thoroughly documented.", "Nevertheless, the 2016 FISMA assessments concluded that a MAC\u2019s  system security plan did not include procedures for testing changes made  to their production environments, and the MAC was not tracking changes  made to the production environments. According to the CMS officials, the  fact that recurring issues such as these have not yet been fully resolved  may be due to the root causes of the deficiencies not yet being  addressed.", "Without more consistent tracking of identified issues through plans of  action and milestones, it may be difficult for CMS to fully determine the  extent to which security weaknesses identified during assessments of the  MACs are remediated. Weaknesses that appear to be low-risk may be  indicators of more significant underlying issues and, thus, may not be  receiving appropriate management attention or prompt remediation,  unnecessarily exposing Medicare beneficiary data to security risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Does Not Have Effective Oversight Processes and Procedures for Researchers and Qualified Entities", "paragraphs": ["While CMS has established assessment programs for MACs, the agency  has much more limited security oversight mechanisms in place to ensure  that qualified entities and researchers with access to Medicare beneficiary  data implement appropriate security controls. CMS oversight processes  and procedures for qualified entities and researchers consists primarily of  reviewing the data protections that researchers and qualified entities  describe in the data management plans they submit when requesting  access to Medicare beneficiary data.", "According to CMS officials who review these plans, they may ask follow- up questions to obtain more information or make recommendations on  how to better implement security safeguards in accordance with CMS  requirements. However, no further reviews are conducted for any  qualified entities or researchers. For example, CMS does not conduct on- site reviews of the implementation of security controls and does not  collect or review evidence of whether the controls have been  appropriately implemented. Further, it does not conduct or require any  independent testing of security controls.", "As an additional check for qualified entities, instead of assessing their  security controls, CMS assesses their responses to questions relating to  213 moderate-level data security controls from 26 control families set  forth in the ARS. However, once the initial document review has been  completed, CMS does not perform any in-person or document reviews of  security controls that are in place unless the qualified entity reports a  major change in its data security environment after initial approval.", "According to officials of the Office of Enterprise Data Analytics, which is  responsible for overseeing access to Medicare data by researchers and  qualified entities, CMS has, in the past, conducted remote and on-site  reviews as a pilot project. These reviews examined selected researchers\u2019  security controls, based on factors such as the use of data described in  the researchers\u2019 data management plans. According to these officials, the  pilot project is no longer being conducted because funding for the  program has stopped.", "The need to ensure that these entities have effectively implemented  information security controls is demonstrated by data breaches that these  organizations have reported. Of the 195 research entities that CMS has  data use agreements with, six have suffered data breaches involving the  loss of over 500 records containing PII covered under the Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which they  reported to the HHS Office of Civil Rights. These breaches included  Internet-based intrusions into researcher systems as well as other IT- related incidents.", "According to CMS officials who oversee access to Medicare data for  researchers and qualified entities, the data use agreement requires  organizations to report any breach of PII or personal health information  from the CMS data files to the agency. These officials also stated that the  six organizations did not report any breaches to CMS and that they were  unaware that the organizations had reported compromises. The officials  noted that if the breaches did not involve PII or personal health  information from CMS data files provided under a data use agreement,  the organizations were not required to report this information to CMS.  Further, these officials stated that the agency is currently revising its data  management plan to include a requirement for organizations to fully  disclose all breaches to the agency, which may impact whether or not to  grant access to Medicare data for organizations that were breached.", "Given that, in the past, researchers\u2019 systems have been successfully  attacked, effective implementation of security controls is critical to  reducing threats of compromise. However, without more robust oversight  processes and procedures, CMS cannot determine whether qualified  entities or researchers have implemented security controls appropriately  and, thus, cannot ensure that the risks associated with their use of  Medicare beneficiary data have been adequately mitigated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["CMS shares Medicare beneficiary data with external entities primarily for  processing Medicare claims, supporting medical research, and evaluating  the performance of Medicare service and equipment providers.

In addition, MACs and qualified entities  are given guidance that generally aligns with federal guidance and is  based on an assessment of risks specific to CMS to ensure that  appropriate controls have been included. However, CMS has not  provided guidance to researchers on how to select and implement  specific security controls. Until CMS provides more comprehensive, risk- based guidance on implementing security controls to all of its external  partners, there is an increased risk that researchers will not fully  implement appropriate protections for Medicare beneficiary data.", "CMS has developed and implemented an oversight program for the  MACs\u2019 implementation of security controls based on two types of annual  independent assessments, which together help ensure that sufficient  testing is being conducted each year.
