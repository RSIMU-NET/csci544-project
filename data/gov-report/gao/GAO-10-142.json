The Federal Protective Service (FPS) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for providing law enforcement and related security services for nearly 9,000 federal buildings under the control and custody of the General Services Administration (GSA). In 2004, GAO identified a set of key protection practices from the collective practices of federal agencies and the private sector that included: allocating resources using risk management, leveraging technology, and information sharing and coordination. As requested, GAO determined whether FPS's security efforts for GSA buildings reflected key practices. To meet this objective, GAO used its key practices as criteria, visited five sites to gain firsthand knowledge, analyzed pertinent DHS and GSA documents, and interviewed DHS, GSA, and tenant agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FPS's approach to securing GSA buildings reflects some aspects of key protection practices, and FPS has several improvements underway such as a new risk assessment program and a countermeasure acquisition program. While FPS's protection activities exhibit some aspects of the key practices, GAO found limitations in each of the areas. FPS assesses risk and recommends countermeasures to GSA and tenant agencies; however, FPS's ability to influence the allocation of resources using risk management is limited because resource allocation decisions are the responsibility of GSA and tenant agencies, which may be unwilling to fund FPS's countermeasure recommendations. Moreover, FPS uses an outdated risk assessment tool and a subjective, time-consuming process. As a result, GSA and tenant agencies are uncertain whether risks are being mitigated. Concerned with the quality and timeliness of FPS's risk assessment services, GSA and tenant agencies are pursuing some of these activities on their own. Although FPS is developing a new risk management program, full implementation is not planned until the end of fiscal year 2011 and has already experienced delays. With regard to leveraging technology, FPS inspectors have considerable latitude for selecting technologies and countermeasures that tenant agencies fund, but FPS provides inspectors with little training and guidance for making cost-effective choices. Additionally, FPS does not provide tenant agencies with an analysis of alternative technologies, their cost, and associated reduction in risk. As a result, there is limited assurance that the recommendations inspectors make are the best available alternatives and tenant agencies must make resource allocation decisions without key information. Although FPS is developing a program to standardize security equipment and contracting, the program has run behind schedule and lacks an evaluative component for assessing the cost-effectiveness of competing technologies and countermeasures. FPS has developed information sharing and coordination mechanisms with GSA and tenant agencies, but there is inconsistency in the type of information shared and the frequency of coordination. Lack of coordination through regular contact can lead to communication breakdowns. For example, during a construction project at one location, the surveillance equipment that FPS was responsible for maintaining was removed from the site during 2007. FPS and tenant agency representatives disagree over whether FPS was notified of this action. Furthermore, FPS and GSA disagree over what building risk assessment information can be shared. FPS maintains that the sensitive information contained in the assessments is not needed for GSA to carry out its mission. However, GSA maintains that restricted access to the risk assessments constrains its ability to protect buildings and occupants."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Concerns persist about the security of federal buildings, their occupants,  and visitors to these buildings.

Until 2003, FPS was a component of GSA\u2019s Public Buildings  Service (PBS), but the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred FPS to  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DHS placed FPS within  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Under the act, FPS  retained its law enforcement and related security functions for GSA  buildings and grounds, while GSA retained its powers, functions, and  authorities related to the operation, maintenance, and protection of GSA  buildings and grounds. To guide the transition, DHS and GSA developed a  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to set forth roles, responsibilities, and  operational relationships between FPS and GSA concerning the protection  of GSA buildings. Additionally, in 2006, GSA established a security division  within PBS to oversee its security operations and policies and liaise with  FPS.

In this report, we use these key practices to evaluate how FPS  protects GSA buildings. The key practices essentially form the foundation  of a comprehensive approach to building protection. ISC is using our key  facility protection practices to guide its priorities and work activities. We  focused on the following three key practices for this report:    Allocating resources using risk management. Identify threats, assess  vulnerabilities, and determine critical assets to protect and use  information on these and other elements to develop countermeasures  and prioritize the allocation of resources as conditions change.", "Leveraging technology. Select technologies to enhance asset security  through methods like access control, detection, and surveillance  systems. This involves not only using technology, but ensuring that  there are positive returns on investment in the form of reduced  vulnerabilities.", "Information sharing and coordination.

In doing our work, we reviewed pertinent  documents and policies from FPS and GSA, related laws and directives,  ISC\u2019s security standards, and prior and ongoing GAO work. We also  interviewed FPS and GSA officials at the national and regional levels, and  the ISC executive director. We selected five sites to illustrate how FPS  protects highly visible GSA buildings, basing our selection on factors that  included geographical diversity, occupancy, the building\u2019s security level,  and other potential security considerations, such as new or planned  construction. Selected sites included three multitenant level IV buildings,  one single-tenant level IV campus, and one single-tenant level III  campus.", "At these sites, we collected documentation and interviewed officials from  FPS, GSA, and tenant agencies. To supplement these site visits, we  interviewed FPS and GSA security officials from the four regions where  we had visited buildings. Because we observed FPS\u2019s efforts to protect  GSA buildings at a limited number of sites, our observations of security  issues at specific buildings cannot be generalized to all the buildings that  FPS is responsible for securing. We conducted this performance audit  from January 2008 to September 2009 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.

Under the act, FPS is authorized to  protect the buildings, grounds, and property that are under the control and  custody of GSA and the persons on the property. FPS is authorized to  enforce federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting GSA buildings  and persons on the property and to investigate offenses against these  buildings and persons. DHS and GSA developed an MOA to set forth roles,  responsibilities, and operational relationships between FPS and GSA  concerning the security of GSA buildings. In accordance with the MOA,  FPS inspectors are responsible for performing a range of law  enforcement and security duties at GSA buildings, including    patrolling the building perimeter,  responding to incidents and demonstrations,    completing risk assessments for buildings and space that GSA is    participating in meetings with GSA property managers and tenant    overseeing contract guard operations.", "The level of physical protection services FPS provides at each of the 9,000  GSA buildings varies depending on the building\u2019s security level. To  determine a building\u2019s security level, FPS uses the Department of Justice  (DOJ) vulnerability assessment guidelines, which categorize federal  buildings into security levels I through V based on factors such as building  size and number of employees. The DOJ standards recommend minimum  security measures for each of the five levels and FPS uses these standards  and other information to recommend countermeasures. The DOJ  standards also require FPS to complete BSAs every 2 to 4 years,  depending on the security level of the building. For example, a BSA is to  be completed every 2 years for a level IV building and every 4 years for a  level I building. As part of each assessment, the inspector is required to  conduct an on-site physical security analysis using FPS\u2019s risk assessment  tool, known as Federal Security Risk Manager, and interview tenant  agency security representatives, GSA realty specialists, site security  supervisors, and building managers. After completing their assessments,  inspectors make recommendations to GSA and tenant agencies for  building security countermeasures, including security equipment and  security fixtures. Tenant agencies decide whether to fund  countermeasures recommended for security equipment and FPS is  responsible for acquiring, installing, and maintaining approved equipment.  GSA and tenant agencies determine whether to fund recommended  security fixtures and GSA is responsible for acquiring, installing, and  maintaining approved fixtures. In some cases, and in accordance with its  policies, FPS has delegated the protection of buildings to tenant agencies,  which may have their own law enforcement authority or may contract  separately for guard services.", "FPS is a fully reimbursable agency\u2014that is, its services are fully funded by  security fees collected from tenant agencies. FPS charges each tenant  agency a basic security fee per square foot of space occupied in a GSA  building. In fiscal year 2009, the basic security fee is 66 cents per square  foot and covers services such as patrolling the building perimeter,  monitoring building perimeter alarms, dispatching law enforcement  officers through its control centers, conducting criminal investigations,  and performing BSAs. FPS also collects an administrative fee that it  charges tenant agencies for building-specific security services, such as  controlling access to building entrances and exits and checking employees  and visitors. In fiscal year 2009, the fee rate for building-specific expenses  is 8 percent. In addition to these security services, FPS provides tenant  agencies with additional services upon request, which are funded through  reimbursable security work authorizations (SWA) for which FPS charges  an administrative fee. For example, tenant agencies fund FPS\u2019s security  equipment countermeasure recommendations that they approve through  SWAs. In fiscal year 2009, the SWA fee rate is 8 percent.", "Since transferring to DHS, FPS\u2019s mission has expanded beyond solely  protecting GSA buildings to include homeland security activities, such as  implementing homeland security directives, and providing law  enforcement, security, and emergency response services during natural  disasters and special events. For example, FPS serves as the sector- specific agency for the Government Facilities critical infrastructure sector  under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7).", "Additionally, DHS has authority under the Homeland Security Act to  engage FPS in activities DHS deems necessary to enhance homelandsecurity. For example, FPS can be called upon to assist the Federal Emergency Management Agency in responding to natural disasters, a provide backup to other DHS law enforcement units during special events,  such as political demonstrations. According to FPS, it is reimbursed fo these supportive services.", "We have previously identified challenges that raised concerns about FPS\u2019s  protection of GSA buildings and tenants. In 2004, we reported on the  challenges FPS faced in transitioning from GSA to DHS, including issues  related to expanding responsibilities and funding. In June 2008, we  reported on a range of operational and funding challenges facing FPS. We  found that the operational challenges we identified hampered FPS\u2019s ability  to accomplish its mission of protecting GSA buildings and the actions it  took may not have fully resolved the challenges. For example, the number  of FPS staff decreased by about 20 percent between fiscal year 2004 and  fiscal year 2007. We found that FPS managed these decreases in staffing  resources in a way that diminished security and increased the risk of crime  and terrorist attacks at many GSA buildings. We further reported that the  actions FPS took to address its funding challenges had some adverse  implications. For example, during fiscal years 2005 and 2006, FPS\u2019s  projected expenses exceeded its collections, and DHS had to transfer  funds to make up the difference. We also found that although FPS had  developed output measures, it lacked outcome measures to assess the  effectiveness of its efforts to protect GSA buildings.

Furthermore, FPS\u2019s reliance on an  outdated risk assessment tool provides less assurance that risks and  mitigation strategies are adequately identified.", "We have previously reported on other concerns about FPS\u2019s risk  assessment tool. For example, the tool does not allow FPS to compare  risks from building to building so that FPS, GSA, and tenant agencies can  prioritize security improvements among the nearly 9,000 buildings within  GSA\u2019s inventory. The ability to compare risks among all buildings is  important because it could allow FPS, GSA, and tenant agencies to  comprehensively identify and prioritize risks and countermeasure  recommendations at a national level and direct resources toward  alleviating them. We also reported that the risk assessment tool does not  allow FPS to further refine security improvement priorities based on more  precise risk categories\u2014rather than the high, medium, or low categories  FPS inspectors use under the current system.

Murrah Federal Building and that FPS inherited a flawed tool  when it moved to DHS. GSA security officials expressed concerns over the  quality of FPS\u2019s BSAs. For example, GSA regional security officials told us  that an FPS inspector recommended that GSA remove a structure from a  building, because the inspector thought it blocked the view of the security  guards. However, according to these officials, FPS had not cited this  blocked view as a vulnerability or recommended the structure\u2019s removal in  previous BSAs, and to their knowledge, there had been no significant  changes in identified threats, the space, or the building\u2019s tenant  composition. GSA security officials also told us that they have had  difficulties receiving timely risk assessments from FPS for space that GSA  is considering leasing. These risk assessments must be completed before  GSA can take possession of the property and lease it to tenant agencies.  An inefficient risk assessment process for new lease projects can add  costs for GSA and create problems for both GSA and tenant agencies that  have been planning for a move. ICE officials told us that there are many  occasions where FPS is not notified by GSA of the need for a new lease  assessment and in some cases, tenants have moved into leased space  without FPS\u2019s knowledge.

GSA security officials said they have seen an increase  in the number of tenant agencies conducting their own risk assessments.  They told us that they are aware of at least nine tenant agencies that are  taking steps to acquire risk assessments for the exterior of their buildings.

We also reported that several DHS components  and other tenant agencies were taking steps to acquire their own risk  assessments because FPS\u2019s assessments were not always timely or  adequate. Similarly, we also found that many facilities had received  waivers from FPS to enable the agencies to complete their own risk  assessments. While tenant agencies have typically taken responsibility  for assessing risk and securing the interior of their buildings, assessing  exterior risks will require additional expertise and resources. This is an  inefficient approach considering that tenant agencies are paying FPS to  assess building security.

According to FPS, RAMP  will provide inspectors with the information needed to make more  informed and defensible recommendations for security countermeasures.  FPS also anticipates that RAMP will allow inspectors to obtain  information from one electronic source, generate reports automatically,  enable FPS to track selected countermeasures throughout their life cycle,  address some concerns about the subjectivity inherent in BSAs, and  reduce the amount of time inspectors and managers spend on  administrative work. Additionally, FPS is designing RAMP so that it will  produce risk assessments that are compliant with ISC standards,  compatible with the risk management framework set forth by the NIPP,  and consistent with the business processes outlined in the MOA with GSA.  FPS expects that the first phase of RAMP will include BSA and  countermeasure management tools, among other functions. According to  FPS, RAMP will support all components of the BSA process, including  gathering and reviewing building information; conducting and recording  interviews; assessing threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to develop  a detailed risk profile; recommending appropriate countermeasures; and  producing BSA reports.

In  June 2008, we reported that FPS was going to implement a pilot version of  RAMP in fiscal year 2009, but in May 2009, FPS officials told us they  intend to implement the first phase in the beginning of fiscal year 2010.", "FPS officials also told us that RAMP training for inspectors will begin in  October 2009 and conclude in December 2009. Until RAMP components  are fully implemented, FPS will continue to rely on its current risk  assessment tool, methodology, and process, potentially leaving GSA and  tenant agencies dissatisfied. GSA security officials are aware that RAMP\u2019s  development and implementation have run behind schedule and are  concerned about when improvements to FPS\u2019s risk assessment processes  will be made. Under the 2006 MOA, FPS and GSA recognized that revisions  and enhancements would need to be made to the risk assessment process,  and FPS agreed it would work in consultation with GSA on any  modifications to risk assessment tools. FPS shared RAMP plans with GSA  in 2007 and solicited feedback, yet GSA security officials told us they think  collaboration could have been stronger and have concerns about RAMP\u2019s  ability to meet their physical security needs. For example, as stated earlier,  GSA relies on FPS to provide it with risk assessments for buildings that it  wants to lease, but because FPS does not provide these assessments in a  timely manner GSA is taking steps to implement its own risk assessment  tool by the end of fiscal year 2009. According to FPS, RAMP will include a  risk assessment tool for new lease projects, but it did not include this  component in the first development phase and instead, this tool is  scheduled for rollout at the end of fiscal year 2010. FPS officials told us  that as they move forward with RAMP, they intend to ask GSA and tenant  agencies what risk assessment information they need from BSA reports.", "Also, FPS officials told us they are reassessing building security levels  using ISC\u2019s updated facility security level standards and a specialized  calculator tool. The updated ISC standards take factors other than a  building\u2019s size and population into account, including mission criticality,  symbolism, threats to tenant agencies, and other factors such as proximity  to a major transportation hub.

According to FPS, inspectors began  reassessing building security levels during June 2008 and as of May 2009,  FPS officials told us that inspectors had determined preliminary security  levels for all buildings, and finalized security levels for 3,100 buildings.", "FPS officials told us inspectors have been following ISC guidance in  reassessing the facility security levels which require that the tenant  agencies make the final security level determination. However, GSA  security officials at the national office told us they were receiving  feedback from GSA security officials in the regions that some FPS  inspectors were presenting the updated security levels as mandatory and  final, not as preliminary results to be discussed.", "Risk management practices provide the foundation of a comprehensive  protection program. Hence, efforts in the other key practice areas\u2014 leveraging technology and information sharing and coordination\u2014are  diminished if they are not part of a risk management approach which can  be the vehicle for using these tools. It is critical that FPS\u2014which is  responsible for assessing risk for nearly 9,000 GSA buildings and  properties that GSA may lease\u2014replace its outdated, subjective, and time- consuming risk assessment tool and approach with the new program it has  been developing since fiscal year 2007, especially as the results of its risk  analyses lay the foundation for FPS, GSA, and tenant agencies\u2019 security  efforts. DHS is the nation\u2019s designated leader of critical infrastructure  protection efforts; therefore, it is critical that RAMP be developed in an  expeditious manner so that DHS can fulfill this mission with regard to  federal facilities that FPS protects. Furthermore, department level  attention in ensuring that FPS achieves success through regular updates to  the Secretary is warranted. This added oversight would enhance the  department\u2019s ability to monitor RAMP development and make FPS  accountable for results, given the delays that RAMP has already  experienced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FPS Lacks a Systematic Approach for Leveraging Technology, but Is Developing a Technology Acquisition Program", "paragraphs": ["FPS\u2019s approach to leveraging technology does not ensure that the most  cost-effective technologies are being selected to protect GSA buildings.

However, the training, guidance, and standards that FPS provides to  inspectors for selecting technologies are limited. As a result, GSA and  tenant agencies have little assurance that the countermeasures inspectors  recommend are cost-effective and the best available alternative. We have  previously reported that by efficiently using cost-effective technology to  supplement and reinforce other security measures, agencies can more  effectively apply the appropriate countermeasures to vulnerabilities  identified through the risk management process, and that linking the  chosen technology to countermeasures identified as part of the risk  management process provides assurance that factors such as purpose,  cost, and expected performance have been addressed. Furthermore, we  have recognized that having a method that allows for cost-effectively  leveraging technology to supplement and reinforce other measures  represents an advanced application of the key practice.", "Through the BSA process, FPS recommends security fixtures to GSA, and  GSA has policies and procedures in place to guide its decisions about the  recommended investments and to identify and acquire cost-effective  fixtures through established contracts with vendors. FPS inspectors also  recommend technology-related security equipment through the BSA  process and acquire, install, and maintain the security equipment that  tenant agencies approve for purchase. FPS does not have a comprehensive  approach for identifying, acquiring, and assessing the cost-effectiveness of  the security equipment that its inspectors recommend. Instead, individual  FPS inspectors identify equipment for its purchase, installation, and  maintenance. FPS officials told us that inspectors make technology  decisions based on the initial training they receive, personal knowledge  and experience, and contacts with vendors. FPS inspectors receive some  training in identifying and recommending security technologies as part of  their initial FPS physical security training. Since FPS was transferred to  DHS in 2003, its refresher training program for inspectors has primarily  focused on law enforcement. Consequently, inspectors lack recurring  technology training. Supervisory officers and inspectors from two of the  five sites we visited told us that they learn about security technologies on  their own by reviewing industry publications and by attending trade shows  and security conferences but inspectors must have the time and funding to  attend. A supervisory officer from one FPS region told us the region has  sent some inspectors to security conferences sponsored by ASIS  International. Additionally, FPS does not provide inspectors with  specialized guidance and standards for cost-effectively selecting  technology. In the absence of specific guidance, inspectors follow the DOJ  minimum countermeasure standards and other relevant ISC standards  but these standards do not assist users in selecting cost-effective  technologies.", "FPS\u2019s devolution of responsibility for selecting technology to individual  inspectors, whose knowledge of existing and emerging technologies varies  because it is built on limited training and personal experience, results in  subjective equipment selection decisions. Additionally, the acquisition  process can be time-consuming for inspectors\u2014many of whom have other  law enforcement and security duties for multiple buildings\u2014because they  must search for equipment and vendors and facilitate the establishment of  installation and maintenance contracts. FPS\u2019s process for acquiring,  installing, and maintaining technologies provides GSA and tenant agencies  with little assurance that they are getting the highest-quality, most cost- effective technology security solutions and that common vulnerabilities  are being systematically mitigated across all buildings. For example, an  explosives detection dog was used at one location to screen mail that is  distributed elsewhere. In 2006, FPS had recommended, based on the  results of its risk analysis, the use of this dog and an X-ray machine,  although at the time of our visit only the dog was being used. Moreover,  the dog and handler work 12-hour shifts Monday through Friday when  most mail is delivered and shipped, and the dog needs a break every 7  minutes. The GSA regional security officials we spoke with questioned  whether this approach was more effective and efficient than using an on- site enhanced X-ray machine that could detect biological and chemical  agents as well as explosives and could be used anytime. In accordance  with its policies, FPS conducted a BSA of the site in 2008 and determined  that using an enhanced X-ray machine and an explosives detection dog  would bring the projected threat rating of the site down from moderate to  low. FPS included estimated one-time installation and recurring costs in  the BSA and executive summary, but did not include the estimated cost  and risk of the following mail screening options: (1) usage of the dog and  the additional countermeasure; (2) usage of the additional countermeasure  only; and (3) usage of the dog only. Consequently, tenant agency  representatives would have to investigate the cost and risk implications of  these options on their own to make an informed resource allocation  decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FPS Is Developing a Program to Standardize Equipment and Contracting", "paragraphs": ["FPS is taking steps to implement a more systematic approach to  technology acquisition by developing a National Countermeasures  Program, which could help FPS leverage technology more cost-effectively.  According to FPS, the program will establish standards and national  procurement contracts for security equipment, including X-ray machines,  magnetometers, surveillance systems, and intrusion detection systems.  FPS officials told us that instead of having inspectors search for vendors  to establish equipment acquisition, installation, and maintenance  contracts, inspectors will call an FPS mission support center with their  countermeasure recommendations, and the center will procure the  services through standardized contracts. According to FPS, the program  will also include life-cycle management plans for countermeasures. FPS  officials explained that the National Countermeasures Program establishes  contractual relationships through GSA Schedule 84 to eliminate the need  for individual contracting actions when requirements for new equipment  or services are identified. FPS officials told us they worked closely with  GSA\u2019s Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) to develop the program and FAS  officials concurred stating, for example, that the two agencies have  collaborated to ensure that GSA Schedule 84 has a sufficient number of  vendors to support FPS requirements for physical security services. FPS  officials said they established an X-ray machine contract through the  schedule and that future program contracts will also explore the use of the  schedule as a source for national purchase and service contracts.  According to FPS, the National Countermeasures Program should provide  the agency with a framework to better manage its security equipment  inventory; meet its operational requirement to identify, implement, and  maintain security equipment; and respond to stakeholders\u2019 needs by  establishing nationwide resources, streamlining procurement procedures,  and strengthening communications with its customers. FPS officials told  us they believe this program will result in increased efficiencies because  inspectors will not have to spend their time facilitating the establishment  of contracts for security equipment because these contracts will be  standardized nationwide. Additionally, FPS officials told us that they  participate in the research and development of new technologies with  DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate.", "Although the National Countermeasures Program includes improvements  that may enhance FPS\u2019s ability to leverage technology, it does not  establish tools for assessing the cost-effectiveness of competing  technologies and countermeasures and implementation has been delayed.  Security professionals are faced with a multitude of technology options  offered by private vendors, including advanced intrusion detection  systems, biotechnology options for screening people, and sophisticated  video monitoring. Having tools and guidance to determine which  technologies most cost-effectively address identified vulnerabilities is a  central component of the leveraging technology key practice. FPS officials  told us that the National Countermeasures Program will enable inspectors  to develop countermeasure cost estimates that can be shared with GSA  and tenant agencies. However, incorporating a tool for evaluating the cost- effectiveness of alternative technologies into FPS\u2019s planned improvements  in the security acquisition area would represent an enhanced application  of this key practice. Another concern is that FPS had planned to  implement the program throughout fiscal year 2009, but extended  implementation into fiscal year 2010 and thus it is not clear whether FPS  will meet the program\u2019s milestones in accordance with updated timelines.  For example, FPS had anticipated that the X-ray machine and  magnetometer contracts would be awarded by December 2008, and that  contracts for surveillance and intrusion detection systems would be  awarded during fiscal year 2009. In May 2009, FPS officials told us that the  X-ray machine contract was awarded on April 30, 2009, and that they  anticipated awarding the magnetometer contract in the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 2009 and an electronic security services contract for  surveillance and intrusion detection systems during the second quarter of  fiscal year 2010. FPS had planned to test the program in one region before  implementing it nationwide, but after further consideration, FPS  management decided to forgo piloting the program in favor of rolling it out  nationally. Until the National Countermeasures Program is fully  implemented, FPS will continue to rely on individual inspectors to make  technology decisions.

However, in May 2009, FPS officials told us they do  not have an estimated date for finalizing the MOA and GSA officials told us  they do not anticipate reaching an agreement until fiscal year 2010. FPS  and GSA recognize that the renegotiation can serve as an opportunity to  discuss service concerns and develop mutual solutions. While FPS and  GSA concur that the MOA should be used as an accountability tool, FPS  thinks the document should offer general guidelines on the services it  provides, but GSA wants a more prescriptive agreement.", "Overall, FPS and GSA regional officials told us that FPS shares some  information with GSA and that collaboration between the two agencies  has improved. However, the agencies\u2019 satisfaction with this situation  differs. The FPS regional officials we spoke with said the agencies\u2019  information sharing and coordination procedures work well, while GSA  regional security officials told us that communication should be more  frequent and the quality of the information shared needs to be improved.", "Moreover, according to the GSA officials, FPS\u2019s sporadic and restricted  sharing of threat information limits GSA\u2019s ability to protect its properties.  We have reported that by having a process in place to obtain and share  information on potential threats to federal buildings, agencies can better  understand the risks they face and more effectively determine what  preventive measures should be implemented. Additionally, we have  reported that sharing terrorism-related information that is critical to  homeland security protection is important, and agencies need to develop  mechanisms that support this type of information sharing. The 2006 MOA  between DHS and GSA requires FPS to provide GSA with quarterly  briefings at the regional level. However, GSA regional security officials  told us that they were not receiving related threat information as part of  these updates until October 2008, when the FPS Director\u2014in response to  feedback from GSA\u2014instructed regional personnel to share threat  information. The FPS Director advised Regional Directors to meet  quarterly with their respective GSA regional administrators, regional  commissioners, or security representatives to discuss and share  information on regional security issues. The Director further stated that  briefings should include unclassified intelligence information concerning  threats against GSA buildings and updates to the regional threat  assessment, as well as information and analysis on protecting the regions\u2019  most vulnerable facilities. Moreover, in its strategic plan, FPS recognizes  the importance of ensuring that policies and procedures are being  established and followed consistently across the country, and asserts that  effective communication between headquarters and regional personnel at  all levels will aid in this effort. GSA officials also told us that they are  taking steps to replicate headquarters structures in their regions to ensure  consistent applications of policies and to standardize communication  practices.", "While FPS\u2019s action to share threat information is a positive step, GSA  security officials at the national office told us they received feedback from  security staff in the regions that threat briefings were not uniform across  regions and varied in their usefulness. The majority of the briefings, the  officials said, communicated information about crime incidents and did  not, in their view, provide threat information. In May 2009, FPS officials  told us that regions gave briefings during the second quarter of fiscal year  2009, but GSA security officials told us that some regions reported that  they had not received these second quarter briefings. To improve  information sharing and coordination at the regional level, FPS  standardized its quarterly threat briefing format. FPS officials told us that  they partnered with GSA to create a sensitive but unclassified (SBU)  facility-specific companion document to the BSA called the \u201cFacility  Security Assessment Threat Summary.\u201d According to FPS, this quarterly  threat briefing will contain facility-specific information on security  performance measures, criminal activity, unclassified intelligence  regarding threats, significant events, special FPS law enforcement  operations, and potential threats, demonstrations, and other events. FPS  officials told us that this quarterly threat briefing format is a positive step  in providing a briefing document that GSA can use in evaluating threat  information that is germane to its property portfolio. FPS officials told us  that they finalized the briefing format and that the Director signed the  General Services Administration Threat Briefing Policy directive in June  2009. In contrast, in June 2009, GSA security officials told us that they  believe they had little involvement in developing FPS\u2019s threat briefing  format explaining that although FPS asked GSA to comment on its  proposed format\u2014which, according to GSA, it did in March 2009\u2014FPS  had not discussed GSA\u2019s comments with them or updated GSA on the  content or status of the format.

Depending on the building\u2019s security level, the BSA may occur every  2 to 4 years. Apart from these briefings, FPS, GSA, and tenant agencies  choose how frequently they will all meet. An information sharing best  practice that we have reported on is holding regularly scheduled meetings  during which participants can, for example, share security management  practices, discuss emerging technologies, and create committees to  perform specific tasks, such as policy setting. It is critical that FPS, as the  provider of law enforcement and related security services for GSA  buildings, and GSA, as the manager of these properties, have well- established lines of communication with each other and with tenant  agencies to ensure that all parties are aware of the ever-changing risks in a  dynamic threat environment and that FPS and GSA are taking appropriate  actions to reduce vulnerabilities.

One of  the tenants recounted an incident in which a security guard directed  the visitor to walk through the garage to an appropriate screening  station. According to the GSA property manager, this action created a  safety hazard. The GSA property manager knew the appropriate  screening procedure, but told us there was no written policy on the  procedure that members could access. Additionally, BSC members told  us that the committee met as needed.", "At one location, FPS had received inaccurate square footage data from  GSA and had therefore overcharged the primary tenant agency for a  guard post that protected space shared by all the tenants. According to  the GSA property manager, once GSA was made aware of the problem,  the agency obtained updated information and worked with the tenant  agencies to develop a cost-sharing plan for the guard post, which made  the primary tenant agency\u2019s security expenses somewhat more  equitable. BSC members told us that the committee met regularly.", "At one location, members of a BSC told us that they met as needed,  although even when they hold meetings, one of the main tenant  agencies typically does not participate. GSA officials commented that  this tenant adheres to its agency\u2019s building security protocols and does  not necessarily follow GSA\u2019s tenant policies and procedures which  GSA thinks creates security risks for the entire building.", "At one location, tenant agency representatives and officials from FPS  told us they met regularly, but GSA officials told us they were not  invited to these meetings. GSA officials at this location told us that they  invite FPS to their property management meetings for that location, but  FPS does not attend. GSA officials also said they do not receive timely  incident information for the site from FPS and suggested that increased  communication among the agencies would help them be more effective  managers of their properties and provide tenants with better customer  service.", "At one location, GSA undertook a major renovation project beginning  in April 2007. FPS, GSA, and tenant agency representatives did not all  meet together regularly to make security preparations or manage  security operations during construction. FPS officials told us they had  not been invited to project meetings, although GSA officials told us that  they had invited FPS and that FPS attended some meetings. In May  2008, FPS discovered that specific surveillance equipment had been  removed. As of May 2009, FPS officials told us they did not know who  had removed the equipment and were working with tenant agency  representatives to recover it. However in June 2009, tenant agency  representatives told us that they believed FPS was fully aware that the  equipment had been removed in December 2007.", "To improve information sharing and coordination at the building level,  FPS and GSA plan to implement ISC\u2019s facility security committee  standards at all multitenant and single-tenant buildings and campuses after  ISC issues them. FPS and GSA could leverage these standards to establish  consistent communications and designate the roles and responsibilities of  FPS, GSA, and tenant agencies. FPS and GSA have had representation on  the ISC working group that is developing the standards.  ISC intends to  issue the standards in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, but it is unclear  when FPS and GSA will implement them.", "GSA security officials also told us that FPS does not consistently or  comprehensively inform GSA of changes to services or provide GSA with  contingency plans when FPS deploys inspectors and other personnel to  provide law enforcement, security, and emergency response services for  special events in support of broader homeland security goals. For  example, GSA security officials cited some instances in which FPS  reduced its services during the 2009 Presidential Inauguration. They noted,  for example, that FPS inspectors did not attend BSC meetings and said  that FPS did not inform GSA of all service changes. FPS\u2019s response to  special events and critical incidents is governed by the FPS Interim  Critical Incident Response Plan issued by the Director in September  2007. This plan does not include procedures for notifying GSA and tenant  agencies of expected service changes, restrictions, and modifications  at  the national, regional, and building levels. FPS officials told us that FPS  notified tenant agencies in the National Capital Region of expected servi changes, restrictions, and modifications during the 2009 inauguration.  Officials also said that, when possible, inspectors personally contacted GSA building managers and tenant agency representatives in the region. However, FPS personnel were deployed from all regions in accordance  with the critical incident response plan and FPS officials did not tell us  that regions other than the National Capital Region were notified.

However, GSA officials at all levels ci limitations with the BSA executive summary saying, for example, that it  does not contain enough contextual information on threats and  vulnerabilities to support FPS\u2019s countermeasure recommendatio justify the expenses that GSA and tenant agencies would incur by  installing additional countermeasures. Moreover, GSA security officials  told us that FPS does not consistently share BSA executive summaries  across all regions. Instead, GSA wants to receive BSAs in their entirety s that it can better protect its buildings and the tenants who occupy them.

However, GSA security officials told us that the process  for requesting BSAs is informal and that FPS has not been responsive to  these requests overall. Furthermore, considering there are nearly 9,000  buildings in GSA\u2019s inventory, this may be an inefficient approach to obtain  key facility protection information. We have found that information  sharing and coordination are important at the individual building level and  that protecting federal buildings requires building security managers to  told us  involve multiple organizations to effectively coordinate and share  information to prevent, detect, and respond to terrorist attacks.", "According to GSA, building protection functions are an integral part of its  property preservation, operation, and management responsibilities. In  2000, when FPS was still a part of GSA, Congress considered removing  FPS from PBS. At that time, GSA opposed such action asserting that it  would divorce security from other federal building functions when  security considerations needed to be integrated into decisions about the  location, design, and operation of federal buildings. GSA was concerned  that separating FPS from PBS would create an organizational barrier  between protection experts and PBS asset managers, planners, project  managers, and building managers who set PBS budgets and policies for  the GSA inventory as a whole and oversaw day-to-day operations in GSA  buildings. However, Congress did not remove FPS from PBS, and FPS  remained within GSA and PBS until it was transferred to DHS and ICE  under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Prior to the creation of DHS, we  expressed concern about separating security from other real property  portfolio functions, such as site location, design, and construction for new  federal buildings, because decisions on these factors have implications for  what types of security will be necessary and effective. We concluded that  if DHS was given the responsibility for securing GSA facilities, the role of  integrating security with other real property functions would be an  important consideration, especially since GSA would still be the caretaker  of these buildings.", "Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, FPS was transferred to DHS  and retained responsibilities for law enforcement and related security  functions for GSA buildings and grounds. However, except for law  enforcement and related security functions transferred to DHS, under the  act, GSA retained all powers, functions, and authorities in law, related to  the operation, maintenance, and protection of its buildings and grounds.  As a result of the act, GSA and DHS both have protection responsibilities  for GSA-controlled buildings and grounds. DHS and GSA developed an  MOA to address roles, responsibilities, and operational relationships  between FPS and GSA concerning the security of GSA-controlled space.  Through this agreement, DHS and GSA determined that FPS would  continue to conduct BSAs for GSA. GSA security officials told us that GSA  staff at the national, regional, and building levels need the information  contained in the BSA to cost-effectively manage their buildings to ensure  that they are secure and that their customers, or tenant agencies, are  adequately protected. Because GSA personnel do not receive the entire  BSA, they must decide on the basis of incomplete information how to use  funds to implement countermeasures and mitigate vulnerabilities.  Furthermore, GSA property managers are responsible for coordinating and  maintaining emergency management plans, such as evacuation and  continuity of operations plans, and when a safety or security incident  arises at a GSA building, GSA assumes a lead role in the incident  command. Without complete risk information, GSA is challenged to  maintain appropriate situational awareness and preparedness to protect  buildings, especially during emergencies.", "Although the Director of FPS recognizes that FPS and GSA have common  interests in protecting GSA buildings and the federal employees who work  in them, the Director has determined that GSA does not meet the  standards under which FPS shares BSAs and maintains that BSA executive  summaries provide GSA with sufficient information. FPS designates the  SBU information contained in BSAs as \u201claw enforcement sensitive\u201d (LES)  in accordance with DHS and ICE policies. FPS considers the BSA to be an  LES document because it incorporates all aspects of a location\u2019s physical  security into one document whose release outside of the law enforcement  arena could adversely impact the conduct of law enforcement programs.  According to FPS, the BSA can include LES information such as:  information, details, or criminal intelligence data indicating why a  threat is deemed credible;  information and details relating to any ongoing criminal investigations,  law enforcement operations, or both; and    detailed analysis of why the lack or inadequacy of a countermeasure  creates an exploitable vulnerability.", "According to FPS, LES information is safeguarded and determinations to  disseminate LES information are made in accordance with a DHS  information safeguarding management directive and an ICE directive for  safeguarding LES information. FPS maintains that GSA does not need to  know the LES information that is contained in the BSA and that if the BSA  is released to GSA, the risk of unscrupulous or criminal use of the  information would increase significantly. According to FPS, the  information contained in the BSA is not critical to GSA\u2019s performance of  its authorized, assigned mission. FPS further maintains that GSA retains  no legal responsibility for the physical protection and law enforcement  operations within GSA buildings because the Homeland Security Act of  2002 transferred FPS\u2019s law enforcement and related security functions  from GSA to DHS and that under the act it is responsible for protecting the  buildings, grounds, and property under GSA\u2019s control or custody.", "We have reported on the importance of sharing terrorism-related  information that is critical to homeland security protection and have  identified a need for agencies to develop mechanisms that support this  information sharing. Other federal agencies have found ways to share  sensitive information with other entities. For example, in response to a  GAO recommendation, the Transportation Security Administration  established regulations that allow for sharing sensitive security  information with persons covered by the regulations who have a need to  know, including airport and aircraft operators, foreign vessel owners, and  Transportation Security Administration employees. The ICE directive for  safeguarding LES information states that an information sharing and  access agreement in the form of a memorandum of understanding or  agreement may formalize LES information exchanges between DHS and  an external entity. Moreover, according to standard language in FPS\u2019s  BSAs, a security clearance is not required for access to LES information; a  criminal history check and a national fingerprint check\u2014performed in  accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12)  investigative requirements\u2014is required. According to GSA, it follows these  requirements. Moreover, GSA has an information safeguarding policy in  place to protect SBU building information which can include:  the location and details of secure functions or space in a building such  as secure routes for prisoners and judges inside courthouses;  the location and details of secure functions or secure space such as  security and fire alarm systems;  the location and type of structural framing for the building including  any information regarding structural analysis, such as counterterrorism  methods used to protect the building and occupants; and  risk assessments and information regarding security systems or  strategies of any kind.", "In the 2006 MOA, FPS and GSA agreed that shared SBU information would  be handled in accordance with each agency\u2019s information safeguarding  policies. Furthermore, one of FPS\u2019s strategic goals is to foster  relationships to increase the proactive sharing of information and  intelligence. In its strategic plan, FPS states that it will use efficient  information sharing and information protection processes based on  mutually beneficial, trusted relationships to ensure the implementation of  effective, coordinated, and integrated infrastructure protection programs  and activities.", "When we spoke with FPS and GSA officials in 2008, they thought the MOA  renegotiation could serve as a platform for determining what BSA  information should be shared. However, when we spoke with FPS and  GSA officials in 2009, they did not know when the MOA would be  renegotiated and FPS determined it would not change BSA sharing  procedures during the renegotiation. Therefore, GSA will continue to  receive BSA executive summaries and the individual BSAs that FPS  approves for sharing, but it will not have access to other BSA information  that it could use to make risk-based decisions to protect its buildings, the  federal employees who work in them, and visitors to these buildings.", "In a post-September 11 era, it is crucial that federal agencies work  together to share information to advance homeland security and critical  infrastructure protection efforts. Information is a crucial tool in fighting  terrorism, and the timely dissemination of that information to the  appropriate government agency is absolutely critical to maintaining the  security of our nation. The ability to share security-related information can  unify the efforts of federal agencies in preventing or minimizing terrorist  attacks. However, in the absence of comprehensive information-sharing  plans, many aspects of homeland security information sharing can be  ineffective and fragmented. In 2005, we designated information sharing for  homeland security as a governmentwide high-risk area because of the  significant challenges faced in this area\u2014challenges that are still evident  today. It is critical that FPS and GSA\u2014which both have protection  functions for GSA buildings, their occupants, and those who visit them\u2014 reach consensus on sharing information in a timely manner to support  homeland security and critical infrastructure protection efforts.

For these situations, having  an interoperable communication system is desirable. However, first  responders continue to use various, and at times incompatible,  communications technologies, making it difficult to communicate with  neighboring jurisdictions or other first responders to carry out the  response. We noted during our review that FPS radios lack  interoperability, meaning they are unable to communicate with the  equipment used by other law enforcement agencies\u2014federal, state, and  local.

The key practices we examined vis-\u00e0-vis FPS\u2014 allocating resources using risk management, leveraging technology, and  information sharing and coordination\u2014are critical components to an  effective and efficient physical security program. However, FPS\u2019s  application of these practices had limitations and as a result, there is a  lack of assurance that federal buildings under the control and custody of  GSA, the employees who work in them, and visitors to them are being  adequately protected. Related to allocating resources using risk  management, FPS\u2019s assessment of risks at buildings is a critical  responsibility considering the results lay the foundation by which GSA and  tenants make resource allocation decisions. However, FPS\u2019s current risk  assessment process is inadequate and its efforts to improve it through the  development of RAMP have been delayed. Related to leveraging  technology, planned improvements to the way inspectors acquire security  equipment through the National Countermeasures Program have also  experienced delays and knowing the cost implications of different  alternatives is the foundation of this key practice, although FPS is not  directly addressing this critical element. Continued delays in the  implementation of improvements in these critical areas\u2014risk management  and leveraging technology\u2014are of concern and deserving of greater  attention by DHS management. Furthermore, related to information  sharing and coordination, FPS\u2019s communications with GSA and tenants  could benefit from more clearly defined parameters for consistency,  frequency, and content, and issues related to interoperability with other  law enforcement agencies surfaced as a concern that FPS is trying to  address.

Provide the Secretary with regular updates, on a mutually agreed-to  schedule, on the status of RAMP and the National Countermeasures  Program, including the implementation status of deliverables, clear  timelines for completion of tasks and milestones, and plans for  addressing any implementation obstacles.  2.  In conjunction with the National Countermeasures Program, develop a  methodology and guidance for assessing and comparing the cost- effectiveness of technology alternatives. 3.  Reach consensus with GSA on what information contained in the BSA  is needed for GSA to fulfill its responsibilities related to the protection  of federal buildings and occupants, and accordingly, establish internal  controls to ensure that shared information is adequately safeguarded;  guidance for employees to use in deciding what information to protect  with SBU designations; provisions for training on making designations,  controlling, and sharing such information with GSA and other entities;  and a review process to evaluate how well this information sharing  process is working, with results reported to the Secretary regularly on  a mutually agreed-to schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the sensitive but unclassified report to DHS and  GSA for review and comment.

Furthermore, DHS stated that FPS will continue to work with key  stakeholders to address other security issues that were cited in our report,  for which specific recommendations were not made. With respect to the  first recommendation\u2014to provide the Secretary of Homeland Security  with regular updates on the status of RAMP and the National  Countermeasures Program\u2014DHS stated that FPS will submit a  consolidated monthly report to the Secretary.", "Although DHS agreed with our second and third recommendations, we are  concerned that the steps it described are not comprehensive enough to  address the intent of the recommendations. For the second  recommendation\u2014to develop a methodology and guidance for assessing  and comparing the cost-effectiveness of technology alternatives\u2014DHS  commented that such efforts will be a part of FPS\u2019s development of RAMP  and that future phases of RAMP will include the ability to evaluate  countermeasure alternatives based on cost and the ability to mitigate  identified risks. However, RAMP has experienced delays and it is unclear  when this future component of RAMP will be developed and implemented.  Moreover, as we reported, FPS inspectors have considerable latitude in  determining which technologies and other countermeasures to  recommend, but receive little guidance to help them assess the cost- effectiveness of these technologies. Until the cost-analysis component of  RAMP is implemented, it will be important for inspectors to have guidance  they can use to make cost-effective countermeasure recommendations so  that GSA and tenant agencies can be assured that their investments in  FPS-recommended technologies and other countermeasures are cost- effective, consistent across buildings, and the best available alternatives.", "Regarding the third recommendation\u2014to reach consensus with GSA on  what information contained in the BSA is needed for GSA to fulfill its  protection responsibilities and to establish information sharing and  safeguarding procedures\u2014DHS responded that FPS is developing a facility  security assessment template as a part of RAMP to produce reports that  can be shared with GSA and other agencies. However, DHS did not  explicitly commit to reaching consensus with GSA in identifying building  security information that can be shared, or to the steps we outlined in our  recommendation\u2014steps that in our view comprise a comprehensive plan  for sharing and safeguarding sensitive information. As we reported, FPS  and GSA fundamentally disagree over what BSA information should be  shared and FPS has decided not to discuss this matter with GSA as part of  the MOA renegotiation. Furthermore, RAMP continues to experience  delays and it is unclear when it will produce facility security assessments  than can be shared with GSA. Therefore, it is important that FPS engage  GSA in identifying what building security information can be shared and  follow the information sharing and safeguarding steps we included in our  recommendation to ensure that GSA acquires the information it needs to  protect the 9,000 buildings under its control and custody, the federal  employees who work in them, and those who visit them.", "GSA agreed with our findings concerning the challenges that FPS faces in  delivering security services for GSA buildings.

Through previous work, we identified a  set of key practices from the collective practices of federal agencies and  private sector entities that can provide a framework for guiding agencies\u2019  protection efforts and addressing challenges. These key practices form  the foundation of a comprehensive approach to building protection. We  used our key facility protection practices as criteria to evaluate the steps  that FPS has taken. We used the following key practices as criteria:  allocating resources using risk management; leveraging technology; and  information sharing and coordination. For the purposes of this review, we  did not consider three other key practices for varying reasons:  performance measurement and testing, because we reported on the  limitations FPS faces in assessing its performance in 2008; aligning assets  to mission, because GSA, not FPS, controls the asset inventory; and  strategic management of human capital, because we are currently  reviewing FPS\u2019s management of human capital.", "To examine FPS\u2019s application of key practices at the building level, we  selected five sites, basing our selection on factors that included  geographical diversity, high occupancy, the building\u2019s designated security  level, other potential security considerations such as new or planned  building construction, and recent and ongoing work. Selected sites  included three multitenant level IV buildings, one single-tenant level IV  campus, and one single-tenant level III campus.", "Collectively, the sites we selected illustrate the range of building  protection practices applied by FPS. At each site, we interviewed FPS,  GSA, and tenant agency officials with primary responsibility for security  implementation, operation, and management. We toured each site and  observed the physical environment, the buildings, and the principal  security elements to gain firsthand knowledge of the building protection  practices. We collected documents, when available, that contained site- specific information on security risks, threats, budgets, and staffing for  analysis. Because we observed FPS\u2019s efforts to protect GSA buildings at a  limited number of sites, our observations cannot be generalized to all the  buildings that FPS is responsible for securing. To supplement these site  visits, we interviewed FPS and GSA security officials from the four regions  where we had visited buildings\u2014regions 2, 4, 7, and 11. We also  interviewed FPS and GSA security officials at the national level and  collected supporting documentation on security plans, policies,  procedures, budgets, and staffing for analysis. For example, we reviewed  the 2006 Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) and GSA that sets forth the security  responsibilities of FPS and GSA at federal buildings. We also interviewed  the executive director of the Interagency Security Committee (ISC), and  we analyzed ISC\u2019s Facility Security Level Determinations for Federal  Facilities, Security Design Criteria for new Federal Office Buildings  and Major Modernization Projects, and Security Standards for Leased  Space.
