In addition, the Navy encompasses Marine Corps operations, which in fiscal year 1994, had about $9 billion in gross budget authority, or about 11 percent, of the Navy\u2019s gross budget authority that year. The Navy also operates certain Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) activities, which in fiscal year 1994 had $24 billion in reported revenue and were larger than both the Air Force\u2019s or the Army\u2019s DBOF activities.", "DOD, and especially the Navy, have acknowledged serious and long-standing financial management and reporting problems. Because of these problems, in February 1995, GAO designated DOD\u2019s financial management as a high-risk area especially vulnerable to waste, fraud, and mismanagement.", "Several organizations are integrally involved in carrying out the Navy\u2019s financial management and reporting: (1) the Office of the Navy\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Financial Management and Comptroller, which has overall financial responsibility, (2) DFAS, which reports to the DOD Comptroller and provides accounting and disbursing services, and (3) Navy components that initiate and authorize financial transactions. The DFAS Cleveland Center is primarily responsible for preparing the Navy\u2019s financial reports from data generated by accounting, financial management, and other management information systems operated by DFAS, the Navy, and the Marine Corps.", "The CFO Act requires DOD and the other \u201cCFO Act\u201d agencies to improve their financial management and reporting operations. Among its specific requirements is that each agency CFO develop an integrated agency accounting and financial management system, including financial reporting and internal controls. Such systems are to comply with applicable principles and standards and provide for complete, reliable, consistent, and timely information that is responsive to the agency\u2019s financial information needs. To help strengthen financial management, the CFO Act also requires that DOD prepare financial statements for its trust funds, revolving funds, and commercial activities, including those of the Navy. To test whether agencywide audited financial statements would yield additional benefits, the CFO Act also established a 3-year pilot program for the Army, the Air Force, and eight other \u201cCFO Act\u201d agencies or components of agencies.", "In response to experiences gained under the CFO Act, the Congress concluded that agencywide financial statements contribute to cost- effective improvements in government operations. Accordingly, when the Congress passed the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA) (Public Law 103-356), it expanded the CFO Act\u2019s requirement for audited financial statements by requiring that all 24 \u201cCFO Act\u201d agencies, including DOD, annually prepare and have audited agencywide financial statements, beginning with those for fiscal year 1996. GMRA also authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to identify component organizations of the 24 \u201cCFO Act\u201d agencies that will also be required to prepare financial statements for their operations and have them audited. Consistent with GMRA\u2019s legislative history, OMB has indicated that it will identify the military services as DOD components required to prepare financial statements and have them audited. Therefore, fiscal year 1996 is the first year for which the Navy will be required to prepare a full set of financial statements for its general funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Widespread Weaknesses Hamper Effective Financial Management and Reporting", "paragraphs": ["To an even greater extent than the other military services, the Navy is plagued by troublesome financial management problems involving billions of dollars. These problems include (1) internal control breakdowns over disbursements, (2) actual and potential violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act, and (3) widely inconsistent financial reporting on the results of operating Navy\u2019s DBOF activities. The Navy\u2019s serious and widespread financial management problems have been highlighted in audit reports, and embarrassing fraud cases and have severely impeded the Navy\u2019s effective financial management. The following are examples of these problems.", "In 1989, we reported to the Secretary of the Navy that the Navy\u2019s consolidated financial reports for fiscal year 1986 were unreliable and understated assets by $58 billion.In 1994, we reported a $163 billion discrepancy between the value of property, plant, and equipment that the Navy reported for fiscal year 1993 and the amounts shown in the supporting information various Navy commands submitted to DFAS.In its fiscal year 1994 Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) (Public Law 97-255) report to the Secretary of Defense, the Navy reported that none of the 28 operating accounting systems it evaluated complied with appropriate accounting standards and related requirements.", "Between 1989 and 1992, a former Military Sealift Command supply officer established a fictitious company, submitted over 100 bogus invoices, and received an estimated $3 million in fraudulent payments.", "With regard to internal control breakdowns over disbursements, over 2 years ago, we reported that the Navy had a severe and persistent problem with unmatched disbursements, which, in December 1992, amounted to about $13.6 billion. As of August 31, 1995, the Navy\u2019s unmatched disbursements and other problem disbursements totaled $18.6 billion, by far the most of any DOD component, with over 67 percent of the DOD total, as shown in table 1.", "Particularly troubling, the Navy continues to have difficulty in solving its problem disbursements. For example, from October 31, 1994, through June 30, 1995, the Navy and DFAS resolved about $7.6 billion in unmatched disbursements, which is significant. This reduction was, however, largely eclipsed by $6.7 billion in new unmatched disbursements.", "Also, problems in keeping records on Navy disbursements have distorted governmentwide financial reporting. DFAS, Cleveland Center, incorrectly recorded billions of dollars of fiscal year 1995 Navy disbursements to a nonbudgetary deposit fund account. According to Department of the Treasury officials, this error resulted in the Treasury understating by at least $4 billion the federal government\u2019s overall budget deficit reported as of June 30, 1995. Thus, maintaining accurate financial records and producing reliable financial information on the Navy\u2019s operations is a meaningful process with relevance to and significant ramifications for the government as a whole.", "With respect to actual and potential violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act, for fiscal years 1993 and 1994, and through the first 10 months of fiscal year 1995, the Navy investigated 25 cases of potential Anti-Deficiency Act violations involving about $166 million. Of these, 18 cases have been closed with the following results.", "For 15 cases, involving about $87 million, DOD reported to the Congress that the Navy had violated the Anti-Deficiency Act. In 11 of these cases, the violations were due to misclassifications between appropriations and four cases represented overexpenditures of obligational authority. These violations resulted in disciplinary actions against 58 people. These actions included 1 removal from office, 2 suspensions, 3 letters of punitive reprimand, 20 letters of nonpunitive reprimand, and various other admonishments. In 3 cases, involving about $63 million, investigators found no violations of the act but discovered that accounting errors primarily caused what initially appeared to have been violations.", "Navy DBOF activities should operate in a businesslike manner with the objective of breaking even. However, in June 1994, we reported that, given the magnitude of differences reported for DBOF\u2019s operating results, it is difficult for Navy and DOD managers to know the Navy DBOF activities\u2019 actual operating results. Nevertheless, the Navy has continued to report misleading DBOF financial information. For fiscal year 1994, the Navy reported (1) a loss of $120 million in the fund\u2019s budget overview, (2) a cumulative loss of $3.2 billion when the fund\u2019s monthly reports for the fiscal year were totaled, and (3) income of $574 million on the fund\u2019s year-end financial statements. Thus, it is unclear and undeterminable whether, in fiscal year 1994, the Navy\u2019s DBOF activities operated at a gain or a loss, or whether they broke even as intended.", "In addition to these wide fluctuations, comparison of the reported results of the Navy DBOF activities between fiscal years also shows readily apparent inconsistencies. For instance, the Navy\u2019s DBOF financial statements for fiscal year 1992 showed a $2.7 billion operating loss whereas the fiscal year 1993 statements showed operating income of $2.5 billion. The fiscal year 1994 statement showed operating income of $574 million. These extreme fluctuations in annual operating results raise questions regarding the effectiveness of fund management and the accuracy of reported amounts.", "In addition, the Naval Audit Service has been unable to express opinions on the Navy\u2019s consolidated DBOF activities\u2019 financial statements prepared under the CFO Act. The Service found extensive problems including that the reported cost of property, plant and equipment, and related depreciation, were not adequately supported, and account balances were materially misstated. Also, DFAS acknowledged in its 1994 FMFIA Statement of Assurance that its Navy-related accounting systems did not provide adequate general ledger control. As a result, the DOD Inspector General was unable to audit DOD\u2019s consolidated DBOF financial statements citing significant deficiencies in accounting systems and the inability of Navy to submit timely and accurate statements for audit of its DBOF activities.", "DOD has initiatives underway that could help address the fundamental weaknesses we found that impede effective financial management and reporting for the Navy. Specifically, the June 1995 DFAS Business Plan includes actions intended to achieve the finance and accounting improvement goals laid out in Secretary Perry\u2019s blueprint for financial management reform. For example, the DFAS Business Plan includes 5 actions to address DOD\u2019s problem disbursements, 19 actions to improve compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act, and 6 actions to improve the systems supporting DOD\u2019s DBOF operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Reports Are Grossly Inaccurate", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 1994, the Navy\u2019s consolidated financial reports showed $506 billion in assets, $7 billion in liabilities, and $87 billion in operating expenses.

Also, while the Navy reported $26.4 billion for ships under construction as of September 30, 1994, it did not include outfitting and post delivery costs, costs related to Military Sealift Command vessel construction, and components for future construction.

However, the Navy and DFAS do not require the consistent use of object class codes when recording disbursements for these purposes. OMB has recognized the importance of object class information and encourages its use for financial statement presentation under the CFO Act.", "In this regard, we extracted approximately 174,000 disbursement transactions totaling about $7.3 billion recorded in the Navy\u2019s Standard Accounting and Reporting System from July through September 1994. Sixty-eight percent of these transactions, representing about $6.4 billion, did not contain object class codes. Also, we identified 2.8 million transactions processed through the Navy\u2019s Centralized Expenditure/Reimbursement Processing System for May and June 1994. We found that 2.2 million of the transactions (78 percent) were processed without object class codes.", "A Navy finance official told us that Navy and DFAS activities are required to use expense element codes to record transactions for operation and maintenance and research, development, test, and evaluation appropriations, and that in his opinion, DFAS, Cleveland Center, should be able to generate expense data, at least for these appropriations, using these codes. However, similar to object class codes, our analysis of about 630,000 disbursement transactions for 2 months of fiscal year 1995 for the two appropriations showed that expense element codes were not consistently used. Of the transactions we analyzed, about 454,000 either (1) did not have expense element codes or (2) the recorded codes were invalid.", "In the absence of object class and expense element code data, we believe that information from which to more accurately report these two types of disbursements could have been derived from the Navy\u2019s budget execution reports as of September 30, 1994. Using these reports, we estimated amounts for operating expense and capital expenditures to be $61 billion and $28 billion, respectively, for fiscal year 1994.

We found, for instance, that the Navy\u2019s official accounting records at DAO-Arlington, had not been reconciled with any of the Navy\u2019s custodial property records for at least 18 months.

When abnormal account balances or unexpected trends occur, their cause should be investigated and any necessary corrections made.", "When an agency\u2019s records or reports show abnormal information or account balances, that is a strong indication that errors have occurred in recording or processing the underlying transactions. In this respect, for example, the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 1994 consolidated financial reports showed an operating loss of $9.1 billion. This followed reported losses of $12 billion for fiscal year 1993 and $7.1 billion for fiscal year 1992. Taken at face value, the magnitude of these losses should have alerted the Navy that it may have overspent its appropriations during these 3 fiscal years.", "Also, the financial reports DFAS used to prepare and support the Navy\u2019s consolidated financial reports for fiscal year 1994 showed various abnormal account balances, such as the following.", "The military construction appropriation report showed a negative accounts receivable balance of $95 million.", "The ship procurement appropriation report showed a negative accounts receivable balance of $13 million.", "Another procurement appropriation report showed an account balance for uncollectible receivables of $88 million, which exceeded the reported value of receivables by $30 million.", "Although the information and account balances in each of these cases were highly unusual and unlikely to be correct, the Navy and DFAS did not investigate and correct them.", "Also, we found unusual trends and large variances in account balances that were not investigated, explained, or resolved, even though the Navy\u2019s regulations require them to be.

A cursory review of these reports would have identified this unreasonable upward fluctuation.", "Once identified, the underlying cause, which in this case was double counting, could have been readily identified and the financial reports corrected. Specifically, this double counting occurred because DFAS personnel inadvertently included in the worksheets used to prepare the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 1994 consolidated financial reports the same structures and facilities data reported from two sources\u2014the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, which maintains Navywide real estate and facilities data, and individual Navy accounting offices.", "In its comments on a draft of this report, DOD stated that Navy\u2019s SF-220 series of reports for fiscal year 1994 provided appropriation level totals but did not provide breakdowns of financial data by command or individual activity.

Finally, DOD stated that it is improbable that errors at the appropriation level will be found without a breakout by command and activity data.", "Effective financial systems and internal controls would prevent and/or detect errors in recording and processing transactions, regardless of the level at which they occurred. Also, it should be recognized that the fiscal year 1994 SF-220 reports which we evaluated were prepared at the overall Navy departmental level, not at the appropriation level as the comments suggest. Contrary to the department\u2019s assertion, most of the errors we identified were not difficult to discern because they dealt with relatively obvious data omissions, double-counting, and misclassifications. In most cases, they occurred because information available at Navy commands was not requested by DFAS, Cleveland Center, errors were made in recording information in the correct \u201cline items\u201d of the reports, or information was entered in the reports twice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adequate Physical Inventories of Plant Property Were Not Assured", "paragraphs": ["The Navy Comptroller Manual specifies that (1) DAOs schedule physical inventories of plant property and monitor their completion at Navy activities, (2) activities perform such physical inventories at least once every 3 years and correct their property records for any differences, and (3) activities inform the DAOs when physical inventories have been completed. However, we found that DAO-Arlington and DAO-San Diego, which accounted for $5.2 billion of the Navy plant property reported in fiscal year 1994, did not ensure that Navy activities reporting to them had completed the required physical inventories.
