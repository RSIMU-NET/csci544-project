For all corporations, a higher percentage of FCDCs reported no tax liabilities than USCCs through 2001 but differences after 2001 were not statistically significant. Most large FCDCs and USCCs that reported no tax liability in 2005 also reported that they had no current-year income. A smaller proportion of these corporations had losses from prior years and tax credits that eliminated any tax liability. By another measure, large FCDCs were more likely to report no tax liability over multiple years than large USCCs. In 2005, comparisons of FCDCs and USCCs based on ratios of reported tax liabilities to gross receipts or total assets showed that FCDCs reported less tax than USCCs. FCDCs and USCCs differed in age, size, and industry. FCDCs were younger than USCCs in that a greater percentage had been incorporated for 3 years or less from 1998 through 2005. In 2005, FCDCs were larger on average than USCCs in that they reported higher average gross receipts and assets than USCCs. A comparison by industry in 2005 showed that large FCDCs were relatively more concentrated in manufacturing and wholesale trade, while large USCCs were more evenly distributed across industries.

We reported  that from 1989 through 2000 foreign-controlled corporations were more  likely to report zero U.S. income tax liability than U.S.-controlled  corporations with a majority of both types of corporations reporting no  liability. We said that corporations may not report U.S income taxes for a  variety of reasons including current-year operating losses, tax credits, and  transfer pricing abuses.", "Transfer prices are the prices related companies, such as a parent and  subsidiary, charge on intercompany transactions.  By manipulating  transfer prices, multinational companies can shift income from higher to  lower tax jurisdictions, reducing the companies\u2019 overall tax liability. As we  noted in our previous reports, researchers acknowledge that transfer  pricing abuses may explain some of the differences in tax liabilities of  foreign-controlled corporations compared to U.S.-controlled corporations.   However, researchers have had difficulty determining the exact extent to  which transfer pricing abuses explain the differences due to data  limitations.", "Based on your request, we updated our 2004 report. Specifically, we  agreed to study (1) how the tax liability of foreign-controlled domestic  corporations (FCDC) compares to that of U.S.-controlled corporations  (USCC)\u2014including the percentage of corporations reporting zero tax  liabilities for tax years 1998 through 2005 and (2) how corporate  characteristics such as age, size, and industry compare between FCDCs  and USCCs.", "To meet these objectives, we analyzed data from the Internal Revenue  Service\u2019s (IRS) Statistics of Income (SOI) samples of corporate tax returns  for tax years 1998 through 2005. These SOI samples were based on returns  as filed, and did not reflect IRS audit results or any net operating loss  carrybacks from future years. The data that we report are estimates based  on the SOI sample.  Sampling errors are reported in appendix II. Caution  should be used when comparing estimates because not all differences  between estimates are statistically significant. Various types of  corporations report their taxes on different forms and may differ in their  tax liabilities. Unlike our previous reports, here we report separately for  each form type.  The estimates in the body of the report are for  corporations filing Forms 1120 or 1120-A. (In app. II we provide separate  estimates for corporations filing Forms 1120-L, 1120-PC, 1120-REIT, 1120- RIC, and 1120S.) We also report separately for large corporations\u2014those  with at least $250 million in assets or $50 million in gross receipts\u2014 because, while they account for less than 1 percent of all corporations,  they make up over 90 percent of all assets reported on corporate returns.", "As agreed, we did not attempt to determine whether corporations were  abusing transfer prices. Nor did we attempt to determine the extent to  which this abuse explains any differences in the reported tax liabilities of  FCDCs and USCCs. Detailed information on our scope and methodology  appears in appendix I.", "We conducted our work from November 2007 through July 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Researchers have studied the factors explaining why FCDCs report lower  tax liabilities than USCCs. Generally, the research has recognized that  nontax characteristics such as age and industry may explain some of the  differences in reported tax liabilities. The researchers have also found that  transfer pricing abuses may play a role in explaining the differences.  However, measuring the separate effects of these factors on tax liabilities  has been difficult due to data limitations.", "Factors like the age and industry of corporations may affect tax liabilities  by affecting net income. For example, younger corporations may be less  likely than older corporations to have net income and, therefore, more  likely to report no tax liability than older corporations. If FCDCs tend to  be younger than USCCs, age differences may explain some of the  difference in reported tax liabilities. We noted in our 1999 report that a  study by Grubert (1997) suggested that the lower relative age of foreign- controlled corporations partially explained their lower reported  profitability. However, data are not available on all the nontax  characteristics that may affect tax liabilities.", "Tax liabilities may also be reduced through transfer pricing abuse. Any  company that has a related company, such as a subsidiary with which it  transacts business, needs to establish transfer prices for those  intercompany transactions.  The transfer price should be the \u201carm\u2019s length  price,\u201d i.e., the price that would be charged if the transaction occurred  between unrelated companies. Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code  provides IRS authority to allocate income among related companies if IRS  determines that the transfer prices used by the taxpayer were  inappropriate. How transfer prices are set affects the distribution of  profits and ultimately the taxable income of the companies. The following  is an example of abusive cross-border transfer pricing. A foreign parent  corporation with a subsidiary operating in the United States charges the  subsidiary excessive prices for goods and services rendered (for example,  $1,000 instead of the going rate of $600). This raises the subsidiary\u2019s  expenses (by $400), lowers its profits (by $400), and effectively shifts that  income ($400) outside of the United States. At a 35-percent U.S. corporate  income tax rate, the subsidiary will pay $140 less in U.S. taxes than it  would if the $400 in profits were attributed to it.", "Researchers have used direct and indirect methods to estimate the extent  to which transfer pricing abuses explain the differences in reported tax  liabilities. Direct methods analyze the transfer prices used by corporations  and compare them to arm\u2019s length prices.  This method is difficult to apply  because price data are often unavailable and determining the price that  would be charged between unrelated parties can be difficult. An  alternative, indirect method used by researchers analyzes data about the  characteristics of corporations in order to test for a statistical relationship  between tax rates and subsidiaries\u2019 profitability or tax liability. In some of  these studies, statistical methods are used to explain as much of the  difference in reported tax liabilities as can be explained by the nontax  characteristics and the remaining unexplained difference is identified as  the upper limit of the difference that could be explained by transfer  pricing abuse. However, how close this upper limit estimate is to the  actual effect of transfer pricing abuse depends on how many of the  important nontax characteristics have been included in the first stage of  the analysis. As noted above, data are unavailable for some important  nontax characteristics.", "Low tax burdens can be measured in various ways.  Zero tax liability is  one way. However, corporations paying only small, but not zero, amounts  of tax also face low tax burdens.  Furthermore, corporations that pay no  or little tax over a number of years have a lower cumulative tax burden.  Therefore, measures based on a range of tax amounts and tax years may  give a fuller description of which types of corporations pay relatively less.  Finally, the amount of taxes paid generally corresponds with the size of  the corporation, with large corporations on average paying more than  small ones. Tax liability can be measured as the amount of tax paid as a  percentage of gross receipts or total assets in order to account for  differences in the size of corporations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCDCs Reported Lower Tax Liabilities Than USCCs by Most Measures", "paragraphs": ["Our comparison of tax liabilities highlights three measures that are used  by tax experts: (1) the percentage of corporations reporting no tax  liability, (2) the number of years corporations reported no tax liability, and  (3) tax liabilities reported by corporations as a percentage of gross  receipts and assets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Large Percentage of Both FCDCs and USCCs Reported No Tax Liabilities", "paragraphs": ["A greater percentage of large FCDCs reported no tax liability in a given  year from 1998 through 2005, as shown in figure 1.

As figure 2  shows, about 72 percent of FCDCs and 55 percent of USCCs reported no  tax liability for at least 1 year during the 8 years. About 57 percent of  FCDCs and 42 percent of USCCs reported no tax liability in multiple  years\u20142 or more years\u2014and about 34 percent of FCDCs and 24 percent of  USCCs reported no tax liability for at least half the study period\u20144 or  more years.

At a high  level, corporate tax returns are organized to (1) calculate gross profit as  gross receipts or sales minus the cost of goods sold; (2) calculate total  income as gross profit plus other types of income; (3) report various  deductible expenses; (4) calculate taxable income as the difference  between income and deductions; and (5) calculate the tax liability for the  taxable income. Corporations can establish the basis for a zero tax liability  at different stages in these calculations by reporting, for example, that  they have no total income or no taxable income which results in their  having no tax liability. Figure 3 shows the percentage of corporations  reporting no tax liability in 2005 by the line on their tax return where they  first reported the zero dollar amounts that resulted in no tax liability. For  example, the figure shows that 3 percent of large FCDCs and 1 percent of  large USCCs established no tax liability by reporting no gross profit on line  3 of their returns. This pattern of similar percentages for large  corporations continues throughout the tax return. For example, a similar,  small percentage of large FCDCs or USCCs, around 4 to 5 percent,  established their zero tax liability on line 11 by reporting zero total  income.", "As figure 3 shows, the overwhelming majority, about 79 to 80 percent of  both large FCDCs and USCCs that reported zero tax liability in 2005,  established it on line 28 where they reported zero taxable income before  net operating losses. This means that their reported current-year  deductions more than offset the positive current-year total income  reported on line 11. The two most commonly used deductions, as a  percentage of the value of all deductions claimed, were \u201cother  deductions\u201d and the deduction for salaries and wages. See table 3 and  figure 8 in appendix II for detailed comparisons of tax return line items  and deductions.", "On the corporate tax return, current-year taxable income is reported  before net operating losses from other years are deducted and any tax  credits are subtracted from tax liabilities. In 2005, losses from prior years  and tax credits had less impact on where on the tax return large  corporations first established no tax liability. Figure 3 shows on line 30  that a relatively small number of large corporations\u2014about 10 percent\u2014 first established a zero tax liability by carrying forward losses from prior  years, and that an even smaller number\u2014about 3 percent\u2014first  established no tax liability through their use of tax credits, as reported on  line 11 schedule J in the figure.", "All FCDCs and USCCs differed in some ways from large FCDCs and  USCCs in where on their tax returns they first established no tax liability,  reflecting the influence of small corporations.

For both of our objectives, we used  data from Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) Statistics of Income (SOI) files  on corporate tax returns for tax years 1998 through 2005. These SOI  samples were based on returns as filed, and did not reflect IRS audit  results or any net operating loss carrybacks from future years. Each tax  return is treated as a separate corporation which, in the case of  consolidated returns, may be composed of a number of subsidiary  corporations. To provide information on the number of years large  corporations did not report tax liabilities, we developed a panel data set  consisting of the tax returns of large corporations that were present in the  SOI corporate files in every year from 1998 through 2005. We did not  include corporations that changed ownership status as USCCs or FCDCs  during this period. We also did not analyze changes in the composition of  corporations that filed consolidated returns. The gross receipts and assets  of the corporations present in the panel data set account for on average  about 40 percent of gross receipts and assets of all corporations and about  50 percent of the gross receipts and assets of large corporations from 1998  through 2005. Over time, the corporations present in the panel data  account for an increasing share of corporate gross receipts and assets. For  example in 1998 and 1999 the panel data corporations accounted for about  40 percent of the gross receipts and assets of all large corporations. This  percentage increased to about 60 percent by 2005.", "To compare all and large FCDCs and USCCs based on the tax liabilities  they reported on their U.S. income tax returns, we made estimates for a  variety of measures of tax liability. For the purposes of this report, an  FCDC is a U.S. corporation with 50 percent or more of its voting stock  owned by a foreign person or entity. Foreign control of a U.S. corporation  exists when a foreign investor gains control of an existing U.S. company or  creates a new company that it incorporates in the United States. Both  FCDCs and USCCs are subject to U.S. income tax laws although the tax  treatment of some income may differ. Large corporations are those with at  least $250 million of assets or at least $50 million of receipts. We also  compared differences in FCDCs and USCCs by age and industry sector.  We defined new corporations as those for which income tax returns  showed incorporation dates within 3 years of the tax year date; all others  were considered old corporations. For example, for tax year 2005, new  corporations are those with incorporation dates no earlier than 2003. We  did not attempt to determine whether corporations were abusing transfer  prices.
