These benefits can include counseling, assistive devices, and other services or equipment. GAO was asked to review issues related to the IL track. This report examines (1) the characteristics of veterans in the IL track, and the types and costs of benefits they were provided; (2) the extent to which their IL plans were completed, and the time it took to complete them; and (3) the extent to which the IL track has been administered appropriately and consistently across regional offices.", "To conduct this work, GAO analyzed VA administrative data from fiscal years 2008 to 2011, and reviewed a random, generalizable sample of 182 veterans who entered the IL track in fiscal year 2008. In addition, GAO visited five VA regional offices; interviewed agency officials and staff; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency policies and procedures."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the 9,215 veterans who entered the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Independent Living (IL) track within the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program in fiscal years 2008 to 2011, most were male Vietnam era veterans in their 50s or 60s. Almost 60 percent served in the U.S. Army, and fewer than 1 percent served in the National Guard or Reserve. The most prevalent disabilities among these veterans were post-traumatic stress disorder and tinnitus. GAO's review of 182 IL cases from fiscal year 2008 found that VR&E provided a range of IL benefits to veterans. Among these cases, the most common benefits were counseling services and computers. Less common benefits included gym memberships, camping equipment, and a boat. GAO estimated that VR&E spent nearly $14 million on benefits for veterans entering the IL track in fiscal year 2008--an average of almost $6,000 per IL veteran.", "Most veterans completed their IL plans, which identify their individual goals to live independently and the benefits VR&E will provide. About 89 percent of fiscal year 2008 IL veterans were considered by VR&E to be \"rehabilitated,\" that is, generally, to have completed their IL plans by the end of fiscal year 2011. VR&E discontinued or closed about 5 percent of cases for various reasons, such as the veteran declined benefits. Six percent of cases were open at the end of fiscal year 2011. Because the complexity of IL cases varied depending on veterans' disabilities and needs, some cases were fairly simple for VR&E to close. For example, one IL case only called for the installation of door levers and a bathtub rail. Another more complex case involved the provision of a range of IL benefits, including home modifications. Rehabilitation rates across regions varied from 0 to 100 percent, and regions with larger IL caseloads generally rehabilitated a greater percentage of IL veterans. While IL plans nationwide were completed in 384 days, on average, completion times varied by region, from 150 to 895 days.", "VR&E exercises limited oversight to ensure appropriate and consistent administration of the IL track across its regions. First, some regions may not be complying with certain case management requirements. For instance, while VR&E is required to coordinate with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) on IL benefits, VR&E counselors have difficulty obtaining timely responses from VHA. VHA physicians respond to VR&E's IL referrals late or not at all, resulting in delayed benefits or VR&E providing the benefits instead of VHA. Second, VR&E does not monitor regional variation in IL caseloads and benefits provided. Instead, it has relied on its quality assurance reviews and ad hoc studies, but these are limited in scope. Third, given counselors have broad discretion in selecting IL benefits, VR&E's written policies for approving IL expenditures may not be appropriate as regions were permitted to purchase a range of items without any Central Office approval, some of which were costly or questionable. For example, in one case, Central Office review would not have been required for expenditures of $18,829 for a riding mower, which is prohibited, and other items. Finally, VR&E's system does not collect IL costs and benefits provided. VR&E also lacks accurate data on the number of IL veterans served. While the law currently allows 2,700 veterans to enter the IL track annually, data used to monitor the cap are based on the number of IL plans developed, not on the number of individual veterans admitted. Veterans can have more than one plan in a fiscal year, so one veteran could be counted multiple times towards the cap."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VR&E explore options to enhance coordination with VHA; strengthen its oversight of the IL track; and reassess its policy for approving benefits.

As such, some  plans are easier for VR&E to close as rehabilitated than others. For  example, in one case we reviewed, the IL plan for a veteran with  rheumatoid arthritis only called for the purchase and installation of eight  door levers and a grab rail for the bathtub, so that the veteran could enter  the rooms of his home without pain or assistance, and be able to safely  enter and exit the bathtub without fear of falling. Other cases were more  complex to close as rehabilitated because of the nature of services being  provided to the veteran. For instance, another case we reviewed called  for providing a veteran who used a wheel-chair with medical, dental, and  vision care as needed and about $24,000 in modifications to the veteran\u2019s  home, including modifying the veteran\u2019s bathroom, widening doors and  modifying thresholds, and installing an emergency exit ramp in a  bedroom.", "While the overall IL rehabilitation rate nationwide of 89 percent is fairly  high, we found that the percentage of veterans who began an IL plan in  fiscal year 2008 and were rehabilitated by the end of fiscal year 2011  varied by regional office. IL rehabilitation rates in these cases ranged  from 0 to 100 percent across regional offices, although about two-thirds  of regional offices had rehabilitated 80 percent or more of 2008 IL track  veterans by the end of fiscal year 2011. (See appendix IV for a complete  list of rehabilitation rates for all regional offices.) In addition, VR&E\u2019s IL  rehabilitation rate was higher in regional offices with larger IL caseloads.  Among veterans who entered the IL track in fiscal year 2008, an average  of 90 percent were rehabilitated at offices with more than 25 IL entrants,  compared to an average of 79 percent at offices with 25 or fewer IL  entrants (see fig. 11).", "Furthermore, we found that fiscal year 2008 IL track veterans nationwide  completed their IL plans, i.e., were classified rehabilitated, in an average  of 384 days (about 13 months). About 50 percent of these veterans  completed their IL plans within 1 year, 79 percent within 2 years, and 88  percent within 3 years. Average days for these IL track veterans to  complete their plans varied by regional office from a low of 150 days at  the St. Paul Regional Office to a high of 895 days at the Roanoke  Regional Office. However, at most regional offices (49 of 53) the  average time to complete IL plans ranged from 226 to 621 days (8 to 21  months). (See appendix V for a complete list of rehabilitation times for all  regional offices.) Also, as shown in figure 12, IL track veterans generally  completed their plans in less time at regional offices with larger IL  caseloads than at offices with smaller caseloads.", "The average time for veterans to complete their IL plans also varied by  veteran age. The oldest veterans completed their plans slightly more  quickly than the youngest. More specifically, veterans who were 70 to 79  completed their plans in an average of 369 days, while those who were  20 to 29 completed them in an average of 413 days (see fig. 13).", "Because differences in the length of time to complete IL plans could have  occurred by chance or be explained by many factors\u2014including the type  and severity of disability or veteran age\u2014we used a statistical model to  estimate the amount of time it would take certain groups of IL track  veterans to complete their IL plans while controlling for type and severity  of disability and other demographic characteristics. (See appendix II for  more detailed information on our model and analysis.) The results of our  model showed that the chance of rehabilitation within 2 years varied by  regional office. At four regional offices the chance of being rehabilitated  within 2 years was less than 50 percent. At 18 offices the chance was  between 50 and less than 90 percent. At 16 offices the chance was 90  percent or greater.", "Our model also estimated that a veteran served by a regional office with a  large IL caseload had a higher probability of completing an IL plan more  quickly than a veteran served by an office with a small IL caseload. More  specifically, we determined that a typical IL track veteran at an office with  a total of 75 IL cases entering the IL track during fiscal years 2008  through 2011 had a 48 percent chance of completing an IL plan within 1  year and a 92 percent chance of completing an IL plan within 3 years,  while a veteran at a regional office with 700 IL cases had a 57 percent  chance of completing an IL plan within 1 year and a 96 percent chance of  completing their plan within 3 years (see fig. 14). Finally, based on our  model we estimated that older veterans had a higher probability of  completing an IL plan more quickly than younger veterans. For example,  a 75 year old veteran had a 41 percent chance of completing an IL plan  within one year, while a 30 year old veteran had a 33 percent chance. We  found no meaningful differences in the time it takes to complete an IL plan  as \u201crehabilitated\u201d according to veteran gender and most disability types.

Site visit monitoring reports from two  regional offices we visited indicated that these offices faced difficulties  complying with this requirement. According to these reports, some VRCs  were not able to schedule monthly in-person meetings with IL track  veterans to check their progress in completing their IL plans. In addition,  VRCs we spoke with during our site visits said that compliance with this  requirement continues to be a challenge due to the size of their caseloads  and the distances that they have to travel to meet with veterans. While  VR&E\u2019s Central Office acknowledges that it can be challenging for some  offices to comply with this requirement, officials stated that face-to-face  contact with IL track veterans is extremely important due to the nature of  their disabilities and the need for more intensive rehabilitation services.", "Furthermore, while VR&E and VHA both have policies that require them  to coordinate on the provision of goods and services for IL track veterans,  we found that some VRCs experience challenges in doing so.  Specifically, VA regulations governing VR&E\u2019s IL track require that if a  veteran needs special equipment and is eligible for such equipment under  another VA program, the items will be provided under that program.  Therefore, prior to VR&E purchasing services for veterans, officials told  us that VRCs are required to refer cases to other VA providers, such as  VHA\u2019s Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) program  and VA medical centers, to determine whether veterans are eligible to  receive the goods and services identified in their plan from these  providers. In addition, VHA \u2018s policy directive for coordinating with VR&E  is intended to ensure that all VR&E participants, including those in the IL  track, receive timely access to VHA health care services. The directive  requires medical center directors to (1) provide clinically appropriate care  to VR&E participants, (2) establish procedures to manage these  participants\u2019 timely access to care, and (3) ensure that clinical staff are  trained in these procedures, including how to alert appropriate VBA  officials when timeliness of care could be an issue, among other  requirements.", "Despite these VR&E and VHA policies, our review of 182 IL track records  found some instances where VR&E purchased goods and services that  appear to be medically related, such as ramps and grab bars, and could  have been provided by VHA. There may have been little coordination on  IL track cases because, as VR&E officials and staff at the five VA regional  offices we visited told us, coordinating with VHA medical center staff can  be challenging. Several VRCs indicated that when they refer IL track  cases to VHA physicians to determine whether any of the medical-related  benefits identified in the IL plans\u2014such as grab bars, wheelchairs, and  safety rails\u2014had been or could be provided by VHA, in many instances,  VHA physicians do not respond or respond too late. As a result, services  for IL track veterans were either delayed or purchased by VR&E instead  of VHA. According to some VHA staff, lack of or delays in coordination  are sometimes due to differences in VR&E rehabilitation goals and VHA  long-term medical goals for veterans. For example, VHA staff members  mentioned they would not approve VRCs\u2019 requests for lift chairs unless  veterans absolutely needed them because VHA staff members said their  medical goal is to promote continued mobility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VR&E Does Not Systematically Monitor Variation in IL Track Caseload Size and Benefits Provided", "paragraphs": ["While IL track caseload size and benefits vary across regions, VR&E  does not systematically monitor these variations.

As  shown in figure 15, the total IL track caseload during fiscal years 2008  through 2011 ranged from over 900 cases in the Montgomery Regional  Office in Alabama to 4 cases in the Wilmington Regional Office in  Delaware. (See appendix VI for annual IL caseload data.) While one  would expect differences in caseload size based on the number of  veterans in an office\u2019s service area, some differences in IL caseload could  not be explained by the size of the veteran population in an office\u2019s  service area. For example, while the estimated size of the veteran  populations in Alabama and Massachusetts are similar, Montgomery\u2019s IL  caseload of over 900 veterans was more than 100 times as large as  Boston\u2019s IL caseload of 8 veterans. VR&E officials told us they are aware  that some offices have low IL participation levels, and attributed some of  the difference to factors, such as the presence of specialized treatment  centers in certain areas of the county that can increase caseload  numbers in those regions. However, evidence from our site visits  suggests that there may be other factors that drive the number of  veterans entering a region\u2019s IL track. For example, officials from the  Detroit Regional Office\u2014which had the second highest total IL caseload  across fiscal years 2008 through 2011\u2014attributed the size of their  caseload to their office\u2019s focus on IL cases and community outreach  efforts, including the involvement of veteran service organizations. The  Atlanta Regional Office also mentioned that in addition to the size of the  veteran population in Georgia and the presence of army bases, the size  of their IL caseload is influenced by increased community interest in the  IL track in recent years, and the informal efforts of past IL participants to  provide information about the IL track to other veterans.", "Based on discussions with regional personnel and our review of the  results of past studies, IL plans and the goods and services provided can  also vary by region. According to VR&E officials, the law gives VA broad  discretion in defining the range of needs covered in an IL track plan, as  well as in choosing the types of goods and services required to achieve  the plan\u2019s goals. VR&E\u2019s policy does, however, prohibit the agency from  providing courses of study and training leading to academic degrees, and  purchasing certain types of equipment, such as lawn tractors. As a result,  some regions appear to develop IL plans that address a broader range of  needs while others elect to develop more focused plans. Officials we  spoke with during our site visits also confirmed that regions differ in their  approach to developing IL plans, and in one region, officials commented  that some regions may develop simpler plans with fewer benefits to  achieve VR&E\u2019s rehabilitation goal. Moreover, VR&E\u2019s 2008 study of the  IL track reported that some regions relied repeatedly on the same types  of benefits to meet veterans\u2019 IL needs. For example, in the New York  and Hartford regional offices, nearly 90 percent of IL participants were  provided computer training. This was almost twice the rate of Detroit\u2014the  office with the next highest rate of providing veterans with computer  training\u2014in 44 percent of its IL cases. Other offices focused more heavily  on providing goods or services to support veterans\u2019 avocational interests  or on finding veterans volunteer opportunities, while some consistently  focused on providing veterans with health club memberships. For  example, the St. Petersburg Regional Office accounted for 33 percent of  veterans receiving volunteer opportunities. In addition, the 2004 VR&E  Task Force report noted significant differences in field office philosophy  regarding the scope and administration of the IL track, and also  recommended providing VR&E Central Office greater \u201cline-of-site  authority\u201d over VR&E field operations. As noted earlier, VBA\u2019s Office of  Field Operations rather than VR&E\u2019s Central Office has direct line of  authority over regional VR&E staff and operations.", "While VA officials acknowledged the existence of regional variation in  these areas, VR&E\u2019s current oversight approach may not be adequate to  ensure consistent administration of the IL track across regions. The  standards for internal control in the federal government emphasize the  need for federal agencies to have timely information to effectively monitor  and mitigate program risks. To oversee administration of the IL track,  VR&E has relied on the information provided through its general quality  assurance (QA) activities and a series of periodic ad hoc studies. The QA  activities are conducted by each region as well as VR&E\u2019s QA staff  located in Nashville, Tennessee. However, these activities are limited in  scope, frequency, and how the information is used. At the national level, a  team of VR&E QA staff are required to perform periodic site visits to each  VA regional office at least every 3 years, although officials told us they  have not been able to meet this goal in recent years because of  budgetary constraints. This team also periodically reviews a sample of  veterans\u2019 records from VR&E\u2019s IL and employment tracks in selected  regions. After each site visit and case review, the QA team produces a  report for the particular region under review. While VR&E officials told us  that QA results are \u201canalyzed to determine trends,\u201d it is unclear how  VR&E uses these results to ensure that consistent procedures are used  by regional offices nationwide.", "In addition to these QA activities, VA has funded two studies over the  past several years on the VR&E program, including implementation of the  IL track, and a third is under way. In 2003, VA appointed a task force to  evaluate the overall VR&E program and recommend ways service  delivery could be improved. In 2008, as mentioned, a study was issued by  VR&E on the types of services received by IL track participants and the  impact those services had on veterans. This study found, among other  things, that IL participants received a broad range of services, and that  some regional offices favored providing certain types of services to IL  track veterans. Finally, in October 2012, VR&E awarded a contract for  about $890,312 to study the IL track service delivery process, barriers  and incentives for field staff when considering the provision of services,  current and future training strategies, and other areas. VR&E officials  anticipate receiving the final results from this study in July 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VR&E Policy for Approving IL Track Expenditures Might Not Be Adequate", "paragraphs": ["Considering the broad discretion VR&E provides to regions in determining  the range of needs covered in IL track plans and the types of goods and  services selected to meet these needs, VR&E\u2019s current policy for  approving IL track expenditures may not be adequate. To guard against  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, the standards for internal  control emphasize the need for agencies to have appropriate levels of  supervision and controls in place to prevent one individual from having  responsibility for all key aspects of a transaction or event. VR&E Central  Office is responsible for managing the program\u2019s national budget. While  officials told us that VRCs are required to include all cost estimates when  they submit veterans\u2019 IL plans to be reviewed and approved by the  region\u2019s VR&E Officer, VR&E was unable to provide any written policy or  guidance that explicitly states this requirement for all IL expenditures.  VR&E\u2019s current written policies allow each region to unilaterally approve  construction-related expenditures up to $25,000 per case and non- construction expenditures up to $100,000 per case without approval from  VR&E Central Office. In addition, VRCs can spend up to $2,000 on  construction-related expenditures and up to $25,000 on non-construction  expenditures without supervisory review of any kind (see table 2). Under  this policy, regional offices are permitted to purchase a broad range of  items without any Central Office approval, resulting in some offices  purchasing goods and services that may be questionable or that are  costly. For example, in one of the 182 IL cases we reviewed, VR&E  Central Office would not have been required to approve total  expenditures of $18,829 for a riding lawn mower\u2014which VR&E policy  prohibits\u2014and other IL goods and services including a bed, bed frame,  desktop computer, and woodworking equipment. In another case, VR&E  Central Office approval would not have been required for the purchase of  a boat, motor, trailer, and the boat\u2019s shipping cost to Molokai, Hawaii,  among other items, totaling about $17,500. Without appropriate  approval levels, VR&E\u2019s IL track may be vulnerable to potential fraud,  waste, and abuse.", "VR&E does not collect or report critical program management  information\u2014such as the costs of goods and service purchased, the  types of benefits provided, and the number of IL veterans served\u2014that  would help the agency in its oversight responsibilities. Specifically,  VR&E\u2019s Corporate WINRS case management system\u2014commonly  referred to as \u201cCWINRS\u201d\u2014lacks information on the total amount of funds  VR&E expends on IL benefits because the agency does not maintain  specific cost information on each of its five tracks or the key program  areas these tracks represent, which are employment services and  independent living. VR&E aggregates costs across all its tracks, despite  VA\u2019s managerial cost accounting policies that require the costs of  products and services to be captured for management purposes.  Federal financial accounting standards also recommend that costs of  programs be measured and reported. According to officials, they do not  collect cost information on the IL track alone because they view the five  tracks as a single program with the same overarching goal\u2014to help  veterans achieve their employment goals. However, in our 2009 report on  the VR&E program, we reported that VR&E serves veterans with  fundamentally different program goals and outcomes\u2014those seeking to  obtain employment and those seeking to live independently. As a result,  we recommended that VR&E separately track its IL rehabilitation rate.", "In addition, the CWINRS system does not collect information on the types  of IL benefits provided to veterans in a standardized manner that can be  easily aggregated and analyzed for oversight purposes. Currently, VRCs  are required to write in a description of the benefits they purchased for IL  track veterans in CWINRS. We found, however, that the recorded  descriptions lack consistency and vary in their level of detail. In several of  the IL track cases we reviewed, the goods and services purchased were  grouped together under a general description, such as \u201cIL equipment\u201d or  \u201cIL supplies,\u201d without any further details. In other cases, VRCs recorded  each purchase separately. For instance, in one case, the VRC created  separate entries for each item purchased, for example, \u201cdesktop  computer,\u201d \u201ccomputer desk,\u201d \u201cQueen Mattress,\u201d \u201call in one printer,\u201d \u201cUSB  cable and ink,\u201d \u201cthreshold ramp,\u201d and \u201cwasher.\u201d In addition, we found that  controls for data entry are not adequate to ensure that all important data  is recorded. For example, we estimated that the service provider field  was either missing or unclear for one or more services in about 15  percent of all IL cases that began in fiscal year 2008. Moreover, in  another 7 percent of IL cases that began during fiscal year 2008, we  found that service provider data was unavailable because CWINRS had  overwritten veterans\u2019 2008 IL plans with subsequent plans. CWINRS only  retains veterans\u2019 current IL plan.", "Furthermore, CWINRS does not provide VR&E with the information it  needs to account for the actual number of IL track veterans it serves to  monitor its statutory entrant cap and program operations. The law allows  VR&E to initiate \u201cprograms\u201d of independent living services and assistance  for no more than a specified number of veterans each year, which is  currently set at 2,700. A VR&E policy letter to VA regional offices, dated  December 14, 2010, states that \u201cVR&E Service will monitor new IL  programs by tracking the number of veterans entering independent living  case status in each fiscal year and notify the field of any necessary action  if the 2,700 statutory limit is being approached.\u201d However, in analyzing  VR&E\u2019s administrative data, we found that VR&E counts the number of IL  plans developed annually and not the number of individual veterans  admitted to the track. VR&E officials told us that the law does not limit the  number of IL plans that can be developed for a veteran in a single fiscal  year. Because multiple IL plans can be developed for an individual  veteran during the same fiscal year, veterans with multiple plans are  counted more than once towards the statutory cap by CWINRS. Based on  data from CWINRS, 403 (4 percent) of the 9,215 veterans beginning an IL  plan during fiscal years 2008 through 2011 had more than one plan  during that time. About 22 percent of these veterans had more than one  IL plan in the same fiscal year. From fiscal years 2008 through 2011,  VR&E did not exceed the statutory cap (see fig. 16).", "Moreover, VR&E officials indicated that they were unaware that CWINRS  was calculating the number of plans and not individual veterans. As a  result, VR&E lacks complete information on the number of veterans it is  serving through the IL track at any given time\u2014information it could use to  better manage staff, workloads, and program resources. According to the  standards for internal control, it is important for program managers to  have reliable and timely \u201coperational\u201d information to ensure agency goals  are met, resources are used efficiently and effectively, and requirements  under various laws and regulations are being complied with.", "Finally, recent evaluations of CWINRS have determined that the system  does not meet VR&E\u2019s current needs and limits its oversight abilities  because important data elements are not captured to support the  agency\u2019s \u201cevolving business needs.\u201d According to a 2012 VR&E report,  VR&E plans to improve CWINRS by (1) increasing data automation to  reduce instances of human error, and (2) enhancing system controls to  improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the data, among other  improvements. However, it appears that the CWINRS redesign will not  enable VR&E to obtain data on IL track expenditures from the system or  to use the system to accurately and efficiently track the types of goods  and services the IL track provides. While officials told us that they plan to  modify the system to enable them to track individual veterans served  through the IL track, they could provide no time frame for this project and  noted that it could take up to 3 years to obtain funding for it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VR&E\u2019s IL track can provide a wide range of benefits to help veterans  with service-connected disabilities maximize their ability to live  independently when the achievement of an employment goal is not  currently feasible.

Consequently, adequate oversight at the national  level is extremely important in ensuring that IL track case management  requirements are met, the track is administered consistently across  regions, expenditures for goods and services are appropriate, and critical  IL track information is collected and used.", "In this context and absent better coordination with VHA, VR&E will  continue to face challenges in ensuring goods and services for IL track  veterans are provided by VHA, when appropriate, in a timely manner.  With regard to VR&E\u2019s Central Office oversight, its current policy  governing the review and approval of expenditures might not effectively  mitigate the risk of fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement inherent in  activities, such as the development and implementation of IL plans, where  there are few limitations on the types and cost of goods and services that  can be provided. Furthermore, without collecting information on cost and  the types of benefits regional offices provide to IL track veterans, and  maintaining an information system that ensures IL track data are recorded  consistently and are accurate and complete, VR&E cannot effectively  oversee the performance and activities of its IL track. Finally, as more  servicemembers from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan transition into  civilian life and veterans\u2019 programs and as the overall veteran population  ages, the demand for IL services will likely increase.

We combined a number of offices that served less  than 50 veterans into a residual group, in order to ensure sufficient  sample within each office. The sample sizes within offices ranged from 58  service, and indicators for sex, branch of service, era of service,  education, year the IL plan began, partial vs. full disability, and disability  type. We coded the covariates such that the baseline reference veteran  was substantively meaningful\u2014a male Army veteran with a high school  education, who served in the Vietnam era, entered an IL plan in fiscal  year 2008, was processed by the Detroit Regional Office, and had a full  musculoskeletal disability\u2014either by setting values of categorical  variables to the appropriate levels or by centering continuous variables at  their means. All categorical variables included levels for missing data.", "In this application, the proportional hazard structure of the model implies  that the instantaneous rate of rehabilitation at any time during an IL plan,  or the hazard, varies across values of the covariates by a constant  amount over time. For example, the model assumes that rehabilitation  rates vary by the same amounts among veterans with different types of  disabilities after 12 months, 18 months, or any other point in an IL plan. In  our initial exploratory data analysis, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the hazard  and survival functions suggested that the hazard was not proportional  across regional offices. Using an unstratified version of the model above  that included fixed effects for regional offices, we found that the  Schoenfeld residuals for many offices were correlated with time at a  sufficiently high level to reject the hypothesis that the hazard functions  were proportional across the covariates (p < .0001). These results are  consistent with our interviews and document reviews suggesting that  program administration varied across offices, which could produce  variation in hazard functions. (The body of this report summarizes these  administrative inconsistencies in more detail.) For these reasons, we  stratified the baseline hazard function by regional office, and we used this  version of the model to calculate hazard rate ratios and elasticities, along  with their standard errors, in table 3. Under the stratified model, we failed  to reject the proportional hazards assumption for \ud835\udefc < .47.", "The estimated rehabilitation (failure) probabilities discussed in the body of  this report came from a version of the model that did not stratify by office  and, instead, assumed office fixed effects. This allowed us to calculate  illustrative rehabilitation probabilities by various follow-up points and for  specific covariate values, without having to produce 36 sets of estimates  implied by separate hazard functions for each office. The differences in  the estimated probabilities across covariate values should resemble  estimates that we would have calculated from the stratified model,  because estimates of \ud835\udefd and their variances were similar in both versions.", "The hazard rate ratios and elasticities in table 3 are consistent with our  estimated rehabilitation probabilities in the body of the report. To calculate  these probabilities, we fixed the value of each covariate at its sample  mode or mean, depending on whether the variable was categorical or  continuous. For this profile of covariate values, we calculated survival  probabilities at various times using the estimated parameters of the  unstratified model, and transformed them to failure probabilities by  subtracting the survival estimates from 1.", "We estimated a final version of the model that used neither office strata  nor fixed effects. This allowed us to estimate the association between  office workload, measured by the total number of IL plans developed from  fiscal year 2008 through 2011, and rehabilitation timeliness. Stratifying  the model by office or estimating fixed effects would have absorbed the  variation needed to estimate the coefficient on workload, as an office- level covariate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["Table 3 provides estimates of \ud835\udefd and hazard ratios derived from them,  along with standard errors and p values for the hypothesis that each ratio  equals 1.
