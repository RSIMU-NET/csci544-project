As health care costs consume an increasingly large portion of the defense budget, current DOD leadership and Congress have recognized the need to better control these costs. Section 716 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 required DOD to submit a report analyzing potential MHS governance options under consideration, and also required GAO to submit an analysis of these options. In response to this mandate, GAO determined the extent to which DOD's assessment provides complete information on cost implications and the strengths and weaknesses of potential MHS governance options. To conduct this review, GAO analyzed DOD's governance report along with supporting documents, and interviewed Task Force members."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense's (DOD) assessment of potential governance options for its Military Health System (MHS) did not provide complete information on the options' total cost impact and their strengths and weaknesses. As part of DOD's assessment, it identified 13 potential governance options for the MHS and included a limited analysis of the options' estimated costs savings and their strengths and weaknesses. All of the options would create a shared services concept to consolidate common services, such as medical logistics, acquisition, and facility planning, under the control of a single entity. DOD selected an option that would create a defense health agency to, among other things, assume the responsibility for creating and managing shared services, and leave the longstanding military chain of command intact with the services in control of the military hospitals. The National Defense Authorization Act (Act) for Fiscal Year 2012 required DOD to submit a report to congressional committees that would, among other things, estimate the cost savings and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each option. Using key principles derived from federal guidance, including cost estimating and economic analysis documents, GAO determined that DOD could have provided more information on cost implications and strengths and weaknesses in its report to Congress. Specifically, DOD did not (1) estimate implementation costs and comprehensive cost savings; (2) include a business case to support consolidating common services; or (3) include supporting quantitative data in its analysis of the options' strengths and weaknesses.", "DOD's cost analysis for its potential MHS governance options was limited In that it did not include implementation costs and only estimated personnel costs savings based on some potentially flawed assumptions, such as not using representative salaries to estimate personnel savings.", "DOD did not develop a business case analysis and an implementation strategy for its proposed shared services concept. A business case analysis would, among other things, define the services to be consolidated, cost to implement and efficiencies to be achieved and could support DOD's assertion that implementing shared services could achieve efficiencies. DOD approved a shared services concept two other times since 2006, but it has yet to develop a business case analysis that would provide a data-driven rationale for implementing the concept.", "DOD used a qualitative process with input from internal experts to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the potential governance structures. However, it did not balance this support with quantitative data as its criteria for assessing the strengths and weaknesses specified. DOD officials stated that they did not provide comprehensive cost estimates or quantitative analysis of the options because an internal 90-day deadline to report back to the Deputy Secretary of Defense did not allow enough time. However, the act requiring DOD to report to Congress was enacted subsequent to DOD's own internal assessment and did not establish a specific deadline. As a result, DOD could have taken time to conduct a more comprehensive analysis before submitting its report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop (1) a comprehensive cost analysis for its potential MHS governance options, (2) a business case analysis and strategy for implementing its shared services concept, and (3) more complete analyses of the options' strengths and weaknesses. DOD concurred with developing a business case analysis for its shared services concept. DOD did not concur with the other 2 recommendations, stating that further analysis would not alter its conclusions. GAO disagrees and believes that more comprehensive analysis will help to distinguish the differences among the costs and benefits of the options."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, the cost of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  Military Health System (MHS) has grown substantially. DOD\u2019s fiscal year  2013 budget request for health care is almost $50 billion, and is  projected to reach about $95 billion by 2030. Historical growth rates in  the MHS have been significantly higher than the corresponding rates in  the national economy. For example, from 2006 to 2011, DOD  experienced annual growth rates of 6.2 percent for purchased care and  contracts and 5.2 percent for direct care and administration, compared  with a national rate of 3.3 percent. As health care consumes an  increasingly larger portion of the defense budget, DOD leadership  recognizes the need to reduce duplication, overhead, and operate the  most efficient health system possible. Under the current structure, the  responsibilities and authorities for the management of the MHS and the  medical services it provides to over 9.7 million beneficiaries are  distributed among several organizations. Several past DOD studies have  suggested that realigning the MHS governance structure could help  control the increase in health care costs.", "Congressional leaders also have raised questions regarding rising military  health costs and the MHS governance structure. For example, the House  Armed Services Committee\u2019s Print accompanying the Ike Skelton  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 noted that DOD had not yet developed a comprehensive plan to enhance quality,  efficiencies, and savings in the MHS, and it encouraged the Secretary of  Defense to evaluate the potential operational, organizational, and  financial benefits of a unified medical command. For the past 6 decades,  DOD and Congress have undertaken many studies to attempt to  determine the governance structure of the MHS, with many of these  studies recommending major organizational realignments. However, for  several years, GAO has highlighted a range of long-standing issues  surrounding the MHS and its efforts to reorganize its governance  structure. In 2005, we identified DOD\u2019s health care system as an example  of a key challenge facing the U.S. government in the 21st century and an  area in which DOD could improve delivery of services by combining,  realigning, or otherwise changing selected support functions to achieve  economies of scale. Additionally, in our March 2011 report on  opportunities to reduce potential duplication in government programs, we  noted that realigning DOD\u2019s military medical command structures and  consolidating common functions could increase efficiencies and  significantly reduce costs.", "In June 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established a Task Force  to review various options for changes to the overall governance structure  of the MHS and of its multi-service medical markets and to provide a  report back within 90 days. The Task Force submitted a report to the  Deputy Secretary of Defense in September of 2011. Further, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 required DOD to submit a  report to the congressional defense committees to include a description of  the alternative MHS governance structures developed and considered by  the Task Force; the goals to be achieved by restructuring or  reorganization and the principles upon which the goals are based; a  description of how each option would affect readiness, quality of care,  and beneficiary satisfaction; an explanation of the costs of each potential  option considered; an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each  option; and an estimate of the cost savings, if any, to be achieved by  each option compared to the MHS in place on December 31, 2011. No  deadline for DOD\u2019s report was included in the statutory language.  Additionally, we were required to submit a subsequent report to the  congressional defense committees within 180 days from the date DOD  issued its report (March 2, 2012) reviewing, among other things, the cost  implications and strengths and weaknesses of DOD\u2019s potential  governance structures. In response to this mandate, we determined the  extent to which (1) DOD\u2019s preferred governance option, and the other  options presented in its report, change the current structure of the MHS;  (2) DOD developed a cost analysis of its potential MHS governance  options; and (3) DOD\u2019s assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of  its potential governance options is well supported and data-driven.", "We reviewed numerous federal guidance documents related to cost estimating,  accounting standards, economic analysis, and budgeting and identified key principles that  we believe can be applied to the evaluation of cost savings estimates. The guidance  documents we reviewed include: GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide,  GAO-09-3SP (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 2, 2009); Office of Management and Budget  Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget (Aug. 2011,  superseded by an August 2012 issuance); Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board,  Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 4 (June 2011); Department of  Defense Instruction 7041.3, Economic Analysis for Decisionmaking (Nov. 7, 1995); and  Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 4, Chapter  22, Cost Finding (May 2010). Although each of these documents may not apply to these  circumstances as a legal matter, we believe that they collectively contain broad themes  that can be applied to evaluating cost analyses. their analysis, and identified broad cost categories that should be  considered in the course of implementing DOD\u2019s governance  transformation. We were unable to rely on DOD\u2019s cost savings estimates  because the estimates and their supporting data were insufficient in the  key data elements needed to completely and accurately develop them as  discussed in the findings section of this report. Finally, to determine the  extent to which DOD\u2019s assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of  its potential governance options is well-supported and data driven, we  obtained and reviewed the Task Force\u2019s supporting documents including  meeting minutes, briefing slides, and the voting template for the criteria  and process used to formulate the strengths and weaknesses of the  options. We also interviewed Task Force officials regarding their  involvement in the process and how they formulated their assessments.  For each of our objectives, we limited our review to the potential overall  governance structures that the Task Force presented in its report. We did  not specifically review the proposed changes to DOD\u2019s multi-service  medical markets or to the governance structure in place within the  National Capital Region as presented in the Task Force report because  we determined these proposed changes were outside the scope of our  mandate. We conducted this performance audit from March 2012 through  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

The readiness mission provides medical services and support to the  armed forces during military operations, including deploying medical  personnel and equipment throughout the world, and ensures the medical  readiness of troops prior to deployment. The benefits mission provides  medical services and support to members of the armed forces, retirees,  and their dependents.

After  formulating criteria, the Task Force discussed each potential governance  structure in detail. Following discussion, the individual Task Force  members voted on the governance structures by scoring them according  to the criteria.

For the overall MHS, the Task Force\u2019s recommendation was to  pursue the formation of a defense health agency which would consolidate  common shared services in support of the three military departments  and to leave the medical components of the military departments as they  are currently. The rationale for this action, according to the Task Force  report, would allow DOD to create shared services, common business  and clinical practices under one leader without large-scale changes to the  MHS at this time.

DOD presented a wide range of  governance structures in its report, such as creating another unified  functional combatant command or establishing a single service in charge  of all medical operations. However, DOD\u2019s preferred option does not  require complex changes in long-established military chains of command  like some other structures would. As discussed earlier, currently the  Army, the Navy, and the Air Force manage their own personnel,  hospitals, and medical operations. The Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Health Affairs) exercises authority, direction, and control over the policies  and resources of the MHS, but does not have command and control over  the military hospitals or over the respective military departments\u2019 medical  personnel. Over the years, DOD has shifted certain responsibilities and  authorities among various MHS officials, as seen in the establishment of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) authority over the  Defense Health Program in 1991 and the TRICARE Management Activity  in 1998, both of which remain part of the current MHS. In 1991, the  Defense Health Program was established as the result of a study of  governance options for the MHS to address concerns about recurring  funding crises and concerns over the inconsistent distribution of health  care services and benefits among the different military departments. In  1992, Department of Defense Directive 5136.1 assigned responsibility for  the program to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Later,  the TRICARE Management Activity was created to reduce duplication  within management of the MHS and transfer the direct management of  several functions away from the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health  Affairs) to allow that position to concentrate on major policy and Defense  Health Program related issues and initiatives. Together, all of these  entities and their responsibilities have evolved into the current MHS  governance structure.", "The Task Force reviewed multiple versions of three basic governance  structures\u2014defense health agency, unified medical command, and single  service. The options\u2019 primary differences from the current structure of the  MHS occur mainly in three particular areas of roles and responsibilities\u2014 overall control, budgetary authority, and control of personnel. DOD\u2019s  preferred governance option is a defense health agency with military  hospitals remaining under the control of the military services. The unified  medical command options would assign the services\u2019 medical assets to a  functional combatant command. Lastly, the single service options would  assign these assets to a single military service. Figure 4 summarizes  variations of these three structures and the current structure as it has  evolved over the years, while figure 5 presents a number of hybrid  models also considered by the Task Force, such as an option which  includes a unified medical command sharing responsibilities with a  defense health agency.", "Overall control \u2013 determines policy making authority, dispute  resolution, and lines of accountability. Under the current MHS  structure, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)  exercises authority, direction, and control of policy and resources, but  DOD noted that in practice, this structure fails to take advantage of  consensus opportunities to more rapidly implement common business  processes. DOD\u2019s preferred option of a defense health agency with  military hospitals remaining under the control of the services would  establish a military-led combat support agency organized under the  Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) that would have  authority, direction, and control of shared services, health plan  management, other strategic areas, while another version of this  option would assign the proposed defense health agency control of  military hospitals. The unified medical command options would place  authority, direction, and control of the MHS with a functional  combatant commander, along with direct responsibility for execution  of health care services. This option would mark a departure from the  current separation of these responsibilities among the three military  services. The single-service options would assign responsibility for the  MHS as a whole to a designated military service Secretary who would  also command all military hospitals\u2014 a departure from the current  arrangement of split responsibility between the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Health Affairs) and the military departments. Under all  options, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) would  retain a policy-making role.", "Budgetary authority \u2013 determines the organizational entity or entities  with responsibility over the Defense Health Program appropriation. In  2007, the Defense Health Board stated in its report, Task Force on  the Future of Military Health Care, that the MHS does not function  as a fully integrated health care system and this lack of integration  diffuses accountability for fiscal management and results in  misalignment of incentives. The current governance structure vests  overall budgetary authority with the Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Health Affairs), who allocates funds to the services to execute their  respective budgets. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health  Affairs) does not have command and control over the military  hospitals or over the respective military departments\u2019 medical  personnel. DOD\u2019s preferred option of a defense health agency with  military hospitals remaining under the control of the services would  not alter this aspect of the current governance structure. An  alternative potential option of a defense health agency with the  military hospitals under the agency\u2019s control would assume direct  control of the Defense Health Program appropriation. Like the latter  option, the unified medical command options would consolidate  budgetary authority with a single official, a functional combatant  commander, along with direct responsibility for the execution of health  care, and would mark a departure from the current separation of these  responsibilities. Similarly, the single-service options would streamline  budgetary authority by vesting all such authority with a designated  military service Secretary.", "Personnel control \u2013 determines which entity has management and  supervisory responsibility over the personnel working within the MHS.  Historically, military services have exercised command and control  over their own medical personnel, and Task Force members told us  that control over the medical personnel was a sensitive issue in their  discussions. DOD\u2019s preferred option of a defense health agency with  military hospitals remaining under the control of the services would  allow the services to maintain control over their own personnel. An  alternative potential option of a defense health agency with the  military hospitals under the agency\u2019s control would allow the agency  to take control of personnel not assigned to deployable units. The  unified medical command options vary on the level of authorities  retained over personnel, as some options assign control of all forces  to the unified medical command, and others assign control of only  some personnel to the unified medical command. The single service  options provide some level of control of all personnel to the  designated single military service in charge of the MHS, with  variations of this option related to the assignment of the deployable  medical personnel assigned to their respective military services.", "DOD\u2019s potential governance options would have different effects on multi- service medical market governance, which is the management of medical  care in a geographic area where more than one service operates Military  Treatment Facilities through a common business plan and coordination of  resources. For example, a single service option would make such  coordination unnecessary, while it still might be required under a unified  medical command. In its report, DOD cites the main weakness of the  current governance of multi-service markets as the failure to fully  leverage the medical capabilities across service boundaries in a given  market to achieve efficiencies. According to DOD officials, DOD\u2019s  preferred option of a defense health agency would allow the department  to implement an enhanced management structure for the multi-service  medical markets that would drive such efficiencies while avoiding  complex changes to long-established military chains of command.  According to DOD\u2019s report, the authorities of the multi-service market  managers would be expanded to include responsibility for developing a 5- year business plan, budgetary authority for the entire medical market, and  the authority to direct personnel to work in other locations within the  market on a short-term basis, among other authorities. However, DOD\u2019s  current effort is not its first attempt at improving multi-service medical  market governance. As its report notes, DOD has experimented with  different approaches to multi-service medical markets over the past 25  years, including the 2003 establishment of Senior Market Managers  responsible for coordinating the development of a single business plan for  all Military Treatment Facilities in each such market. In 2006, the Deputy  Secretary of Defense approved the implementation of an alternative to  wholesale changes in the structure of the MHS, which included seven  targeted governance initiatives. Among other things, the initiatives  included the establishment of governance structures for two multi-service  medical markets, San Antonio and the National Capital Region, as well as  the creation of governance structures that consolidate command and  control of military treatment facilities in other multi-service medical  markets. As we reported in 2012, DOD established these structures in  San Antonio and the National Capital Region, but had made no changes  to the governance structures of other multi-service markets. Several  senior DOD officials noted that while they recognize there are efficiencies  to be gained in multi-service markets, they expressed reservations  concerning the details of DOD\u2019s plans for reforming such markets. One  senior DOD official highlighted challenges that may arise in their  operation, such as the control of medical personnel to support  deployments and other missions and coordination of market business  plans with the services\u2019 priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Did Not Present a Business Case Analysis for Its Shared Services Concept", "paragraphs": ["DOD did not present a business case analysis for proceeding with its  shared services concept common to all of the proposed governance  structures, including an estimate of costs to merge shared services  functions, operational savings to be accrued, or the likely timeframe in  which this service consolidation would achieve savings. As we have  previously reported, a business-case analysis can provide a data-driven  rationale for why an agency is undertaking a consolidation initiative, such  as a shared services concept since consolidation is beneficial in some  situations and not in others, and so a case-by-case analysis is  necessary. DOD has twice proposed this shared services concept in the  past, which would consolidate areas such as information technology,  contracting, and public health under one entity. DOD first proposed  implementation of a shared services concept in 2006 as part of a series of  seven different incremental governance initiatives adopted as an  alternative to wholesale changes in the structure of the MHS. Specifically,  implementation of the initiative would have created a Joint Military Health  Service Directorate under a joint senior flag officer reporting to the  Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), a structure not unlike  DOD\u2019s preferred option of a Defense Health Agency for its current review  of MHS governance. At the time, we recommended that DOD needed to  demonstrate a sound business case, including an analysis of benefits,  costs, and risks, for proceeding with its seven initiatives, and DOD  concurred with our recommendation. Further, we later reported that  DOD had not developed such estimates, and the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Health Affairs) had not provided guidance on how and when to  complete these initiatives. In 2012, we also reported that in the prior  calendar year, DOD approved a plan to reorganize the TRICARE  Management Activity and establish a shared services division with a new  Military Health System Support Activity as part of the former Secretary of  Defense\u2019s effort to increase efficiencies and reduce costs with the  department. As a result of this effort, DOD reduced the fiscal year 2012  Defense Health Program budget request anticipating the establishment of  the Military Health System Support Activity, but the initiative was put on  hold pending the results of the Task Force report.", "In addition to a data-driven analysis, our body of work on organizational  mergers, acquisitions, and other transformations has shown that agencies  should apply essential change management practices such as active,  engaged leadership of top leaders and a dedicated implementation team  to ensure the continued attention needed for a transformation to be  sustained and successful, among others. the implementation of its 2006 governance initiatives, including efforts to  establish a shared services directorate, DOD did not establish an  effective and ongoing communication strategy, did not establish a  dedicated implementation team, and top leadership did not provide the  sustained direction needed to maintain progress. Moreover, we also  have previously reported on the challenges that other federal agencies  have faced in attempting to specifically implement shared services. For  example, in December 2005, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) halted its eMerge program, which was expected to integrate  financial management systems across the entire department and address  financial management weaknesses, after DHS had spent about $52  million, according to officials. We noted our concern that moving  forward, DHS did not have a fully developed financial management  strategy and plan for the integration of its financial management systems  and shared services, such as information technology hosting, business  process services, and application management services.", "GAO, Highlights of a GAO Forum: Mergers and Transformation: Lessons Learned for a  Department of Homeland Security and Other Federal Agencies, GAO-03-293SP  (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 14, 2002). this concept, it did not estimate potential savings from consolidating  common services. According to DOD officials, DOD\u2019s preferred option of  a defense health agency is a significant change for the MHS because it  would allow the department to implement shared services in order to drive  the adoption of common business and clinical practices and achieve  efficiencies while not requiring complex changes to long-established  military chains of command. However, under the current governance  structure, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) has the  broad authority that could allow for the implementation of shared support  services across the MHS. As noted above, DOD has developed  proposals to exercise such authority in the past, but such proposals have  never been implemented. Further, DOD has not developed a business  case analysis for its shared services concept since it was first proposed in  2006. Until DOD develops a more detailed business case analysis, it  lacks a data-driven rationale and a strategy for proceeding with the  implementation of this concept."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Cost Analysis of Its Potential MHS Governance Options Was Limited", "paragraphs": ["CNA Center for Naval Analyses, Cost Implications of a Unified Medical Command,  2006.", "National Capital Region, the study provides several categories for  potential savings beyond headquarters personnel. For example,  health care operations savings could be accrued through  administrative consolidation between large medical facilities which  perform responsibilities on behalf of smaller clinics in the same  geographic area. CNA reported that by bridging current service  administrative boundaries which require the smaller clinics to report to  larger facilities of the same service, potential savings could be  accrued by designating a single facility in a geographic area to  perform technical, legal, and administrative functions on behalf of all  nearby clinics, regardless of service affiliation. In addition, governance  reorganization may provide an opportunity to reduce infrastructure  costs, and as the CNA report notes, the timeline for realizing cost  savings could influence the amount of possible short- and long-term  savings. The difference in the areas of cost savings considered and  methodological approaches could explain the varying results of CNA  and DOD\u2019s analyses. For example, DOD estimated a net cost  increase for a unified medical command option, while CNA estimated  a net cost savings for the same option in its 2006 study. As noted  earlier, although DOD\u2019s preferred option assumes that DOD would  achieve some personnel efficiencies due to greater use of shared  services, DOD did not estimate the operational savings it expects,  such as savings from consolidated contracts.", "DOD used several potentially flawed assumptions in estimating  headquarters personnel savings. DOD used several potentially flawed  assumptions in estimating its headquarters personnel savings, and  therefore it cannot be assured that DOD\u2019s methods to estimate such  savings produced reliable results. First, DOD estimated the size of a  unified medical command by using Joint Task Force National Capital  Region Medical (JTF CapMed) headquarters as an example of a  unified medical command on a small scale. DOD estimated that given  this command performs 10 percent of MHS operations with 150  personnel, a unified medical command would require a minimum of  1,500 personnel. However, DOD did not present evidence that 150  personnel is the most efficient number of staff for JTF CapMed, and  the assumption concerning the relationship between the number of  staff at JTF CapMed and a unified medical command is questionable  because economies of scale could create efficiencies, therefore  requiring fewer personnel. Moreover, the report assumes such  economies of scale in its estimate of personnel savings from shared  services functions. Second, DOD used the services\u2019 execution of the  Defense Health Program\u2019s Operations and Maintenance budget to  determine the most efficient staffing requirements for service support  and regional commands. While these commands currently execute  only their respective services\u2019 portion of the budget, DOD estimated  the number of full-time equivalents each of these commands would  require if charged with executing the entire budget. However, in its  report, DOD undermines the credibility of this method by citing  numerous weaknesses, and characterized this approach as \u201cnot a  credible predictor of staffing requirements.\u201d Third, DOD determined  the cost of the potential options\u2019 personnel requirements by  multiplying an average of TRICARE Management Activity civilian  compensation by the number of staffing requirements. However, this  figure excluded military personnel, whose compensation is markedly  different from that of civilian personnel.", "Task Force officials stated that the internal 90-day deadline required by  the Deputy Secretary of Defense for the Task Force to complete its report  did not allow for a detailed analysis of implementation costs or a more  thorough review of possible cost savings, and that this time period also  limited the practicality of more detailed analysis. However, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which required a report  on MHS governance options to be submitted to the congressional  defense committees, was passed approximately 3 months after the Task  Force completed its review and contained no specific deadline for DOD to  submit its report. DOD chose to submit the report developed by the Task  Force in response to the Deputy Secretary of Defense\u2019s direction, along  with an additional cost analysis in response to the statutory requirement.  However, DOD could have conducted additional analysis before  submitting its report to the congressional defense committees.", "Given the concerns outlined above, DOD has not comprehensively  assessed the net costs of the various governance options. As we  reported in 2007, such information is critical to making data-informed  decisions about the structure of the MHS, especially in light of the nation\u2019s  current fiscal challenges. Past transformation experiences, such as the  BRAC process, and prior reports on MHS governance, such as the 2006  CNA study, could provide a starting point for DOD in the consideration of  possible implementation costs, cost savings areas, and methods of  estimating such cost data. DOD has selected its preferred structure, a  Defense Health Agency with the Military Treatment Facilities remaining  under the services, without the benefit of an inclusive cost analysis which  explores these areas.

For governance options that included a split  between unified medical command and military-led defense health  agency, DOD stated that these structures would effectively split the  readiness sustainment between the higher command and the services,  thereby making the development and sustainment of the medical  readiness forces more complex. However, DOD did not specifically  identify the types of complexities or provide supporting examples in which  such organizational issues have resulted in a negative impact on medical  readiness.

DOD reiterated that all of the potential  governance options under consideration include a shared services  concept and noted that as part of its implementation planning, it will  ascertain which shared services, functions, and activities will be  consolidated. Additionally, DOD stated it will produce a detailed  implementation timeline for the transfer of each such service to the  defense health agency. We agree this effort to identify which services will  be consolidated and to develop a timeline for the migration of these  services is important. DOD states that shared services and common  business practices will realize savings, but we are concerned that DOD is  moving forward in implementing its shared services concept without  knowledge of implementation costs or an estimated return on its  investment. Further, with respect to DOD\u2019s governance decisions on the  multi-service markets and the National Capital Region, DOD states that  our recommendations for additional analysis did not apply to these  reforms. We did not include these specific areas in our recommendation  because the potential governance options for the multi-service markets  and the National Capital Region were outside the scope of our mandated  review. As a result, we did not address the extent to which DOD\u2019s reform  plans for the multi-service markets and the National Capital Region may  or may not require additional analysis. However, several senior DOD  officials noted during the course of our review that while they recognize  efficiencies could be gained in multi-service markets, they expressed  reservations concerning the details of DOD\u2019s plans for reforming such  markets.", "In its non-concurrence with our recommendation that DOD develop a  comprehensive cost analysis for the MHS governance structures,  including (1) estimates of implementation costs, (2) cost savings in  additional areas such as health care operations and infrastructure  changes, and (3) and an improved estimate of personnel savings, DOD  noted that it recognizes that a more detailed and comprehensive cost  analysis of governance options could be undertaken. However, DOD  states that further cost analysis will not help to materially distinguish  among the options. We disagree with DOD and believe that more  comprehensive cost analysis will help to distinguish the differences  among the costs and benefits of the options. First, DOD did not estimate  implementation costs for any of its 13 governance options. As we  reported, significant implementation costs are a key element of a  comprehensive cost analysis, as illustrated in the case of the Base  Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, in which DOD\u2019s one-time  implementation costs increased 53 percent over the BRAC Commission\u2019s  original estimate. Second, we continue to believe that further analysis of  cost savings areas beyond personnel cost savings, such as health care  operations or reduced infrastructure, could help DOD to materially  distinguish among the governance options. Third, DOD\u2019s estimate of  personnel cost savings used several potentially flawed assumptions, and  as a result, we determined DOD\u2019s estimate to be unreliable. In its  decision to move forward with implementation of the defense health  agency, DOD not only lacks any estimate of implementation costs and  cost savings in areas such as healthcare operations and reduced  infrastructure, but also reliable estimates of personnel cost savings. DOD  also stated in its non-concurrence that its decision to affect incremental  change through the implementation of a defense health agency enjoys  the consensus of the most senior military leaders. However, the decision  for this option is based on incomplete and potentially flawed data. Absent  such information, we continue to believe that DOD lacks a sound basis  upon which to make its decision about the future of MHS governance.", "In its non-concurrence with our recommendation that DOD include  quantitative data as available in its assessment of the strengths and  weaknesses of the potential overall governance structures and conduct a  specific assessment of the degree to which the options meet the criteria  for Trained and Ready Medical Force and Quality Beneficiary Care, DOD  stated that the work of the MHS governance task force provided DOD  senior leaders with sufficient information to make decisions among near- term medical governance reform options based on a variety of criteria,  many of which are inherently qualitative in nature and would not  significantly benefit from the sort of quantitative data we recommended  that DOD include. However, DOD\u2019s own criteria for the assessment of the  potential governance structures called for the inclusion of quantitative  information, as we reported. Further, DOD\u2019s response to our draft report  did not specifically address the portion of our recommendation that a  specific assessment of the degree to which the potential governance  options meet the criteria Trained and Ready Medical Force and Quality  Beneficiary Care\u2014two of the three most important criteria according to  DOD task force members. Without inclusion of these criteria coupled with  the lack of quantitative data, it remains unclear how DOD senior leaders  have sufficient information to make decisions regarding near-and long- term medical governance reform options. Therefore, we believe our  recommendation that DOD improve its evaluation of the potential  governance structures\u2019 strengths and weaknesses by including  quantitative data in its assessment and to determine the impact on a  trained and ready medical force and the quality of beneficiary care  remains valid.", "In its comments, DOD noted that it is committed to the MHS governance  changes agreed to by the Department leadership in 2012 that are  presented in its report in response to Section 716 of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. As we noted, Section 716 required  DOD to submit a report to the congressional defense committees to  include, among other things, a description of the alternative MHS  governance options developed and considered by the Task Force; an  analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each option; and an  estimate of the cost savings, if any, to be achieved by each option. DOD  stated that to undertake the additional evaluation we recommended would  not only be time-consuming but also inherently speculative and imprecise,  and that additional analysis would not alter its conclusion about which  governance reforms to pursue in the near term. We are not suggesting  that DOD not reap the benefits of certain desirable, near-term reforms,  such as the development of a business-case analysis for its shared  services followed by its implementation, and we recognize that  implementing these near-term reforms can provide some insight into the  potential benefits of further transformation efforts. As we noted in our  report, under the current governance structure, the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Health Affairs) has the broad authority that could allow for the  implementation of shared support services across MHS, and DOD has  had an opportunity to develop a supporting business case analysis since  this concept was first proposed in 2006. However, given the complex and  costly nature of MHS, we continue to believe that changes to its overall  governance should be well thought out and analyzed to ensure that there  are significant, measurable benefits before being implemented. In  addition, the need to improve the evaluation of potential governance  options by considering critical information such as the cost of DOD\u2019s  reforms, their possible cost savings, and a thorough discussion of the  options\u2019 strengths and weaknesses would benefit DOD\u2019s decision-making  process.
