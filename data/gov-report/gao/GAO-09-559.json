At the same time, high levels of spending for health care in some parts of the country, and rapid increases in spending for physician services, have been identified as factors that threaten the long-term fiscal sustainability of the Medicare program. GAO was asked to assess beneficiary access to physician services and to identify indicators of potential overutilization of physician services. In this report, GAO (1) examines whether, from 2000 through 2008, beneficiaries had problems accessing physician services; (2) identifies areas of the country in which Medicare beneficiaries are potentially overserved by physicians; and (3) describes characteristics that distinguish the potentially overserved areas from other areas in the nation. GAO analyzed the most recent data available from several sources, including an annual Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) survey of fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare physician claims for services provided in April of each year from 2000 through 2008, the Health Resources and Services Administration's Area Resource File, and the U.S. Census Bureau."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that Medicare beneficiaries experienced few problems accessing physician services during its period of study. Very small percentages of Medicare beneficiaries--less than 3 percent--reported major difficulties accessing physician services in 2007 and 2008. The proportion of beneficiaries who received physician services and the number of services per beneficiary served increased nationwide from April 2000 to April 2008. Indicators of physician willingness to serve Medicare beneficiaries and to accept Medicare fees as payments in full also rose from 2000 to 2008. Potentially overserved areas--areas that were in the top half in both the level and growth in utilization of physician services--tend to be in the more densely populated urban regions and the eastern part of the United States. Large metropolitan areas were much more likely to be potentially overserved than rural and small metropolitan areas. Areas east of the Mississippi River were also more likely to be potentially overserved than those in the west. Potentially overserved and other areas are similar in demographic characteristics and the capacity to provide health care services. The two groups are also similar in Medicare beneficiary satisfaction with health care. In contrast, certain types of physician services, such as advanced imaging and minor procedures, are performed more frequently in potentially overserved areas relative to other areas, suggesting differences in physician practice patterns. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS noted the agency's longstanding practice of monitoring the effect of policy changes on beneficiary access to Medicare services, and stated that this report would help in that effort."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the last several years, rapid spending growth in Medicare Part B  services\u2014driven in part by growth in physician services\u2014has heightened  concerns regarding the Medicare program\u2019s fiscal sustainability.  According to the Medicare Trustees, despite statutory controls on  physician fee increases, spending for physician services has steadily  increased from about $32 billion in 1998 to about $61 billion in 2008.  Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) pays for more than 7,000 physician services  through an annually updated fee schedule. Since the early 1990s, Congress,  policy analysts, and groups representing physicians have periodically  questioned whether efforts to control spending by limiting increases in  physician fees could undermine beneficiary access to physician services.", "The Medicare physician fee schedule is updated annually by the  sustainable growth rate (SGR) system, with the intent of limiting the total  growth in Medicare spending for physician services over time. Since the  SGR\u2019s establishment, annual updates to physician fees have varied and  produced a 4.8 percent reduction in physician fees in 2002. Congressional  and administrative actions averted subsequent reductions in physician fees  for 2003 through 2009. However, concerns about access remained as the  fee updates during this period did not keep pace with the growth in  Medicare\u2019s estimated cost to physicians for providing their services. Under  current law, Medicare\u2019s fees to physicians are projected to be reduced by  about 21 percent in January 2010. Although these fee reductions may not  occur if Congress intervenes, the uncertainty surrounding physicians\u2019  Medicare fees points to the ongoing need to monitor beneficiary access to  physician services.", "Our previous work has shown that this uncertainty about physician fees  has not been accompanied by reduced beneficiary access to physician  services, as measured by changes in FFS beneficiary utilization of these  services. In 2005, we reported that utilization of Medicare physician  services increased from 2000 to 2002 and that the 2002 reduction in  physician fees did not appear to have an impact on beneficiary access. In  a 2006 report, we found no evidence of a decrease in access from 2000 to  2005, as measured in terms of utilization; our findings suggested that  beneficiary access actually increased. Specifically, during the years we  studied, relatively small proportions of beneficiaries reported problems  accessing physician services, the percentage of beneficiaries who received  physician services increased, and the number of services provided per  beneficiary increased as well.", "Although these increases in utilization demonstrated that beneficiaries  were able to access physician services, our previous work did not  determine whether all of the increases in utilization we found were  appropriate. Wide geographic variation in Medicare spending for physician  services\u2014unrelated to beneficiary health status or outcomes\u2014indicates  that in some areas of the country, health needs alone may not always  determine the level of utilization of, and therefore the amount of spending  on, physician services. These areas may be potentially overserved  compared to other areas of the nation. Some studies have shown that the  provision of more care does not necessarily mean better health care or  better health outcomes for patients and in some cases may lead to harm.  Therefore, some of the increased utilization of physician services that we  identified in previous studies may not have been warranted.", "You raised questions about Medicare beneficiary access to physician  services, as well as questions about long-term fiscal challenges for and  inefficiency in Medicare. To obtain more information on these topics, you  asked us to provide an assessment of beneficiary access to physician  services and also to identify indicators of potential beneficiary  overutilization of physician services. This report (1) examines whether,  from 2000 through 2008, beneficiaries had problems accessing physician  services; (2) identifies areas of the country in which Medicare  beneficiaries are potentially overserved by physicians; and (3) describes  characteristics that distinguish the potentially overserved areas from other  areas in the nation.", "To address the first objective, we constructed three types of indicators to  measure beneficiary access to physician services: beneficiary perceptions  about access, utilization of physician services, and indicators of physician  willingness to participate in Medicare and serve Medicare beneficiaries.  Beneficiary perceptions about access were obtained from an analysis of  the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS)  survey data from 2007 and 2008. CAHPS is an annual Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services (CMS) patient satisfaction survey of Medicare  beneficiaries. Specifically, we examined beneficiary responses to two  questions related to access to physician services. The survey questions  asked how often an appointment for routine care was available as soon as  the respondent thought necessary and how often it was easy to obtain an  appointment with a specialist; our analysis was limited to beneficiaries  who needed such appointments. The possible responses were \u201cnever,\u201d  \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201cusually,\u201d and \u201calways.\u201d We considered respondents to have  reported a major access problem when they responded \u201cnever\u201d to one of  the two survey questions. We analyzed utilization trends by examining all  Medicare claims for physician services provided in the first 28 days of each  April from 2000 through 2008. Specifically, we calculated two  measures of utilization\u2014the proportion of FFS beneficiaries receiving  physician services and the number of services per 1,000 beneficiaries who  received services. We examined these trends in both urban and rural areas  nationwide and in individual states. We also examined trends in  utilization of specific services, such as physician office visits, from 2000  through 2008. We further utilized claims data to analyze trends in the  number of physicians billing Medicare and in the proportion of services for  which Medicare fees were accepted as payment in full. (For more  information on our scope and methodology, see app. I.)", "To address our second objective, we identified areas of the country where  utilization of physician services in Medicare is potentially excessive.  Because policymakers have expressed concerns about both the level and  growth of services in the Medicare program, we incorporated both factors  in our measure of potential overservice. Specifically, we identified areas  that were both relatively high in their level of utilization and relatively high  in their growth in utilization. Using U.S. Census Bureau and Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) classifications, we classified counties into  one of four types of geographic areas: metropolitan divisions, large  metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), small MSA areas, and rural areas.  Metropolitan divisions and large MSAs (MSAs with at least 200,000  residents) each constituted a separate geographic area. We combined  smaller MSAs with other small MSAs within each state. We designated  counties outside of metropolitan divisions and MSAs as rural and  combined these rural areas within each state. This classification process  yielded 296 areas across the United States. To determine utilization status,  we measured utilization in each of these areas by examining the number of  services per beneficiary who received services in April 2000 and April  2008. We ranked the areas by their level of utilization in 2000 and the  change in utilization from 2000 to 2008. We then designated areas in the   top half of both measures as \u201cpotentially overserved\u201d areas and the rest of  the areas as \u201cother\u201d areas (for more information on the rank of each area,  see app. III).", "To address the third objective, we reviewed literature to identify and  construct area-level characteristics that could drive the use of physician  services. We then compared potentially overserved and other areas based  on these characteristics. Specifically, we examined demographic  characteristics and the capacity to provide health care services. We also  compared beneficiary satisfaction with their health care in the two groups  of areas, as measured by a beneficiary survey, and the types of physician  services provided in the two types of areas. To make these comparisons,  we obtained the most recent available data on demographic and health  care utilization capacity characteristics from the Area Resource File  (ARF), a national county-level health resource information database  produced by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of  the Department of Health and Human Services; population and income  data from the U.S. Census Bureau; data on beneficiary experiences from  the 2008 CAHPS survey; and utilization data from Medicare physician  claims from April 2008. We also analyzed and compared utilization of  specific types of physician services in potentially overserved and other  areas (see app. IV for more information).", "We took several steps to measure the reliability of data used in this report.  For the CAHPS and Medicare claims data, we reviewed the documentation  for both data sets, examined the accuracy and completeness of the data,  and interviewed experts to ensure that we were using the data  appropriately. The utilization information in claims data is generally  considered reliable, as the data are used by the Medicare program to  determine payment to health care providers and are closely monitored by  CMS and Medicare carriers. We also examined the reliability of the U.S.  Census Bureau and ARF data by reviewing documentation and checking  for obvious errors in the data sets. We found all four data sources  sufficiently reliable for this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2008 through August 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 1992, the Medicare program has used a resource-based fee schedule  to pay for physician services in the traditional FFS Medicare program. The  physician fee schedule includes three components: the relative value for  the service, a geographic adjustment, and a conversion factor. The relative  value for a service compares the resources involved in performing one  service with those of other services. There are more than 7,000 physician  services in the fee schedule and each one is assigned a relative value. The  geographic adjustment was designed to ensure that fees appropriately   reflect the geographic variation in costs associated with operating a  medical practice. Finally, the fee schedule uses a conversion factor  expressed in dollars to determine the payment rate for a particular  physician service. The conversion factor is updated annually based on  the SGR formula, which is set by law. The SGR is a spending target system  designed to control growth in spending attributable to increases in the  number of services, known as volume, and to the services\u2019 complexity and  costliness, known as intensity. Although the SGR formula has called for  negative physician fee updates in recent years, Congress has mandated  either no change or a positive update that has been less than growth in the  estimated cost to physicians for providing their services. Beginning in  2010, physician fees are projected to be reduced by 21 percent, according  to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "Medicare generally pays physicians a predetermined amount for each  service provided. Physicians who \u201caccept assignment\u201d are those who agree  to accept Medicare\u2019s fee as payment in full. The fee includes the  coinsurance amount (usually 20 percent) paid by the beneficiary.  Physicians who sign Medicare participation agreements\u2014referred to as  participating physicians\u2014must accept assignment for all Medicare- covered services that they provide to beneficiaries. Physicians who do not  sign participation agreements\u2014referred to as nonparticipating  physicians\u2014can either opt to accept assignment on a service-by-service  basis or not at all. When a nonparticipating physician accepts assignment,  the fee schedule amount, also known as the Medicare-approved amount, is  reduced by 5 percent. Medicare pays the physician 80 percent of the  reduced amount; the beneficiary pays 20 percent of the reduced amount.  When a nonparticipating physician does not accept assignment, the  Medicare-approved amount is also reduced by 5 percent, but the physician  may collect from beneficiaries a portion of the difference between his or  her charge and the Medicare-approved amount\u2014a practice known as  balance billing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Access to Physician Services", "paragraphs": ["Several recent surveys of Medicare beneficiary access to physician  services have not identified major access issues.

MedPAC found that most beneficiaries were able to schedule timely  routine appointments and find a new physician when needed. Additionally,  Medicare beneficiaries reported similar or better access to physician  services compared to individuals covered by private insurance, according  to MedPAC, HSC, Commonwealth Fund, and AARP surveys.

Specifically, some of the higher volume and intensity that drive spending  growth may not be medically necessary. Physicians have a financial  incentive to perform as many services as possible because Medicare pays  them a fee for each service provided, with little accountability for quality  or efficiency. The Senate Finance Committee has stated that the  combination of high health care spending and lagging quality is  unsustainable for both the government and patients.", "Several studies of geographic variation in Medicare spending have  concluded that some utilization may not be warranted. A February 2008  CBO report found that per capita Medicare spending varied substantially  among states, ranging in 2004 from $4,000 in Utah to $6,700 in  Massachusetts. CBO found that the price paid for health care services  and severity of illness were important factors, but cited research  indicating that these two factors together likely account for less than half  of the geographic variation in spending. CBO also found that patient  preferences and income appear to explain little of the variation and  concluded that some variation in medical practice may be attributable to  differences in the supply of medical resources, such as specialist  physicians.", "Several studies from Dartmouth have found that Medicare beneficiaries  living in areas with high levels of health care spending and utilization do  not experience better health outcomes or quality of care. One Dartmouth  study noted that Medicare spending would fall by 29 percent if spending  levels in the lowest decile of areas were realized in all higher spending  regions. Dartmouth researchers concluded that geographic variation in  Medicare spending can be attributed to how physicians respond to  technology, capital, and other resources under FFS. For example,  physicians in higher-spending regions were more likely than those in  lower-spending regions to recommend discretionary services and more  resource-intensive services. Clinical decisions are associated with  physician discretion when the evidence does not point clearly to a correct  action in a specific clinical situation. In a review of 2,500 treatments for a  variety of medical conditions, more than half were subject to physician  discretion.", "Congress has recently shown an interest in varying annual Medicare  physician payment updates by geographic area. In the Deficit Reduction  Act of 2005, Congress directed MedPAC to examine alternatives to the  current payment system, including options that varied payment updates by  geographic areas. In a 2007 study, MedPAC found that setting fee update  amounts by geographic area would recognize that practice patterns differ  regionally and therefore have different contributions to overall growth in  volume and spending. MedPAC suggested that regional updates would  improve equity across the nation and could help reduce geographic  variation over time. Congress has also held hearings on revising the  method used to update physician payments, and the Chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee has stated that reforming physician payment is  an important component of health care reform."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Indicators Show Few Problems in Beneficiary Access to Physician Services", "paragraphs": ["Together, the three types of indicators we reviewed show that Medicare  beneficiaries experienced few problems accessing physician services.

Specifically, we wanted to (1) determine  how beneficiary access to physician services has changed from 2000 to  2008; (2) identify areas of the country where Medicare beneficiaries are  potentially overserved by physicians; and (3) describe characteristics that  distinguish potentially overserved areas from other areas in the nation.", "To determine how beneficiary access to physician services changed from  2000 to 2008, we constructed three types of indicators to measure  beneficiary access to physician services: beneficiary perceptions about  access, utilization of physician services, and indicators of physicians\u2019  willingness to participate in Medicare and serve Medicare beneficiaries. To  measure beneficiary perceptions of access, we analyzed 2007 and 2008  responses to the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and  Systems (CAHPS) survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS). We used CAHPS survey data that asked  beneficiaries to describe their experiences with the Medicare fee-for- service (FFS) program. These annual surveys are a nationally  representative source of Medicare beneficiary perceptions of their access  to health care that would enable comparisons over time among states and  between urban and rural areas. Respondents were asked about their  experiences in the 6 months before the survey. CMS surveyed  approximately 431,000 FFS beneficiaries in the spring of 2007 and  approximately 306,000 in the spring of 2008. We excluded responses from  beneficiaries residing outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia  from our analysis. The number of FFS beneficiaries residing in the areas  that were part of our analysis who completed the survey was 199,000 in  2007 and 163,000 in 2008.", "We focused on two CAHPS questions that were related to beneficiary  access to physician services. The questions, reproduced in table 8, asked  about the ease of scheduling prompt appointments for routine care and  beneficiary ability to gain access to specialists. For each question, we  included only the responses from those beneficiaries who could have  encountered an access problem\u2014that is, those who reported trying to  schedule an appointment with any doctor and those who attempted to  make an appointment to see a specialist. For example, we include  responses to the specialist access question only for those beneficiaries  who answered in a prior survey question that they needed to see a  specialist in the past 6 months. We calculated the proportion of  respondents who responded the most negatively\u2014those who responded  that they were \u201cnever\u201d able to schedule an appointment as soon as they  thought they needed it.", "We also examined whether these responses varied by state or between  urban and rural areas nationwide.", "To analyze Medicare beneficiary access to physician services based on  their utilization of services, we used Medicare Part B claims data from the  National Claims History (NCH) files. We constructed data sets for   100 percent of Medicare claims for physician services performed by  physicians in the first 28 days of April of 2000 through 2008, which yielded  more than 60 million claims per year. These claims represent an annual  snapshot of beneficiary access to physician services for each of the   9 years. We selected April to allow time for the annual fee updates to be  implemented beginning January 1 and for physician behavior to adjust to  the new fees. To avoid \u201ccalendar bias\u201d\u2014that is, the occurrence of more  weekdays in April in one year compared to another\u2014and to create an  equal number of weekdays in each year\u2019s data set, we limited each year\u2019s  claims to services performed within the first 28 days of the month. These  data encompass several periods: 2 years in which fee increases were  greater than the increase in the estimated cost of providing services (2000  and 2001), 1 year in which fees decreased (2002), and 6 years in which fee  increases were less than the growth in the estimated cost of providing  services (2003 through 2008). We established a consistent cutoff date (the  last Friday in September of each year) for each year\u2019s data file and only  included those claims for April services that had been processed by that  date. Because claims continue to accrete in the data files, this step was  necessary to ensure that earlier years were not more complete than later  years. To determine the number of FFS beneficiaries, we used the April  enrollment data from the Denominator file\u2014a database that contains  enrollment data and entitlement status for all Medicare beneficiaries  enrolled, entitled, or both in each month in a given year. In addition, on the  basis of beneficiary location, we associated each service with an urban or  rural location, using the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  classification of metropolitan statistical areas (MSA). We constructed  multiple utilization measures to determine whether Medicare beneficiaries  experienced changes in their access to physician services; these indicators  included  the percentage of Medicare FFS beneficiaries obtaining services in April of  each year and the number of physician services per 1,000 beneficiaries who received  services.", "We analyzed these utilization measures nationally, for urban and rural  areas within each state, and for specific services, such as office visits for  new and established patients and emergency room visits. Using MSAs, we  classified the nation\u2019s counties as urban or rural, consolidated the urban  counties and rural counties in each state and the District of Columbia, and  created 99 geographic areas to analyze access at a subnational level.", "To indicate physicians\u2019 willingness to participate in Medicare, we  determined the number of physicians billing Medicare from 2000 through  2007, whether services were performed by participating or  nonparticipating physicians, and whether claims for physician services  were paid on assignment or not on assignment. We did not adjust the data  for factors that could affect the provision and use of physician services,  such as incidence of illness or coverage of new benefits.", "To identify areas of the country where Medicare beneficiaries are  potentially overserved by physicians, we identified areas of the country  where utilization of physician services in Medicare is potentially excessive.  Because policymakers have expressed concerns about both the level and  growth of services in the Medicare program, we incorporated both factors  in our measure of potential overservice. Specifically, we identified areas  that were both relatively high in their level of utilization and relatively high  in their growth in utilization. We analyzed one of our access indicators,  services per beneficiary served, to measure potential overutilization. Using  the U.S. Census Bureau and OMB classifications, we divided states into  urban and rural areas and made additional distinctions among urban areas,  allowing us to classify counties into one of four types of areas, as shown in  table 9.", "We did not allow areas to cross state lines, so a metropolitan division or  MSA that crossed state lines was subdivided into separate areas for each  state. We examined a total of 296 areas, ranking them by their level of  utilization in 2000 and their change in utilization from 2000 to 2008. To  determine an area\u2019s utilization status, we designated areas in the top half  of both measures as \u201cpotentially overserved\u201d and the rest as \u201cother\u201d areas.  (See table 10.) This method resulted in 72 of the 296 areas being  designated as potentially overserved.", "To describe characteristics that distinguish potentially overserved areas  from other areas in the nation, we reviewed literature to identify  characteristics that could drive the use of physician services. Using the  most recently available data sources, we constructed several area-level  characteristics and compared them between potentially overserved areas  and all other areas. Specifically we compared various demographic  characteristics and compared the capacity to provide health care  services\u2014both of which are factors that could drive the use of physician  services. We also compared beneficiary satisfaction with their health care  and the types of physician services provided in the two types of areas. We  examined the provision of physician services broadly. However, our  review of clinical and economic studies in the literature suggested that  certain services might be or might not be prone to overuse and thus we  also compared the utilization of these services for both potentially  overserved and other areas. We obtained demographic data on mortality,  race, and education as well as data on health services capacity from the  Area Resource File (ARF), a national county-level health resource  information database produced by the Health Resources and Services  Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services;  population and income data from the U.S. Census Bureau; beneficiary age  and enrollment data from the Denominator file; and risk score data from  the CMS Medicare Advantage rate calculation data for 2009.

Therefore, when comparing various characteristics of  potentially overserved areas and other areas, we accounted for this  difference in population density by weighting the data from other areas to  reflect the same proportion of urbanization found in potentially  overserved areas.", "We also analyzed the utilization of specific types of physician services in  potentially overserved and other areas. This analysis was based on the  Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS) code assigned to each  physician service in the Part B claims data. According to CMS, the BETOS  coding system consists of readily understood clinical categories, is stable  over time, and is relatively immune to minor changes in technology or  practice patterns.
