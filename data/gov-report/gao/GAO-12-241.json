GAO has previously reported on initiatives under way to address potentially duplicative IT investments\u0097i.e., investments providing similar functions across the government. GAO was asked to review the extent to which potentially duplicative IT investments exist within three categories at selected agencies (the Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), and Homeland Security (DHS)) and actions these agencies are taking to address them.

For example, GAO identified four DOD Navy personnel assignment investments\u0097one system for officers, one for enlisted personnel, one for reservists, and a general assignment system\u0097each of which is responsible for managing similar functions. While GAO did not identify any potentially duplicative investments at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) within its sample, DHS officials have independently identified several duplicative investments and systems.", "DOD and DOE officials offered a variety of reasons for the potential duplication, such as decentralized governance and a lack of control over certain facilities. Further complicating agencies\u0092 ability to identify and eliminate duplicative investments is that investments are, in certain cases, misclassified by function. Until agencies correctly categorize their investments, they cannot be confident that their investments are not duplicative.", "DHS has taken action to improve its processes for identifying and eliminating duplicative investments. For example, through reviewing portfolios of IT investments, DHS has identified much, and eliminated some, duplicative functionality in certain investments. Additionally, DOD and DOE have recently initiated plans to address potential duplication in many of the investments GAO identified, which include consolidating or eliminating systems. While these efforts may eventually yield results, they have not yet led to the elimination of duplication. For example, while DOD and DOE have specific plans to improve their IT investment review processes, officials did not provide examples of duplicative investments that had been consolidated or eliminated.

These  areas spanned a range of government missions: agriculture, defense,  economic development, energy, general government, health, homeland  security, international affairs, and social services. Within and across these  missions, the report touched on hundreds of federal programs, including  IT programs, affecting virtually all major federal departments and  agencies.", "Specifically, we identified 34 areas where  We reported that overlap and fragmentation among government  programs or activities could be harbingers of unnecessary duplication.  Thus, the reduction or elimination of duplication, overlap, or fragmentation  could potentially save billions of tax dollars annually and help agencies  provide more efficient and effective services. For example, we reported  that, according to OMB, the number of federal data centers (defined as  data processing and storage facilities) grew from 432 in 1998 to more  than 2,000 in 2010. These data centers often house similar types of  equipment and provide similar processing and storage capabilities. These  factors have led to concerns associated with the provision of redundant  capabilities, the underutilization of resources, and the significant  consumption of energy. Operating such a large number of centers places  costly demands on the government. In an effort to address these  inefficiencies, in February 2010, OMB launched the Federal Data Center  Consolidation Initiative to guide federal agencies in consolidating data  centers.

We noted that this  limits OMB\u2019s ability to identify potentially duplicative investments both  within and across agencies because similar investments may be  organized under different functions. Accordingly, we recommended that  OMB revise guidance to federal agencies on categorizing IT investments  to ensure that the categorizations are clear and that it allow agencies to  choose secondary categories, where applicable, which will aid in  identifying potentially duplicative investments.

Without demonstrating the progress of efforts to identity  and eliminate duplicative investments, DOD and DOE will be unable to  provide assurance that they are avoiding investment in unnecessary  systems.

In commenting on the draft, DOD and DHS  generally concurred with our recommendations. DOE generally agreed  with our first recommendation and disagreed with parts of our second  recommendation. In addition, OMB provided oral technical comments that  we incorporated, where appropriate. Each department\u2019s comments are  discussed in more detail below, and the written comments are reprinted in  appendixes IV, V, and VI.", "DOD\u2019s Deputy CIO for Information Management, Integration, and  Technology within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Networks and Information Integration provided written comments, which  stated that the department agreed with both of our recommendations.  DOD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated, where  appropriate.", "The Director of DHS\u2019s Departmental GAO/Office of Inspector General  Liaison Office provided written comments, which stated that the  department agreed with our recommendation to correct the  miscategorized investments and ensure that investments are correctly  categorized. Additionally, DHS provided documentation showing that the  department had recently corrected the miscategorizations in response to  our recommendation. The department also provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "The DOE CIO provided written comments in which the department  generally agreed with the first recommendation and disagreed with parts  of the second recommendation. Regarding our first recommendation, to  identify and eliminate potentially duplicative investments as appropriate,  DOE generally agreed with the recommendation and stated that the  Office of the CIO is committed to increasing its IT investment oversight.  The department added that for the non-major investments that GAO  identified as being potentially duplicative, it will update GAO on its  progress through means other than the IT Dashboard, since non-major  investments are not individually tracked on the Dashboard. However,  DOE also indicated that it does not believe certain investments that we  identified are potentially duplicative. Specifically, DOE did not agree that  the two card issuance and maintenance, and three logical access control  investments were potentially duplicative. Rather, it stated that the  investments in these groups were listed individually on the exhibit 53 for  reporting purposes, in order to show how the funding was being  distributed at various locations. According to DOE, these costs were for  the labor involved in deploying the technology, and could not be avoided  given the separate geographical locations. We reviewed this additional  information, and subsequently removed these five investments from our  list of potentially duplicative investments.", "Regarding our second recommendation to correct miscategorizations and  ensure that investments are correctly categorized, DOE disagreed with  parts of this recommendation. Specifically, DOE agreed that two of the  four investments could be recategorized. However, it disagreed that the  two training center investments should be recategorized, and stated that  they should continue to be categorized under the Employee Performance  Management FEA sub-function because of how they are funded.  However, OMB guidance defines Employee Performance Management  as activities that enable managers to make distinctions in performance  and link individual performance to agency goals and mission  accomplishment. In other words, this sub-function involves enabling  managers to assess the performance of personnel\u2014and does not involve  providing training to personnel. In contrast, the Human Resources  Development sub-function\u2014which OMB guidance defines as  administering, delivering, and designing employee development  programs\u2014is a more appropriate category.position. Additionally, DOE stated that we identified only 4 miscategorized  investments from its total population of 876 investments. However, this  implies we reviewed all 876 investments. As stated in our report, we  looked at 19 percent of DOE\u2019s reported IT investment population, or 167  investments, and identified 4 miscategorized investments from that  subset.", "Therefore, we maintain our  In addition, DOE stated that in our September 2011 report we highlighted  limitations in OMB\u2019s guidance regarding proper categorization of  investments and further stated that, while OMB agreed to make  improvements to the guidance, agencies and OMB did not have time to  implement the changes before our new audit began. In our September  report, we noted that, under OMB\u2019s guidance, agencies were unable to  designate a secondary category, in addition to the primary category for  each of the investments. However, in this report, our concern is with the  accuracy of agencies\u2019 selections of the primary categories for certain  investments. These are two independent concerns with investment  categorization\u2014both of which need to be addressed and are not  necessarily dependent on each other. In other words, regardless of  whether agencies are able to designate a secondary category, in addition  to a primary category, it is still critically important that the primary  category is accurate.", "DOE made several additional comments that we address below:", "The department stated that it has implemented various investment  review processes to help identify potentially duplicative investments  and to manage these investments. We acknowledge in the report that  DOE has such processes in place, and we provide examples of the  department\u2019s existing IT investment management processes that are,  in part, intended to prevent, identify, and eliminate duplicative  investments.", "DOE stated that our draft report mentions the Federal Data Center  Consolidation Initiative but that we did not specifically discuss DOE\u2019s  accomplishment in this area. In response, we added the number of  federal data centers that DOE reportedly closed.", "The department stated that prior to the GAO audit, DOE officials  realized potential duplicative investments may exist in back-end  infrastructure and that a working group has been meeting regularly to  identify duplicative investments and investigate the possibility of  consolidating. We agree with this statement, and we acknowledge the  working group\u2019s efforts in the report. However, as we report, this  initiative has not yet resulted in the consolidation or elimination of  duplicative investments or functionality.", "According to DOE, it had developed a departmental strategy for  electronic records management whereby a small number of approved  records management applications will be identified for department- wide use. It added that the three records management investments  cited in our report will remain in place while the departmental strategy  is being implemented. In response to this comment, we updated the  report to acknowledge that the CIO stated that DOE has developed a  departmental strategy, in addition to establishing an electronic records  management working group. However, similar to the back-end  infrastructure, these efforts have not yet resulted in the consolidation  or elimination of duplicative investments or functionality, and thus,  DOE may continue investing in unnecessary systems until such  actions are taken.", "Lastly, DOE noted that in our report we discuss the Department\u2019s  TechStrat sessions related to commodity IT services but did not  discuss the TechStrat sessions conducted by its Office of  Environmental Management on its major investments. We did not add  this activity to the report, because supporting documentation was not  provided to indicate that this session was conducted to specifically  reduce duplication, rather than to review major investments with  performance problems.", "Finally, OMB\u2019s Chief Architect provided comments regarding the office\u2019s  efforts to oversee IT investments, which we incorporated, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 11 days from the  report date.

We discussed the groupings with each of the selected agencies, and we  obtained further information from agency officials. We also reviewed and  assessed agencies\u2019 rationales for having multiple systems that perform  similar functions. Additionally, when analyzing each investment\u2019s  description, we compared each investment\u2019s designated FEA primary  category and sub-category to OMB\u2019s definitions for each FEA primary  category and sub-category and determined whether the investment was  placed in the correct FEA category. We obtained additional information  from agency officials about these discrepancies.", "To identify the actions agencies have taken to address the potentially  duplicative investments we identified, we reviewed agency  documentation, such as agency memos and working group charters, and  interviewed officials.
