In 2006, GAO reported on problems with the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) WTC Federal Responder Screening Program and on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) distribution of treatment funding. GAO was asked to update its 2006 testimony. GAO assessed the status of (1) services provided by the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program, (2) efforts by CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the New York City (NYC) area, and (3) NIOSH's awards to grantees for treatment services and efforts to estimate service costs. GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed HHS officials, grantees, and others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["HHS's WTC Federal Responder Screening Program has had difficulties ensuring the uninterrupted availability of services for federal responders. From January 2007 to May 2007, the program stopped scheduling screening examinations because there was a change in the administration of the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program, and certain interagency agreements were not established in a timely way to keep the program fully operational. In April 2006 the program also stopped scheduling and paying for specialty diagnostic services because a contract with the program's new provider network did not cover these services. Almost a year later, the contract was modified, and the program resumed scheduling and paying for these services in March 2007. NIOSH is considering expanding the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program to include monitoring--follow-up physical and mental health examinations--and is assessing options for funding and service delivery. If federal responders do not receive monitoring, health conditions that arise later may not be diagnosed and treated, and knowledge of the health effects of the WTC disaster may be incomplete. NIOSH has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the NYC area, although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of these services. In late 2002, NIOSH arranged for a network of occupational health clinics to provide screening services. This effort ended in July 2004, and until June 2005, NIOSH did not fund screening or monitoring services for nonfederal responders outside the NYC area. In June 2005, NIOSH funded the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Data and Coordination Center (DCC) to provide screening and monitoring services; however, DCC had difficulty establishing a nationwide network of providers and contracted with only 10 clinics in 7 states. In 2006, NIOSH began to explore other options for providing these services, and in May 2007, it took steps toward expanding the provider network. However, these efforts are incomplete. NIOSH has awarded treatment funds to four NYC-area programs, but does not have a reliable cost estimate of serving responders. In fall 2006, NIOSH awarded $44 million for outpatient treatment and set aside $7 million for hospital care. The New York/New Jersey WTC Consortium and the New York City Fire Department WTC program, which received the largest awards, used NIOSH's funding to continue outpatient services, offer full coverage for prescriptions, and cover hospital care. Program officials expect that NIOSH's outpatient treatment awards will be spent by the end of fiscal year 2007. NIOSH lacks a reliable estimate of service costs because the estimate that NIOSH and its grantees developed included potential costs for certain program changes that may not be implemented, and in the absence of actual treatment cost data, they relied on questionable assumptions. It is unclear whether the estimate overstates or understates the cost of serving responders. To improve future cost estimates, HHS officials have required the two largest grantees to report detailed cost data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Tens of thousands of people served as responders in the aftermath of the  World Trade Center (WTC) disaster, including New York City Fire  Department (FDNY) personnel, federal government personnel, and other  government and private-sector workers and volunteers from New York  and elsewhere. These responders were exposed to numerous physical  hazards, environmental toxins, and psychological trauma. More than   5 years after the destruction of the WTC buildings, concerns remain about  the physical and mental health effects of the disaster, the long-term nature  of some of these health effects, and the availability of health care services  for those affected.", "Following the WTC attack, federal funding was provided to government  agencies and private organizations to establish programs for screening,  monitoring, or treating responders for illnesses and conditions related to  the WTC disaster; these programs are referred to in this report as the WTC  health programs. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  funded the programs as separate efforts serving different categories of  responders\u2014for example, firefighters, other workers and volunteers, or  federal responders\u2014and has responsibility for coordinating program  efforts. We have previously reported on the implementation of these  programs and their progress in providing services to responders, who  reside in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 2005 and 2006, we  reported that one of the WTC health programs, HHS\u2019s WTC Federal  Responder Screening Program, which was established to provide onetime  screening examinations for responders who were federal employees when  they responded to the WTC attack, had lagged behind the other programs  and accomplished little. HHS established the program in June 2003 and  then suspended the program\u2019s activities in March 2004, in part because of  difficulties identifying eligible federal responders and providing any  necessary diagnostic services related to responders\u2019 screening  examinations. After taking steps to address these concerns, HHS resumed  the program in December 2005; when we testified in September 2006, we  reported that the program was registering and screening federal  responders and that a total of 907 federal workers had received screening  examinations. We also reported that the National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a component of HHS\u2019s Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) responsible for administering  most of the WTC health programs for responders, had begun to take steps  to provide access to screening, monitoring, and treatment services for  nonfederal responders who reside outside the New York City (NYC)  metropolitan area.", "In September 2006 we also testified that CDC had begun, but not  completed, the process of allocating funding from a $75 million  appropriation made in fiscal year 2006 for WTC health programs for  responders. This appropriation was available to provide health care  treatment for responders, the first time an appropriation was specifically  available for this purpose. We reported that in August 2006, CDC had  awarded $1.5 million to the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment  Program from this appropriation and almost $1.1 million to the New  York/New Jersey (NY/NJ) WTC Consortium for treatment-related  activities. We also reported that CDC officials told us they could not  predict how long the funding from the appropriation would support four  WTC health programs that provide treatment services, in part because of  uncertainty about the cost of providing these services.", "You requested that we update information provided in our September 2006  testimony. Specifically, in this report we assess the status of (1) services  provided by the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program, (2) NIOSH\u2019s  efforts to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the  NYC metropolitan area, and (3) NIOSH\u2019s awards to grantees for treatment  services, as well as efforts to estimate the cost of serving responders.", "To assess the status of services provided by the WTC Federal Responder  Screening Program, we obtained and reviewed program data and  documents from HHS, including applicable interagency agreements. We  interviewed officials from the HHS entities involved in administering and  implementing the program: NIOSH and two HHS offices, the Federal  Occupational Health Services (FOH) and the Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). To assess the status of  NIOSH\u2019s efforts to provide services for nonfederal responders residing  outside the NYC metropolitan area, we obtained documents and  interviewed officials from NIOSH. We also interviewed officials of  organizations that worked with NIOSH to provide or facilitate services for  nonfederal responders who reside outside the NYC metropolitan area,  including the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Association of  Occupational and Environmental Clinics (AOEC)\u2014a network of  university-affiliated and other private occupational health clinics across  the United States and in Canada. To assess the status of NIOSH\u2019s awards  to grantees for treatment services and efforts to estimate the cost of  serving responders, we obtained documents and interviewed officials from  NIOSH, HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and HHS\u2019s  Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. We also  interviewed officials from two WTC health program grantees from which  the majority of responders receive medical services: the NY/NJ WTC  Consortium and the FDNY WTC program. In addition, we interviewed  officials from the American Red Cross, which has funded treatment  services for responders. We reviewed a 2007 report submitted to the  mayor of New York City that included an estimate of the cost of providing  health services to responders, and we attended a briefing by a NYC  official who participated in compiling that estimate. To do the work for  our review, we relied on information provided by agency officials and  contained in government publications. We compared the information with  information in other supporting documents, when available, to determine  its consistency and reasonableness. We determined that the information  we obtained was sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Those affected included people residing, working,  or attending school in the vicinity of the WTC and emergency responders.  In the days, weeks, and months that followed the attack, tens of thousands  of responders were involved in some capacity. These responders  included personnel from many federal, state, and NYC government  agencies and private organizations, as well as volunteers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Effects", "paragraphs": ["A wide variety of physical and mental health effects have been observed  and reported among people who were involved in rescue, recovery, and  cleanup operations and among those who lived and worked in the vicinity  of the WTC buildings. Physical health effects included injuries and  respiratory conditions, such as sinusitis, asthma, and a new syndrome  called WTC cough, which consists of persistent coughing accompanied by  severe respiratory symptoms. Almost all firefighters who responded to the  attack experienced respiratory effects, including WTC cough. One study  suggested that exposed firefighters on average experienced a decline in  lung function equivalent to that which would be produced by 12 years of  aging. Commonly reported mental health effects among responders and  other affected individuals included symptoms associated with post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Behavioral  health effects such as alcohol and tobacco use have also been reported.", "Some health effects experienced by responders have persisted or  worsened over time, leading many responders to begin seeking treatment  years after September 11, 2001. Clinicians involved in screening,  monitoring, and treating responders have found that many responders\u2019  conditions\u2014both physical and psychological\u2014have not resolved and have  developed into chronic disorders that require long-term monitoring. For  example, findings from a study conducted by clinicians at the NY/NJ WTC  Consortium show that at the time of examination, up to 2.5 years after the  start of the rescue and recovery effort, 59 percent of responders enrolled  in the program were still experiencing new or worsened respiratory  symptoms. Experts studying the mental health of responders found that  about 2 years after the WTC attack, responders had higher rates of PTSD  and other psychological conditions compared to others in similar jobs who  were not WTC responders.", "Clinicians also anticipate that other health effects, such as immunological  disorders and cancers, may emerge over time. Clinicians at the FDNY WTC  program found an increased incidence of sarcoid-like pulmonary disease  involving inflammation of the lungs. Of 26 cases of this sarcoid-like  pulmonary disease, 13 cases were identified during the first year after the  WTC attack and 13 cases were found during the next 4 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of WTC Health Programs", "paragraphs": ["There are six key programs that currently receive federal funding to  provide voluntary health screening, monitoring, or treatment at no cost to  responders. The six WTC health programs, shown in table 1, are (1) the  FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program; (2) the NY/NJ  WTC Consortium, which comprises five clinical centers in the NY/NJ  area; (3) the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program; (4) the WTC  Health Registry; (5) Project COPE; and (6) the POPPA program. The  programs vary in aspects such as the HHS administering agency or  component responsible for administering the funding; the implementing  agency, component, or organization responsible for providing program  services; eligibility requirements; and services. Each program uses a  variety of approaches, such as Web sites, toll-free numbers, and  community forums, to conduct outreach to eligible populations.", "The WTC health programs that are providing screening and monitoring are  tracking thousands of individuals who were affected by the WTC disaster.  As of June 2007, the FDNY WTC program had screened about 14,500  responders and had conducted follow-up examinations for about 13,500 of  these responders, while the NY/NJ WTC Consortium had screened about  20,000 responders and had conducted follow-up examinations for about  8,000 of these responders. Some of these responders include nonfederal  responders residing outside the NYC metropolitan area. As of June 2007,  the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program had screened 1,305  federal responders and referred 281 responders for employee assistance  program services or specialty diagnostic services. In addition, the WTC  Health Registry, a monitoring program that does not provide in-person  screening or monitoring, but consists of periodic surveys of self-reported  health status and related studies, collected baseline health data from over  71,000 people who enrolled in the registry. In the winter of 2006, the  Registry began its first adult follow-up survey, and as of June 2007, over  36,000 individuals had completed the follow-up survey.", "In addition to providing medical examinations, FDNY\u2019s WTC program and  the NY/NJ WTC Consortium have collected information for use in  scientific research to better understand the health effects of the WTC  attack and other disasters. The WTC Health Registry is also collecting  information to assess the long-term public health consequences of the  disaster. Clinicians who evaluate and treat responders to the WTC disaster  told us they expect that research on health effects from the disaster will  not only help researchers understand the health consequences, but also  provide information on appropriate treatment options for affected  individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Funding and Coordination of WTC Health Programs", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in October 2001 and continuing through 2003, FDNY\u2019s WTC  program, the NY/NJ WTC Consortium, the WTC Federal Responder  Screening Program, and the WTC Health Registry received federal funding  to provide services to responders. This funding primarily came from  appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of the approximately  $8.8 billion that the Congress appropriated to FEMA for response and  recovery activities after the WTC disaster. FEMA entered into  interagency agreements with HHS agencies to distribute the funding to the  programs. For example, FEMA entered into an agreement with NIOSH to  distribute $90 million appropriated in 2003 that was available for  monitoring. FEMA also entered into an agreement with ASPR for ASPR  to administer the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program. A   $75 million appropriation to CDC in fiscal year 2006 for purposes related  to the WTC attack resulted in additional funding for the monitoring  activities of the FDNY WTC program, NY/NJ WTC Consortium, and the  Registry. The $75 million appropriation to CDC in fiscal year 2006 also  provided funds that were awarded to the FDNY WTC program, NY/NJ  WTC Consortium, Project COPE, and the POPPA program for treatment  services for responders. An emergency supplemental appropriation to  CDC in May 2007 included an additional $50 million to carry out the same  activities provided for in the $75 million appropriation made in fiscal year  2006. The President\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2008 budget for HHS includes  $25 million for treatment of WTC-related illnesses for responders.", "In February 2006, the Secretary of HHS designated the Director of NIOSH  to take the lead in ensuring that the WTC health programs are well  coordinated, and in September 2006 the Secretary established a WTC Task  Force to advise him on federal policies and funding issues related to  responders\u2019 health conditions. The chair of the task force is HHS\u2019s  Assistant Secretary for Health, and the vice chair is the Director of NIOSH.

Since the beginning of the program, the provision of screening  examinations has been intermittent (see fig. 1). After the program resumed  screening examinations in December 2005 and conducted them for about  a year, HHS again placed the program on hold in January 2007. From  January to May 2007, FOH, the program\u2019s implementing agency, did not  schedule screening examinations for federal responders. This interruption  in service occurred because there was a change in the administration of  the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program, and certain interagency  agreements were not established in a timely way to keep the program fully  operational. In late December 2006, ASPR and NIOSH signed an  interagency agreement giving NIOSH $2.1 million to administer the WTC  Federal Responder Screening Program. Subsequently, NIOSH and FOH  needed to sign a new interagency agreement to allow FOH to continue to  be reimbursed for providing screening examinations. It took several  months for the agreement between NIOSH and FOH to be negotiated and  approved. After both agencies signed the agreement, FOH resumed  scheduling screening examinations for federal responders in May 2007. At  that time, there were 28 federal responders waiting to be scheduled for  screening examinations.", "The WTC Federal Responder Screening Program\u2019s provision of specialty  diagnostic services has also been intermittent. The health effects  experienced by responders often result in a need for diagnostic services by  ear, nose, and throat doctors; cardiologists; and pulmonologists. When  these diagnostic services are needed after the initial screening  examination, FOH refers responders to these specialists and pays for the  services. The WTC Federal Responder Screening Program stopped  scheduling and paying for these specialty diagnostic services for almost a  year, from April 2006 to March 2007. This occurred because in April 2006,  FOH contracted with a new provider network to provide various services  for federal employees, such as immunizations and vision tests. The  contract with the new provider network did not cover specialty diagnostic  services by ear, nose, and throat doctors; cardiologists; and  pulmonologists. Although the previous provider network had provided  these services, the new provider network and the HHS contract officer  interpreted the statement of work in the new contract as not including  these specialty diagnostic services. FOH was therefore unable to pay for  these services for federal responders and stopped scheduling them in April  2006. Almost a year later, in March 2007, FOH modified its contract with  the provider network and resumed scheduling and paying for specialty  diagnostic services for federal responders. FOH estimated that at that  time, 104 responders were waiting for appointments for these services.", "The WTC Federal Responder Screening Program was designed to provide  a onetime screening examination; however, NIOSH officials told us they  want to expand the program to offer monitoring examinations\u2014that is,  follow-up physical and mental health examinations\u2014to federal  responders. Clinicians involved in the monitoring of responders have  noted the need for long-term monitoring because some possible health  effects, such as cancer, may not appear until many years after a person has  been exposed to a harmful agent. NIOSH officials have said that to expand  the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program to include monitoring,  NIOSH would need to secure funding and determine who would provide  the monitoring services. A NIOSH official told us that one option for  funding would be for NIOSH to use some of the $2.1 million of the existing  FEMA-ASPR funding to have the WTC Federal Responder Screening  Program include monitoring. For this to happen, the NIOSH official said,  FEMA, which originally provided the funding to ASPR to establish the  program, would have to agree to change the scope of the program. In  February 2007, NIOSH sent a letter to FEMA asking whether the funding  for the program could be provided directly to NIOSH and whether the  funding could be used to support monitoring in addition to the onetime  screening examination the program currently offers, but as of June 2007,  NIOSH had not received a response from FEMA. NIOSH officials told us  that if FEMA does not agree to this arrangement, NIOSH will consider  using other funding to pay for monitoring. According to a NIOSH official, if  NIOSH either reaches a new agreement with FEMA or decides to pay for  monitoring of federal responders by itself, NIOSH would have to either  negotiate a new agreement with FOH to provide monitoring, which FOH  officials said they would consider doing, or it would have to make  arrangements with another program, such as the NY/NJ WTC Consortium,  to provide monitoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIOSH Has Not Ensured the Availability of Services for Nonfederal Responders Residing outside the NYC Metropolitan Area", "paragraphs": ["NIOSH has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring  services for nonfederal responders residing outside the NYC metropolitan  area, although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of  these services.

AOEC then  subcontracted with 32 of its member clinics across the country to provide  screening services. For its part, AOEC was responsible for establishing a  network of providers nationwide through its member clinics, referring  nonfederal responders to the AOEC member clinics for screening  examinations, working with Mount Sinai to determine responders\u2019  program enrollment eligibility, ensuring proper billing, and reimbursing its  member clinics for services.

Of the $51 million, NIOSH awarded about $44 million for  outpatient services to the FDNY WTC program, the NY/NJ WTC  Consortium, Project COPE, and the POPPA program. NIOSH made the  largest awards to the two programs from which almost all responders  receive medical services, the FDNY WTC program and NY/NJ WTC  Consortium (see table 2). Officials from the FDNY WTC program and  NY/NJ WTC Consortium expect funds they received from NIOSH for  outpatient treatment services to be expended by the end of fiscal year  2007. In addition to the $44 million it awarded for outpatient services,  NIOSH set aside about $7 million for the FDNY WTC program and NY/NJ  WTC Consortium to pay for responders\u2019 WTC-related inpatient hospital  care as needed.", "The FDNY WTC program and NY/NJ WTC Consortium used their awards  from NIOSH to continue providing treatment services to responders and to  expand the scope of available treatment services. Before NIOSH made its  awards for treatment services, the treatment services provided by the two  programs were supported by funding from private philanthropies and  other organizations. According to officials of the NY/NJ WTC Consortium,  this funding was sufficient to provide only outpatient care and partial  coverage for prescription medications. The two programs used NIOSH\u2019s  awards to continue to provide outpatient services to responders, such as  treatment for gastrointestinal reflux disease, upper and lower respiratory  disorders, and mental health conditions. They also expanded the scope of  their programs by offering responders full coverage for their prescription  medications for the first time. A NIOSH official told us that some of the  commonly experienced WTC conditions, such as upper airway conditions,  gastrointestinal disorders, and mental health disorders, are frequently  treated with medications that can be costly and may be prescribed for an  extended period of time. According to an FDNY WTC program official,  prescription medications are now the largest component of the program\u2019s  treatment budget.", "The FDNY WTC program and NY/NJ Consortium also expanded the scope  of their programs by paying for inpatient hospital care for the first time,  using funds from the $7 million that NIOSH had set aside for this purpose.  According to a NIOSH official, NIOSH pays for hospitalizations that have  been approved by the medical directors of the FDNY WTC program and  NY/NJ WTC Consortium through awards to the programs from the funds  NIOSH set aside for this purpose. As of June 1, 2007, there were 15  hospitalizations of responders, 13 of whom were referred by the NY/NJ  WTC Consortium\u2019s Mount Sinai clinic and 2 by the FDNY WTC program.  Responders have received inpatient hospital care to treat, for example,  asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and severe cases of depression or PTSD. If  not completely used by the end of fiscal year 2007, funds set aside for  hospital care could be used for outpatient services.", "After receiving NIOSH\u2019s funding for treatment services in fall 2006, the  NY/NJ WTC Consortium ended its efforts to obtain reimbursement from  health insurance held by responders with coverage. Consortium officials  told us that efforts to bill insurance companies involved a heavy  administrative burden and were frequently unsuccessful, in part because  the insurance carriers typically denied coverage for work-related health  conditions on the grounds that such conditions should be covered by state  workers\u2019 compensation programs. However, according to officials from  the NY/NJ WTC Consortium, responders trying to obtain workers\u2019  compensation coverage routinely experienced administrative hurdles and  significant delays, some lasting several years. Moreover, according to  these program officials, the majority of responders enrolled in the program  either had limited or no health insurance coverage. According to a labor  official, responders who carried out cleanup services after the WTC attack  often did not have health insurance, and responders who were  construction workers often lost their health insurance when they became  too ill to work the number of days each quarter or year required to  maintain eligibility for insurance coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIOSH and Its Grantees Have Estimated Costs of Providing Monitoring and Treatment Services, but These Efforts Have Not Produced a Reliable Estimate", "paragraphs": ["NIOSH has worked with two of its grantees\u2014the FDNY WTC program and  NY/NJ WTC Consortium\u2014to estimate the annual cost of monitoring and  treating responders. In December 2006, the agency and its grantees  estimated that the annual cost of monitoring and treating responders  enrolled in the FDNY WTC program and NY/NJ WTC Consortium,  including associated program costs, was about $257 million. In January  2007, NIOSH revised the estimate to also include the cost of monitoring  and treating responders enrolled in the WTC Federal Responder Screening  Program and nonfederal responders residing outside the NYC  metropolitan area who participate in the WTC health programs. The  estimate did not include the cost of providing mental health treatment  services through Project COPE and the POPPA program. The January  2007 estimate projected that aggregate annual costs for providing  monitoring and treatment services, along with associated program  expenses, could be approximately $230 million or $283 million, depending  on the number of responders who receive treatment services.", "To develop an estimate of outpatient treatment costs, which are generally  higher than monitoring costs, NIOSH and its grantees projected the  incidence of WTC-related health conditions among responders and the  number of responders who would likely obtain treatment. Based on this  number, they projected that in a given year,    25 to 30 percent of participating responders will have aerodigestive  (combined pulmonary and gastrointestinal) disorders that require  treatment,   25 to 35 percent of participating responders will have mental health  disorders that require treatment, and   1 to 4 percent of participating responders will have musculoskeletal  disorders that require treatment.", "To estimate treatment costs for these conditions, NIOSH and its grantees  multiplied the estimated per patient cost of providing outpatient services  by the number of responders projected to need these services in a given  year. They did not have actual cost data on these services because the  WTC health programs had not been required to report such data when  private organizations were funding the programs\u2019 treatment services. In  the absence of actual cost data, NIOSH and its grantees relied on workers\u2019  compensation reimbursement rates for specific services as a proxy for  outpatient treatment costs. They adjusted the proxy rates to reflect  different treatment utilization levels\u2014routine, moderate, or extensive  outpatient care\u2014and used their best judgment, based on experience, for  the distribution of responders into the three treatment utilization levels.  Specifically, they used the proxy rates to represent moderate utilization,  reduced the proxy rates by one-third to represent routine utilization, and  increased the proxy rates by one-third to represent extensive outpatient  care. Outpatient treatment costs were further adjusted to account for the  differences in treatment protocols and medication costs at the FDNY WTC  program and NY/NJ WTC Consortium. After estimating the cost of  providing outpatient services, NIOSH and its grantees estimated other  treatment-related expenses\u2014inpatient care, medical monitoring, indirect  costs, language translation, data analysis, and expenses incurred by  NIOSH such as for travel and telephone service. They added these  estimated expenses to the estimate for outpatient services to arrive at a  total annual cost amount.", "Several factors reduced the reliability of the January 2007 estimate. It is  unclear whether the overall estimate overstated or understated the costs  of monitoring and treating responders. First, the estimate included  potential costs that reflect certain program changes that may not be  implemented. For example, when NIOSH and its grantees projected the  cost of medically monitoring responders, the estimate assumed a more  frequent monitoring interval, which has been discussed by program  officials but has not been adopted. Similarly, they included costs for  providing monitoring and treatment services to federal responders, who  are not now eligible for such services.", "Second, NIOSH mistakenly included certain costs in the estimate.  According to NIOSH officials, the estimate included a calculation for  indirect costs associated with monitoring and treating responders.  However, NIOSH officials later learned that the workers\u2019 compensation  reimbursement rates that were used as a proxy for outpatient treatment  costs already contained an adjustment for indirect costs. As a result, total  indirect costs were overstated. In addition, the estimate included the cost  of monitoring services provided by the FDNY WTC program and NY/NJ  WTC Consortium without taking into account that these services were  already funded through mid-2009 by other NIOSH funds.", "Finally, in the absence of actual data on the cost of providing treatment  services, the estimate was based in part on two questionable assumptions.  First, when NIOSH and its grantees used the assumption that adjusting the  proxy rates up or down by one-third would account for the differences in  treatment utilization levels, there were no data to support the accuracy of  such adjustments. As a result, it is unclear whether the projections of  treatment costs have resulted in an overestimate or underestimate of  treatment costs. Second, the assumption used to estimate the cost of  medical monitoring was not consistent with the historical participation  rates reported by the NY/NJ WTC Consortium. NIOSH and its grantees  based the estimate on the assumption that every responder would keep his  or her appointment for periodic medical monitoring. However, NY/NJ  WTC Consortium officials told us that the rate at which responders have  kept scheduled appointments is 50 to 60 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Officials Have Taken Steps to Develop More Reliable Cost Estimates", "paragraphs": ["To improve the reliability of future efforts to estimate the cost of providing  services to responders, NIOSH officials and the Assistant Secretary for  Health\u2014in his capacity as chairman of the HHS WTC Task Force\u2014have  required the FDNY WTC program and NY/NJ WTC Consortium to report  detailed demographic, service utilization, and cost information.

For example, some clinical centers submitted  expense reports for only 1 quarter instead of 2. Furthermore, a NIOSH  official told us that some of the data that were compiled manually were  not accurate. According to the task force member, HHS will need at least   4 quarters of complete and accurate data before it can make reliable  estimates. This would mean that HHS may not have data needed to  develop a reliable estimate of costs until October 2008.

Federal responders are eligible only for the initial screening examination  provided through the WTC Federal Responder Screening Program and are  not eligible for federally funded follow-up monitoring examinations. In  addition, many responders who reside outside of the NYC metropolitan  area have not been able to obtain screening and monitoring services  because available services are too distant.
