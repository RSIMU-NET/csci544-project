Some DOD officials expressed concern over the impact that certain weapon limitations have on weapon operation, maintenance, and war planning. According to DOD officials, current DOD mitigation actions, as well as the successful completion of ongoing and planned NNSA efforts, should address most limitations for which the officials raised concerns. DOD officials stated that the current stockpile allows sufficient flexibility to mitigate limitations. However, they told GAO that there may be less flexibility in the future as the stockpile continues to age and decreases in size. For each weapon system, NNSA provides DOD with guidance containing additional information on nuclear weapon limitations. However, GAO found that this guidance does not cover all limitations and some DOD officials said that it may not provide them with relevant information for some limitations. Specifically, the guidance addresses approximately 60 percent of all limitations but does not include limitations based on certain weapon components. In addition, one senior DOD official stated that the guidance did not help clarify the potential impact that a particular limitation may have on weapon operation and maintenance. The applicable military service is now conducting its own analysis of this limitation\u0092s potential impact. Furthermore, the national laboratories identified four existing weapon limitations (8 percent of all limitations) that are no longer valid because, among other reasons, corrective action to address the limitations is complete. In addition, it is uncertain if an ongoing DOD and NNSA review of nuclear weapon military requirements will be used to eliminate limitations based on potentially outdated military requirements.", "NNSA has begun to implement some recommendations from the agency\u0092s draft October 2010 management review of the nuclear stockpile surveillance program but has not developed a corrective action plan to guide its multiple actions. For example, NNSA (1) created and staffed the position of Senior Technical Advisor for Surveillance in response to the review\u0092s recommendation to establish strong NNSA leadership and (2) established a formal process for setting surveillance testing requirements. National laboratory and DOD officials GAO interviewed generally viewed NNSA\u0092s actions as positive steps to improve the program. However, NNSA has not developed a corrective action plan, as called for by Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-123. According to this circular on management controls, federal managers are to develop a corrective action plan to address program operations weaknesses identified through management reviews, among other things. Such plans are to include specific dates, assigned responsibilities, and metrics to measure progress and hold management accountable. According to a senior level NNSA official, the agency did not implement many of the recommendations from three prior surveillance program management reviews primarily because there was no specific approach for implementation. Without a corrective action plan, it is unclear how NNSA will (1) ensure that the draft October 2010 management review\u0092s recommendations are fully implemented and (2) demonstrate to key stakeholders, such as Congress and DOD, that NNSA is committed to improving the surveillance program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other things, GAO recommends that NNSA, in appropriate collaboration with DOD, expand guidance on weapon limitations to include all limitations, revise this guidance to clearly describe the limitations\u0092 potential impacts, and develop a corrective action plan for implementing surveillance program recommendations.

The 2010 review found that NNSA lacked  a clearly defined interface between the Core Surveillance Program and  Enhanced Surveillance Campaign and that the lack of a documented  process for promoting integration, among other things, has resulted in  the underutilization of Enhanced Surveillance Campaign capabilities in  the Core Surveillance Program\u2019s testing activities. In June 2011, the  acting senior advisor told us that integration between Core and  Enhanced Surveillance is central to the surveillance program\u2019s future  and that increased integration presents a management challenge.

Corrective action plans are  to include specific dates, assigned responsibilities, and metrics to  measure progress to resolve the findings of audits and reviews. The  circular also states that agencies should periodically assess and report on  the progress of those plans.

A corrective action plan would provide a framework for such  time frames, as well as a mechanism for holding management  accountable for meeting the time frames. According to the acting senior  advisor, NNSA did not address many of the findings and  recommendations in its three previous surveillance program management  reviews primarily because the agency did not have a specific approach  for implementation. This statement echoes the 2010 draft management  review finding that the prior reviews\u2019 recommendations were not  implemented because, among other reasons, NNSA did not have a well- defined, documented process for executing the surveillance program. In  May 2011, more than 6 months after NNSA issued its draft October 2010  management review, the acting senior advisor directed the steering  committee to establish a working group to develop a plan to implement  the review\u2019s recommendations, but both the scope and time frame of this  plan remain uncertain. In the interim, NNSA officials have requested  reports on individual actions taken to implement the review\u2019s  recommendations but not on the agencywide effort to implement these  recommendations.

However, several factors  raise concerns with the limitations and NNSA\u2019s management of them.  First, some limitations require mitigation actions, which can impose  logistical burdens, increased security risks, and war planning restrictions  on the Air Force, Navy, and STRATCOM. DOD officials said they would  have less flexibility in mitigating limitations in the future should the  stockpile\u2019s size be reduced as future arms control agreements are  pursued.

NNSA  agreed in principle with the other two recommendations aimed at  clarifying the information NNSA provides to DOD on nuclear weapon  limitations. NNSA stated that it agrees with the desired outcome of these  two recommendations, but NNSA concluded that a key procedural  weakness in the process used to report on weapon limitations is the  absence of a document that formally communicates DOD\u2019s position on  limitations. NNSA said that it will ask the Nuclear Weapons Council to  require that military service lead project officers provide NNSA with a  consolidated DOD response each time a MAR is issued, and that this  response could include any concerns with nuclear weapon limitations. We  agree with NNSA that the management of nuclear weapon limitations  requires active participation from both NNSA and DOD through the  Nuclear Weapons Council.
