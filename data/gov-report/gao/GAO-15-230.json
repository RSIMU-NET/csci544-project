Many of the construction contractors that GAO spoke with said that bid shopping occurs, but could not furnish evidence of specific instances. Negotiation procedures between prime contractors and subcontractors may create the impression of bid shopping among subcontractors that submit bids. Specifically, prime contractors explained that they receive multiple subcontractor bids for each trade (e.g., electrical, plumbing) up to minutes before their proposal is submitted to the government; and they typically do not use a specific subcontractor's price in their proposal, but a price informed by the subcontractors' bids.

In these contracts, the federal  government holds the prime contractor (also known as the general  contractor in construction projects) fully responsible for project delivery.  This means the prime contractor assumes the risk of meeting contract  requirements, including quality assurance, at the committed price and  completion date, regardless of whether the contractor\u2019s actual total cost  falls short or exceeds the contract price. Once a construction contract is  awarded, the prime contractor is responsible for managing its  subcontractors. According to government officials and construction  industry representatives, typically 60 to 90 percent of the work on a  construction project is subcontracted to other companies with building  expertise in specific trades (e.g. plumbing, electrical, mechanical).

To identify  possible cases of bid shopping, we used the Contractor Performance  Assessment Reports System (CPARS)construction contracts where the prime contractors received low  performance rating in subcontractor management. From these contracts,  we judgmentally selected two contracts from each of the selected  agencies for in-depth review, based on contract award amount, type of  contract, and project location. At the Department of Defense, we selected  two contracts awarded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)  and two awarded by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  (NAVFAC). The contracts were awarded between fiscal years 2009 and  2011, and in total were valued at about $760 million.

We also obtained and reviewed  pertinent agency guidance and supplements to the FAR, Small Business  Administration (SBA) regulations, and the Office of Management and  Budget-Office of Federal Procurement Policy guide to best practices for  contract administration. To determine if the federal agencies use these  tools on construction contracts where there were subcontracting issues,  we obtained information from the same eight construction contracts  identified above to determine how agencies monitor prime contractor and  subcontractor contract performance and address unsatisfactory  performance. We reviewed documentation in the contract files such as  the solicitation, proposals (including the technical evaluation), inspection  reports, contractor performance reports, and other key documents for  identification, monitoring and compliance purposes. We reviewed  selected change orders for the contracts in our review to identify some of  the reasons for cost increases and schedule delays. We also interviewed  agency contracting officials, prime contractors and subcontractors about  their experience in the contracting process. We contacted all eight prime  contractors associated with the contracts in our sample to obtain  information on their process to select subcontractors; three responded to  our request. We also contacted 67 subcontractors for those eight  contracts and received responses from eight. Our results from the  analysis of these construction contracts are not generalizable agency- or  government-wide.

They then use the multiple subcontractors\u2019 bids to prepare  their own estimates to include in their proposal to the government. The  prime contractors we spoke with stated that they generally do not use a  specific price bid by one subcontractor, but use the bids to benchmark  their own estimates. One prime contractor representative we spoke with  stated that the company tries to obtain three bids for each trade when  developing a proposal to get a better sense of a reasonable estimate to  include in its proposal.", "We also found that the process the prime contractor goes through to  submit a proposal can be chaotic. According to both prime and  subcontractors we interviewed, subcontractors, to remain competitive,  often wait to submit their bids to the prime contractor until just minutes  before the prime contractor is required to submit its proposal to the  agency, which allows minimal time for the prime contractor to ensure that  the bids are reasonable and cover the required scope of work. Four of the  subcontractors we spoke with told us that this is one method to help  prevent their bids being shopped prior to contract award. For a large  project, the subcontractors\u2019 bids can number in the hundreds. In fact, one  prime contractor estimated that for one large project it may review  approximately 500 bids to prepare its proposal. Further, according to  prime contractors, it can be uncertain at the time their proposals are  submitted to the government that subcontractors bids include the full  scope of work, so they must do their best to quickly assess the accuracy  and completeness of the various bids they review for one trade. In  addition, a prime contractor told us that he may submit a low proposal  price depending on who he is competing against, and then hope to  negotiate further with the subcontractors during the buyout process.", "We were told by the prime contractors that not until after the government  awards the contract do they negotiate the specific tasks and prices with  subcontractors during the buyout process. The prime contractor will verify  that each subcontractor has a complete scope of work for the project, and  then select and award a contract to a subcontractor to do the work. The  subcontractors stated that it is common practice for prime contractors to  negotiate with them on the scope and price of its proposed subcontract  after contract award. Several of the subcontractors we interviewed also  stated that a subcontractor may erroneously believe that its bid is being  bid shopped, when in fact negotiation is part of the normal buyout  process. Further, most of the subcontractors we interviewed told us that if  they have not done business with and are unfamiliar with a specific prime  contractor\u2019s negotiation procedures or if a prime contractor is known to  shop bids, they may propose an inflated price under the assumption that  the prime contractor will negotiate that price down during the buyout  process. In contrast, if they are bidding to a prime contractor they know,  they are more likely to provide the best price in the first bid.

In  general, this means that the government cannot direct subcontractors to  perform tasks under the contract, and the prime contractor retains legal  and management responsibility for overall contract performance.  Agency officials also said that due to privity of contract, they hold the  prime contractor fully accountable for the subcontractors\u2019 work quality. In  our review of selected contracts, we found that agencies use a variety of  tools to monitor and assess work quality and progress on a project.  Specifically, the tools agencies use include onsite representatives,  inspection reports, and a host of reporting requirements to monitor and  assess work quality and progress. Further, the FAR generally provides  that each contract shall include quality control requirements which the  prime contractor must meet in the performance of the construction  contract. Agencies must use these quality control requirements to  assess the prime contractor and their subcontractors to ensure they meet  these standards for materials, workmanship and timeliness. Some of the  tools agencies in our review used include the following:", "Onsite representatives. We found that agency construction projects  had an onsite representative (e.g. resident engineer for construction  or COR).

The contracts in our review generally  require the prime contractor to furnish a report each day summarizing  the daily activities onsite. At the VA, for example, the reports must  show the number of trade workers, foremen/forewomen, and pieces of  heavy equipment used by the prime contractor and its subcontractors  on the prior day. The reports must also give a breakdown of  employees by craft, location where employed, and the work  performed for the day, and a list of materials delivered to the  construction site on the date covered by the report. Examples of  reports we reviewed for a NAVFAC project included the name of the  firm and its trade (e.g. carpenters and electricians), and the type of  work that they performed such as plumbing, and installing switches  and doors.", "Periodic onsite progress meetings. Some of the contracts in our  review identify what types of meetings should be held, who is to  attend, and how often the meetings should be held. But depending on  the type and complexity of the project, government contracting  personnel can require more frequent meetings with prime contractors  to monitor progress of the construction work. For example, USACE  provided us examples of minutes from biweekly coordination meetings  with the prime contractor; and biweekly meetings with the prime  contractor and certain subcontractors for the purpose of testing the  performance of certain systems, such as heating and ventilation  systems. For one VA contract, the government\u2019s representatives  required weekly meetings with the prime contractor and  subcontractors to discuss project progress and to identify problems  and solutions to those problems.", "Inspection reports. Inspections are performed at various stages of  the project to ensure that the execution of the contract by the prime  contractor (and its subcontractors) meets contract specifications.  Our review of examples of inspection reports from a couple of the  contract files showed inspections of work quality and in some cases  testing of systems, such as mechanical, fire and electrical systems,  throughout the project. The contracts may also require the prime  contractor to notify the onsite representative when inspections and  tests are to be conducted so that he or she may choose to be present  to observe.", "Deficiency reports. If the agency identifies prime contractor or  subcontractor nonconformance with contract material or workmanship  requirements, we found that a report is prepared to notify the prime  contractor of the deficiencies. The report notes who is responsible for  taking corrective action, and tracks the status of corrective actions  taken. In examples of the deficiency reports we reviewed, if the listed  deficiency in material or workmanship was not corrected, then the  deficiency stayed on the reports until it was corrected to contracting  officer\u2019s satisfaction. In the final stages of a project, a list of tasks that  need to be completed or corrected before the agency will accept the  building for occupancy is developed, called a punch list. We found  examples of punch lists in the contract files we reviewed identifying  tasks to be resolved prior to final acceptance.", "Monthly progress payment reports. The FAR provides that  agencies may make monthly progress payments to prime contractors  as the work progresses. To achieve this, agency contracting  personnel and the prime contractor agree to a schedule of tasks that  need to be performed and their value. At the conclusion of each  month, the prime contractor submits a payment request to the  contracting officer that identifies the materials delivered and the  percentage of work performed for each task. Since a single payment  can be for millions of dollars, it is important that the project\u2019s  contracting personnel adequately review the contractors\u2019 payment  requests to ensure that work is billed accurately, reflects the materials  used, and the work has been performed. If any discrepancies are  noticed they must be resolved before any payment is made. The  progress payment reports we reviewed from one GSA project  summarized the status of cost and schedule information to inform how  much of the contractor\u2019s monthly payment request should be  approved.", "Submission of weekly certified payrolls. The prime contractors  also submitted weekly certified payrolls, which includes information on  subcontractors, so that the government can check for accuracy of  wages including overtime and categorization for a particular trade  (e.g., tile setter and electrician).

Liquidated damages can result from a delay  caused by the prime contractor or one of its subcontractors.

As a result, the  Commission took a position against a mandatory government-wide  requirement for subcontract listing in federal construction. Department of the Interior and GSA previously required subcontractor bid  listing but stopped the practice in 1975 and 1983, respectively.

In  discussion with officials from some of these states, the requirement to list  subcontractors in the prime contractor\u2019s proposal has been required for  many years. Officials from one state told us that they are reconsidering  the requirement for bid listing because of the administrative burden it is  causing for state contracting officials, specifically an increase in bid  protests. According to these officials, unsuccessful contractors are using  this requirement to protest contract awards because of administrative  mistakes in contractors listing their subcontractors. This is similar to the  issue that GSA raised in the early 1980s when it stopped the requirement  to list subcontractors. However, according to officials from the other  states that we contacted that require bid listing, they have had no  complaints from prime contractors in complying with this requirement.", "Moreover, in the instances from the contracts we reviewed where cost  growth or schedule delays occurred as the result of government-driven  changes after award or unforeseen conditions, bid listing, if required,  would not have prevented these types of changes. The FAR and  agencies\u2019 acquisition regulations provide for changes to fixed-price  construction contracts, known as change orders. When the change is  driven by the government, the government generally bears the additional  cost. We found that most of the construction projects we reviewed  experienced increased costs and schedule delays as a result of  government-driven changes or unforeseen conditions. For example, on  one NAVFAC contract the government decided to incorporate furniture,  furnishings, and audiovisual equipment into the construction project,  resulting in a cost increase of $1.9 million for an $11.6 million contract.  On a GSA contract, after construction began, the government found a  different site condition than expected and added soil remediation costs of  approximately $400,000 and provided an extension of 52 days."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Bid shopping is widely considered an unethical business practice, but the  prevalence of the practice is unknown. It is difficult to determine, for a  particular contract, whether the prime contractor\u2019s selection of  subcontractors was truly a result of bid shopping or appears so due to the  chaotic nature of bidding for and buying out a federal construction project.  Specifically attributing poor performance to bid shopping is therefore also  challenging. Though considered an administrative burden, bid listing is an  optional practice available to contracting officers who determine it is  necessary to ensure that the prime contractor\u2019s proposal identifies  qualified responsible subcontractors.", "Nonetheless, in evaluating a prime contractor\u2019s proposal, the federal  government must determine that the price is fair and reasonable. After the  prime contractor is awarded a fixed-price contract, it must manage the  subcontractors to complete the job within the established contract price  and schedule. The government has additional tools available to provide  oversight to manage or correct identified deficiencies during a project\u2019s  duration. As the prevalence of bid shopping on federal construction  contracts is unknown, and bid listing requirements to prevent it have been  discontinued by federal agencies in part due to administrative burden, we  are making no recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Defense and  Veterans Affairs, and the General Services Administration for their review  and comment.
