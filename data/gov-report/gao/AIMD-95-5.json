Subsequent arrangements refer to the regulatory controls over certain cooperative arrangements for the supply, use, or retransfer of nuclear materials. Certain controls in the agreements for cooperation are designed to assure both the United States and the recipient nation or group of nations that materials transferred between parties will be used for authorized purposes only and will be properly safeguarded. (See app. I for a discussion of U.S. export license processes.) As of November 1994, the United States had 29 agreements for cooperation with other countries.", "In addition, the United States, as well as many members of the international community, relies on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to develop and enforce effective international safeguards\u2014technical measures designed to detect the diversion of significant quantities of nuclear materials from peaceful uses\u2014for nuclear materials of U.S. and non-U.S. origin.", "The U.S. agreement with IAEA, as well as some of the U.S. agreements for cooperation, requires the United States to maintain a system of accounting and control over source and special nuclear materials.

For example, as we reported in 1982 and 1985, the U.S. agreement for cooperation with the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM)does not require most EURATOM countries to inform the United States of retransfers of U.S.-supplied materials from one EURATOM country to another EURATOM country, or to report alterations to U.S.-supplied nuclear materials in most of these countries. In addition, none of the existing agreements for cooperation require foreign countries to report intracountry transfers of U.S.-supplied materials from one facility to another. Thus, the NMMSS may not contain correct and current data on either which EURATOM country has U.S.-supplied nuclear materials or at what specific facilities these materials are located.", "The NMMSS\u2019 international tracking capability also is limited because the data base does not contain certain data on the current status (i.e., whether the materials are irradiated, unirradiated, fabricated, burned up, or reprocessed) of all U.S. nuclear materials that have been exported to foreign countries, with the exception of Sweden, Australia, and Canada. The NMMSS contains status data about U.S.-supplied nuclear materials in these three countries because the United States performs annual reconciliations with them. The reconciliations compare the NMMSS\u2019 data to the foreign countries\u2019 records. The NMMSS\u2019 data are then adjusted, where necessary, to reflect the current status of U.S.-supplied materials in those countries. However, for foreign countries that do not participate in reconciliations with the United States, the NMMSS contains data only on the export transactions and on transactions requiring U.S. approval (such as retransfers of the nuclear materials) that occurred subsequent to the export, as required by the agreements for cooperation.", "The United States has also started an initial nuclear materials reconciliation with Japan, which illustrates the potential for substantial differences between data recorded in the NMMSS and the current status of U.S.-supplied nuclear materials in a foreign country. According to the NMMSS\u2019 data, Japan produced approximately 20.3 metric tons of plutonium from U.S.-supplied nuclear materials between 1978 and 1992. However, Japanese records indicated that Japan produced about 58.7 metric tons of plutonium from U.S. nuclear materials during that period. The DOE official who is performing the reconciliation cited two primary reasons for this difference. First, Japan was required to report to the United States only the amount of plutonium retransferred to other countries for reprocessing; thus, plutonium produced but not sent to other countries for reprocessing was not reported to the United States. Second, the current U.S.-Japanese agreement requires Japan to report certain retransferred-plutonium transactions under a unique quarterly reporting arrangement. The NMMSS was not modified to reflect this unique reporting arrangement and therefore did not contain data on the amount of plutonium that Japan reprocessed from U.S.-supplied nuclear materials after July 17, 1988\u2014the date of the new agreement. A DOE official stated that the NMMSS was recently modified to accept this reporting arrangement, and Martin Marietta has begun entering these data in the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliability of NMMSS\u2019 Data Contingent on Complete and Accurate Reporting", "paragraphs": ["The reliability of the NMMSS\u2019 data is also contingent on the willingness of foreign countries and U.S. and foreign facilities to report complete and accurate data on nuclear materials imports, exports, and retransfers.", "Although the NMMSS users whom we interviewed, such as members of the NMMSS Steering Committee, were generally or very satisfied with the accuracy and completeness of information from the NMMSS, DOE occasionally has found instances of incomplete reporting while reconciling nuclear materials transactions. For example, in 1990 a reconciliation of the NMMSS\u2019 data with a foreign country\u2019s records identified several transactions, such as retransfers of low-enriched uranium, that had not been reported to the United States. These transactions were subsequently entered into the NMMSS. However, because the NMMSS does not distinguish between normal transactions and those added during the reconciliation process, we could not determine how many other NMMSS entries were added as a result of reconciliations with foreign countries. A DOE official stated that many transactions may be added to the NMMSS during the initial reconciliation with a foreign country, but in later years such entries are infrequent.", "The extent to which the NMMSS can provide data on nuclear materials is also affected by the accuracy and availability of historical records. We have previously reported on problems in this area. For example, in 1985 we reported numerous errors in the international data contained in the NMMSS. These errors resulted from inaccurate data entries as well as from missing documents of some historical transactions. A DOE official told us that DOE attempted to upgrade the accuracy of the NMMSS\u2019 international data by searching for old records documenting historical transactions. This official stated that the current NMMSS data base contains the best available data on historical transactions, given the limitations of these records. Some NMMSS users also told us that although older NMMSS data are sometimes inaccurate, they are the best data available."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Used Poor Systems Development Practices in Modernizing NMMSS", "paragraphs": ["Because the NMMSS was an older system, DOE decided to replace and modernize it. However, DOE decided to merely replicate the functions of the current NMMSS, and therefore its limitations will remain. In addition, DOE did not adequately plan the development effort for the new NMMSS. For instance, DOE did not identify and define users\u2019 needs or adequately explore design alternatives that would best achieve these needs in the most economic fashion. DOE could have reduced the likelihood that these planning deficiencies would occur by following the software development requirements set forth in its own software management order."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Modernized NMMSS Will Replicate Current System\u2019s Functions", "paragraphs": ["Martin Marietta\u2019s NMMSS is housed on a mainframe using unstructured COBOL code. Performing modifications on the NMMSS and designing custom reports is difficult because of the volume and complexity of the code. As a result, DOE believed that the NMMSS\u2019 operating costs could be reduced by modernizing the system\u2019s hardware and software. In addition, NRC supported DOE\u2019s decision to modernize the NMMSS\u2019 hardware and software because it believed that the replacement NMMSS would be less costly than Martin Marietta\u2019s existing system. Accordingly, DOE\u2019s Office of Arms Control and Nonproliferation tasked the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory with developing a new NMMSS data base that would replicate the functions of Martin Marietta\u2019s NMMSS. Livermore hired a subcontractor to perform this task.

Such an analysis documents the organization\u2019s functional and informational needs, the current system and its effectiveness, and the organization\u2019s future needs. Such information is important because the more knowledge that is generated about potential system users and their operational needs, the more likely it is that the resulting system will meet the users\u2019 needs. In addition, identifying users\u2019 needs at the beginning of a development effort can help to reduce the need for later systems modifications, which are typically more expensive, and to eliminate the need for separate development efforts. Since the NMMSS\u2019 primary functions were developed during the late 1960s (for DOE facilities) and 1970s (for international reporting), it was particularly important that DOE, before the subcontractor\u2019s development effort, determine whether the NMMSS was meeting users\u2019 needs in the most effective manner, or whether changes in the design of the data base were needed to better serve its users.", "DOE could have assessed users\u2019 needs by involving the NMMSS Steering Committee, which is composed of the major NMMSS users, in the new NMMSS planning process. Although the NMMSS Steering Committee is charged with reviewing and commenting on significant proposed changes to the NMMSS, it was not consulted about the conversion from Martin Marietta\u2019s NMMSS to the subcontractor\u2019s new NMMSS. Most of the Steering Committee members were unaware that DOE was even considering a new system until months after the decision to develop a new NMMSS was initiated. Some Steering Committee members told us they felt that they were deliberately kept in the dark about the new NMMSS. For example, one Steering Committee member said he believed written notification of the new NMMSS was not provided because DOE headquarters did not want to give users the opportunity to raise any objections to the program. Another member said the Committee members felt that they had been ignored and misled about the proposed changes in the NMMSS\u2019 operations. Furthermore, several Committee members and other NMMSS users wrote to DOE\u2019s Office of Nonproliferation and National Security to express dissatisfaction that no effort had been made to involve the Steering Committee in the departmental decision-making process.", "In explaining why users\u2019 requirements were not assessed, DOE officials stated that since the new NMMSS data base will duplicate the existing NMMSS\u2019 functions, a requirements analysis was unnecessary. They stated that users will be consulted on future enhancements to the data base. However, such an approach can result in a data base that perpetuates system weaknesses and leads to inefficiencies. For example, the current NMMSS\u2019 financial module does not contain all of the inventory valuation data needed by DOE\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Since the new NMMSS is replicating the current NMMSS\u2019 functions, it too will not contain these data. In addition, because the Office of the CFO was not aware that changes to the NMMSS were being considered, in August-September 1993 the Office of the CFO sponsored, and a programmer began developing, a new system to satisfy these needs. An official within the Office of the CFO told us that if the Office had known about the new NMMSS development effort, they would have considered working with the new NMMSS development team to enhance the NMMSS\u2019 financial module, rather than developing a separate new system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Did Not Adequately Consider System Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of an alternatives analysis is to compare and evaluate the costs and benefits of various alternatives for meeting users\u2019 requirements and to determine which alternative is most advantageous to the government.

Instead, DOE\u2019s analysis was limited to a cost comparison of two alternatives: (1) to have Martin Marietta modernize the NMMSS or (2) to have the Livermore subcontractor provide a new NMMSS data base. Furthermore, this analysis did not assess the benefits of the two alternatives and was not used to determine which alternative was most advantageous to the government because it was prepared after DOE had already chosen to implement the second alternative.", "In addition, because the new NMMSS will simply replicate the current NMMSS\u2019 functions, it will be subject to the same nuclear materials tracking limitations that existed previously. Thus, the data contained in the new NMMSS on the status and location of U.S.-supplied nuclear materials internationally will continue to be limited by the data reported under the agreements for cooperation.", "In addition, the comparison of costs for the two alternatives cited in the analysis was not supported by adequate documentation and did not appropriately consider all relevant costs to ensure that DOE chose the most cost-effective alternative. Moreover, DOE had already decided to authorize the subcontractor to begin building the new NMMSS before this analysis was prepared.", "DOE\u2019s cost analysis compared the estimated development cost and fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996 operating costs of the subcontractor\u2019s new NMMSS data base with Martin Marietta\u2019s upgrade proposal for the NMMSS. However, the documentation provided to support this analysis was inadequate. Specifically, the only documentation offered in support of the new NMMSS was a one-page document provided by Livermore\u2019s subcontractor, which DOE did not independently verify.", "The cost analysis was also inadequate because it (1) did not include costs to develop the new NMMSS incurred by Livermore\u2019s subcontractor before the analysis; (2) included fiscal year 1997 costs in Martin Marietta\u2019s alternative but not in the subcontractor\u2019s alternative; (3) did not reduce Martin Marietta\u2019s estimated costs by the amount of indirect costs that will continue to be incurred by Martin Marietta (and paid by DOE) even if Martin Marietta no longer operates the NMMSS; and (4) included the NMMSS\u2019 operating costs during development in the estimate for Martin Marietta\u2019s alternative but did not include these costs in the subcontractor\u2019s estimate. DOE\u2019s cost comparison also did not take into account the considerable costs to transition from Martin Marietta\u2019s NMMSS to the new NMMSS data base housed at the Livermore subcontractor\u2019s location. Moreover, the analysis did not consider any costs that Livermore will incur managing and overseeing the subcontractor\u2019s development of the new NMMSS.", "We analyzed the cost documentation that DOE provided, taking the above factors into consideration. Although we could not determine with certainty whether DOE chose the more cost-effective alternative, since some cost data were not available, our analysis did determine that any potential savings are, at best, questionable and that upgrading Martin Marietta\u2019s NMMSS may have been a more cost-effective option.", "Because of the flaws in DOE\u2019s initial cost analysis, we asked DOE to provide us with a total life cycle cost for the new NMMSS.

Another official in this Office stated that adequate requirements and alternatives analyses (including the costs and benefits of alternatives) are required before approval is granted. However, the Office of Arms Control and Nonproliferation neither sought nor received such approval for the new NMMSS development effort.

Recognizing that the NMMSS does not contain such data, and given the NMMSS\u2019 other data limitations, the United States relies on other sources to obtain information on nuclear materials of both U.S. and foreign origin that are located in foreign countries. For example, the United States has relied on DOE and other agencies to help determine the quantity, location, origin, and characteristics of commercial plutonium in noncommunist countries. DOE also uses data provided by intelligence sources and technology to support nuclear materials nonproliferation programs.", "We did not assess the reliability of these information sources. However, according to the recent Rand study performed for the Under Secretary of the Department of Defense, no intelligence community can know of all of the major nuclear facilities and activities in certain countries. For example, according to an official from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, U.S. intelligence sources lacked reliable information on North Korea and Iraq. The Director of DOE\u2019s International Safeguards Division told us that the need for an international nuclear materials tracking system is clear and that if the U.S. system for tracking materials had been more effective, the United States might have known more about Iraq\u2019s nuclear program before Desert Storm.

Once the United States exports nuclear materials, it is the responsibility of the recipient country to adequately protect them. While no international organization is responsible for establishing or enforcing physical protection standards, IAEA has developed guidelines that are broadly supported by its member states. These guidelines include protection measures such as the use of physical barriers along the perimeters of protected areas. The United States uses these guidelines to help evaluate whether foreign countries\u2019 physical protection systems are adequate. As a result of these evaluations, the United States may make nonbinding physical protection recommendations.", "The international community, including the United States, has supported states\u2019 sovereign rights and responsibilities to establish and operate physical protection systems for nuclear materials and facilities. It is also in the best interest of the sovereign states to ensure the physical protection of these materials to reduce the threat of theft or diversion. Concerns have been expressed about the physical protection of U.S.-supplied nuclear materials at the High Flux Petten Reactor in the Netherlands. Reportedly, Dutch Marines staged a mock attack on the facility and gained access to its HEU. During this review, we visited the High Flux Petten Reactor and met with Dutch officials, who confirmed that this incident, which was intended to test the facility\u2019s physical security system, did occur. These officials also noted that physical security at the reactor has improved since the incident took place.", "Although the ultimate responsibility for the protection of nuclear materials resides with the sovereign state, according to IAEA the protection of these materials is a matter of international concern and cooperation. Nevertheless, no international organization is currently responsible for establishing physical protection standards or ensuring that nuclear materials are adequately protected from unauthorized removal and that facilities are protected from sabotage. However, beginning in 1972, IAEA convened international experts to establish and subsequently revise guidelines on the physical protection of civilian-use nuclear materials. These guidelines represent a broad consensus among IAEA\u2019s member states on the requirements for physically protecting nuclear materials and facilities. IAEA also assists states that request guidance on physical protection by providing international physical protection experts as consultants. The United States supports these assistance efforts and provides experts when requested.", "The United States also evaluates foreign countries\u2019 physical protection systems under the U.S. Bilateral Physical Protection Program.

These obligations require that the United States ensure that U.S.-supplied nuclear materials are subject to a level of physical protection that meets or exceeds IAEA\u2019s guidelines.

Of the remaining six applications, five are pending and one was withdrawn by the applicant country as of May 5, 1994. According to an NRC official, of the five pending applications, the United States is awaiting letters of assurance, as required, from the applicants before making a decision.

The subsequent arrangements and retransfer process are regulatory controls used to control the supply, use, or retransfer of exported U.S.-supplied nuclear materials and equipment. Activities that can be subject to subsequent arrangements are the reprocessing of spent fuel or the retransfer of nuclear materials to a third country. Generally, these requirements enable the United States to determine that the arrangement or retransfer will not be inimical to the common defense and security of the United States.", "As figure I.2 outlines, DOE is generally the lead agency for processing subsequent arrangements and retransfer requests and coordinating the interagency review required for these requests. These interagency reviews provide the Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and NRC the opportunity to review the request. For subsequent arrangements, the State Department must approve the arrangement in order for it to proceed, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency must determine whether or not the arrangement requires a nonproliferation assessment statement. After the interagency review, DOE will make a determination on the basis of its and the participating executive agencies\u2019 views. If, during the interagency review, any agency believes the request raises issues requiring more extensive consideration or denial, the request may be submitted for further discussion and concurrence to the Subgroup on Nuclear Export Coordination.
