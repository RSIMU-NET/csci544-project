In some cases, the individuals and companies benefiting from these services paid user fees for all or part of the cost of providing the service. In other cases, no user fees were charged. Consequently, in fiscal year 1995 the government incurred about $1.2 billion in food-related service costs that were funded through general fund appropriations.", "Reducing the federal budget deficit has become a national priority. In this context, we identified and evaluated opportunities to increase the share of funding by beneficiaries for food-related services provided by the federal government. Specifically, we identified (1) the types of food-related services provided by federal agencies; (2) the extent to which beneficiaries currently pay for such services through user fees; and (3) potential opportunities for recovering more of the service costs through user fees, as well as arguments for and against doing so."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["User fees\u2014charges individuals or firms pay for services they receive from the federal government\u2014are not new but have begun to play an increasingly important role in financing federal programs, particularly since the Balanced Budget Act of 1985. Increases and extensions of user fees could be used to help meet the nation\u2019s budget deficit reduction goals or increase the level of government services.", "User fees may be established in various ways. General user fee authority was established under title V of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA) of 1952. The IOAA gave agencies broad authority to levy user charges on identifiable beneficiaries by administrative regulation. Before its enactment, an agency generally imposed fees only if it had specific congressional authorization to do so. User fee authority may also be granted through specific authorizing legislation. For example, the Congress mandated user fees in the authorizing legislation of a new program to certify agricultural products as organically grown. These fees will be used to fund administrative and review activities necessary to the certification process. Agencies may also request approval to charge user fees by including proposals to do so in their annual budget submissions to the Congress.", "The IOAA provides general guidance to agencies but is not specific enough to conclusively determine the appropriateness or amount of a user fee in a given situation. The federal Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has interpreted the IOAA to mean that if a government service provides an \u201cindependent\u201d public benefit, no user fee should be charged for that portion of the benefit. Furthermore, according to the 1993 version of Circular A-25, the latest guidance by OMB, if private individuals or firms receive the primary benefits of the government service and public benefits are \u201cincidental,\u201d then user fees could be charged for the full costs of providing the service.", "Because the IOAA and OMB\u2019s guidance do not define \u201cindependent\u201d or \u201cincidental\u201d public benefits, interpretations of these criteria have changed over time. For example, from the inception of the IOAA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained that the public was the primary beneficiary of its services and that an independent public interest was involved, which precluded a user fee. However, FDA has recently argued that various identifiable private recipients are the primary beneficiaries of some of its services, for example reviewing applications for new human drugs, and that the existence of incidental public benefits does not preclude charging a user fee.", "To assist the agencies in determining when user fees are appropriate, in 1959 the Bureau of the Budget (now OMB) issued Circular A-25, which contained guidance for assessing user fees. The circular, last revised by OMB in 1993, states that \u201ca user charge will be assessed against each identifiable recipient for special benefits derived from federal activities beyond those received by the general public.\u201d According to OMB, a special benefit will be considered to accrue, and a user charge will be imposed when the government service enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial gains or values (which may or may not be measurable in monetary terms) than those that accrue to the general public (e.g., receiving a patent, an insurance or guarantee provision, or a license to carry on a specific activity or business); provides business stability or contributes to public confidence in the business activity of the beneficiary; or responds to the request of or is provided for the convenience of the service recipient and is beyond the service regularly received by other members of the same industry or by the general public (e.g., receiving a passport, visa, or Custom\u2019s inspection after regular duty hours).", "In determining the user fee amount, the circular states that \u201cfull costs\u201d should be charged. Full costs include (1) direct and indirect personnel costs, including salaries and expenses for fringe benefits such as medical insurance and retirement; (2) physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs, including costs for utilities, insurance, travel, and rents; (3) management and supervisory costs; and (4) the costs of enforcement, research, regulation, and the establishment of standards.", "In some cases, the government supplies a service that provides a special benefit to an identifiable recipient and also provides a benefit to the general public. According to Circular A-25, when the public obtains benefits as a necessary consequence of an agency\u2019s provision of special benefits to an identifiable recipient (i.e., the public benefits are not independent of, but merely incidental to, the special benefits), an agency need not allocate any costs to the public and should seek to recover from the identifiable recipient the full costs of providing the service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Food-Related Services Provided by Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The federal government provides food-related services in four general categories\u2014premarket reviews, regulatory compliance, import or export activities, and essential support.

For example, federal agencies need to periodically inspect manufacturing facilities and procedures to ensure the safety of food-related products.", "Import inspections and export certifications are made so that the government can attest to the quality and safety of products in international trade. For example, some countries to which the United States exports seafood require that the product be accompanied with a health certificate. Food-related products that are imported into the United States are inspected to ensure that they are safe and free of agricultural diseases and pests.", "Essential support activities, such as standard setting and laboratory analysis, support the government\u2019s main inspection, grading, and compliance programs.

The agency requires that new animal drugs are safe and effective for their intended use and that drug residues in animal tissue will not be harmful for human consumption. Food additives and colorings are reviewed primarily for safety. Before marketing a new animal drug, food additive, or color additive, sponsors are responsible for demonstrating the safety and, in the case of animal drugs, the effectiveness of their products by conducting studies and submitting data to FDA as part of a review process. FDA is responsible for reviewing these data and approving or denying the application. FDA also inspects domestic and imported food products (excluding meat, poultry, and some egg products) to ensure safety, wholesomeness, and accurate labeling.", "FDA performs a wide variety of compliance inspection activities. Among these activities, FDA periodically inspects the manufacturers and importers of food products such as cheese, canned food, and seafood to ensure that they are not contaminated with pesticides, filth, or pathogens, such as salmonella. Scientists analyze samples in FDA field laboratories, and compliance officers and others conduct enforcement actions when necessary.", "NMFS administers a voluntary seafood inspection and certification program. The purpose of the seafood inspection program is to facilitate consistent distribution of safe, wholesome, and properly labeled fishery products of designated quality. The inspection provides assurances of safety, wholesomeness, proper labeling, and quality of seafood to consumers and the seafood industry. NMFS conducts seafood inspection and grading activities for a wide variety of clients, including harvesters, processors, and retailers.

Meat and poultry slaughterhouses receive continuous carcass-by-carcass inspections, while processing plants are inspected daily. Egg products processing plants are also subject to continuous federal inspection. Inspectors collect and send product samples to FSIS laboratories that test the samples for the presence of chemical residues or pathogens. The agency also inspects imported and exported meat, poultry, and egg products to ensure that they meet U.S. standards.", "AMS is responsible for inspecting and grading agricultural commodities and products, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry, as an aid in marketing these commodities. AMS also administers marketing agreements and orders that are designed to stabilize market conditions for milk and certain fruits and vegetables and improve producers\u2019 revenues. In addition, the agency promotes fair trading practices in the sale of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables.", "GIPSA facilitates the marketing of grain, lentils, and related commodities by ensuring uniform inspection and weighing, establishing descriptive standards, and certifying quality. GIPSA also helps ensure fair business practices in the livestock, meat, and poultry industries by guarding against fraudulent practices and providing payment protection.", "APHIS has responsibility for inspecting plants and animals within the country and those that are being imported to or exported from the United States to ensure that they do not spread agricultural pests and animal diseases. APHIS also regulates the development and use of genetically modified organisms and veterinary biological products by issuing permits and licenses for these activities.

The other nearly $1.2 billion was provided through general fund appropriations. The percentage of user fee funding varied by agency and the type of service provided. Certain types of activities, for example grading, were generally funded through user fees, whereas the costs of other activities, such as compliance inspections, generally were funded through general fund appropriations.", "The percentage of an agency\u2019s food-related services funded through user charges, as shown in table 1, ranged from a high of 96 percent for NMFS to a low of 1 percent for FDA. Some agencies, such as NMFS, AMS, and GIPSA, received the majority of their funding from user fees while others, such as FDA and FSIS, did not. For example, in 1995 $116 million, or 67 percent, of AMS\u2019 funding came from user fees, mostly for grading services, while FSIS received about $84 million, or 14 percent, of its funds through user fees, mostly charges for overtime incurred on inspections of meat, poultry, and egg products.", "Certain types of food-related service costs are generally funded through user fees, other types of service costs are sometimes funded by fees, and still other services are generally provided without charge to the service recipient. The costs of the federal premarket service of grading are the ones that are most likely to be funded through user fees. Drawing on the authority provided in the laws establishing the programs, AMS and GIPSA charge fees for the direct grading services they provide. For new product reviews, another premarket activity, fees are charged for the review of some products but not for others. For example, FDA charges some user fees for new human drug and color additive reviews but does not charge for new animal drug or food additive reviews. In addition, APHIS charges for the inspection of imported animal products, but FDA and FSIS do not charge for their import inspections.", "Mandatory compliance activities, conducted during regular duty hours, were the primary food-related activities not funded by user fees at the six agencies we reviewed.

For agencies that collect partial user fees for certain services, additional fees of about $22.5 million could have been charged to cover the full costs of providing the service.

For the food-related services that we reviewed, basing user fees on the full costs of providing the service would have allowed the federal government to charge about $22.5 million more in fiscal year 1995.", "Circular A-25 states that agencies charging user fees should recover the government\u2019s full costs of providing the service, including both direct and indirect costs. According to the circular, indirect costs include among other things, essential support expenses for such things as establishing program standards. Establishing standards is essential to assessing the quality of an agricultural product or commodity. For example, in grading grain, GIPSA develops and maintains quality standards for water content, hardness, protein content, and other factors that determine the value of the grain on the market.", "In a 1981 report, we stated that public funding for standard-setting activities for grading services is appropriate as long as the standards primarily benefit commodity marketing industries as a whole and not just those requesting grading services. This view was based on OMB\u2019s original 1959 version of Circular A-25, which stated that \u201cno charge should be made for services when the identification of the ultimate beneficiary is obscure and the service can be primarily considered as benefitting broadly the general public.\u201d However, the guidance in the 1993 revision of the circular allows agencies to charge service beneficiaries the full costs of providing the service, even though the public receives incidental benefits. For example, if the grain industry as a whole obtains benefits that are not independent of, but rather incidental to the special benefits provided to grading customers, under A-25\u2019s guidance an agency should recover from these customers the full costs of providing the benefits.", "While GIPSA includes the costs of its direct grading activities in its user fee calculations, it excludes the costs of developing and maintaining the necessary standards\u2014about $4.8 million in fiscal year 1995. Believing that standard-setting costs should be included in its user fee calculations, GIPSA requested congressional authority to charge for these activities in the President\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget. However, the Congress did not approve GIPSA\u2019s request. GIPSA has again proposed charging user fees for standard-setting activities in the fiscal year 1998 budget.", "In opposition to GIPSA\u2019s proposal, the National Grain and Feed Associationsaid (1) standard-setting activities have broad societal benefits and therefore should receive public funds, (2) new user fees are likely to fall disproportionately on exporters and effectively become a tax on U.S. agricultural exports, and (3) new user fees would weaken the official inspection system because higher costs would drive some domestic grain inspection customers away from the system. The last two concerns relate to the fact that grain for export is required to be inspected by GIPSA\u2019s official grading system, but grain for the domestic market is not.", "GIPSA estimated that including standards development costs in its user fee calculations for grading services would increase the fees by about 13 percent, for example, from $31.50 per hour to $35.60 per hour. However, to lessen the burden on small firms, a fee schedule could be developed that would vary, for example, on the basis of the volume of grain inspected. According to a GIPSA official, for fiscal year 1995, including the cost of standard setting in the user fee calculations would increase the grain industry\u2019s total cost by less than 1 percent.

Sponsors of both new human and animal drugs are responsible for demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of their products by conducting studies and submitting data to FDA as part of the premarket review process. In animal drug studies, the sponsors are required to demonstrate safety both to the animal and to humans consuming edible tissue of the treated animal. FDA is then responsible for reviewing the safety and effectiveness data and approving or denying the application to market the new drugs. FDA reviews applications both for animal drugs intended for use in food-producing animals as well as drugs for pets and other non-food-producing animals.", "In the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, the Congress approved some user fees for human drug reviews, stipulating that the revenues generated were to be used to help reduce the length of time needed to review new drug applications. In fiscal year 1995, FDA charged about $71 million in user fees for human drug reviews. However, no fees are charged for the review and approval of animal drugs. In fiscal year 1995, FDA received about $20.2 million in general fund appropriations to review new animal drugs.", "FDA\u2019s review and approval of new animal drugs provides producers of these drugs economic benefits by (1) allowing them to market approved drugs and keeping unapproved animal drugs off the market, (2) increasing public confidence in the efficacy and safety of approved drugs, and (3) reducing the manufacturer\u2019s exposure to liabilities associated with unknown side effects.", "By approving a firm\u2019s new animal drug application, the government gives the applicant in effect a \u201clicense\u201d to sell its drug and potentially derive substantial profits. The approval also provides the public with assurances that the drug is safe and will not leave residues that are harmful to humans. In a 1990 report, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Inspector General concluded that regulated industries, including the animal drug industry, should contribute to the cost of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of their products because they receive benefits from FDA\u2019s regulatory activities. \u201cIn light of existing constraints on federal resources and the importance of regulating the safety and efficacy of animal drugs, providing FDA with specific authority to charge user fees for approving new animal drugs may be a viable alternative to appropriations for funding this program.\u201d", "In a November 1994 study on the new animal drug review process, FDA found that by collecting some user fees the agency could accelerate the review process, which would result in speedier market entry and, therefore, increased financial benefit to the sponsors of new animal drugs. The study estimated that the financial benefits to industry from an improved animal drug review process would range from $16 million to $55 million.", "Since publishing its 1994 study, FDA has not proposed charging user fees for animal drug reviews, and the Congress has taken no action on the matter. According to FDA, some administrative and procedural changes are being made to reduce the time required to review and approve new animal drug applications. In addition, the animal health industry has come to believe that many improvements to the review process can be made without charging fees to hire additional reviewers. Finally, according to an OMB official, currently the Congress and FDA may view other potential candidates for user fees, such as medical device reviews, as a higher priority.", "The Animal Health Institute, which represents the interests of manufacturers of animal health products, opposes user fees for the review of new animal drugs. In case user fees are considered, according to the Institute, the funds collected should be used only to meet specific goals for improving the review process.

All air passengers and commercial vehicles entering the United States are charged a user fee\u2014except those originating in, and entering from, Canada. Because Canadian agricultural products posed less risk to U.S. agriculture and thus required less frequent inspections, air passengers and commercial vehicles entering from Canada were excluded from the user fee charges.", "After reviewing the situation, in 1996 APHIS considered charging user fees for air passengers and commercial vehicles entering from Canada but did not go forward with such a proposal. According to APHIS officials, the proposal was not made because (1) agricultural products from Canada still constitute relatively little risk to U.S. agriculture, (2) the user fees would generate little revenue, and (3) the user fees may induce Canada to reciprocate by charging U.S. air passengers and commercial vehicles crossing into Canada a similar fee.", "While we do not know whether or not the Canadian government would reciprocate, we noted in our review of APHIS\u2019 budget documents that risks to U.S. agriculture have increased and thus more inspections are required of products entering the United States from Canada. According to APHIS\u2019 explanatory notes for its fiscal year 1997 budget, \u201cincreased traffic of untreated Asian and European agricultural products into the United States through Canada has created the need for increased inspections to reduce the risk of introducing exotic agricultural pests into this country.\u201d Over the past 3 years, the value of agricultural imports from Canada has increased about 29 percent, from $5.2 billion to $6.7 billion.", "We estimate that charging air passengers and commercial vehicles entering from Canada the same fees charged for entries from all other foreign countries would have generated approximately $15.1 million in new revenues from the 1995 border crossings. The costs of collecting such fees would be minimal because the collection mechanism is already in place.

From 1994 to 1997, FSIS limited its request to the authority to charge user fees for any inspections beyond a single scheduled and approved primary shift. The Congress has not approved any of these requests. In its fiscal year 1998 budget submission, FSIS expanded its user fee proposal to charge for the salaries, benefits, and related costs associated with in-plant inspections of meat and poultry at all establishments inspected by the agency. FSIS estimated that it could charge about $381 million in fees for its direct inspection services. The proposal does not include user fees for indirect costs such as the agency\u2019s administrative, supervisory, and other overhead costs.", "A variety of arguments have been raised in favor of charging user fees for mandated meat and poultry inspections. Those in favor of charging user fees argue that these inspections benefit industry by (1) providing inspected firms an economic advantage, (2) helping ensure public confidence in the safety and wholesomeness of the product, (3) performing quality control activities that are generally thought of as a plant\u2019s responsibility, and (4) protecting against unfair competition from firms that might not otherwise perform adequate safety inspections in an attempt to lower their costs.", "Meat and poultry firms are not charged for FSIS\u2019 inspections but benefit economically in several ways. First, firms must be federally inspected before they can market their products in interstate and foreign commerce. Second, firms marketing products that are not regulated by the meat and poultry acts, such as buffalo, venison, rabbit, emu, ostrich, and quail, must pay to receive an examination by FSIS and inspection stamp from USDA. (In fiscal year 1995, FSIS charged $1.1 million for these requested inspections.) Finally, FSIS officials believe that many people make their choice of meats based on the presence of a USDA stamp of inspection.", "In a 1981 report, we stated that \u201cUSDA\u2019s inspections of meat and poultry processing plant operations clearly provide broad public benefits; therefore, appropriations funding is appropriate.\u201d This view was based on OMB\u2019s original 1959 version of Circular A-25, which stated that \u201cno charge should be made for services when the identification of the ultimate beneficiary is obscure and the service can be primarily considered as benefitting broadly the general public.\u201d However, the guidance in the 1993 revision of the circular allows agencies to charge service beneficiaries the full costs of providing the service even though the public receives incidental benefits.

For example, federal inspections benefit industry by reducing the adverse publicity and potential liability costs that accompany outbreaks of foodborne illness.In its April 1996 report on FSIS\u2019 inspections, USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General also concluded that industry derived special benefits, including increased public confidence, from federal inspections of meat and poultry. The report recommended that FSIS recover the cost of these inspections through user fees.", "Moreover, not charging for meat and poultry inspections also subsidizes plants\u2019 quality control activities. We and others have testified in congressional hearings that industry should be more responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of its products. In this regard, FSIS is now considering a plan to allow plant employees to conduct some inspection activities with FSIS\u2019 oversight.", "Historically, the Congress has believed that meat inspection costs, with the exception of overtime costs and voluntary services, should be borne by the federal government, because the public was considered the primary beneficiary. In addition, the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Meat Institute oppose user fees for meat and poultry inspection. Veterinary Association officials said that they believe the public is the primary beneficiary of federal meat and poultry inspections and therefore user fees for such services are not appropriate.

FSIS estimated that a user fee covering all its inspection costs would increase consumer prices an average of 0.6 cents per pound.

While the user fees charged would vary among the numerous commodities covered, the total charges would represent about 0.05 percent of the commodities\u2019 sale value in 1995. For example, user fees for milk marketing orders would amount to about 0.03 cents per gallon of milk.", "Neither the Congress nor the affected industries have supported user fees for marketing orders. The Congress has denied AMS\u2019 request to charge user fees for these services for the last 14 years. Recently, AMS again requested user fee authority for these services in its fiscal year 1998 budget submission. The industry groups that we contacted either favored continued public funding or had no opinion on funding. For example, the National Milk Producers Federation, one of the many groups that represent growers and handlers covered by marketing agreements and orders, prefers public funding for the services.
