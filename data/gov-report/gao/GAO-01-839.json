In the  Secretariat, FAO, ILO, and WHO, where members pay regular assessments  and may make additional voluntary contributions, a formal target or range  is established to calculate geographic targets for employing the nationals of  each member state.   These targets are expressed in terms of a range of  positions to provide organizations with some flexibility in meeting these  targets, but the midpoint of the range is generally viewed as the ideal level  of representation.

However, UNHCR and WFP have  established informal targets for representation of Americans since the  United States is the largest contributor to both organizations.  UNDP  officials, on the other hand, said that while the program does not have  targets for individual countries, it seeks to achieve a \u201creasonable  geographic balance\u201d of international staff between donors and program  countries as well as \u201cequity within contribution levels.\u201d", "The organizations in our analysis with formal geographic targets for  individual countries have similar approaches to determining which  positions are subject to these targets.

In addition, all organizations except WHO disregard  positions that are financed from voluntary contributions in the formula for  calculating equitable geographic distribution targets.   Unlike the  Secretariat and the specialized agencies, UNHCR and WFP do not set aside  positions subject to geographic distribution and apply their informal  targets to all professional positions.

FAO also differs from  the other organizations in that the level of position that a country\u2019s citizens  hold, in addition to the number of positions, is considered in determining  that country\u2019s representation status.

According to American staff with whom we met, while the association of  professional staff at FAO favors spousal employment, the issue has been  extremely contentious because the union for the general services staff  strongly opposes allowing spousal employment.

Annual financial country assessments  or contributions and the organization\u2019s regular budget were also supplied.   Information was provided for the United States, Canada, Japan, and each of  the 15 member countries of the European Union.  The four organizations  that have formal geographic equitable staff representation targets\u2013the U.N.  Secretariat, FAO, ILO, and WHO\u2013provided these annual targets.   Employment data generally refer to the end of the calendar year, except for  the Secretariat, which was for June 30.  Four organizations provided annual  data on the number of geographic staff employed by grade level for the  organization as a whole and for the selected nationalities for the 9-year  period.  ILO and UNDP provided these data for 1995 to 2000 and WFP for  1996 to 2000.", "To facilitate comparisons across time and across countries, financial  assessments/contributions, equitable representation targets, and grade  level staff are expressed as percentages.  For example, the high and low  equitable representation target staff numbers for each country are divided  by the respective organization's total number of geographic staff used in  the calculation of these targets.  For the Secretariat and WHO, this is a  specified base number, which includes actual filled positions and  vacancies.  For ILO, it is the number of filled positions.  FAO provides its  targets as a position-weighted percentage.  In order to compare a country's  actual employment to the target range, the total number of national staff  employed is divided by the organization's total number that was used to  calculate the annual targets.  For organizations that do not have formal  targets\u2013UNDP, UNHCR, and WFP\u2013the organization's total number of filled  international professional positions is used.", "For the figures in appendixes II and IV, grade level employment  percentages are presented as 3-year averages for the non-overlapping  periods of 1992 to 1994, 1995 to 1997, and 1998 to 2000.  Only 5 years of  grade level data are available for WFP, 1996 to 2000.  For this organization,  the black bar in the figures describing country representation is a 2-year  average, 1996 to 1997.  The numbers in the 1998 to 2000 bars are the 3-year  average of the number of nationals employed at the respective U.N.  organization for the designated grade levels during 1998 to 2000.  The sum  of grade level employment numbers may not equal the total number due to  rounding.  The line that represents a country\u2019s financial assessment or  contribution percentage share is a 3-year average for 1998 to 2000.   Similarly, the target range is a 3-year average for 1998 to 2000.", "To calculate the grade level representation percentage, a country\u2019s grade  level employment is divided by the organization\u2019s total employment for the  corresponding grade level.  For the Secretariat and WHO, the organization\u2019s  grade level employment number is scaled up by the ratio of base number  employment to actual total employment for each year.  Thus, grade level  employment percentages are constructed in a comparable fashion to actual  total representation percentages and target range percentages.", "We compared U.S. representation in senior-level and policymaking  positions with those of four major contributors\u2014Japan, Germany, France,  and the United Kingdom.  For the period of 1998 to 2000, we calculate the  average ratio of each country's percentage representation of these high- level positions to the country's annual average assessment at the four U.N.  organizations with formal geographic targets.  The resulting number can be  interpreted as the country's percentage representation at senior-level and  policymaking positions per 1 percent of its assessment.  For illustrative  purposes, consider table 10 in appendix II describing representation at  senior-level and policymaking positions at FAO.  U.S. representation in  these high-level positions is 9.4 percent, and its average assessment is 25  percent.  Dividing 9.4 by 25 results in 0.38 percent, the U.S. representation  of high-level positions per 1 percent of U.S. assessment.  In a similar  fashion, 0.14 percent is the Japanese representation per 1 percent of its  assessment, and 1.48 percent is the French representation per 1 percent of  its assessment.  The average representation for the four selected countries  is 0.76 percent per 1-percent assessment.", "In table 4, in the report we multiplied this four-country average  representation by the U.S. assessment to derive a hypothetical comparative  representation level, under the assumption that U.S. representation in  senior-level and policymaking positions was proportionate to the average  of these four major contributors.  For example, if the United States, given  its 25-percent assessment at FAO, were to have representation  proportionate to the 0.76 average ratio for the four selected countries, then  its representation would be 19.1 percent.", "To describe U.S. representation over time, both the actual number and  relative number of American staff in each organization are presented.  For  example, see figures 4 and 5 in appendix II, which describe U.S.  representation at the U.N. Secretariat.  A relative number, a ratio of the  number of total country staff employed expressed as a percentage of the  organization's total staff, allows the reader to examine the change in  country staff size over time while taking into consideration the change in  the total organization staff size.  However, because of different means of  measuring an organization's total staff size, care should be taken when  interpreting this information.", "For U.N. organizations that use a base number rather than the actual  number of filled staff positions, there may be a significant difference in  national representation trends and the trend of total national employment  as a percentage of total actual organization employment.  In some  situations, as described below for WHO, one trend may be positive and the  other negative.  For example, annual U.S. representation at WHO during  1998 to 2000 can be interpreted as follows: As shown in figure 10 in  appendix II, the gap between U.S. employment and the lower target range,  which is calculated using a base number, is narrowing which indicates an  improvement in U.S. representation.  During this period, U.S. employment  grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent, while the WHO employment base  number remained constant at 1,450. Thus, U.S. representation increased  relative to its target range.  However, during this period total actual  employment at WHO grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent.  Employment of  non-Americans increased at a faster rate than for Americans.  The  percentage of Americans actually employed declined.  However, based on the representation methodology employed by WHO, U.S. representation is  shown as increasing.", "The criteria to judge whether a country is underrepresented,  overrepresented, or equitably represented at an organization are to  compare the actual number of nationals employed to the target range  numbers.  That is the approach used for organizations with formal targets  in the first of each U.N. organization\u2019s figures for U.S. representation in  appendix II.  The second figure for each organization in appendix II and all  of the figures in appendix IV use a percentage measure to compare actual  country employment with representation targets.  Except for FAO, which  uses a position-weighted percentage to calculate target ranges and actual  representation, our percentage approach is not the official method used by  the U.N. organizations.  Our approach enables one to compare a country\u2019s  total employment as well as grade level employment with representation  target ranges.", "The use of a base number rather than actual employment figures to  calculate target ranges tends to reduce the number of countries that are  classified as overrepresented.  The base number includes actual filled  positions and vacancies.  Since the annual base numbers for the Secretariat  and WHO are greater than each organization\u2019s respective actual number  employed, the upper target figure is larger than would be derived if the  actual employment number were used in the target range formula.  For  example, the Secretariat\u2019s target range for the United States in 2000 is 424  to 314 when a base number employment figure of 2,600 is used.  If the  actual employment number of 2,389 were to have been used in the target  range formula, the target range would have been 390 to 289.  In this case,  the United States still would have been equitably represented.  However, if  actual employment numbers had been used in the target range formula,  Canada and the United Kingdom would have been classified as  overrepresented.  The larger, upper target may partially explain why the  Secretariat and WHO have fewer overrepresented countries than FAO or  ILO (see apps. III and V)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO's comments on the Department of State's letter  dated July 19, 2001. 1. While State commented that it places a high priority on efforts to  ensure the United States is represented, at all levels, in U.N.  organizations, we found that its actions to achieve equitable  representation do not reflect this stated priority.  For example, as  discussed in this report, State has reduced many of its recruitment  efforts without assessing how these reductions will affect recruitment  and does not have recruiting or action plans in place to support U.N.  employment of Americans.   2. State disagreed with our recommendation to develop guidelines that  define its goal for obtaining an equitable share of senior-level and  policymaking positions for Americans and use these guidelines to help  assess whether the United States is equitably represented.  State said it  should not develop separate guidelines for defining its goal of obtaining  an equitable share of Americans in these high-level positions but rather  that it should focus on equitable representation at all levels.  While we  agree that State should be concerned about achieving equitable  employment for Americans at all levels in U.N. organizations, we  believe it is important to emphasize achieving an equitable share of  high-level positions.
