Subsequently, Congress extended the time period for DOD to achieve required funding reductions in select contract services through 2014. In December 2014, GAO reported on DOD's implementation for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and made several recommendations to improve DOD's management of contract services.", "The House Armed Services Committee Report 113-446 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's implementation of the contract services limits.

The Comptroller's office sought input from components\u2014military departments and defense agencies\u2014when setting obligation targets and implemented a waiver request process to allow for adjustments, which it had not done in 2012 or 2013. The military departments also implemented a variety of controls over contract services obligations, but experienced varying degrees of success in adhering to their targets.", "Moreover, Army and Navy budget officials identified additional actions their departments' plan to take to improve adherence to the spending limit. For example, Army budget officials are soliciting contract services budget estimates from commands and the Navy has increased monitoring of contract services obligations from twice a year to monthly.", "GAO analysis of DOD obligation data from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 indicate that all of the military departments achieved required funding reductions for contractors performing closely associated with inherently governmental and staff augmentation functions\u2014positions that run the risk of contractors inappropriately influencing government decisions. DOD initiated a different approach in fiscal year 2015 to measure compliance after GAO found in December 2014 that DOD lacked the data necessary to demonstrate reductions and recommended that DOD identify additional data sources to ensure funding reductions were achieved. Congress facilitated DOD's implementation of this recommendation in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2015, encouraging DOD to use advisory and assistance services\u2014a budget category that includes many of the types of contract services that are considered closely associated with inherently governmental and staff augmentation\u2014to measure compliance with funding reductions. DOD issued guidance in May 2015 adopting the alternative measure and instructed components to submit these data as part of the fiscal year 2017 budget request. Based on currently available obligation data through fiscal year 2014, GAO found that the Air Force and Navy achieved reductions greater than 20 percent as required by Congress from 2010 through 2013. The Army achieved a 9 percent reduction by 2013, but achieved a 32 percent reduction in 2014.

In fiscal year 2014, contract services constituted more than  half of DOD\u2019s $285 billion in total acquisition obligations. Our prior work  has shown that there are benefits to using contractors to perform services  for the government. However, DOD acquisition of contract services  continues to be an issue we identified as high risk, in part, because DOD  lacks reliable data on its contract services acquisitions to inform decision  making, such as the appropriate workforce mix between military, civilian,  and contractor personnel.", "Citing the need to reduce DOD spending on services and to maintain the  appropriate balance between the civilian and contractor workforce,  section 808 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal  year 2012, as modified by section 802 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2014,  imposed various limits on DOD\u2019s contracted services for fiscal years 2012  through 2014. Specifically, the NDAA set limits on DOD\u2019s total obligations  for contract services and instructed the Secretary of Defense to issue  guidance to reduce funding for contracts that have contractor staff  performing services that are closely associated with inherently  governmental or staff augmentation functions. House Armed Services  Committee Report 113-446 accompanying the NDAA for Fiscal Year  2015 contained a provision for GAO to review DOD\u2019s implementation of  these limits and funding reductions. We previously reported on  implementation for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and made a number of  recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s implementation of the contract  services limitations. These recommendations and their status are  discussed later in this report.", "This report addresses DOD\u2019s progress to implement our previous  recommendations and further implementation of the contract services  limitations for fiscal year 2014. Specifically we assessed the extent to  which DOD implemented the (1) contract services spending limit for fiscal  year 2014 and (2) funding reductions for contracts with closely associated  with inherently governmental and staff augmentation functions from fiscal  years 2010 through 2014.", "To identify implementation efforts for each objective, we reviewed  relevant guidance and discussed implementation efforts with budget,  acquisition, and manpower officials from the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller) and the military departments. Further, we  analyzed DOD Comptroller budget and obligation data for fiscal years  2010 and 2014 to assess DOD\u2019s methodology for determining the annual  spending limit and the extent to which DOD adhered to this mandated  limit. We compared the Comptroller obligation data to services obligations  reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation and  the military departments\u2019 financial systems to identify any differences.  When differences were identified, we interviewed budget and financial  management officials from the military departments and Comptroller\u2019s  office to determine the reasons for these differences. Based on these  steps, we determined that the obligation data provided by the  Comptroller\u2019s office were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To identify  steps taken by the DOD to implement fiscal controls, we limited our  analysis to implementation efforts by the military departments, which  account for over 70 percent of DOD\u2019s contract services obligations in  fiscal year 2014. To determine the extent to which DOD implemented  funding reductions for closely associated with inherently governmental  and staff augmentation contracts, we reviewed DOD components\u2019  compliance with relevant DOD guidance. For example, in accordance  with DOD\u2019s May 2015 guidance, we analyzed military department  advisory and assistance services obligations from fiscal years 2010  through 2014 to determine reductions achieved over the time period.

The limit does not apply to contract services for military  construction, research and development, and services funded for  overseas contingency operations. Additionally, it provides for two  adjustments to the limit above fiscal year 2010 budgeted levels. DOD  may adjust spending above 2010 levels to account for (1) funding  increases associated with contract services that were transferred from  overseas contingency operations to the base budget and (2) the cost of  additional civilian personnel positions over fiscal year 2010 levels.", "The spending limit identified in the act applies to DOD in its entirety;  therefore, individual components\u2014military departments and defense  agencies\u2014may exceed their individual targets but DOD would still be in  compliance with the law if total obligations for contract services across the  entire department were less than the aggregate limit. DOD identified an  aggregate spending limit of $55.75 billion for fiscal year 2014. Section  813 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2015 extended the aggregate spending  limit through fiscal year 2015.", "Congress has also enacted legislation to improve the availability of  information on DOD\u2019s acquisition of services and to help the department  make more strategic decisions about the appropriate workforce mix of  military, civilian, and contractor personnel. In fiscal year 2002, Congress  enacted section 2330a of title 10 of the U.S. Code, which required the  Secretary of Defense to establish a data collection system to provide  management information on each purchase of services by a military  department or defense agency. In 2008, Congress amended section  2330a of title 10 of the U.S. Code to require the Secretary of Defense to  submit an annual inventory of contracted services performed for or on  behalf of DOD during the preceding fiscal year. This annual inventory  submission is to include, among other things, the number of contractor full  time equivalents and the associated direct labor cost for these positions.  More recently, section 955 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2013 required the  Secretary of Defense to ensure that the civilian and service contractor  workforces are appropriately sized to support and execute the National  Military Strategy and to develop an efficiencies plan for those  workforces. Section 955 further requires that the efficiencies plan  ensures that total funding reductions for the civilian and service contractor  workforces are commensurate with reductions in military end strength.  We have on-going work assessing DOD\u2019s compliance with section 2330a  as well as DOD\u2019s implementation of section 955 and plan to report the  final results in fiscal year 2016.", "Following the submission of the inventory, section 2330a(e) of title 10 of  the U.S. Code requires the secretaries of the military departments and  heads of the defense agencies to complete a review of the contracts  identified in the inventory to ensure, among other things, that the activities  do not include inherently governmental functions\u2014which are those that  require discretion in applying government authority\u2014such as the  determination of budget policy. The review should also ensure that to the  maximum extent practicable, the activities do not include any closely  associated with inherently governmental functions, which are those that  may be at risk of becoming inherently governmental due to the manner in  which the contractor performs the work, among other things. Upon  completion of this review, DOD guidance instructs the secretaries of the  military departments and heads of the defense agencies to submit an  inventory review certification letter to the Office of Personnel and  Readiness that outlines the results of the review and any corrective  actions to be taken to ensure that contractors are not performing  inherently governmental functions and to monitor the use of contractors  for closely associated with inherently governmental functions.", "Section 808 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2012 further reinforced those  provisions by requiring DOD to issue guidance instructing components to  reduce funding by 10 percent for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 for contracts  identified with personnel performing closely associated with inherently  governmental and staff augmentation functions. These functions may  include personal services or other positions that may put the government  at risk of contractors inappropriately influencing government decisions.  Unlike the aggregate DOD spending limit, the statutory requirement for  guidance on reductions in funding for closely associated with inherently  governmental functions and staff augmentation are directed to each  component; therefore, the reductions are expected to take place at each  component, rather than an aggregate reduction across the department.  Through subsequent revisions of the law, Congress extended the time  period for DOD to implement the full 20 percent reduction for both closely  associated with inherently governmental and staff augmentation functions  through fiscal year 2015. Fiscal years 2014 and 2015 are also referred  to as carryover years\u2014meaning that whatever required reductions that  DOD did not achieve in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 are required to be  taken in 2014 or 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Work", "paragraphs": ["In December 2014, we reported on DOD\u2019s implementation of the section  808 limitations in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Specifically, we found  DOD exceeded the spending limit in fiscal year 2012 and adhered to the  limit in fiscal year 2013. However, we also identified issues with the DOD  Comptroller office\u2019s calculation of the spending limit which resulted in an  overstated limit in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. For example, in both fiscal  years 2012 and 2013, the Comptroller included approximately $248  million in research and development budgeted amounts in the spending  limit, despite the law excluding such services from the spending limit. In  addition, the Comptroller office\u2019s calculation of the civilian workforce  adjustment was not consistently applied, further overstating the limit. As a  result, we recommended that the Comptroller\u2019s office update its  methodology to determine compliance with aggregate spending limit to  correct these errors. DOD concurred with this recommendation and has  taken steps to address it for fiscal year 2015, as discussed later in this  report. After adjusting for these errors, we found that DOD obligated  $1.72 billion more than the limit in fiscal year 2012 and about $500 million  less than the limit in fiscal year 2013.", "In our December 2014 report, we also found that each of the military  departments exceeded their respective Comptroller-provided targets in  fiscal year 2012.

However, the Army still exceeded its target by  more than $2 billion in fiscal year 2013. We concluded that significant  discrepancies between the military departments\u2019 adherence to obligation  targets for fiscal year 2013 signaled that improvements could be made to  better manage contract services obligations and recommended that the  Secretary of Defense evaluate the fiscal controls used by the military  departments to identify effective practices to improve the management of  contract services. DOD agreed with this recommendation and while the  Comptroller\u2019s office has not taken action to implement it, the military  departments have improved implementation of fiscal controls as  discussed later in this report.

However, we found that the components\u2019  annual inventory reviews did not include information necessary to  measure a funding reduction in these functions, such as comparable  obligation data. Further, we found that the guidance lacked clarity in how  reductions in staff augmentation funding should be implemented and  measured. The guidance noted that these funding reductions were  factored into budget requests for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, but did not  specify the amounts of these budgeted reductions or the data source that  should be used to determine if the reduction was achieved.", "DOD updated its inventory guidance in May 2014, instructing components  to identify the steps taken\u2014supported with appropriate documentation\u2014 to demonstrate compliance with the required reductions. However, we  found that the supplemental guidance did not provide components with  any additional clarification in how to measure the reductions given the  lack of data collected through past inventories. We also found that one  measure that could be used to determine compliance was the advisory  and assistance services budget category which includes many of the  types of contractor services that are considered closely associated with  inherently governmental and staff augmentation functions. As a result, we  recommended that DOD identify additional data sources beyond the  inventory of contracted services to help ensure that funding reductions  called for in the law are implemented. DOD concurred with our  recommendation. Moreover, section 813 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2015  facilitated DOD\u2019s implementation of our recommendation, encouraging  DOD to use other data sources, such as advisory and assistance  services, to measure compliance with closely associated with inherently  governmental and staff augmentation funding reductions.

This new process allowed the  Comptroller to approve adjustments related to specific requests and  allocate portions of the reserved amount among the components.  Through this process, the Comptroller received three waiver requests  totaling $607 million for fiscal year 2014.

However, Army budget  officials explained that these budget estimates did not accurately capture  the extent to which funds were allocated to contract services because  Army commands do not separately identify contract services budget  estimates in their annual budget inputs to the Army Budget Office for  inclusion in the President\u2019s budget. Instead, the Army budget office relies  on historical budget data to determine contract services budget estimates  for inclusion in the budget request and as a result had underestimated the  level of obligations allocated for contracted services. For example, in  fiscal year 2013, the Army obligated $2.7 billion more than estimated for  contract services. An Army budget official said that based on the Army  command inputs, the Army Budget Office was able to develop a more  realistic contract services spending estimate to use in negotiations with  the Comptroller\u2019s office.

To  address this issue, an Army budget official said they monitored contract  services obligations during the year and once they received the  Comptroller\u2019s target, further worked with commands to reduce contract  services obligations in line with the lower target. By doing so, the Army  obligated $10.4 billion on contract services for the operations and  maintenance account, or $800 million less than the initial spending  targets provided to commands.

If  components are not in compliance with the full 30 percent reduction by  fiscal year 2015, a Comptroller official said that the Comptroller\u2019s office  plans to enforce the reduction by making adjustments to component  funding levels for the fiscal year 2017 budget submissions.", "As indicated by the Comptroller\u2019s May 2015 guidance, the office plans to  assess the military departments and defense agencies reductions in  advisory and assistance service obligations when the fiscal year 2017  budget is submitted. Therefore, compliance with the required funding  reductions will not be determined by the Comptroller\u2019s office until early  fiscal year 2016 when DOD has complete data on each component\u2019s  fiscal year 2015 obligations.

Specifically, we assessed DOD\u2019s implementation of the 1) contract  services spending limit for fiscal year 2014 and 2) funding reductions for  contracts with closely associated with inherently governmental and staff  augmentation functions from fiscal years 2010 through 2014.", "To determine the extent to which DOD implemented the contract services  spending limit in fiscal years 2014, we reviewed relevant laws and DOD  guidance, analyzed budget and obligation data from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller for fiscal years 2010 and 2014  from the program resource collection process (PRCP) system, and  interviewed DOD and military department budget officials. Specifically, we  reviewed DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2014 section 802 guidance, issued in May  2014, to determine steps taken by the Comptroller\u2019s office to implement  the limit. Further, we reviewed the Comptroller\u2019s methodology for  calculating the spending limit by analyzing the categories of services  DOD included in the spending limit baseline. We then compared these  categories to the fiscal year 2014 obligation data DOD used to determine  its compliance with the spending limit to ensure that both the baseline and  obligation data included consistent categories of contract services. To  ensure that contract services obligation data from PRCP were sufficiently  reliable to determine compliance with the spending limit, we compared  the PRCP obligation data to contract services obligations reported in the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation from fiscal years  2010 through 2014 and found that both sources showed a similar  downward trend in contract services obligations. Further, we compared  the PRCP obligation data to military department contract services  obligations reported in their respective financial systems to identify any  obvious errors or differences. When differences were identified, we  interviewed knowledgeable budget and financial management officials  from the military departments\u2019 and Comptroller\u2019s office to determine the  reasons for these differences. Based on these steps, we determined that  the Comptroller\u2019s PRCP obligation data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To identify steps taken by the DOD to implement fiscal  controls, we limited our analysis to implementation efforts by the military  departments, which account for over 70 percent of DOD\u2019s contract  services obligations in fiscal year 2014. To identify the steps taken by  each military department to implement controls over contract services  obligations, we interviewed military department budget and financial  management officials and reviewed available guidance issued by each of  military department to implement the spending limit.", "To assess the extent to which DOD components reduced funding for  contracts containing closely associated with inherently governmental and  staff augmentation functions from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 we  reviewed section 802 implementation guidance issued by the  Comptroller\u2019s office, which instructed components to follow additional  guidance. The additional guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Readiness and Force Management in May 2014  instructed each component to report in their fiscal year 2013 inventory  review certification letters specific actions taken and supporting  documentation to demonstrate compliance with the required 10 percent  funding reduction for closely associated with inherently governmental and  staff augmentation contracts in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. We analyzed  certification letters submitted by 35 DOD components for the fiscal year  2013 inventory review to determine what steps and supporting  documentation each component provided to demonstrate compliance with  the required funding reductions for closely associated with inherently  governmental functions and staff augmentation contracts. In addition, we  interviewed officials responsible for compiling and reviewing the inventory  of contracted services to gain additional insight into the steps taken to  implement the reductions. Based on updated guidance from the  Comptroller, issued in May 2015, instructing components to rely on the  advisory and assistance services budget category to measure the  reductions, we analyzed each military department\u2019s obligations for this  budget category reported in the Comptroller\u2019s PRCP data from fiscal  years 2010 through 2014 to determine if reductions had been achieved by  the military departments.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 through  September 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
