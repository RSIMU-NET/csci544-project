For that report, GAO analyzed the most current annual reports for 30 MTW agencies; compared HUD\u0092s monitoring efforts with internal control standards; and interviewed agency officials, researchers, and industry officials. For this testimony, GAO also reviewed actions HUD has taken in response to the report\u0092s recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Opportunities existed to improve how the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) evaluated the Moving to Work (MTW) program, which is intended to give participating public housing agencies (PHA) flexibility to design and test innovative strategies for providing housing assistance. GAO reported in April 2012 that HUD had not (1) developed guidance specifying that performance information collected from MTW agencies be outcome-oriented, (2) identified the performance data needed to assess results, or (3) established performance indicators for the program. The shortage of such standard performance data and indicators had hindered comprehensive evaluation efforts; such evaluations are key to determining the success of any demonstration program. In addition, HUD had not developed a systematic process for identifying lessons learned from the program, which limited HUD's ability to promote useful practices for broader implementation. Since the GAO report, HUD has revised reporting requirements for MTW agencies. These requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget in May 2013. GAO is reviewing this new guidance.", "In 2012, GAO also reported that HUD had not taken key monitoring steps set out in internal control standards, such as issuing guidance that defines program terms or assessing compliance with all the program's statutory requirements. As a result, HUD lacked assurance that MTW agencies were complying with statutory requirements. Additionally, HUD had not done an annual assessment of program risks, although it had a requirement to do so, and had not developed risk-based monitoring procedures. Without taking these steps, HUD lacked assurance that it had identified all risks to the program. Finally, HUD did not have policies or procedures in place to verify the accuracy of key information that MTW agencies self-report. For example, HUD staff did not verify self-reported performance information during their reviews of annual reports or annual site visits. Without verifying at least a sample of information, HUD could not be sure that self-reported information was accurate. According to HUD, the recently approved reporting requirements will result in more standardized data that HUD can verify either through audits or during site visits.", "Finally, GAO noted in 2012 that expanding the MTW program might offer benefits but also raised questions. According to HUD, affordable housing advocates, and MTW agencies, expanding MTW to additional PHAs would allow agencies to develop more activities tailored to local conditions and produce more lessons learned. However, data limitations and monitoring weaknesses raised questions about expansion. HUD had reported in 2010 that expansion should occur only if newly admitted PHAs structured their programs to permit high-quality evaluations and ensure that lessons learned could be generalized. Since the GAO report was issued, four additional agencies were admitted into the program. HUD required these agencies to implement and study rent reform activities through partnerships with local universities and a research organization. Until more complete information on the program's effectiveness and the extent to which agencies adhered to program requirements is available, it will be difficult for Congress to know whether an expanded MTW would benefit additional agencies and the residents they serve."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommended that HUD improve MTW information and monitoring.

As of June  2013, 35 public housing agencies (PHA) were participating through the  end of their fiscal year 2018. To put in place the innovations intended  under the program\u2019s authorizing legislation, agencies may request  waivers of certain provisions in the United States Housing Act of 1937, as  amended. For example, housing agencies may combine the funding they  are awarded annually from different programs\u2014such as public housing  capital funds, public housing operating funds, and voucher funds\u2014into a  single, authoritywide funding source.", "In addition to addressing the program\u2019s three statutory purposes\u2014reduce  costs and achieve greater cost-effectiveness in federal housing  expenditures, give families with children incentives to obtain employment  and become self-sufficient, and increase housing choices for low-income  families\u2014MTW agencies must meet five requirements.

Although MTW agencies reported annually  on their activities, which included efforts to reduce administrative costs  and encourage residents to work, the usefulness of this information was  limited because it was not consistently outcome-oriented. For example,  for similar activities designed to promote family self-sufficiency, one MTW  agency reported only the number of participants, which is generally  considered an output, and another did not provide any performance  information. In contrast, a third agency reported on the average income of  program graduates, which we consider an outcome. To be consistent with  GPRAMA, HUD\u2019s guidance on reporting performance information should  indicate the importance of outcome-oriented information.specific guidance on the reporting of performance information\u2014for   Without more  example, to report quantifiable and outcome-oriented information\u2014HUD  could not be assured of collecting information that reflected the outcomes  of individual activities.", "As we reported in 2012, HUD had not identified the performance data  needed to assess the results of similar MTW activities or of the program  as a whole. Obtaining performance information from demonstration  programs is critical\u2014because the purpose of a demonstration is to test  which approach obtains positive results. Although HUD started collecting  additional data from MTW agencies (including household size, income,  and educational attainment) in its MTW database, it had not analyzed the  data. And since 2009, HUD had required agencies to provide information  on the impact of activities, including benchmarks and metrics, in their  annual MTW reports. While these reports were informative, they did not  lend themselves to quantitative analysis because the reporting  requirements did not call for standardized data, such as the number of  residents who found employment. Whether these data would be sufficient  to assess similar activities and the program as a whole was not clear, and  as of April 2012 HUD had not identified the data it would need for such an  assessment.", "HUD also had not established performance indicators for MTW.  According to GPRAMA, federal agencies should establish efficiency,  output, and outcome indicators for each program activity as appropriate.  Federal internal control standards also require the establishment of  performance indicators. As we noted in 2012, specific performance indicators for the MTW program could be based on the three statutory  purposes of the program. For example, agencies could report on the  savings achieved (reducing costs). However, without performance  indicators HUD could not demonstrate the results of the program.", "The shortage of standard performance data and performance indicators  had hindered comprehensive evaluation efforts, which are key to  determining the success of any demonstration program. We  recommended in 2012 that HUD (1) improve its guidance to MTW  agencies on providing performance information in their annual reports by  requiring that such information be quantifiable and outcome-oriented, (2)  develop and implement a plan for quantitatively assessing the  effectiveness of similar activities and for the program, and (3) establish  performance indicators for the program. HUD partially agreed with these  recommendations. Since our report, HUD has revised the performance  reporting requirements for MTW agencies. The Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) approved these revisions on May 31, 2013. The new  requirements state that MTW agencies are to report standard metrics and  report outcome information on the effects of MTW policy changes on  residents. HUD also provided a standard format to allow analysis and  aggregation across agencies for similar activities. We are currently  assessing the extent to which these new requirements address our  recommendations.", "Furthermore, as we indicated in our 2012 report, while HUD had identified  some lessons learned on an ad hoc basis, it did not have a systematic  process in place for identifying such lessons. As previously noted,  obtaining impact information from demonstration programs is critical.  Since 2000, HUD had identified some activities that could be replicated  by other housing agencies. For example, a HUD-sponsored contractor  developed five case studies to describe issues and challenges involved in  implementing MTW. However, these and subsequent efforts had  shortcomings. In most cases, the choice of lessons learned was based on  the opinions of HUD or contracted staff and largely involved anecdotal (or  qualitative) data rather than quantitative data. Because HUD had not  developed criteria and a systematic process for identifying lessons  learned, we reported in 2012 that it was limited in its ability to promote  useful practices for broader implementation. Thus, we recommended that  HUD create a process to systematically identify lessons learned. HUD  agreed and in response, stated that once its revised reporting  requirements were implemented, the resulting data would inform an effort  to establish lessons learned. Consistent with this, HUD noted that one  purpose of the revised reporting requirements that OMB approved in May  2013 was to identify promising practices learned through the MTW  demonstration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Could Strengthen Some Monitoring Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["HUD had policies and procedures in place to monitor MTW agencies but  could have done more to ensure that MTW agencies demonstrated  compliance with statutory requirements and to identify possible risks  relating to each agency\u2019s activities. For example, as noted in our 2012  report, HUD had not issued guidance to MTW agencies clarifying key  program terms, including definitions of the purposes and statutory  requirements of the MTW program. Federal internal control standards  require the establishment of clear, consistent goals and objectives.  Agencies also must link each of their activities to one of the three  program purposes cited in the MTW authorizing legislation.

Similarly, officials  from MTW agencies that we contacted stated that expansion of the  program would provide a broader testing ground for new approaches and  best practices. Finally, information from a private research organization,  affordable housing advocates, and MTW agencies suggested that  allowing additional PHAs to participate in the program could result in  additional opportunities to test innovative ideas and tailor housing  programs and activities to local conditions. In 2004, the Urban Institute  reported that the local flexibility and independence permitted under MTW  appeared to allow strong, creative PHAs to experiment with innovative  solutions to local challenges. We have reported separately on cost  savings that could be realized from allowing additional housing authorities  to implement some of the reforms MTW agencies have tested.", "Some proponents of expansion that we interviewed also noted that  expanding the MTW program could provide more PHAs with the ability to  use funding from different sources more flexibly than possible without  MTW status. As we have seen, MTW agencies may request waivers of  certain provisions of the 1937 Housing Act in order to combine annual  funding from separate sources into a single authoritywide funding source.  HUD field office staff with responsibility for monitoring MTW agencies  observed that the single-fund flexibility was beneficial because it enabled  participating agencies to develop supportive service programs, such as  job training or educational programs, which help move families toward  self sufficiency. Further, officials from the MTW agencies we interviewed  agreed that this flexibility was beneficial. For example, officials from one  MTW agency stated it had been able to use the single fund to organize  itself as a business organization, develop a strategic plan based on the  housing needs of low-income families in the community, leverage public  funds and public and private partnerships, and develop mixed-income  communities.", "However, a lack of performance information (which creates a limited basis  for judging what lessons could be taken from the program to date), limited  HUD oversight, and concerns about the program\u2019s impact on residents  raised questions about expanding the MTW program.
