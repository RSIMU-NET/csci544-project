The task force issued three reports containing 194 recommendations. The Fiscal Year 2004 National Defense Authorization Act required GAO to review DOD's progress in implementing the recommendations. This report discusses (1) DOD's ability to report on domestic violence incidents and disciplinary actions, (2) the resources DOD has provided to implement the recommendations, and (3) DOD's specific actions to ensure victim confidentiality and the education of commanding officers, senior enlisted personnel, and chaplains. GAO also examined whether DOD has established an oversight framework to monitor implementation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's ability to report on domestic violence incidents and disciplinary actions taken by commanders is hampered because the systems that the department uses to collect domestic violence information do not contain complete data. DOD's domestic violence database does not capture data from all law enforcement systems and, therefore, does not provide a complete accounting of reported incidents and actions taken by commanders. Notwithstanding the task force's recommendation to report on the number of domestic violence incidents, DOD and the services have not developed any plans to address the data limitations, which do not allow for visibility over domestic violence incidents. Without complete information on reported incidents of domestic violence and the steps taken by commanders to address these incidents, DOD will not know the size and nature of the problems or be able to assess the effectiveness of its actions. DOD has provided about $23 million to implement the recommendations and has made progress in this regard. Specifically, GAO identified 94 recommendations of varying potential importance as completed, 60 as pending further action, and 40 in which no action had been taken because DOD either disagreed with the recommendations or determined that they were not applicable to the department. Nonetheless, DOD faces challenges in completing the pending recommendations in a timely manner because of potential shortages of essential personnel in the office overseeing implementation. In addition, DOD's method of communicating its policy changes resulting from the recommendations has not ensured consistent practices and widespread understanding of the policies among DOD and the services. While DOD is taking steps toward ensuring confidentiality for victims and to train its personnel on domestic violence issues, additional efforts are needed. To ensure victim confidentiality, DOD issued a policy, effective April 22, 2006, allowing victims to report domestic violence to specified people without notifying command. In addition, DOD issued guidance requiring training and is providing several educational options. However, data regarding which chaplains have completed training are not available because the department and the services do not track this training. Chaplains play a special role in assisting domestic violence victims and, without complete training data, DOD may be unable to determine if chaplains have been provided the needed resources to assist victims. DOD has not established an oversight framework to monitor compliance with and evaluate implementation of the task force recommendations. While the task force recommended and DOD's draft domestic violence instruction requires monitoring and evaluation of domestic violence efforts, DOD has not established a process to do so. Without an overall management framework, DOD and Congress have limited visibility and oversight to evaluate DOD's implementation efforts and make needed improvements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congress and the Department of Defense (DOD) have expressed concerns  about domestic violence in the military and its adverse effect on unit  morale and mission readiness.

The National  Defense Authorization Act of 2000 required DOD to develop a centralized  domestic violence database of information on incidents of domestic  violence involving members of the Armed Forces. This includes domestic  violence incidents reported to a commander, a law enforcement authority  of the Armed Forces, or a family advocacy program official. Under the act,  the Secretaries of the military departments are required to report this  information annually to the administrator of the database. DOD is also  required, under Section 591, to report information from the database,  along with its responses to each of the three task force reports. In an  effort to satisfy the legislation, DOD established the central domestic  violence database within its Defense Incident-Based Reporting System.  This database contains domestic violence incidents that are criminal in  nature including: infractions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, state  law, or violation of a protection order.", "Although DOD established the central domestic violence database in June  2000, it is not yet fully operational and it does not contain complete  information about reported incidents of domestic violence. DOD officials  stated that the information contained in the database on the number of  incidents is not complete because some of the law enforcement systems  used by the services that feed into the central database are not yet  operational.

As a result, the central domestic violence  database does not contain any information about domestic violence  incidents that would be captured in these systems.", "The central domestic violence database captures incidents of a criminal  nature that were responded to by military law enforcement personnel; but  it does not contain information on incidents reported to Family Advocacy  personnel such as emotional abuse or domestic violence incidents that  occur off the installation. To obtain this information, as required in the  act, DOD must supplement data from the Defense Incident-Based  Reporting System with data from the Family Advocacy Program Central  Registry, which contains clinical data on domestic violence incidents.  However, the Central Registry data system previously provided incomplete  domestic violence data because until January 2006, the Central Registry  only contained reported incidents of abuse involving current spouses. It  did not contain domestic violence data as defined by DOD\u2019s 2004  definition that involved former spouses and intimate partners with whom  the alleged offender shared a child or a common domicile. Therefore, prior  to 2006, DOD did not provide complete information on all reported  instances of domestic violence.", "DOD used information from the two systems in preparing its reports to  Congress on the number of incidents of domestic violence in the military  and commanders\u2019 actions taken in responding to them during fiscal years  2000 through 2002. However, DOD officials who have responsibility for  gathering these data acknowledged that the statistics contained in these  reports were questionable. Moreover, they informed us that since the last  report to Congress on fiscal year 2002 incidents, no attempts had been  made to match up the information from the two systems, despite a June 8,  2000, memorandum from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness that directed them to do so. Our analysis  confirmed that neither system had complete data to enable DOD to  accurately determine the extent of reported domestic violence incidents in  the military.", "Beyond these concerns, our review of information in the Defense Incident- Based Reporting System and supporting service law enforcement systems  revealed that a number of installations were not reporting disciplinary  actions taken by the commanders as required. For example, in the fiscal  year 2002 report that DOD released to Congress, DOD reported that of the  2,173 Army and Air Force incidents for which sufficient evidence existed  to take disciplinary action, 1,027, or 47 percent had no actions listed. DOD  and service instructions require that command disciplinary actions be  entered into the law enforcement systems. Moreover, these systems  contain a data field to record commanders\u2019 actions in responding to  domestic violence incidents. However, during our site visits, we found that  some commander disciplinary actions were not being entered into the data  field and some of the law enforcement officials we interviewed stated that  they were unaware that they were required to do so. These officials  acknowledged the importance of including this information to provide  visibility over what disciplinary actions had been taken and that there was  a field available in the system for them to do so. At one installation, we  found that hard copies of the commander disciplinary actions were  maintained in a file in the Provost Marshall\u2019s office, but this information  had not been entered into the law enforcement database.", "Officials who oversee the DOD central domestic violence database and the  Central Registry data system, as well as Family Violence Policy Office  personnel, are aware of the problems with obtaining complete information  about domestic violence incidents and commander disciplinary actions.

Notwithstanding this point, of the 194 recommendations made by  the task force, we found DOD had completed actions on 94  recommendations, had actions pending on 60 recommendations, and had  not taken actions on 40 recommendations because the department either  disagreed with the recommendations, the recommendation was not  applicable to the department, or DOD felt that the recommended action  was already undertaken.

For example, the task force recommended that DOD  centrally track military protective orders. DOD essentially disagreed with  the recommendation, stating that it had determined that it would not be  feasible to centrally record and track military protective orders because  there were too few such orders to justify creating another database.  Nevertheless, DOD categorized this recommendation as complete, while  we categorized this recommendation as one with which they disagreed.

The  Navy did not \u201cbackfill\u201d or replace its position, stating that the position was  needed within their service, and officials in the Family Violence Policy  Office stated that OSD had placed the Air Force position within another  area of DOD because OSD had a greater need for that position there.

DOD\u2019s  method of communicating its policy changes has not been effective in  ensuring consistent practices or promoting widespread understanding of  the new policies among DOD and the services.", "As of March 2006, DOD had issued 16 directive-type memoranda as interim  guidance to quickly communicate information about changes resulting  from implementation of the task force recommendations. (See app. IV for  a list of these memoranda). Almost all of the directive-type memoranda set  target dates for DOD to issue later guidance implementing the interim  policies. In most cases, final guidance such as a directive was expected to  be issued within 180 days after each memorandum was signed; however,  as of March 2006, the final guidance had not been issued and most of the  interim guidance is now more than 2 years old. Since the memoranda are  interim guidance, they have been communicated to the services and  throughout DOD through mail to the Service Secretaries and informally via  e-mails and special Web pages rather than being formally posted on the  official DOD directives Web site. Under internal control guidance,  organizations should consistently apply policies, and sound management  practices of leading organizations offer federal agencies a methodology for  establishing effective communications to promote consistency. However,  some DOD and service officials we met with stated that existing DOD  guidance was not always consistent with the directive-type memoranda  implementing the task force recommendations and that this inconsistency  has sometimes caused confusion at the installation level. In addition, we  found that information in the directive-type memoranda was not always  communicated to the installations in a timely manner and had resulted in  some of the officials not knowing about and, thus not following current  policies consistently.", "We identified several inconsistencies in implementing the  recommendations as a result of DOD\u2019s policy changes not being  communicated effectively, including the following:    DOD\u2019s Family Advocacy Program Directive 6400.1 has not been updated to  reflect DOD\u2019s interim guidance that implements the task force  recommendations, even though a number of the task force  recommendations had called for these changes to be made in this  directive. Family Advocacy officials told us they will not update their  directive until the Family Violence Policy Office issues a new instruction,  incorporating all of the interim guidance issued in the directive-type  memoranda. As a result, some DOD and service officials stated that  inconsistent guidance from these two offices has been a source of  confusion. A prime example is that while DOD\u2019s new definition of  domestic violence was issued in 2004, staff at some of the installations we  visited said that they did not become aware of the definition until late 2005  or January 2006. Consequently, some victims of domestic violence who  were covered under the new definition, since 2004, may not have been  considered for services.", "The task force also recommended that DOD establish a policy that written  copies of military protective orders be forwarded immediately to both law  enforcement and family advocacy officials. While DOD initially issued a  policy in March 2004 allowing distribution to law enforcement, it reversed  this policy in July 2004 due to concerns with the military protective order\u2019s  use and dissemination. DOD\u2019s August 8, 2005, status report on  recommendations further stated that the Privacy Act does not allow  distribution of the military protective orders to family advocacy and law  enforcement. This policy change, however, was not effectively  communicated, causing many inconsistent practices throughout the  installations we visited. For example, contrary to the July 2004 guidance,  DOD\u2019s September 2005 domestic violence training materials provided to  commanders, judge advocates, and law enforcement personnel contained  information on leadership responsibilities, which stated that a copy of  each order is to be forwarded to law enforcement and family advocacy.  Further, policy information on DOD\u2019s Web sites that allowed the orders to  be distributed to law enforcement was not changed until we notified DOD  officials of the inconsistency. Additionally, we found inconsistent  practices between the services. For example, the Army\u2019s regulations  allowed distribution of the protective orders to family advocacy and law  enforcement officials. On the other hand, the Navy did not provide copies  to family advocacy. However, a Navy instruction, which predated the  DOD July 2004 guidance, allowed distribution to law enforcement. Navy  officials stated that their guidance will be revised to reflect DOD  requirements not to provide copies to law enforcement, upon release of  DOD\u2019s Domestic Violence instruction. Finally, our discussions with OSD  and service lawyers revealed that they believe providing copies of  protective orders to family advocacy and law enforcement officials would  not be a violation of the Privacy Act.", "The task force recommended that \u201cDOD mandate the military services to  provide awareness education to military spouses regarding the transitional  compensation program.\u201d DOD said that no action was required on this  recommendation \u201cince Congress established the transitional  compensation program; the services have routinely educated dependent  family members about it.\u201d However, during our installation visits we found  inconsistent communication of this information. Discussion groups with  victim advocates and interviews with family advocacy officials revealed  that a few installations elected not to inform military members or spouses  about transitional compensation until a specific victim had a documented,  validated domestic violence case in which they would be eligible to  receive benefits. The victim advocates stated that this was done to prevent  potential abuse of the program. Some of the other installations were quite  liberal about providing information on the program. They said they felt  providing the information may encourage more people to come forward if  they knew help was available.", "The task force also recommended that DOD develop guidance for  commanding officers on how to properly document domestic violence  issues in separation papers to help facilitate transitional compensation.  The directive-type memorandum issued by DOD to implement this  recommendation states that commanding officers should be trained on  transitional compensation, but it does not specifically require training  them on how to \u201cproperly document separation papers.\u201d Some victim  advocates at installations we visited said that commanding officers do not  always use proper documentation to ensure that victims will receive  transitional compensation and that some victims have been denied these  funds because of lack of documentation. DOD officials in the Family  Violence Policy Office told us that guidance on waiver requirements, as  recommended by the task force, is included in a draft instruction from the  Military Personnel Policy Directorate on transitional compensation. We  found inconsistencies in victim advocates\u2019 knowledge of the waiver  associated with transitional compensation requirements because this  information had not been effectively communicated to the advocates.", "DOD officials in the Family Violence Policy Office, Family Advocacy  Program Office, as well as officials in the four services acknowledged that  communication could be a problem and may result in inconsistencies.", "They also noted that formal instructions take years to draft and coordinate  and that mailing the interim guidance to service secretaries, e-mailing it to  key points of contacts, and placing the guidance on the Web pages were  the best avenues to follow.

In response to the task  force\u2019s recommendations, on January 22, 2006, DOD issued its Restricted  Reporting Policy for Incidents of Domestic Abuse to ensure that domestic  violence victims are protected, treated with dignity and respect, and  provided with support, advocacy, and care.", "Under the new policy, victims can choose either unrestricted reporting or  restricted reporting. Unrestricted reporting uses current reporting  channels\u2014e.g., chain of command, Family Advocacy Program, or law  enforcement\u2014and is for victims of domestic abuse who want to pursue an  official investigation of an incident. Restricted reporting allows adult  victims of domestic abuse to disclose the abuse to health care providers,  victim advocates, or supervisors of victim advocates, and receive medical  treatment and victim advocacy services without notifying the alleged  offender\u2019s commanding officer or law enforcement. The new policy allows  victims to receive relevant information, medical attention, and support  while having additional time to make a more informed decision about  reporting the incident. The task force found that victims were often  reluctant to seek services because they had fears about the potential  adverse impact the reported incident may have on the servicemember\u2019s  career and the family\u2019s financial well-being, as well as concerns about  their personal safety.", "However, the restricted reporting policy did not take effect until April 22,  2006, in order for the services to have time to develop consistent policies  and an implementation strategy. Consequently, at the time of our review, it  was too soon to assess what effects this policy will have on reported cases  of domestic violence. The new policy, nonetheless, was a topic of great  concern during our discussions at the 15 installations included in our  study. Installation commanders, commanding officers, legal officers,  provost marshals or heads of security forces, chaplains, family advocacy  program managers, victim advocates, and health care providers all shared  their views about the advantages and disadvantages of the restricted  reporting policy. Their views varied considerably and ranged from  unequivocal support for the policy, to uncertainty because of licensing and  ethical concerns, to outright objection.", "Those who expressed support for the policy said they did so because they  felt the policy promoted victim confidentiality, safety, and support. Some  unit commanders, for example, stated that the policy would allow the  victims to receive medical care and time to decide if they wanted to press  charges. In addition, chaplains at some installations voiced approval for  the policy because it opened another avenue for victims to receive  assistance without getting others involved.", "Conversely, officials who objected to the restricted reporting policy said  they did so because they believed the policy would not encourage victims  to \u201cofficially\u201d report the incident, and thus would send the wrong message  to aggressors, as well as diminish the commanding officers\u2019 ability to hold  offenders accountable. Specifically, legal officers serving as prosecutors  and commanding officers at several installations told us that they objected  to the policy because, while permitting victims to receive some types of  assistance was positive, it allowed aggressors to remain free from  disciplinary actions and to be able to continue the pattern of domestic  violence. The legal officers also expressed concern about the evidence  that would not be captured at the crime scene when domestic violence  occurs because the incident was not reported immediately.", "One area of concern raised during our installation visits dealt with specific  licensing issues and ethical dilemmas. For example, health care providers  expressed concerns that the new restricted reporting policy may conflict  with state licensing requirements mandating them to report incidents of  domestic violence to civilian authorities. They also expressed reservations  about the policy in cases where they had to provide medical aid to a  severely injured individual who appeared to be untruthful about the  source of the injury. While this policy is similar to DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response Program policy, many officials in our discussion  groups said that similar reporting may not be appropriate. According to  these individuals, the perpetrator of sexual assault does not usually reside  with the victim; therefore unreported incidents are less likely to place a  victim in a situation for further abuse, unlike domestic violence where a  victim would return home to the alleged abuser. Some of the health care  providers expressed concerns that they might be placed in a position in  which they had to send a battered victim back into a dangerous situation.", "During the time of our installation visits\u2014i.e., from October 2005 through  February 2006\u2014the restricted reporting policy was issued and addresses  some of the concerns and issues from our discussion groups. For example,  the policy states that confidentiality will be suspended for specific  reasons, such as to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the  health or safety of the victim or another person or when required by state  statute. While some of the issues are addressed in the policy, the level of  support this policy will provide victims of domestic violence, the potential  impact restricted reporting will have on law enforcement investigations, as  well as the impact the policy will have on a commander\u2019s ability to hold  perpetrators accountable, will be determined during implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Efforts Are Needed to Ensure Training Is Received", "paragraphs": ["Beyond confidentiality, the task force made over 10 recommendations that  focused on training for commanding officers, senior enlisted personnel,  and chaplains to respond to domestic violence issues. To respond to the  task force recommendations to train commanding officers and senior  enlisted personnel, DOD issued guidance directing the services to require  these officials to receive such training. Specifically, the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued a directive-type  memorandum titled \u201cDomestic Abuse Response and Intervention  Training for Commanding Officers and Senior Enlisted Personnel\u201d in  February 2004. This memorandum required training on specified topics,  such as dynamics of domestic violence, common misconceptions of victim  safety, and responses to alleged domestic abuse. The military services are  addressing this requirement by providing several educational options,  including Web-based training, training at the professional military  education schools, and training at installations led by instructors.", "In addressing the task force recommendation to train chaplains, the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued a  directive-type memorandum titled \u201cDomestic Abuse Training for  Chaplains\u201d on January 29, 2004, which required training for chaplains on  specified topics. One of the primary topics that chaplains received training  on was privileged communication, because of the special role chaplains  play in providing assistance to victims of domestic violence. Chaplains we  spoke with said they received this training at their basic officer\u2019s course,  periodically through continuing professional military education, and at  installations.", "While training on domestic violence issues is being provided to  commanding officers, senior enlisted personnel, and chaplains, DOD does  not have complete data on which chaplains have received training because  the Military Community and Family Policy Office did not require tracking  or documenting training provided to chaplains. Although internal control  guidance states that management should document and track agency  initiatives to ascertain if they are achieved and provide follow-up actions,  the Family Violence Policy Office and Family Advocacy Office did not  develop training metrics. Without accurate training data and  documentation, DOD lacks visibility over whether chaplains have been  adequately trained and are being provided with resources that will assist  them in handling domestic violence issues.", "Furthermore, during our discussion groups with chaplains, which included  a mix of experienced and junior officers, we found that some chaplains did  not fully understand their responsibilities concerning privileged  communication. For example, the Army regulation states that such  privileged communication is not to be disclosed to third persons other  than those to whom disclosure furthers the purpose of the  communication, or to those reasonably necessary for the transmission of  the communication. The regulation also states that the chaplain and  chaplain assistant will not divulge privileged communication without the  written consent of the person(s) authorized to claim the privilege. Some  Army and Navy chaplains we interviewed stated that they may notify the  chain of command about a privileged communication. For example, one  chaplain mentioned that there was no Army requirement that chaplains  report information discussed during a privileged communication and  others stated that the current Army regulation for chaplains speaks to this.  The chaplain further stated that some Army chaplains had decided for  themselves what they would and would not report and would explain this  to people that they counseled. A Navy chaplain also stated that under  certain conditions he would notify the commanding officer if an individual  admitted being involved in domestic violence, even if the person made the  statement as a matter of religious conscience. Other chaplains in our  discussion groups told us that a breach of privileged communication could  ruin the reputation of chaplains and lead to no one seeking their help.", "The task force, in its 2002 report, also had similar findings and  recommended that DOD issue guidance clarifying clergy confidentiality.  An official at the Chaplain Board told us that, since it takes so long to  issue DOD-wide guidance, DOD is not likely to issue additional guidance  addressing confidentiality and privileged communication because the  services have issued guidance, which is consistent with the Military Rules  of Evidence. However, when we discussed privileged communication  with chaplains, many referred to service guidance, as well as the Military  Rules of Evidence; but some were unclear as to what their responsibilities  were. Additional guidance and emphasis during chaplain training could  facilitate a consistent understanding by chaplains of their responsibilities  regarding confidentiality. Without taking action, DOD may be unable to  ensure that all chaplains are prepared to handle private information  provided by victims or offenders, which could deter both from seeking  assistance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Established an Oversight Framework to Monitor Compliance and Evaluate Implementation of Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not established an oversight framework to monitor compliance  with and evaluate implementation of the task force recommendations on  domestic violence. The task force\u2019s initial 2001 report recommended that  DOD strategically use regional oversight and monitoring visits at both the  DOD and service levels to improve the department\u2019s oversight of its efforts  to address domestic violence. DOD\u2019s draft domestic abuse instruction  requires the Military Community and Family Policy Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to monitor compliance  with the instruction and periodically evaluate domestic violence efforts.  The draft instruction, however, does not communicate how this should be  done and the Military Community and Family Policy Office has not  established a formal process for doing this.", "Officials in the Family Violence Policy Office stated that action on the task  force recommendation for oversight is pending and told us they were  exploring options for addressing it, such as having the DOD Inspector  General perform reviews every 2 or 3 years. These officials and those from  the Family Advocacy Program told us that the services\u2019 headquarters  monitor and evaluate their own installation family advocacy program  offices through their accreditation processes. However, they  acknowledged that the service accreditation reports are not sent to DOD  and that the department has limited visibility into service domestic  violence efforts. The Military Community and Family Policy Office is  considering asking officials from the Family Advocacy Program Office and  the Family Violence Policy Office to go on some of the services\u2019  accreditation visits to provide oversight of the implementation efforts. The  task force mentioned, however, that to be effective, program evaluation  must be ongoing and fully integrated.", "Although the DOD Family Advocacy Office has established output metrics  that somewhat relate to certain recommendations, DOD has not  established results-oriented performance measures that could enable it to  evaluate compliance with the recommendations. One example of an  established DOD metric is the number of briefings to new unit  commanders and senior enlisted personnel on domestic abuse and child  abuse. A DOD Family Advocacy Program official stated that this metric is  intended to be an output measure related to the Government Performance  and Results Act and is only indirectly related to a recommendation in the  task force reports. This metric is not a results-oriented performance  measure that would capture the results or evaluate the effectiveness of the  briefings in increasing these officers\u2019 awareness of domestic violence  issues. Without an overall management framework for monitoring and  reporting on implementation, DOD and Congress will continue to have  limited visibility and oversight to evaluate the changes associated with the  recommendations and to make improvements.

In  addition, the lack of sufficient personnel threatens the timely  implementation of the pending task force recommendations. Further, the  absence of clear and effective communication of the policy changes made  in response to the task force recommendations has hindered  servicemembers\u2019 awareness of their responsibilities in providing  assistance to victims and holding offenders accountable. The failure to  track the training of the chaplains who respond to domestic violence  incidents impairs DOD\u2019s visibility over whether chaplains are being  provided with the tools to effectively deal with domestic violence and  understand their obligations concerning privileged communications.  Finally, the absence of an oversight framework limits DOD\u2019s ability to  assess its efforts to achieve the desired results in improving the prevention  of and response to domestic violence.

The  department further noted that GAO\u2019s review had assumed that DOD  should implement all recommendations of the task force exactly as written  and stated that after each report the department clearly indicated the  recommendations it agreed with, did not agree with, and would study.  DOD also stated that it never suggested that it could not or would not  modify any of the task force recommendations. DOD noted that GAO had  sought to penalize the department for deviating from the narrowest  reading of individual recommendations. We disagree. To the contrary, our  report is very clear on the progress the department has made in  implementing the recommendations. Moreover, the scope and  methodology for our study (explained in app. I) clearly details the  approach that we used to assess this progress. Further, in mentioning that  the recommendations vary in their relative importance to improving  DOD\u2019s efforts to address domestic violence issues, we simply noted that  the implementation of some recommendations may not have as significant  an impact on DOD\u2019s efforts as will the implementation of others.  Additionally, we did not assume that DOD could not modify task force  recommendations. As the report states, when counting recommendations  as being completed by DOD, we included instances where actions taken to  implement the recommendations were different from language that the  task force suggested. Specifically, we stated that completed actions were  grouped into two categories: (1) actions that DOD took that directly  implemented the task force recommendations and (2) completed actions  taken that DOD believed met the intent of the recommendation. We also  made it clear in our report that there were 40 recommendations that DOD  did not take action on because they did not agree with the  recommendation, the recommendation was not applicable to DOD, or the  recommended action was already being done. In addition, we noted in the  report that there were 60 recommendations where DOD had actions  pending.", "Regarding our recommendations, DOD concurred that the department  would take steps to ensure commander actions related to domestic  violence are entered into law enforcement databases, develop a plan to  ensure adequate personnel are available to implement pending task force  recommendations, and establish an oversight framework to monitor  progress and implementation of the task force recommendations. DOD  stated that it had issued policy requiring documentation of commander  actions, conducted training to communicate this policy, and would  continue to aggressively communicate this policy to the services. DOD  also indicated that it was committed to providing resources to implement  the task force recommendations and had requested extensions for current  personnel to do so. We believe this approach could satisfy the intent of our  recommendation if DOD has a defined plan to provide personnel in the  event the requested personnel extensions are not granted. DOD said it is  developing an initial oversight process to monitor progress and  implementation and it anticipates completion will be in fiscal year 2007 or  2008. As DOD develops this oversight process, we reiterate the need for it  to include results-oriented performance measures that can enable it to  evaluate compliance with the recommendations.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation calling for the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to develop a  comprehensive management plan to address data deficiencies in DOD\u2019s  domestic violence database.

Specifically, DOD agreed with the need to issue a revised Family Advocacy  Program Directive. However, the department disagreed with the need to  reconsider the task force\u2019s recommendation to provide military protective  orders. DOD stated that it has considered the issue of providing the  protective orders to law enforcement and family advocacy officials and  continued to believe there are privacy concerns. Given its position, we are  no longer recommending that the department reconsider the task force\u2019s  recommendation in that regard. However, because of inconsistent  practices found among the services regarding whether distribution of  these orders was allowed to law enforcement and family advocacy  personnel, we continue to believe that the department needs to clarify and  more effectively communicate its policy on this issue and, therefore, we  are revising our recommendation to emphasize this point.", "DOD partially nonconcurred with our recommendation to develop, in  concert with the Family Advocacy Director and four service family  advocacy program managers, guidance and training materials clarifying  chaplain responsibilities regarding privileged communications.

DOD also stated  that each military department has policy addressing clergy confidentiality  and DOD does not contemplate developing such a policy. DOD further  stated that it has issued policy requiring this training and noted that DOD  and the services will continue to address this issue at relevant training  events. Because we, like the task force, found some chaplains did not fully  understand their responsibilities concerning privileged communications,  we continue to believe that DOD needs to issue a departmentwide policy  on privileged communications, and that DOD and the services need to  develop training materials that highlight and clarify chaplain  responsibilities for these communications.", "DOD nonconcurred with our recommendation to develop, in concert with  the Family Advocacy Director, four service family advocacy program  managers, and the chaplaincy board, procedures and metrics to ensure  that accurate, consistent, and timely domestic violence training data are  collected for chaplains.
