The agency had just begun the first phase of its three-phased prototype to demonstrate a new concept of operations over a 2-year period when, in late March 2007, the Department of Commerce's Under Secretary suspended the prototype because of concerns about the agency's approach. In the first phase, NWS established a program manager and began planning for the next two phases. During the remaining phases, NWS planned to have 20 weather forecasting offices share responsibilities in 2-office pairs and then in 4-office clusters. NWS then planned to decide whether to implement the new concept of operations on a national basis. The justification for the prototype was not sufficient. Before the prototype was suspended, the agency had approved moving forward with its prototype without conducting a cost-benefit analysis. NWS estimated that the prototype would cost approximately $9.3 million and would offer qualitative benefits, such as increased efficiency and an improved ability to focus on severe weather events, but did not quantify benefits or the expected return on its investment. If NWS were to proceed with the prototype without a cost-benefit analysis, it would lack assurance that its approach would be a cost-effective investment for the agency. NWS identified goals and selected measures to evaluate during its prototype activities, but it did not establish a rigorous evaluation plan. Specifically, NWS did not define a full set of needed measures, how it planned to compare prototype results with baseline performance, or how its selected measures supported the prototype goals. If NWS were to proceed without a rigorous evaluation plan, the agency would run an increased risk of not sufficiently measuring the impact of changes on its performance and could make decisions affecting the nation's weather on the basis of incomplete or flawed data. Although NWS involved internal stakeholders in planning its prototype, it did not (1) involve external stakeholders or (2) establish a plan that identified key stakeholders, the stakeholders' responsibilities, and a time line for involving stakeholders and addressing their comments. If NWS were to proceed with its prototype without such a plan, it could not ensure that stakeholder interests would be identified and addressed. NWS planned to mitigate the risk of degradation during and after the prototype by conducting laboratory exercises to understand the impact of the prototype, using a dedicated workstation in each office so that the office could switch to original systems if warranted, and monitoring its systems and products during the prototype.

In August 2005, the board chartered a working group to evaluate  the roles, responsibilities, and functions of weather offices nationwide and  to make a proposal for a more efficient concept of operations. The group  was given a set of guiding principles, including that the proposed concept  should (1) be cost-effective, (2) ensure that there would be no degradation  of service, (3) ensure that weather services nationwide were equitable, and  (4) not reduce the number of forecast offices nationwide.", "The group gathered input from various agency stakeholders and other  partners within NOAA and considered multiple alternatives. They  dismissed all but one of the alternative concepts because they were not  consistent with the guiding principles. In its December 2005 proposal, the  working group proposed the remaining concept, in which several offices  with the same type of weather and warning responsibilities, climate, and  customers would be grouped together to share responsibilities,  particularly when there is a high-impact weather event affecting one of the  offices. NWS called this a \u201cclustered peer concept of operations.\u201d", "Under the clustered peer concept of operations, offices would share the  workload associated with routine services, such as 7-day forecasts. During  a high-impact weather event\u2014such as a severe storm, flood, or wildfire\u2014 the offices would redistribute the workload to allow the impacted office to  focus solely on the event, while the other offices in the cluster would pick  up the impacted office\u2019s routine services. In addition, offices in a cluster  could occasionally allocate the work so that certain offices would take on  forecasting responsibilities while other offices focused on other tasks,  such as training, customer outreach, and research. In this manner, peer  offices could help supplement staffing needs, and the workload across  multiple offices could be more efficiently balanced.", "Some of these benefits were demonstrated in recent years by a pair of  weather forecasting offices. The Detroit and Grand Rapids offices  established a technology workaround to allow them to more efficiently  switch to backup operations between the two offices. This technology  improvement allows them to switch to backup mode instantaneously,  rather than taking 60 to 90 minutes using current AWIPS technology.

The laboratory results  showed that with minor modifications, AWIPS was capable of allowing a  more efficient and timely switch of operations between two weather  forecast offices for backup purposes, and that, in some cases, functions  could be shared among four offices. Officials in charge of the laboratory  exercise estimated that larger clusters would not be possible until the next  version of AWIPS is deployed\u2014a milestone currently planned for 2010.

The plan entailed sharing  forecasting responsibilities between 2, and subsequently among 4, weather  forecast offices using a single workstation in each office. The prototype  was to be a hands-on demonstration conducted at 20 weather forecast  offices, clustered in 4 different areas of the country: the Pacific Northwest,  Great Plains, Great Lakes, and Southeast (see fig. 4).

Without undertaking a  more rigorous approach, NWS would run an increased risk that its  prototype will not be a sound investment, and that any resulting decisions  could be based on flawed data and analysis. Taking this more rigorous  approach to the prototype should not preclude NWS from considering  options for improving the ability to switch to a backup site when a  weather forecast office becomes disabled due to loss of power or  communications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making four recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce. If  NWS decides to proceed with its prototype, we recommend the Secretary  direct the Assistant Administrator for the National Weather Service to    develop a cost-benefit analysis for the clustered peer approach before  implementing the prototype in any weather forecasting office;   develop an evaluation plan that includes a comprehensive set of measures  that are linked to prototype goals and identifies the baseline performance  that the prototype will be compared with before implementing the  prototype in any weather forecasting office; and   develop a plan for internal and external stakeholder involvement, which  includes a list of relevant stakeholders, roles and responsibilities for these  stakeholders, and a schedule for when stakeholders should be involved  before implementing the prototype in any weather forecasting office.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary direct the Assistant  Administrator for the National Weather Service to evaluate moving  forward with technology upgrades to the AWIPS processing system to  allow weather forecast offices to switch to backup service more quickly  during high-impact weather situations; these upgrades could be handled as  an initiative that is separate and distinct from broader changes in the  agency\u2019s concept of operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from Commerce  (see app. III). In the department\u2019s response, the Deputy Secretary of  Commerce agreed with our recommendations to conduct a thorough cost- benefit analysis, develop a rigorous evaluation plan with fully defined  performance measures, and involve internal and external stakeholders.  The response stated that our findings were included in the Under  Secretary\u2019s recent review of the concept of operations prototype. On the  basis of that review, the NOAA Administrator directed NWS to cease all  activities associated with the concept of operations prototype, and to  undertake a comprehensive and analytical review to determine new and  revised requirements for NWS products and services. This review is  expected to determine what, if any, changes are required. Should NWS  decide to proceed with a new concept of operations, we believe that our  recommendations to justify, evaluate, and involve stakeholders in any  such changes would still be relevant and useful.", "In addition, Commerce agreed with our recommendation to evaluate  moving forward with technology upgrades to the AWIPS processing  system to allow weather forecast offices to switch to backup service more  quickly during high-impact weather situations. The department stated that  NWS has established a proposal for improving its service backup  capability, expects to approve requirements for the backup capability by  September 2007, and plans to deploy this capability by September 2008.", "As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days  from the report date.

As described in the  plan, phase 1 would include planning activities, such as training; phase 2  was meant to establish clustered peer operations in 10 pairs of weather  forecast offices across the country; and phase 3 would include offices  grouped into 4-office clusters. NWS planned to conclude prototype  operations and to issue a report on the prototype by July 2009. NWS was  to decide at that time if it would proceed to implement the clustered peer  concept of operations on a national basis. Details about each of the  planned prototype phases are included in the following text.", "Phase 1, the planning phase, began in November 2006 with the Corporate  Board\u2019s approval of the prototype plan. NWS established a program  manager to oversee the prototype. In addition, cluster management teams  representing each cluster were to meet to decide on the rules of  engagement, common tools, and common forecast methodologies. At the  end of this phase, a second laboratory exercise was planned to validate  that software upgrades and hardware additions to support the prototype  were operationally ready. The second laboratory exercise was scheduled  for June 2007 and was to involve only weather forecast offices that are  currently service-backup pairs within the original four geographic cluster  areas. Upon completion of this exercise, the Corporate Board was to  decide on whether to initiate Phase 2 of the prototype.", "Phase 2 was planned to begin in August 2007. During this phase, NWS  planned to conduct training, develop guidance for how and when offices  would take over activities for other offices (called playbooks), define the  cluster methodology, and have 10 pairs of offices operate as clustered  peers. Also during this phase, NWS planned to develop the software  upgrades needed for expanded operations in the next phase. Near the end  of this phase, in February 2008, NWS planned to conduct a third laboratory  exercise to test the software necessary for moving to clusters of 4 offices.  After completion of this exercise, the Corporate Board was to decide on  whether to initiate Phase 3 of the prototype.", "Phase 3 was planned to begin in April 2008 and was to determine if  clusters of 4 offices can work as a multioffice team sharing forecasting  responsibilities.
