Such potential loss may result in significant skill gaps. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires GAO to submit a report on DOD's 2010-2018 strategic civilian workforce plan. In response, GAO determined the extent to which DOD identified critical skills, competencies, and gaps; assessed its workforce mix; and measured progress in implementing its strategic workforce plan. GAO analyzed DOD's strategic workforce plan and supporting documents, and met with managers of four functional communities within the civilian personnel community (information technology, financial management, logistics, and law enforcement), because they represent the three largest and the one smallest of the functional communities, to determine how they conducted their strategic workforce planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade, Congress has passed legislation requiring the Department of Defense (DOD) to conduct human capital planning efforts for the department's civilian workforce.

However, it did not report the results of any of its gap analyses for its mission-critical occupations.", "DOD did not assess the appropriate mix of military, civilian, and contractor workforces or provide an assessment of the capabilities of each of these workforces. Only two of the civilian community managers who provided input presented data on all three workforces. The remaining nine community managers provided data only on military and civilian personnel. DOD guidance requires, among other things, that DOD missions be accomplished with the least costly mix of military, civilian, and contractor personnel, consistent with military requirements and other needs of the department.", "DOD assessed progress in implementing its strategic workforce plan by using newly developed measures that contain characteristics of valid results-oriented performance measures, but these measures are not aligned with DOD's statutory reporting requirements. For example, although DOD is required to conduct gap analyses and assess its workforce mix, it is unclear how the measures that DOD developed will help to address these requirements.", "The input to DOD's strategic workforce plan on critical skills and competencies varied, in part, because the reporting template that DOD sent to its civilian personnel community managers did not contain sufficient detail and clear definitions. Also, the template did not provide departmental expectations for conducting gap analyses or communicate clear guidance for reporting on workforce mix assessments. Without sufficiently detailed guidance to help ensure complete reporting, input into future plans will continue to vary and the plan's usefulness as a workforce planning document will be diminished. Further, in those cases where DOD's performance measures are not aligned with its congressionally mandated reporting requirements, it is difficult for DOD to demonstrate progress against those requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommendations include that DOD issue clearer guidance for assessing its skills and competencies, conduct and report on gap analysis of mission-critical occupations, clarify its guidance for assessing workforce mix issues, and enhance its performance measures to align with congressionally mandated reporting requirements.

To determine  the extent to which DOD assessed its workforces to identify the  appropriate mix of military, civilian, and contractor personnel capabilities,  we obtained and reviewed DOD guidance on conducting these  assessments and analyzed DOD\u2019s efforts to apply the guidance. We  compared DOD\u2019s efforts to prior GAO work on assessing the appropriate  mix of workforces and identifying capabilities of those workforces.

For the 2010-2018 strategic  workforce plan, 11 functional communities provided some information on  their 22 mission-critical occupations in an appendix to the plan. Mission- critical occupations are positions key to DOD\u2019s current and future mission  requirements, as well as those that present recruiting and retention  challenges. Table 1 lists the 11 functional communities along with their  mission-critical occupations.", "DOD\u2019s mandated strategic workforce plans are developed by the Defense  Civilian Personnel Advisory Service\u2019s Strategic Human Capital Planning  Office, which is within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness. To collect data and information from the  functional communities, the Strategic Human Capital Planning Office  develops a reporting template that it sends to the 11 functional community  managers within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The  template consists of three sections that request information and data on  areas such as workforce end-strength forecasts, constraints that impact  the ability to meet end-strength targets, status of competency  development, and strategies to fill gaps. To complete the template, the  functional community managers work with their counterparts at the  component level to collect the necessary information and data for the  mission-critical occupations. Once the component-level functional  community managers collect the necessary information and data, they  send their completed templates back to the functional community  integrators, who compile all the information and data for each community  into one cohesive functional community document. The Strategic Human  Capital Planning Office then compiles the various reports from the  functional community managers and integrators and issues the report  after it passes an internal review. Figure 1 identifies the key offices that  develop the strategic workforce plan.", "Our previous work has found that, in general, DOD\u2019s efforts to develop  workforce plans have been mixed. In our February 2009 report, we  recommended that DOD develop performance plans for its program  offices that have responsibilities to oversee development of the strategic  workforce plan. Specifically, we recommended that the performance  plans include establishing implementation goals and time frames,  measuring performance, and aligning activities with resources to guide its  efforts to implement its strategic workforce plan. DOD partially concurred  with our recommendations and noted that efforts were underway to  develop performance plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Assessments of Existing and Future Critical Skills, Competencies, and Gaps Varied", "paragraphs": ["DOD assessed, to varying degrees, the existing and future critical skills  and competencies for all but one of its mission-critical occupations, but  the department did not assess gaps for most of them.

We have previously reported that it is essential for agencies  to determine the skills and competencies that are critical to successfully  achieving their missions and goals. This is especially important as  changes in national security, technology, budget constraints, and other  factors change the environment within which federal agencies operate.  The assessments contained in DOD\u2019s 2010-2018 plan, however, varied  significantly in terms of the amount of detail provided. This variation can  be attributed, in part, to the fact that some communities are able to draw  on existing requirements and standards. For example, the information  technology functional community used the Clinger-Cohen Competencies  for the Information Technology Workforce, which provide a description  of the technical competencies for various information technology  occupations, to assess the critical skills and competencies within its  workforce. Accordingly, the information technology functional community  manager was able to provide detail and specificity when describing this  community\u2019s assessment processes and the results of those  assessments. Similarly, the medical functional community was able to  use existing national standards for licensure and board certification for  physicians when it assessed particular critical skills and competencies.  This community was able to provide specific details about its assessment  processes and the results from those assessments. In contrast, while the  installations and environment functional community reported on the  competency models available for assessing its two mission-critical  occupations, firefighters and safety-and-health managers, this community  did not provide the results of any analyses using these models.", "DOD is also required to report on the critical skills and competencies that  will be needed in its future workforces. We have previously reported that  an agency needs to define the critical skills and competencies that it will  require in the future to meet its strategic program goals. Doing so can  help an agency align its human-capital approaches that enable and  sustain the contributions of all the critical skills and competencies needed  for the future.  Our assessment of DOD\u2019s 2010-2018 strategic workforce  plan found that for 17 of the 22 mission-critical occupations, DOD  provided some discussion of future competencies. For the remaining five  mission-critical occupations, DOD reported that functional community  managers were waiting for the completion of competency models for their  specific mission-critical occupations before assessing future  competencies. One functional community, Intelligence, did not provide an  assessment of skills and competencies for either its existing or future  mission-critical occupations. DOD officials told us that the intelligence  community\u2019s assessments are maintained in classified documents and  could not be provided in the department\u2019s 2010-2018 strategic workforce  plan. According to the plan, the Offices of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Intelligence and the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness, along with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,  agreed instead to capture the reporting requirements in already  established human-capital employment plans that were submitted by  intelligence-community elements to the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence. Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Intelligence acknowledged that they should provide input into DOD\u2019s  strategic workforce plan and stated that they would provide input into the  next submission of the plan.", "DOD officials responsible for developing the strategic workforce plan said  they followed a collaborative process and met numerous times to seek  input and guidance for developing the plan. To obtain information and  data from each functional community, the Strategic Human Capital  Planning Office distributed a reporting template to the functional  community managers that contained a series of questions related to the  requirements of section 115b of Title 10 of the United States Code. For  the 2010-2018 plan, from May 2009 through October 2010 the Strategic  Human Capital Planning Office provided informal guidance for template  development to functional community managers, integrators, and action  officers. This office also provided additional training and one-on-one  sessions with integrators, and tailored meetings with functional  community managers to address completion. The template, however, did  not define key terms such as skills and competencies. Accordingly, we  found that the functional community managers interpreted the questions  within the template differently and developed different understandings of  key terms. For example, officials in one functional community explained to  us that they viewed skills as a subset of a larger category of  competencies. Officials in a separate functional community associated  skills with employee capabilities and competencies with occupational  descriptions. Without clear guidance for assessing skills and  competencies, functional community managers are likely to continue to  provide inconsistent responses that vary in detail and usefulness to  decision makers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Majority of Functional Communities Did Not Conduct Competency Gap Assessments for Mission- Critical Occupations, and None Reported the Results of Gap Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Section 115b of Title 10 of the United States Code requires DOD to  include an assessment of gaps in the existing and future civilian  employee workforce that should be addressed to ensure that the  department has continued access to the critical skills and competencies  needed to accomplish its mission.

Our analysis found, however, that functional community  managers reported conducting competency gap assessments for only 8  of the 22 mission-critical occupations. These 8 occupations include  nurses, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, social workers, medical  officers, security specialists, police officers, and human-resources  managers. Further, in cases where the functional community managers  did conduct gap analyses, they did not report the results of these  assessments. Officials responsible for developing the 2010-2018 plan told  us that they focused on identifying critical-skill gaps based on staffing  levels in the mission-critical occupations. According to these officials,  competency gaps will be assessed using the Defense Competency  Assessment Tool that is scheduled for initial deployment in late fiscal year  2013.", "In some cases, competency models are still being developed that will  enable the functional communities to conduct gap assessments for their  mission-critical occupations. For example, the financial-management  functional community stated specifically in DOD\u2019s plan that it did not  complete a gap assessment because competency models for its mission- critical occupations remain incomplete. The financial-management  community reported in the plan that, upon completion of its competency  models, it will be able to fully assess gaps in knowledge and skills. DOD  officials responsible for the plan told us that they anticipate these models  to be completed by the end of 2012.", "Some functional communities, similarly, are waiting for the completion of  an automated competency assessment tool in order to complete their gap  assessments. The logistics functional community stated in the plan, for  example, that it will use DOD\u2019s Defense Competency Assessment Tool  when it becomes available. Because this community, as of September  2010, had more than 18,000 personnel serving in the mission-critical  occupation of logistics-management specialist, community officials  explained that the workforce is too large to track without an automated  tool.", "Further, some officials attributed the absence of gap analyses to other  priorities that took precedence. Officials acknowledged that they did not  address all of the statutory requirements and explained that their work on  the Secretary of Defense\u2019s 2010 efficiency initiatives\u2014which were  introduced to reduce duplication, overhead, and excess\u2014preempted their  efforts to develop responses for DOD\u2019s 2010 Strategic Workforce Plan.", "Finally, of the functional communities that reported completing gap  assessments for eight of the mission-critical occupations, none reported  the results. For example, the medical functional community reported that  DOD\u2019s Medical Health System analyzed a variety of data monthly to  ensure goals are met and to assess and respond to gaps for all five of its  mission-critical occupations: nurses, pharmacists, clinical psychologists,  social workers, and physicians. However, the plan did not report the  results of any of these assessments. Our analysis of the template DOD  sent to the functional community managers found that it was not clear in  all cases that each functional community should report the results of any  gap analyses or report the reasons why it could not conduct these  assessments\u2014if that is the case\u2014or report timelines for when the  assessments would be conducted.

From October of 2009 until December 2011, section 115b required  the submission of the plan on an annual basis, rather than on any specific  date. In December of 2011, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2012 amended section 115b to make the strategic plan a  biennial requirement, rather than an annual one. Our analysis shows,  based on these requirements, that DOD\u2019s first three submissions were  304, 115, and 395 days late, respectively. Additionally, while DOD issued  its third strategic workforce plan on March 31, 2010, the department  issued its fourth, and most recent, plan 24 months later on March 27,  2012. When DOD began development of its fourth plan, the department  was required to submit its workforce plan on an annual basis; by the time  DOD issued the plan the reporting requirement had been revised from an  annual to a biennial requirement.

Specifically, the medical and human-resources functional communities  provided the percentages of military, civilian, and contractor personnel for  their current workforce, and reported their desired mix for fiscal year  2016, as the template requested. For example, the medical functional  community provided workforce mix data for its military, civilian, and  contractor personnel in each of its mission-critical occupations. According  to officials responsible for the strategic workforce plan, the medical  functional community was able to provide workforce mix data because the  community already tracked personnel data as a way to maintain  oversight. Conversely, the logistics and information-technology functional  communities provided only the military and civilian workforce data and did  not include contractor data. The intelligence functional community did not  provide any workforce mix data for inclusion in the 2010 strategic  workforce plan.", "Moreover, data on contractor personnel was incomplete. During this  review, DOD officials responsible for the plan stated that they have  difficulties tracking contractor data, explaining that DOD contracts for  services rather than for individuals. We note, however, that this issue is  not new. DOD guidance requires defense officials to consider personnel  costs, among other factors, when making certain workforce decisions. For  example, a February 2005 DOD directive states that missions shall be  accomplished using the least costly mix of personnel (military, civilian,  and contract) consistent with military requirements and other needs of the  department. Subsequently, in April 2010, DOD issued an instruction that  included guidance on implementing the prior directive. Further it is DOD  policy that DOD components follow prescribed business rules when  performing an economic analysis in support of workforce decisions.  These rules apply when, among other circumstances, DOD\u2019s components  decide whether to use DOD civilians to perform functions that are  currently being performed by contractors but could be performed by DOD  civilians.", "By law, DOD is required to annually compile and review an inventory of  activities performed pursuant to contracts to help provide better insights  into the number of contractor full-time equivalents providing services to  the department, and the functions they are performing. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 requires  appropriate DOD officials to develop a plan, including an enforcement  mechanism, to ensure that this inventory of contracted services is used to  inform strategic workforce planning, among other things. The act also  directed the Secretary of Defense to establish policies and procedures for  determining the most appropriate and cost-efficient mix of military,  civilian, and contractor personnel to perform the mission of the  department. Further, the act directed that these policies and procedures  should specifically require DOD to use the strategic workforce plan,  among other things, when making these determinations, and that these  policies and procedures, once developed, should inform the strategic  workforce planning process. Earlier this year, we reported that DOD has  difficulty collecting data on the number of contractors performing work,  and that DOD is working on a means to collect the data. We also reported  that DOD has submitted to Congress a plan to collect personnel data  directly from contractors that would help inform the department of the  number of full-time-equivalent contractor staff.

All five performance measures include targets to  track progress toward goals\u2014such as a 70 percent target for key  milestones in mission-critical occupations\u2014so that the results of any  progress can be easily compared to the targets. Additionally, the  performance measures are quantifiable. For example, one of the  performance measures establishes a 15 percent variance between the  actual end-strength and the target end-strength of mission-critical  occupations.", "While DOD introduced these measures for the first time in its 2010-2018  strategic workforce plan, the department conducted preliminary  assessments of its progress against those measures. In this plan, DOD  reported in its preliminary observations that it has met two performance  measures\u2014key milestones and competency-model development\u2014and  partially met two other measures\u2014workforce-mission readiness and the  end-strength of mission-critical occupations. For example, according to  OSD\u2019s preliminary assessment, more than half of the mission-critical  occupations were within the 15 percent variance. DOD will use the fifth  performance measure, which addresses loss rates for new hires, to  assess the department\u2019s progress in implementing the plan in the next  strategic workforce planning cycle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Performance Measures Are Not Fully Aligned With Congressional Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["We have previously recommended that DOD develop a performance plan  that includes establishing implementation goals and time frames,  measuring performance, and aligning activities with resources. While the  performance measures that DOD established to monitor the department\u2019s  progress in implementing its strategic workforce plan generally align with  departmental goals and priorities, it is not clear in all cases how the five  measures will help DOD demonstrate progress in meeting all the  reporting requirements contained in section 115b of Title 10 United States  Code. While DOD is not required to develop performance measures that  monitor progress in meeting the statutory requirements, our prior work  has shown that agencies that have been successful in measuring their  performance generally developed measures that are responsive to  multiple priorities and complement different program strategies.  Additionally, DOD is required to develop performance measures to  monitor progress in implementing the strategic workforce plan, and the  plan itself states that one of its goals is to make progress toward meeting  the statutory requirements.", "Section 115b of Title 10 of the United States Code requires DOD to  include in its 2010-2018 strategic workforce plan an assessment of,  among other things, gaps in the existing and future civilian workforce that  should be addressed to ensure that the department has continued access  to the critical skills and competencies, and the appropriate mix of military,  civilian, and contractor personnel capabilities. During this review, we  found, as we reported earlier in this report, that the department did not  conduct comprehensive assessments in these two areas. Although one of  DOD\u2019s performance measures\u2014key milestones\u2014identifies assessments  of competency gaps and workforce mix as key milestones, the plan does  not describe how the department assessed progress in these areas or  interim steps as to how it plans to meet these milestones. As a result, it is  unclear how this measure addresses DOD\u2019s progress in implementing the  portions of the plan related to these two requirements, and how the  performance measures and the department\u2019s efforts align with and  address congressional requirements. According to prior GAO work,  performance measures should align with and indicate progress toward  the goals of the organization. Without a clear, effective alignment of  DOD\u2019s performance measures with United States Code requirements, the  department will not be in the best position to measure and report how it is  meeting its congressional requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With about a third of DOD\u2019s civilian workforce eligible to retire by 2015\u2014 during a time of changing national security threats and challenging fiscal  realities\u2014it is imperative that decision makers in DOD and Congress  have access to complete and timely information on the skills,  competencies, and any associated gaps within DOD\u2019s civilian workforce.  However, because the office responsible for developing the plan did not  provide sufficiently detailed guidance to the managers who were  responsible for providing key data, the information in the current plan on  skills and competencies varies significantly. Further, while DOD officials  have stated that they do not have the necessary tools in place to conduct  gap analyses across the board, the department has not reported the  results of any gap analyses that it has conducted nor provided reporting  timeframes for conducting remaining gap analyses; this situation  diminishes the plan\u2019s utility as a workforce planning document. To the  extent that DOD provided data in 2012, the data was based on  information from 2010, which further limits this document\u2019s use for  planning purposes. When the reports use dated information, decision  makers do not have relevant information for managing the critical needs  of the federal workforce. Further, DOD did not collect all required  information for its 2010-2018 strategic workforce plans, including the  number or percentage of military, civilian, and contractor personnel and  the capabilities for those three workforces. Without revised guidance  specifying the need to collect all information required for a complete  assessment to determine the appropriate mix of the three workforces,  DOD will have difficulty in determining if its civilian workforce is properly  sized to carry out essential missions. Finally, where DOD has identified  performance measures and indicated progress toward the goals of the  strategic plan, those measures are not, in all cases, aligned with DOD\u2019s  congressionally mandated reporting requirements; also, the measures do  not provide detail about how DOD plans to meet those requirements,  making it difficult for DOD to demonstrate progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To meet the congressional requirement to conduct assessments of critical  skills, competencies, and gaps for both existing and future civilian  workforces, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to include in  the guidance that it disseminates for developing future strategic workforce  plans clearly defined terms and processes for conducting these  assessments.", "To help ensure that Congress has the necessary information to provide  effective oversight over DOD\u2019s civilian workforce, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness to conduct competency gap analyses for DOD\u2019s mission- critical occupations and report the results. When managers cannot  conduct such analyses, we recommend that DOD report a timeline in the  strategic workforce plan for providing these assessments.", "To help ensure that the data presented in DOD\u2019s strategic workforce  plans are current and timely, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness to establish and adhere to timelines that will ensure issuance  of future strategic workforce plans in accordance with statutory  timeframes.", "To enhance the information that DOD provides Congress in its strategic  workforce plan, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to provide  guidance for developing future strategic workforce plans that clearly  directs the functional communities to collect information that identifies not  only the number or percentage of personnel in its military, civilian, and  contractor workforces but also the capabilities of the appropriate mix of  those three workforces.", "To better develop and submit future DOD strategic workforce plans, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to enhance the  department\u2019s results-oriented performance measures by revising existing  measures or developing additional measures that will more clearly align  with DOD\u2019s efforts to monitor progress in meeting the strategic workforce  planning requirements in section 115b of Title 10 of the United States  Code."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with our first  recommendation and partially concurred with the remaining four  recommendations. DOD comments are reprinted in appendix II.", "While DOD acknowledged that we had conducted a thorough review and  assessment of DOD\u2019s Fiscal Year 2010-2018 Strategic Workforce Plan  for, DOD also expressed its disappointment that we did not appear to give  the department credit for the major progress that it has made, including  actions to reframe its planning progress from the current state to a  comprehensive future state by 2015.  Further, DOD stated that the overall  negative tone \u2013 in its opinion \u2013 overshadowed the monumental efforts of  the department. We disagree. The objectives in our final report are  consistent with the objectives we presented to DOD when we first notified  the department of our review at the beginning of this engagement, and we  did provide positive examples where DOD had responded to  congressional direction, especially as those actions related to our report\u2019s  objectives.  For example, we state clearly in our report, among other  things, that DOD assessed to varying degrees the existing and future  critical skills and competencies for all but one of its mission-critical  occupations.  This has been a longstanding issue and represents  progress.  Further, we reported that DOD developed performance  measures to assess progress in implementing its workforce plan.  This  was a new reporting requirement for DOD, and we reported that DOD had  been responsive to this requirement.", "DOD also asserted that our recommendations simply restate areas for  improvement that the department already identified in its plan, and which  have already been implemented since the plan was published.  We note,  however, that these issues are not new.  We first reported on DOD\u2019s  strategic workforce planning for its civilian workforce in 2004.    Subsequently, Congress mandated that DOD develop and submit civilian  workforce strategic plans to the congressional defense committees, and  that we conduct our own independent assessment of those plans.   We  have previously conducted 3 reviews of DOD\u2019s plans since 2008 and our  work has reported mixed results.   We recommended in 2008, for  example, that DOD address all of its statutory reporting requirements, and  note that DOD did not concur with this recommendation.   (In 2010, we  reported that DOD\u2019s civilian workforce plan addressed 5 and partially  addressed 9 of DOD\u2019s 14 legislative requirements.)   In 2009, we  recommended, among other things, that DOD develop a performance  plan that includes establishing implementation goals and timeframes,  measuring performance, and aligning activities with resources.   DOD  partially concurred with these recommendations. Given the response by  DOD to our previous reports and recommendations on these issues, we  have reviewed the recommendations that we present in this report and  continue to believe that corrective action is needed.", "DOD concurred with our first recommendation to include in guidance that  it disseminates for developing future workforce plans clearly defined  terms and processes for conducting these assessments.  DOD stated in  its agency comments, among other things, that it has already provided  numerous governance and policy documents, and more, to assist key  stakeholders in meeting strategic workforce plan reporting requirements.   We make similar statements in our report. DOD also stated in its agency  comments, however, that the department strives for continuous  improvement and has already provided additional guidance for the next  planning cycle, for this reason they believe no additional direction from  the Secretary of Defense is needed. We do not disagree that DOD strives  for continuous improvement.  However, during the course of our audit  work, we found, as we state in our report, that functional community  managers interpreted questions in DOD\u2019s guiding template differently and  developed different understandings of key terms.  Therefore, we continue  to believe that this recommendation will enhance the development of  DOD\u2019s next strategic workforce plan.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation that DOD  conduct gap analyses for DOD\u2019s mission-critical occupations and report  on the results, and, when managers cannot conduct such analyses,  report a timeline for providing these assessments.  DOD also stated its  belief that no additional direction from the Secretary of Defense is needed  with regard to this recommendation.  In its agency comments, DOD  stated that the department focused on the identification of critical skill  gaps based on staffing levels in its mission-critical occupations.  We  agree that DOD\u2019s plan includes these data.  However, we reported that  DOD is required to include an assessment of competency gaps in its  existing and future civilian employee workforces, and that our analyses  found that DOD\u2019s functional community managers reported conducting  gap assessments for only 8 of DOD\u2019s 22 mission-critical occupations.    Therefore we continue to believe that DOD needs to conduct these  analyses and, for clarity, we added references to competency gap  analyses in our finding and recommendation, as appropriate. DOD stated  in its agency comments that competency gaps will be assessed in the  future.", "DOD also partially concurred with our third recommendation that DOD  establish and adhere to timelines that will ensure issuance of future  strategic workforce plans in accordance with statutory timeframes but,  similarly to its other responses, added that no additional direction is  needed from the Secretary of Defense at this time.  In its comments, DOD  stated that the department does have an established planning process  and timeline, and that this established process aligns with the budget  cycle and takes about a year to complete because of the size and  complexity of the department.  DOD added that the planning cycle  timeline is flexible enough to allow for significant events, among other  things, and provided a notional strategic workforce plan timeline as an  attachment to its agency comments.  However, we continue to believe it  is key that DOD take steps to adhere to the timelines it establishes to  meet congressional reporting requirements and enhance the utility of its  future reports.  As we note in our report, DOD has issued all of its  strategic workforce plans late since 2007.", "Regarding our fourth recommendation, DOD also partially concurred that  DOD provide guidance for developing future workforce plans that clearly  directs the functional communities to collect information that identifies not  only the number or percentage of personnel in its military, civilian, and  contractor workforces but also the capabilities of the appropriate mix of  those three workforces.  While DOD agreed that additional improvements  are necessary, the department again stated that it did not believe  additional direction is necessary from the Secretary of Defense.  In its  comments, DOD stated that is preparing to pilot a capabilities-based  approach to assess civilian and military workforce and contract support.   We continue to note DOD\u2019s existing requirement to conduct an  assessment of the appropriate mix of military, civilian, and contractor  personnel capabilities, and we look forward to seeing the results of DOD\u2019s  pilot program.", "Finally, DOD also partially concurred with our fifth recommendation that  the department enhance its results-oriented performance measures by  revising existing measures or developing additional measures that will  more clearly align with DOD\u2019s efforts to monitor progress in meeting the  strategic workforce planning requirements contained in statute. However,  again, DOD did not believe any additional direction from the Secretary of  Defense was needed. In its response, DOD stated that the measures in  the fiscal year 2010-2018 strategic workforce plan do assess progress  both in implementing the strategic workforce plan and in meeting the  statutory requirements and, as an attachment to its comments, provided a  matrix\u2014that it developed in response to our draft report\u2014to show  linkages between the two.  Based on the matrix, we agree with DOD\u2019s  assertion that some alignment does exist between the performance  measures and the statutory criteria.  However, the justification that DOD  provided in its matrix for demonstrating these linkages is not always clear.   Further, DOD did not include this analysis in its plan.  We did not state in  our report that the performance measures that DOD developed were  inappropriate in some way. However, our analysis did find that DOD  continues to struggle to meet its statutory reporting requirements.  Therefore, we continue to believe that DOD can enhance its performance  measures by more clearly aligning them to those requirements.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and  appropriate congressional committees.

We also met with functional  community managers in the information technology, financial  management, logistics, and law enforcement communities to determine  how each of these communities conducted their strategic workforce  planning and how coordination occurred between the various levels of  DOD. We selected these four functional communities because they  represent three of the largest and one of the smallest functional  communities included in the plan. Further, DOD business-systems  modernization (information technology), financial management, and DOD  supply-chain management (logistics) are on GAO\u2019s High-Risk list.
