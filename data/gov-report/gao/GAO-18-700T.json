PFOS and PFOA are part of a larger class of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which can be found in firefighting foam used by DOD. In May 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued nonenforceable drinking water health advisories for those two chemicals. Health advisories include recommended levels of contaminants that can be present in drinking water at which adverse health effects are not anticipated to occur over specific exposure durations.", "In response to those health advisories, DOD's military departments directed their military installations to (1) identify locations with a known or suspected release of PFOS and PFOA and address any releases that pose a risk to human health, which can include people living outside DOD installations, and (2) test for PFOS and PFOA in installation drinking water and address any contamination above the levels in EPA's health advisories. For example:", "As of August 2017, DOD had identified 401 active or closed military installations with known or suspected releases of PFOS or PFOA.", "The military departments had reported spending approximately $200 million at or near 263 installations for environmental investigations and responses related to PFOS and PFOA, as of December 2016. According to DOD, it may take several years for the department to determine how much it will cost to clean up PFOS and PFOA contamination at or near its military installations.", "DOD reported taking actions (such as providing alternative drinking water and installing treatment systems) as of August 2017 to address PFOS and PFOA levels exceeding those recommended in EPA's health advisories for drinking water for people (1) on 13 military installations in the United States and (2) outside 22 military installations in the United States.", "In addition to actions initiated by DOD, GAO reported in October 2017 that the department also had received and responded to four orders from EPA and state regulators that required DOD to address PFOS and PFOA levels that exceeded EPA's health advisory levels for drinking water at or near four installations.", "GAO also reported in October 2017 that DOD was taking steps to address health and environmental concerns with its use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS. These steps included restricting the use of existing foams that contain PFAS; testing foams to identify the amount of PFAS they contain; and funding research on developing PFAS-free foam that can meet DOD's performance requirements, which specify how long it should take for foam to extinguish a fire and keep it from reigniting. In a June 2018 report to Congress, DOD stated that no commercially available PFAS-free foam has met DOD's performance requirements and that research to develop such a PFAS-free foam is ongoing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss our report on  the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) attention to drinking water  contaminants, part of our body of work on the federal government\u2019s  environmental liabilities. The federal government is financially liable for  cleaning up areas where federal activities have contaminated the  environment. Today\u2019s hearing addresses federal liability for and  procurement of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a large group  of man-made chemicals that include perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)  and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).

The Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) has found PFOS and PFOA in drinking water  across the United States, including in drinking water at or near DOD  installations. EPA has not regulated PFOS and PFOA in drinking water,  but EPA did issue nonenforceable drinking water health advisories for  these contaminants in May 2016, which we discuss further in this  statement. Addressing PFOS and PFOA contamination represents a  potentially significant environmental liability for DOD because the  regulatory requirements are still evolving, the scientific community is still  developing the underlying science, and the scope of work needed for  cleanup is not yet known.", "In our statement today, we discuss actions DOD has taken to address  elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water at or near military  installations and to address concerns with DOD\u2019s firefighting foam.

EPA has issued such  regulations for approximately 90 drinking water contaminants. Public  water systems, including the DOD public water systems that provide  drinking water to about 3 million people living and working on military  installations, are required to comply with EPA and state drinking water  regulations.", "While EPA has not issued legally enforceable standards for PFAS in  drinking water, the agency has monitored water systems in the United  States for six types of PFAS chemicals\u2014including PFOS and PFOA\u2014in  order to understand the nationwide occurrence of these chemicals. This  monitoring effort was part of a larger framework established by the Safe  Drinking Water Act to assess unregulated contaminants. Under this  framework, EPA is to select for consideration from a list (called the  contaminant candidate list) those unregulated contaminants that present  the greatest public health concern, establish a program to monitor  drinking water for unregulated contaminants, and decide whether or not to  regulate at least 5 such contaminants every 5 years (called a regulatory  determination).", "EPA\u2019s regulatory determinations are to be based on the following three  broad statutory criteria, all of which must be met for EPA to decide that a  drinking water regulation is needed:  the contaminant may have an adverse effect on the health of persons; the contaminant is known to occur or there is a substantial likelihood that the contaminant will occur in public water systems with a frequency and at levels of public health concern; and in the sole judgment of the EPA Administrator, regulation of such contaminant presents a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems.", "To date, PFOS and PFOA are unregulated because EPA has not made a  positive regulatory determination for these chemicals.", "Even when EPA has not issued a regulation, EPA may publish drinking  water health advisories. In contrast to drinking water regulations, health  advisories are nonenforceable. Health advisories recommend the  amount of contaminants that can be present in drinking water\u2014\u201chealth  advisory levels\u201d\u2014at which adverse health effects are not anticipated to  occur over specific exposure durations. Most recently, in May 2016 EPA  issued lifetime health advisories for PFOS and PFOA. These advisories  set the recommended health advisory level for each contaminant\u2014or  both contaminants combined\u2014at 70 parts per trillion in drinking water.  According to DOD, the department also considers information in these  health advisories when determining the need for cleanup action at  installations with PFOS and PFOA contamination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Initiated Actions to Address Elevated Levels of PFOS and PFOA in Drinking Water and Concerns with Firefighting Foam", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Has Initiated Actions to Identify, Test, Address, and Respond to Orders from Regulators Regarding PFOS and PFOA in Drinking Water", "paragraphs": ["We reported in October 2017 that, following the release of EPA\u2019s lifetime  health advisory for PFOS and PFOA in May 2016, each of the military  departments directed their installations to  identify locations with any known or suspected prior release of PFOS and PFOA and to address any releases that pose a risk to human health\u2014which can include people living outside DOD installations; and test for PFOS and PFOA in their drinking water and address any contamination above EPA\u2019s lifetime health advisory level.", "We further reported that, as of December 2016, DOD had identified 393  active or closed military installations with any known or suspected  releases of PFOS or PFOA. Since we issued our report, DOD has  updated that number to 401 active or closed installations, according to  August 2017 data provided in a March 2018 report to Congress on the  department\u2019s response to PFOS and PFOA contamination.", "We stated in our October 2017 report that the military departments had  reported spending approximately $200 million at or near 263 installations  for environmental investigations and response actions, such as installing  treatment systems or supplying bottled water, as of December 2016.", "The Air Force had identified 203 installations with known or suspected releases of PFOS and PFOA and had spent about $153 million on environmental investigations and response actions (accounting for about 77 percent of what the military departments had spent on PFOS and PFOA activities as of December 2016). For example, the Air Force reported spending over $5 million at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. During our visit to that installation in November 2016, officials showed us the current and former fire training areas that they were investigating to determine the extent to which prior use of firefighting foam may have contributed to PFOS and PFOA found in the drinking water of three nearby communities. Additionally, the Air Force had awarded a contract for, among other things, installing treatment systems in those communities.", "The Navy had identified 127 installations with known or suspected releases of PFOS and PFOA and had spent about $44.5 million on environmental investigations and response actions (accounting for about 22 percent of what the military departments had spent on PFOS and PFOA activities as of December 2016). For example, the Navy reported spending about $15 million at the former Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove in Pennsylvania. During our visit to that installation in August 2016, officials told us that the Navy was investigating the extent to which PFOS and PFOA on the installation may have contaminated a nearby town\u2019s drinking water. At the time, the Navy had agreed to pay for installing treatment systems and connecting private well owners to the town\u2019s drinking water system, among other things.", "The Army had identified 61 installations with known or suspected releases of PFOS and PFOA and had spent about $1.6 million on environmental investigations (accounting for less than 1 percent of what the military departments had spent on PFOS and PFOA  activities as of December 2016), but had not yet begun any response  actions. At the time of our October 2017 report, the Army had not yet  completed testing its drinking water for PFOS and PFOA.", "DOD\u2019s March 2018 report to Congress provided updated information on  actions taken (such as providing alternative drinking water or installing  treatment systems) to address PFOS and PFOA in drinking water at or  near military installations in the United States, as shown in figure 1 below.  Specifically, DOD reported taking action as of August 2017 to address  PFOS and PFOA levels exceeding those recommended in EPA\u2019s health  advisories for drinking water for people (1) on 13 military installations and  (2) outside 22 military installations.", "We reported in October 2017 that, in addition to actions initiated by DOD,  the department also took action in response to state and federal  regulators. DOD responded to four administrative orders requiring that  DOD address PFOS and PFOA levels that exceeded EPA\u2019s health  advisory levels for drinking water. One order was issued by the Ohio  Environmental Protection Agency at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in  Ohio, and three orders were issued by EPA at the former Pease Air Force  Base in New Hampshire; Horsham Air Guard Station in Pennsylvania;  and the former Naval Air Warfare Center Warminster in Pennsylvania.  For example, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, levels of PFOS and  PFOA that exceeded EPA\u2019s lifetime health advisory levels were found at  two wells on the installation in 2016. In response to the order from the  Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the Air Force closed drinking  water wells, installed new monitoring wells, and provided bottled water to  vulnerable populations on the installation. Additional details on each order  and examples of actions by DOD to address the orders were reported on  in our October 2017 report.", "According to DOD, it may take several years for the department to  determine how much it will cost to clean up PFOS and PFOA  contamination at or near its military installations. Additionally, DOD  officials told us in September 2018 that they believe a legally enforceable  EPA drinking water cleanup standard would ensure greater consistency  and confidence in their cost estimates because such a standard would  give them a consistent target to clean up to. In a January 2017 report on  environmental cleanup at closed installations, we recommended that  DOD include in future annual reports to Congress best estimates of the  environmental cleanup costs for contaminants such as PFOS and PFOA  as additional information becomes available.

Others, such as researching potential PFAS-free firefighting foams, were  in progress at the time of our review.", "DOD\u2019s military specification for firefighting foam, which outlines  performance and compatibility requirements, also requires that firefighting  foam purchased by the department contain PFAS. We reported in  October 2017 that, according to DOD, there was no PFAS-free firefighting  foam that could meet DOD\u2019s performance and compatibility requirements.  As a result, the Navy\u2014which is the author of the military specification\u2014 had no plans to remove the requirement for firefighting foam to contain  PFAS. However, Navy officials told us during our review that if a PFAS- free foam were to be developed that could meet DOD performance and  compatibility requirements the Navy would make any necessary revisions  to the military specification at that time. Navy officials also said during our  review that they were planning to revise the military specification to set  limits for the amount of PFAS that are allowed in firefighting foam,  following their testing on the amounts of PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS  found in foam used by DOD.", "In June 2018, DOD reported to Congress that its military specification for  firefighting foam was amended to set a maximum level of PFOS and  PFOA (800 parts per billion). DOD officials told us in September 2018  this maximum level applies to the amount of those chemicals in  firefighting foam concentrate before it is mixed and diluted with water to  create firefighting foam. The DOD officials also said that 800 parts per  billion is the lowest level of PFOS and PFOA that can be detected in  firefighting foam concentrate by current testing methods and  technologies, but DOD is working with foam manufacturers and  laboratories to achieve lower detection limits. According to the June 2018  report, DOD plans to establish lower limits for PFOS and PFOA in  firefighting foam in late 2018. The June 2018 report reiterated that,  according to DOD, no commercially available PFAS-free foam has met  the performance requirements of the military specification, and the report  also stated that DOD-funded research efforts to develop a PFAS-free  foam that can meet performance requirements are still ongoing.", "Chairman Paul, Ranking Member Peters, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes our prepared statement.
