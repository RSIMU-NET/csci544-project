It has been described as an epidemic with society-wide repercussions. While combating elder financial exploitation is largely the responsibility of state and local social service, criminal justice, and consumer protection agencies, the federal government has a role to play in this area as well. GAO was asked to review issues related to elder financial exploitation. This report describes the challenges states face in (1) preventing and (2) responding to elder financial exploitation, as well as the actions some federal agencies have taken to help states address these challenges.", "To obtain this information, GAO interviewed state and local social service, criminal justice, and consumer protection officials in California, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania--states with large elderly populations; officials in seven federal agencies; and various elder abuse experts. GAO also analyzed federal strategic plans and other documents and reviewed relevant research, federal laws and regulations, and state laws."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Officials in each of the four states GAO contacted identified the need for more safeguards and public awareness activities to help prevent elder financial exploitation. They also noted that it is difficult to prevent exploitation by individuals such as financial services providers, power of attorney agents, guardians, and paid in-home caregivers. Although states have primary responsibility for combating elder financial exploitation, the federal government could disseminate information on model power of attorney legislation, for example, to help states better safeguard against power of attorney abuse--one type of federal activity authorized under the Older Americans Act of 1965. In addition, experts and state and local officials told GAO that many older adults need more information about what constitutes elder financial exploitation in order to report and avoid it. The seven federal agencies GAO reviewed have undertaken activities to increase public awareness of elder financial exploitation. While some experts observed that a nationwide approach to educating the public is needed, federal public awareness activities are not currently conducted as part of a broader coordinated approach, which GAO believes could help ensure the effective use of federal resources. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council, which held its first meeting in 2012, could be the vehicle for developing and implementing a coordinated national strategy. The Council is composed of officials from federal agencies and is charged with developing national priorities and coordinating federal elder justice activities.", "Experts and officials in each state GAO reviewed indicated that difficulty 1) gaining expertise, 2) sustaining collaboration between law enforcement and adult protective services agencies, and 3) obtaining data hinders their response to elder financial exploitation. As with prevention, many federal agencies have individually taken steps to address these challenges that are in line with their own missions. For example, the Department of Justice (Justice) has begun to construct a website that contains training and other materials prosecutors can use to build their expertise in investigating and prosecuting elder abuse, which includes elder financial exploitation. However, there are gaps in federal support in some areas. For example, law enforcement officials in each of the four states GAO reviewed indicated that it is not clear how they should obtain the federal support they need to respond to interstate and international cases. Justice can provide this information, in keeping with its priority to strengthen its relationship with state and local law enforcement. Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Consumer Sentinel Network database compiles incidents of financial exploitation reported to it by many sources around the country but receives incidents from state government agencies in only 12 states. The database would be of greater use if FTC obtained incidents from more of the states and contained an indicator that the incident involved an older adult."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies should develop a written national strategy addressing challenges GAO identified, facilitate case investigation and prosecution, and improve data, among other things. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Health and Human Services supported GAO's recommendations. FTC did not believe it is necessary to examine the feasibility of requiring victim's age in complaints. GAO maintains the importance of its recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Elder financial exploitation is the illegal or improper use of an older adult\u2019s  funds, property, or assets. Experts have described it as an epidemic with  society-wide repercussions. Perpetrators may be family members; paid  home care workers; those with fiduciary responsibilities, such as financial  advisors or legal guardians; or strangers who inundate older adults with  mail, telephone, or Internet scams. Older adults are particularly  vulnerable to financial exploitation because, as research has shown,  financial decision-making ability decreases with age. Moreover, older  adults are often ashamed to report exploitation or even admit that they  have been exploited because they are afraid of losing their  independence. As a result, existing data on elder financial exploitation  may substantially underestimate its extent.", "Elder financial exploitation has far-reaching effects on its victims in  particular and society in general. A study of media reports from April to  June 2010 estimated that financial exploitation cost older adults at least  $2.9 billion in 2010.  The money that older adults lose in these cases is  rarely recovered, and the loss can undermine both the health of older  adults and their ability to support or care for themselves. Consequently,  the burden of caring for exploited older adults may fall on various state  and federal programs. For example, a review of 80 elder financial  exploitation cases in Utah in 2010 found the state\u2019s Medicaid program  would potentially have to pay about $900,000 to cover the cost of care for  older adults in that state who had suffered substantial losses.", "As the U.S. population ages, growing numbers of older adults could be at  risk of financial exploitation, so its potential impact on society is likely to  increase. Combating elder financial exploitation is primarily the  responsibility of state and local agencies. At the same time, however,  multiple federal agencies have a role to play in supporting state and local  efforts. In light of these growing concerns, we were asked to provide  information on elder financial exploitation issues. Specifically, this report  addresses the challenges states face in (1) preventing and (2) responding  to elder financial exploitation, as well as the actions some federal  agencies have taken to help states address these challenges.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed officials from agencies that  included state and local social services, criminal justice, and consumer  protection agencies in California, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania.  We selected these states to achieve variation in location, because of the  large size of their elder population, and because each state had a number  of initiatives to combat elder financial exploitation. Across the four states,  we held interviews with representatives from entities such as state and  local adult protective services (APS) agencies; offices of attorneys  general; police and sheriffs\u2019 departments; local district attorneys and  courts; and state banking, securities, and insurance regulators. In three of  the four states we also spoke with private organizations that work on  issues related to elder financial exploitation, such as a university research  center, elder abuse forensic center, and state banking association. In  Pennsylvania, we met with experts from the Institute on Protective  Services at Temple University and also attended an elder financial  exploitation training for APS workers that was hosted by the Institute. We  focused only on financial exploitation of older adults living at home, not on  older adults in long-term care facilities.", "We also interviewed experts in the field of elder abuse\u2014including  academics and practitioners\u2014and representatives from a variety of non- profit and private sector organizations, such as the AARP, American Bar  Association, and American Bankers Association. We interviewed  representatives from University of California at Irvine\u2019s Center of  Excellence on Elder Abuse and Neglect and the University of Kentucky\u2019s  Justice Center for Elders and Vulnerable Adults. In addition, in order to  gain the perspectives of large national and small community banks, we  interviewed officials at six financial institutions. These banks are not,  however, representative of banks nationwide.", "Furthermore, we interviewed officials and analyzed strategic plans and  other documents from seven federal agencies\u2014including the  Administration on Aging (AoA) within the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection  (commonly referred to as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or  CFPB), Department of Justice (Justice), Federal Trade Commission  (FTC), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) within the  Department of the Treasury, Postal Inspection Service, and Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC). In total, we held dozens of interviews  with experts and officials from federal, state, local, and non-governmental  organizations.", "We also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, as well as  selected state laws. Moreover, we attended the initial meeting of  members of the Elder Justice Coordinating Council (EJCC), which  includes officials from 11 federal agencies with an interest in elder abuse.  We also attended several conferences related to elder financial  exploitation, including the American Society on Aging\u2019s 2012 Aging in  America Conference, California District Attorneys Association\u2019s (CDAA)  2011 Elder Abuse Symposium, Stanford Center on Longevity and the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\u2019s (FINRA) 2011 State and Future  of Financial Fraud Conference, Elder Financial Protection Network\u2019s  (EFPN) 2012 Call to Action Conference, and a 2011 webcast on elder  issues hosted by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human  Services and State Bar Association\u2019s 2011 Elder Issues Webcast. At the  CDAA Symposium, we held small group meetings with district attorneys  and investigators from various counties in California. And at the EFPN  Conference we held a small group meeting with local district attorneys,  advocates, a state insurance agency official, and a financial institution.", "To illustrate the complexities of combating elder exploitation, we met with  a social service agency, several criminal justice agencies, and, in one  case, a family member to develop detailed case histories on six  prosecuted cases of elder financial exploitation. The perpetrators in these  cases were family members, financial services providers, or telephone  scammers. We identified cases from news stories and internet searches.  We selected six cases because they (1) occurred in three of our four  review states (California, New York, and Pennsylvania), (2) involved each  of the different types of elder financial exploitation (exploitation by family  or trusted others, exploitation by financial services providers, and  exploitation by strangers), and (3) included instances where more than  one agency or system was involved. The cases we selected are a non- generalizable sample of elder financial exploitation cases.", "Lastly, we identified and reviewed research published from 2000 onward  on elder financial abuse or elder financial exploitation by searching  numerous bibliographic databases and reviewing materials cited by elder  abuse experts or published by federal, state, and non-governmental  organizations. We focused our review on published research on the  extent, impact, cost, and nature of elder financial exploitation. We also  interviewed an official from the Utah Division of Aging and Adult Services  to discuss the state\u2019s study on the cost of elder financial exploitation.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 to November  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

As a group, older adults tend to possess more  wealth than those who are younger because they have had a longer time  to acquire it. In addition, the incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other  dementias that undermine judgment increases with age. Moreover,  financial capacity\u2014the capacity to manage money and financial assets in  ways that meet one\u2019s needs\u2014generally declines with age, and this  decline may go unaddressed until it is too late.", "State and local agencies in the social services, criminal justice, and  consumer protection systems in each state are at the forefront of efforts  to prevent, detect, and respond to elder financial exploitation. Seven  federal agencies whose missions correspond to the state and local social  service, criminal justice, and consumer protection systems are positioned  to contribute to state and local efforts in this area: AoA, CFPB, Justice,  FTC, FinCEN, SEC, and the Postal Inspection Service (see fig. 1).", "At the state and local level, APS agencies investigate and substantiate  reports of suspected elder abuse, including financial exploitation and, if  the client agrees to accept help, can arrange for services to secure their  safety and meet their basic needs. APS can also refer cases to law  enforcement agencies or district attorneys for criminal investigation and  prosecution. Whether an elder financial exploitation case comes to the  attention of criminal justice authorities through referral from APS or some  other means, law enforcement agencies and district attorneys can  exercise broad discretion when deciding if a case warrants any action on  their part.", "State-level consumer protection agencies\u2014such as banking, securities,  and insurance regulators\u2014conduct examinations to ensure that rules to  protect consumers are followed and take enforcement actions against  institutions that break the rules.

The  agent persuaded him to invest about $250,000 in a flexible premium deferred annuity,  warning him not to let anyone talk him out of it. As a result, the man was left with no  penalty-free access to his entire life savings for the next 11 years, while the agent  earned a commission on this transaction. To earn about $16,000 more in  commissions, the agent then convinced the man to move half the amount invested in  the annuity into unregistered stock, which cost the man a surrender fee of about  $10,000. The stock turned out to be worthless, leaving the man with a fraction of what  he had when he met the agent. Attempts by the man\u2019s nephew to retrieve his uncle\u2019s  money were unsuccessful. The nephew reported the insurance agent to the California  Department of Insurance, which eventually revoked the agent\u2019s license, but local  police did not pursue the older adult\u2019s case.

The scheme was reported to FINRA, investigated by the  FBI, and prosecuted by the Eastern District of New York U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, which  sought sentencing enhancements for targeting the elderly. Victims lost over $12  million. They also reported irreplaceable financial losses, emotional distress, feelings  of betrayal and disbelief, and various physical symptoms as a result.", "SEC has developed some educational materials and SEC and CFPB  have conducted research related to investment fraud that targets older  adults. For example, SEC has published a guide for older adults that  counsels them to check their investment adviser\u2019s disciplinary history,  lists warning signs of fraud, and provides information on where to go for  help. SEC also provides a link to a FINRA website that provides  consumers with the required qualifications, including educational  requirements, of the designations used by securities professionals. In  August 2012, SEC released a study on financial literacy among investors  and stated the agency\u2019s desire to develop a strategy for increasing the  financial literacy of certain groups, including older adults. CFPB plans to  issue a report in early 2013 to Congress and the SEC that will address  providing information to older adults about financial advisors and their  credentials. In June 2012, the CFPB issued a public inquiry for  information about elder financial exploitation, including a question on what  resources older adults have to determine the legitimacy, value, and  authenticity of credentials held by investment professionals.expects to share its results in 2013.", "Older adults can use a legal document referred to as a financial power of  attorney to appoint another person (an agent) to manage their finances  should they become incapable of doing so. Having a financial power of  attorney enables an older adult (a principal) to choose the person who  can legally make these decisions for them, when needed. Powers of  attorney are easy for anyone to create, can vary in specificity and format,  and do not require legal assistance or a court for execution. Each of the  four states we contacted has a law that helps prevent misuse of powers  of attorney by specifying the responsibilities of agents and, in at least one,  penalties for misuse. However, powers of attorney can be forged or  perhaps otherwise improperly obtained without a principal\u2019s knowledge or  consent and an agent can easily use the principal\u2019s money for his or her  own benefit. For this reason, many state and local officials we interviewed  in the four states were concerned about misuse of these instruments. For  example, one Pennsylvania official described power of attorney  documents as a \u201cpowerful, simple, and dangerous tool.\u201d", "A month after an elderly man with dementia and his wife agreed to add their  daughter\u2019s name to their bank account, the daughter convinced her mother to sign a  document providing her financial power of attorney.

Over the next 3 months, the daughter placed the deed to her parent\u2019s  home in her name, wrote checks on their account totaling nearly $600,000 that were  never questioned by the bank, and attempted to withdraw about $500,000 more.  When the woman\u2019s son discovered what had been happening, he had the bank stop  payment on the $500,000 and asked the local district attorney to investigate. The  daughter was charged with numerous counts of theft, pled guilty, and was sentenced  to 3 years probation. The deed was transferred back to the woman and although the  prosecutor sought restitution, the $600,000 was not recoverable\u2014it had been used to  pay off the daughter\u2019s mortgage, country club membership, and other bills.", "Some APS and criminal justice officials we spoke to indicated that  stronger state power of attorney laws could help prevent elder financial  exploitation by agents. For example, Pennsylvania officials said that  current state laws have been ineffective at (1) creating practices to  monitor the activities of power of attorney agents and (2) encouraging  banks to question power of attorney documents they find questionable. In  California, law enforcement officials noted that notaries were not always  held accountable for their role in signing power of attorney documents.", "To help strengthen state laws designed to prevent misuse of financial  powers of attorney, the Uniform Law Commission has developed the  Uniform Power of Attorney Act, which explicitly defines the duties of the power of attorney agent,  including fiduciary duties such as acting in good faith and keeping  careful records; allows a third party to refuse to honor a power of attorney  agreement if there is a good faith belief that the principal may be  subject to abuse, and requires the third party to report to APS; allows co-agents to be appointed for additional third-party  oversight; and  imposes liability on agents who violate the law.", "According to the Uniform Law Commission, 13 states have adopted the  entire Uniform Power of Attorney Act. Others have enacted various  other power of attorney laws. For example, New York requires an agent  to provide a full accounting to APS when it is investigating a report that  the principal may be in need of protective or other services or the victim of  abuse or neglect. If it is not provided within 15 days, APS can commence  a special proceeding to compel the production of the information. Illinois  has added safeguards for principals to its law and created additional court  remedies for violations of the law.

Furthermore,  the CFPB is developing a guide to educate \u201clay fiduciaries\u201d\u2014including  guardians and agents under powers of attorney\u2014about their  responsibilities, and is planning to develop several state-specific lay  fiduciary guides, scheduled for release in 2013.", "There are limited safeguards to protect older adults from abuse by  guardians, who are granted authority by a state court to make decisions  in the best interest of an incapacitated individual concerning his or her  person or property. While guardians can play a key role in managing the  assets of these older adults, we have noted in past reports that guardians  are only subject to limited safeguards that could protect these older adults  from financial exploitation. For example, local officials in California noted  that it can be hard to determine whether a person applying to be a  guardian is doing so to further his ward\u2019s best interests. We have also  reported that few states conduct criminal background checks on potential  guardians. Moreover, we have noted concerns with weak court oversight  of appointed guardians, as well as poor communication between the  courts and federal agencies that have enabled guardians to chronically  abuse their wards and/or others.", "Exploitation by in-home caregivers was also cited by local APS officials,  police, and district attorneys we spoke to as a type of abuse that is  difficult to prevent.

In-home caregivers may be employed by  a private company approved to provide services via a state\u2019s OAA program or independently hired by older adults or their families. Caregiver  services may also be covered under a state Medicaid program if the  individual is eligible for Medicaid.", "Older adults may rely on and trust in-home caregivers, and some  caregivers have used that relationship to exploit their clients. For example, a caregiver may be given access to an older adult\u2019s ATM or  credit card to help with banking or grocery shopping and later be found  withdrawing money or purchasing items for themselves. As the population  ages and public policies encourage older adults to remain in their homes  for as long as practical, there will be an increased need for in-home  caregivers.", "OAA Title III-B provides funding for in-home services, such as personal care, chore,  and homemaker assistance. subject to limited, if any, background checks. A California law  enforcement official told us that caregivers suspected of exploiting older  adults sometimes have a history of theft. While the Medicaid program  requires states to develop and implement home care provider  qualification standards, there is no federal Medicaid requirement for  criminal background checks. According to the National Conference of  State Legislatures, while many states have required agencies to conduct  background checks before employing in-home caregivers who are paid by  Medicaid or with other state funds, these laws vary greatly in their breadth  and scope and the amount of flexibility afforded the agencies when they  use the checks to make hiring decisions. Napa County, California  recently initiated an innovative paid in-home caregiver screening initiative.  Before in-home caregivers can work in that county, they must submit to a  background check and obtain a permit annually.", "While background checks for in-home caregivers help flag potential  abusers, an AARP study has found that states do not always use all  available federal, state, and local criminal data systems. For one, the  implementation cost may discourage their use. Moreover, their  effectiveness in reducing elder abuse, in general, is unproven. As  required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented the National  Background Check Program that encourages states to adopt safeguards  to protect clients of in-home caregivers. This voluntary program provides  grants to states to conduct background checks for employees of long- term care facilities and providers, such as home health agencies and  personal care service providers. As of November  2012, 19 states were  participating. The results of this program could provide data on the  effectiveness of background checks in preventing elder abuse, including  elder financial exploitation.", "State and local authorities in the four states we visited told us current  safeguards are not always sufficient to prevent exploitation by those older  adults depend on for assistance.

Similar calls for  coordination were raised when the EJCC held its first meeting on October  11, 2012, to begin implementing its mandate to coordinate federal elder  justice activities and develop national priorities. As EJCC Chairman, the  Secretary of HHS stated that combating elder abuse\u2014which includes  elder financial exploitation\u2014is an \u201call-of-government\u201d effort and that  federal programs are not organized in a strategic way, which decreases  their effectiveness.

Local law enforcement officials also noted that  they receive little training on elder financial exploitation and need  additional training to build expertise. In addition, we were told that some  prosecutors and judges are reluctant to take on cases of suspected elder  financial exploitation because of competing priorities and limited  resources, a continuing belief that elder financial exploitation is primarily a  civil issue, or a view of older adult victims as unreliable witnesses.", "State and local officials in the four states we reviewed are attempting to  increase their expertise. For example, some state and local officials told  us they attempt to acquire investigative expertise through formal and on- the-job training, by dedicating units or staff to investigate suspected cases  of elder financial exploitation, or by contracting for assistance from  certified fraud examiners or other forensic accountants. However, state  and local officials also told us that funding constraints limited their ability  to build this additional expertise.

In some locations APS,  criminal justice agencies, and other public and private entities have  formed groups that meet periodically to develop awareness activities,  foster information sharing, and discuss and resolve individual cases.  Some multidisciplinary groups discuss elder abuse broadly, such as elder  abuse task forces in some Pennsylvania counties and multidisciplinary  groups in New York City. Others concentrate on financial exploitation  specifically, such as the Philadelphia Financial Exploitation Task Force,  and Financial Abuse Specialist Teams in some California counties.", "Although multidisciplinary groups responding to elder financial  exploitation already exist in each of the four states we visited and  elsewhere, forming and sustaining these groups continues to be  challenging, according to law enforcement officials in one state we visited  and experts. Busy schedules and competing priorities make it difficult for  some participants to attend meetings regularly, and a group\u2019s focus  influences how extensively members are willing to participate. For  example, in one location officials told us that when the primary focus of  their group shifted from prosecuting cases to providing services,  participation by law enforcement officials declined. Collaborative efforts  can also be undermined by a history of poor interaction between member  organizations, differences in systemic understanding of elder financial  exploitation, difficulties communicating across disciplines, different  understandings of limits on information sharing, unclear roles, and failure  to address the group\u2019s long-term survival.relevant promising practices in this area could help promote creation of  such groups\u2014particularly when resources are limited\u2014and ensure their  success.", "However, information on  Federal agencies have made some efforts to promote and inform  collaboration between the APS and criminal justice systems in states.

For example, coordinating with law   so state  enforcement authorities in other jurisdictions is labor intensive,and local officials are often unable to pursue these cases themselves.  Furthermore, even though various federal agencies have the authority to  investigate and prosecute interstate and international scams (see fig. 3),local law enforcement officials told us there is not enough information  available on whom they should contact when they need to refer a case to  the federal level. They indicated that the lines of communication between  local and federal agencies tend to be informal, based on whom local law  enforcement officers know in a federal agency. Providing accurate  contact information is consistent with Justice\u2019s strategic objective for fiscal  years 2012-2016 to strengthen its relationships with state and local law  enforcement. Justice officials told us they believe that local officials know  which federal officials to contact about international and interstate cases,  but state and local law enforcement officials told us that it would be  helpful to have more specific information. Cases that local officials do not  refer to a federal agency due to a lack of correct contact information may  not be investigated or prosecuted by either federal or local authorities.", "In addition to not knowing whom to contact, state and local law  enforcement officials in the four states we reviewed told us that they are  concerned that federal agencies do not take enough of the cases that are  referred to them. For example, a law enforcement official from California  described a case of widespread interstate check fraud, expressing  frustration with federal agencies that would not provide any support when  he requested it. Federal officials, on the other hand, told us that they  cannot take all cases referred to them by state and local law enforcement  and that they must prioritize their caseload to make the best use of their  limited resources. Justice and FTC officials said they tend to focus on  larger cases in which many victims were affected or a significant amount  of money was lost, and Justice\u2019s U.S. Attorneys also apply regional  priorities, such as the vulnerability (including age) of the victim, when  determining which cases to take.", "Even if federal agencies choose not to take a case a state or local agency  refers to them, officials told us that consistent referrals of cases by state  and local authorities allow them to identify patterns or combine several  complaints against the same individual into one case. FTC\u2019s Consumer  Sentinel Network database (Consumer Sentinel) collects consumer  complaint data and aims to be an information-sharing tool to enable state  and local law enforcement to become more effective. Justice officials  said they encourage individuals and state and local authorities to file a  complaint of suspected fraud to either the Consumer Sentinel or the FBI\u2019s  Internet Crime Complaint Center. However, while some state Attorneys  General were familiar with the FTC database, local law enforcement  officials we spoke with did not say that they reported cases to it or used  its data. One official said he did not find the Consumer Sentinel database  useful because law enforcement officials are not familiar with it.", "FTC officials explained that while they have made attempts to get state- level offices to contribute to the Consumer Sentinel, barriers such as  reservations about data sharing, obsolete technological infrastructure,  and severe budgetary cutbacks have kept the numbers of contributors  low. When state officials do not contribute to the Consumer Sentinel, the  information in the database does not give a national picture of the extent  of cross-border scams.

Indeed, frontline  bank staff are able to observe elder financial exploitation firsthand. For  example, a bank teller who sees an older adult regularly is likely to notice  if that individual is accompanied by someone new and seems pressured  to withdraw money or if the older adult suddenly begins to wire large  sums of money internationally.", "There are state efforts and bank policies to help bank employees  recognize exploitation. In Illinois, all state-chartered banks are required to  train their employees on what constitutes elder financial exploitation.  State and local agencies in California and Pennsylvania provide  information and training to banks to help them recognize elder financial  exploitation. Most of the six banks we spoke with had a policy for  periodically training employees on identifying elder financial exploitation.  In addition, these banks had a system in place that routinely monitors  bank transactions for unusual activity and can help identify exploitation.", "Banks may also help report suspected elder financial exploitation to local  authorities.

For  example, in one case, bank officials did not take any action in response to  repeated withdrawals of large amounts of money that were not typical for   Despite  that customer. Bank officials said they do report suspected elder financial  exploitation, but also emphasized that banks are not law enforcement  agencies. Officials said their primary responsibility is to protect customer  assets and privacy and ensure customers have access to their funds.

The  CFPB is the primary federal consumer protection regulator with respect to  a variety of financial institutions, including banks. The Dodd-Frank Act  authorizes the CFPB to protect consumers, including older adults, from  abusive practices committed in connection with the offering or provision of  consumer financial products or services. In a November 2011  congressional testimony, the Assistant Director of CFPB\u2019s Office for Older  Americans said the agency has a unique opportunity to help enhance,  coordinate, and promote efforts of a variety of groups, including financial  services providers.", "While the federal government generally requires banks to train employees  on a variety of issues, such as money laundering, physical bank security,  and information security, we could find no similar requirements for banks to train employees to recognize and report elder financial  exploitation.

A clearly articulated national strategy is needed to coordinate  and optimize such federal efforts to effectively prevent and respond to  elder financial exploitation, and the EJCC can be the vehicle for defining  and implementing this strategy. In the current economic climate, state and  local APS and law enforcement agencies will find it increasingly difficult to  cope with growing numbers of cases without a national strategy attuned  to their need for information and guidance on preventing and responding  to elder financial exploitation, as well as additional data on its extent and  impact.", "In addition to working together to build a national strategy to combat elder  financial exploitation, there are a number of ways individual federal  agencies could better support state and local APS and law enforcement  agencies. For example, Justice has identified providing training and  resources to combat elder abuse as a strategy to achieve its objectives of  preventing and intervening in crimes against vulnerable populations.  Without easily accessible information and guidance tailored to the needs  of prosecutors nationwide, they may continue, given limited resources, to  make such cases a low priority. Similarly, many cases cross jurisdictions  and could involve multiple victims or have perpetrators located in other  countries. These cases may not be investigated or prosecuted unless  state and local law enforcement have better information on the process  for contacting the federal government regarding these cases or the ways  in which the federal government could provide support.", "Without information to correct banks\u2019 misconceptions about the impact of  federal privacy laws on their ability to release bank records, APS and law  enforcement agencies will continue to find it difficult to obtain the  information they need from banks to investigate suspected cases of elder  financial exploitation. Moreover, without educating bank employees  nationwide on how to identify and report suspected elder financial  exploitation, many cases will continue to go unreported, uninvestigated,  and unprosecuted.
