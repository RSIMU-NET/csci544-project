Although an action plan that the State Department (State) drafted was not fully implemented, State and other agencies took several actions in response to our recommendations to improve Visas Mantis and to facilitate travel by foreign students and scholars. These actions included (1) adding staff to process Mantis cases, (2) providing additional guidance to consular officers, (3) developing an electronic tracking system, (4) clarifying roles and responsibilities of agencies involved in the Mantis program, (5) reiterating State's policy of giving students and scholars priority interviews, and (6) extending the validity of Mantis clearances.

A primary tool that the U.S. government uses to conduct  this screening is the Visas Mantis program, a security review procedure  involving multiple U.S. government agencies, which aims to identify those  visa applicants who may pose a threat to our national security by illegally  transferring sensitive technology. Visa applicants from China account for  more than half of all Visas Mantis security reviews.", "In February 2004, we reported and testified that there were delays in the  Visas Mantis program and interoperability problems between the State  Department (State) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that  contributed to these delays and allowed cases to get lost.

To determine the length of time it takes to process a Mantis check,  we obtained and analyzed data from the State Department\u2019s electronic  tracking system for Mantis cases. To fulfill our second objective, we  analyzed policies and procedures put in place to improve the Visas Mantis  program and interviewed key State, Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), and FBI officials.

On the day of the appointment, a consular  officer reviews the application, checks the applicant\u2019s name in the Consular  Lookout and Support System (CLASS), takes the applicant\u2019s digital  fingerprints and photograph, and interviews the applicant. Based on the  interview and a review of pertinent documents, the consular officer  determines if the applicant is eligible for nonimmigrant status under the  1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). If the consular officer  determines that the applicant is eligible to receive a visa, the applicant is  notified right away and he or she usually receives the visa within 24 hours.", "In some cases, the consular officer decides that the applicant will need a  Security Advisory Opinion (SAO), a response from Washington on whether  to issue a visa to the applicant. SAOs are required for a number of reasons,  including concerns that a visa applicant may engage in illegal transfer of  sensitive technology. An SAO based on sensitive technology transfer  concerns is known as Visas Mantis and, according to State officials, is the  most common type of SAO applied to science applicants. It is also the most  common type of SAO sent from the posts we visited in China, as well as in  Kiev, Ukraine.", "The Visas Mantis process is designed to further four important national  security objectives:  prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their   restrain the development of destabilizing conventional military  capabilities in certain regions of the world;  prevent the transfer of arms and sensitive dual-use items to terrorists  and states that sponsor terrorism; and  maintain U.S. advantages in certain militarily critical technologies.", "The Visas Mantis process has several steps and involves multiple U.S.  agencies (see fig. 1). In deciding if a Visas Mantis check is needed, the  consular officer determines whether the applicant\u2019s background or  proposed activity in the United States could involve exposure to  technologies on the Technology Alert List (TAL). The list, published by the  State Department in coordination with the interagency community and  based on U.S. export control laws, includes science and technology-related  fields where, if knowledge gained from research or work in these fields  were used against the United States, it could potentially be harmful. If a  Visas Mantis is needed, the consular officer generally informs the applicant  that his or her visa is being temporarily refused under Section 221(g) of the  INA, pending further administrative processing.", "After a consular officer decides that a Visas Mantis is necessary for an  applicant, several steps are taken to complete the process. The officer or a  Foreign Service National drafts a Visas Mantis SAO request, which contains  information from the applicant\u2019s application package and interview. The  case is then generally reviewed and approved by a consular section chief or  other consular official at post before it is transmitted both electronically  and through State\u2019s traditional cabling system. Once the request is sent, the  State Department\u2019s Bureau of Nonproliferation and other agencies review  the information in the cable and respond within 10 working days to State\u2019s  Bureau of Consular Affairs. Several agencies, such as the Departments of  Commerce and Energy, receive Mantis cases but do not routinely respond  to Consular Affairs.", "State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs receives all responses pertaining to an  applicant, summarizes them, and prepares a security advisory opinion. This  SAO is then transmitted to the post electronically indicating that State does  or does not have an objection to issuing the visa, or that more information  is needed. A consular official at post reviews the SAO and, based on the  information from Washington, decides whether to deny or issue the visa to  the applicant. The officer then notifies the applicant that the visa has been  denied or issued, or that more information is needed.", "Last year, consular officers submitted roughly 20,000 Mantis cases.  According to consular officials, the visa is approved in the vast majority of  cases. Data provided show that less than 2 percent of all Mantis requests  result in visa denial. However, even when the visa is issued, the information  provided by the consular posts on certain visa applicants is useful to  various U.S. government agencies in guarding against illegal technology  transfer.

Data  show that this policy is critical for ensuring that students and scholars  obtain their visas in time to meet their deadlines. For example, between  January and September 2004, non-student, nonimmigrant visa applicants  applying in Shanghai could expect to wait between 1 and 2 months to  obtain an interview.

These opportunities could include, among other initiatives,  mandatory one-on-one meetings with officials from the Bureaus of  Consular Affairs and Nonproliferation for new consular officers before  they travel to post; additional visits by State officials to consular  conferences; and more frequent videoteleconferences with posts that  submit large numbers of Mantis requests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of State, Homeland  Security, and Justice for their comments. State, DHS, and Justice provided  written comments on the draft (see appendixes II, III, and IV, respectively).  State commented that it had already made considerable progress with  regard to the report\u2019s recommendations and outlined the actions it had  taken to do so. For example, State has committed to sending  representatives from its Consular Affairs and Nonproliferation Bureaus to  India, China, and Russia to engage in on-site discussions of Mantis issues  with consular officers. In addition, State is in the process of negotiating and  signing memoranda of understanding with five U.S. agencies to share  Mantis data electronically. DHS expressed appreciation for our work to  identify actions to improve the Visas Mantis process and stated that it will  pursue completion of GAO\u2019s recommendations.", "Justice responded to a recommendation included in the draft report that  directed the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to  set a formal timeframe for completing negotiations on FBI access to US- VISIT and SEVIS. Because the two agencies reached agreement prior to  publication of the final draft, the recommendation is not included in this  report. The Department of Justice also provided technical comments,  which we have incorporated where appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to other interested Members of  Congress. We are also sending copies to the Secretary of State and the  Secretary of Homeland Security. We also will make copies available to  others upon request.

To  determine how long it takes to process Visas Mantis checks, we obtained  and analyzed data from the State Department\u2019s electronic tracking system  for Security Advisory Opinions (SAOs). Specifically, we reviewed \u201cSAO  Processing Statistics\u201d reports for all Mantis requests submitted to the State  Department between April 1, 2004, and August 31, 2004, as well as other  Mantis statistics produced by the State Department. These reports showed  the average total processing time (in calendar days) for Mantis cases  worldwide. To assess the reliability of State\u2019s data on Visas Mantis cases,  we (1) interviewed State officials responsible for creating and maintaining  the electronic tracking system used for Mantis cases, (2) observed use of  the tracking system, and (3) examined data collected through the tracking  system. We noted in our report that average Mantis processing times, as  calculated through State\u2019s tracking system, do not take into account Mantis  cases that are still pending. As a result, reported average Mantis processing  times can change as cases that have been pending are cleared. State may  also calculate average Mantis processing times based on the date on which  a consular post initially drafted a Mantis case, rather than the date on  which the consular post submitted the final draft to Washington. As a  result, total Mantis processing times can seem longer than they really are.  Despite these limitations, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of identifying trends in Mantis processing.", "To identify and assess actions taken to implement our recommendation to  improve the Visas Mantis program, we obtained documentation from key  U.S. agencies, primarily the State Department, interviewed officials from  these agencies, and observed training classes for new consular officers at  the State Department\u2019s Foreign Service Institute. We reviewed the  Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Manual, the Bureau of  Consular Affairs\u2019 quarterly reports on Visas Mantis, and other cables and  related documents from that bureau. In Washington, we interviewed  officials from the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Justice. At  State, we met with officials from the Bureau of Consular Affairs and the  Bureau of Nonproliferation. At the Department of Homeland Security, we  met with officials from the Directorate of Border Transportation and  Security. At the Department of Justice, we met with officials from the  Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Name Check Unit. We requested a  meeting with Department of Justice and FBI officials to discuss  negotiations with DHS regarding access to US-VISIT and SEVIS; they  agreed to answer questions in writing. In August 2004, we observed classes  at the Foreign Service Institute for newly assigned consular officers. As  part of that training, we attended the Visas Mantis briefing that had been  added to the curriculum for new officers in response to our  recommendation in the February 2004 report.", "To identify whether there were any remaining issues that affect the total  amount of time it takes for science students and scholars to obtain visas,  we analyzed data on interview wait times, spoke with representatives of  various educational organizations, and observed a roundtable discussion  on Mantis issues sponsored by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  We obtained data on interview wait times at consular posts worldwide from  State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs. We also obtained information on  interview wait times from the consular posts in China and Russia. We met  with representatives from the National Academies of Science, NAFSA:  Association of International Educators, and the Alliance for International  Education. The roundtable discussion we attended involved officials from  the Departments of State and Homeland Security, as well as representatives  from the International Institute for Education; the Association of American  Universities; the National Institutes of Health; the National Academies of  Science; NAFSA: Association of International Educators; and others.  Representatives from various colleges and universities were also in  attendance.", "We conducted fieldwork at five visa-issuing posts in three countries\u2014 China, Russia, and Ukraine. We chose these countries because they are  leading places of origin for international science students and scholars  visiting the United States and because they account for 78 percent of all  Mantis cases. During our visits to these posts, we observed visa operations,  reviewed selected Visas Mantis data, and interviewed consular staff about  the Visas Mantis program. In China, we met with consular officers at the  U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the consulates in Shanghai and Guangzhou. We  also met with the Deputy Chief of Mission, as well as officials from the  Office of the Defense Attach\u00e9; the Office of Environment, Science,  Technology, and Health; the Office of Public Diplomacy; and the Foreign  Commercial Service. In Beijing, we observed a meeting of the American  Chambers of Commerce in China, where they discussed their experience  with the Visas Mantis program. In both Shanghai and Guangzhou, we met  with the Consul General. In Russia, we met with consular officers at the  U.S. Embassy in Moscow. We met with the Consul General and his Deputy,  as well as officials from the Department of Energy; the Office of  Environment, Science, Technology, and Health; and Public Affairs. In  Ukraine, we met with consular officers at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev. We met  with the Deputy Chief of Mission, the Consul General and her Deputy, as  well as officials from the Department of Energy; the Office of Public  Affairs; and the Office of the Defense Attach\u00e9.
