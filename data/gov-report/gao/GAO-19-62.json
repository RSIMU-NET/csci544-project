Additionally, the employment  opportunities that are available may not fit the migrants\u2019 skills. For  example, only migrants with sufficient English skills can be placed in  call centers. At the same time, the training programs being offered at  a particular time may not interest the migrant. Further, the few  opportunities available may not be offered in the locations where  migrants can readily access them. Finally, an official from a  multilateral organization working in the region raised the concern that  many of the training opportunities offer similar skills, such as training  to be a barber, beautician, or mechanic, and the market can support  only so many people in these professions.", "Need for individualized services: Each returning migrant has a  different set of needs, skills, and interests, but providing customized  assistance takes time and resources. Staff at reintegration assistance  centers we visited told us that they try to match a migrant with the  services or opportunities they need. For example, a returning migrant  may be a single mother with good English skills and referred to  services and opportunities based on that profile. Additionally,  according to U.S. and Honduran government officials, large-scale  reintegration efforts encounter the challenge of reintegrating migrants  with different and individualized profiles.", "Voluntary nature of seeking and finding assistance: Receiving  reintegration assistance and services depends in part on the initiative  and desire of the returning migrant. Returning migrants must seek  assistance to receive reintegration services, and so must be aware of  and connect with the reintegration assistance centers. In El Salvador,  only about 7 percent of returning migrants requested help from the  reintegration assistance centers in 2017; of those who requested  assistance, however, 91 percent received it, according to El  Salvador\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In both El Salvador and  Honduras, the reintegration assistance offered by the government is  publicized at the reception centers where migrants are processed  upon their return. However, in El Salvador, a government official told  us that migrants may not have the patience to wait to receive  information after traveling and going through the reception process.", "Termination of TPS May Increase the Need  for Reception and Reintegration Services  in El Salvador and Honduras  With the Secretary of Homeland Security\u2019s  decisions to terminate TPS in the United  States for nationals of El Salvador and  Honduras, as of September 9, 2019, and  January 5, 2020, respectively, both countries  face the possibility of a significant influx of  returnees\u2014as many as 262,500 Salvadorans  and 86,000 Hondurans, along with their U.S.  citizen children. Reintegration efforts may also  be complicated by the different backgrounds  and needs of returning migrants who  benefited from TPS. According to State  officials, returning migrants who had TPS are  likely to be older with more skills and  education than those who left the country  more recently. Successful strategies to  reintegrate former TPS beneficiaries will be  different than those that are currently in place.  TPS beneficiaries may also have children who  are U.S. citizens with different needs than  UAC.  During our country visits in March 2018, State  officials indicated that official planning for the  return of former TPS beneficiaries was either  just beginning, as in El Salvador, or had not  begun, as in Honduras because an official  decision on the termination of TPS for  Hondurans had not yet occurred. U.S.  officials, though, were meeting with their  counterparts to discuss the challenges of  reintegrating TPS beneficiaries. In both El  Salvador and Honduras, U.S. officials have  encouraged the government to address the  challenges of reintegrating former TPS  beneficiaries. For example, in February 2018,  USAID\u2019s mission in El Salvador convened a  one-day conference on current efforts to  prevent migration and to plan for the return of  migrants with TPS. At the same time, U.S.  government officials also stated that some or  most TPS beneficiaries might choose to stay  in the United States without lawful status,  attempt to adjust their status, or move to a  third country rather than return to their home  countries.", "Leadership turn-over and guidance: Elections in the three countries,  and the subsequent turnover of government officials, also affect  implementation, according to IOM. Furthermore, in Guatemala  leadership turn-over in key agencies has affected what the  government can achieve in terms of reintegration of returning  migrants, according to IOM officials. Both the Secretariat of Social  Welfare and the Directorate of Migration have had various leaders  over the past few years.

According to USAID officials, these activity and progress reports served  as the basis for conversations with IOM about program progress and  assessment. The reports included information such as an overview of  achievements, activity updates by country, and challenges and actions  taken. For example, the reports detailed information such as the number  of returning migrants provided with post-arrival assistance, including food  or hygiene kits, as well as progress on larger projects such as  constructing small-scale, community-based infrastructure or renovating  reception centers. IOM also explained challenges encountered and plans  for overcoming them, such as building strong relationships with new key  government personnel when there was turnover in Guatemala and  Honduras. IOM also provided information to USAID through periodic, two- page information sheets that summarized its activities in a certain  geographical area, such as a municipality in El Salvador, or with a certain  program, such as NTMI in Honduras.", "As part of the agreements with USAID, IOM agreed to conduct mid-term  and final evaluations of the three programs. IOM produced written mid- term and final evaluations for the first program (PARA) based on reviews  of documents, field visits, and interviews with government counterparts  and USAID, among others. The final evaluation highlighted the program\u2019s  achievements, challenges, effective practices, lessons learned, and  recommendations. For example, it noted IOM\u2019s strong working  relationship with USAID and host government agencies, as well as the  need to conduct high-quality assessments in each country during  program design. Instead of a written mid-term evaluation for the second  program (NTMI), IOM held an internal workshop, which a USAID  representative attended. According to IOM officials, IOM plans to present  USAID with a mid-term evaluation for the Return and Reintegration  program and a final evaluation for the NTMI program, although both have  been delayed due to staffing issues.", "USAID also assessed IOM\u2019s programs during internal USAID meetings.  For example, according to USAID officials, when USAID considered  IOM\u2019s requests for no-cost extensions for the PARA and NTMI  agreements, USAID assessed the progress and challenges of the  activities implemented as part of the agreements and whether they were  fulfilling their goals. USAID also discussed the effectiveness of IOM\u2019s  programs at a strategic level during portfolio reviews and program  performance reports, according to USAID officials. USAID officials told us  that because the first program with IOM was productive and had good  results, USAID also funded the second and third programs through  program contribution agreements.

During our site visit in March 2018, we visited five  reception centers and one shelter in the three countries, including the  Bel\u00e9n Assistance Center in Honduras, which we had visited in March  2015, prior to its renovation. The Bel\u00e9n Assistance Center renovations  were extensive, including the dining areas, kitchen, bathrooms,  dormitories, play spaces, clinics, and counseling areas as well as a  conference room used for facilitating meetings and workshops among  government entities and partners.

For  example, from 2014 through 2017 in all three countries, IOM reported that  it supplied in total: nearly 60,000 hygiene kits, nearly 34,000 items of clothing, and more than 75,000 meals to returning migrants.", "In fiscal year 2017, IOM provided post-arrival assistance to over 29,000  returning migrants, according to IOM. Additionally, IOM provided the host  governments with 12 buses to transport returning migrants from the  airport to the reception center and from the reception center to the bus  station to return to their communities. U.S. and host government officials  in the three countries noted that, with USAID and IOM\u2019s assistance, the  reception of returnees has improved. For example, IOM expanded and  renovated the DAMI Reception Center in San Salvador, adding separate  areas for the various ministries involved so that returning migrants can  receive specialized services such as a medical examination,  psychological and social assistance, and the beginning of job placement  assistance. The center also provides integrated child protection and  social services. During our site visits to the reception centers and shelter  in Guatemala City and San Pedro Sula in March 2018, we observed staff  distributing food to returning migrants upon their arrival.", "Through technical assistance and other support, IOM also helped build  the capacity of host government institutions as it relates to the reception  process and their ability to provide better reception services.

Prior to USAID and IOM entering into  the NTMI agreement, no official statistics were available that allowed for  evidence-based decisions or public policy design. Now, during the  registration process in Honduras, for instance, returning migrants are  asked what trade they would like to learn, which can inform host  government planning. With information about the reasons migrants left  the country, governments can also refer migrants to existing programs or  create programs to address those issues, such as developing training and  employment opportunities.

USAID,  IOM, and host government officials cited the challenges of tracking and  following up with returned migrants once they leave the reception centers.  Although the countries are beginning to offer reintegration assistance,  through the information and municipal assistance centers in El Salvador  and Honduras, there are currently no systems in place to track migrants  when they return to their communities.

IOM also coordinated with civil  society organizations such as:", "Fundaci\u00f3n Cristosal, in El Salvador, which is working to implement a  new registration system of victims of internal displacement.", "Fundaci\u00f3n Avina, in Guatemala, which assists returnees with social  and labor reintegration.", "Scalibrini Missionary Sisters, in Honduras, which operates the  reception center at San Pedro Sula and provides returnees bus tickets  back to their communities of origin, if needed and also phone calls to  reach their family members upon their arrival.", "During our site visit to Honduras in March 2018, we attended a roundtable  meeting with representatives from the International Committee of the Red  Cross, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and the United Nations High  Commissioner of Refugees, where these representatives discussed  coordination and efforts to avoid duplication at reception centers. For  example, officials at the meeting stated that during the post-election  protests in Honduras in late 2017 and early 2018, returning children and  families could not access the Centro de Atenci\u00f3n para Ni\u00f1ez y Familias  Migrantes Bel\u00e9n (Bel\u00e9n Assistance Center for Children and Families) to  be processed by IOM, so they were processed by the Honduran Red  Cross at the Centro de Atenci\u00f3n al Migrante Omoa (Omoa Assistance  Center for Migrants). The organizations worked together and consistently  communicated to ensure that there were no gaps in coverage for the  returning UAC and families, according to officials at the meeting.", "USAID officials told us that IOM programs helped strengthen the  relationship between the U.S. government and the host country  governments. The host government agency must formally request IOM\u2019s  assistance before IOM will provide support, and IOM officials said this  letter of request is important to ensure institutional support for and  cooperation with IOM\u2019s programs. Additionally, IOM, USAID, and the host  government agencies worked together to improve reception and  reintegration services for returning migrants. For example, in Honduras in  March 2018, USAID, IOM, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the  National Center for Social Sector Information met to discuss what  additional information they would like to obtain about returning migrants  and how to analyze the data.", "The program contribution agreements also called for the establishment of  coordination committees to facilitate coordination and consultation among  its members. According to the agreements, the committees were to share  information as needed to provide assistance, evaluate the effectiveness  of the assistance, and otherwise share relevant information. The  committee meetings, according to IOM officials, were held regionally  among representatives of IOM and the USAID missions under the first  program contribution agreement, Repatriation Assistance to Returning  Families and Unaccompanied Children in the Northern Triangle of Central  America, when the efforts were beginning and there was a sense of  urgency due the rapid influx of UAC at the U.S. border from El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras. When the third program contribution  agreement, Return and Reintegration in the Northern Triangle, began in  2016, the meetings between IOM and USAID were held bilaterally in each  country.", "The coordination committee played an important role during the beginning  of the first program contribution agreement because, according to USAID  officials, it facilitated interaction with the host governments, helped with  coordination, and established working relationships between USAID and IOM. Once the program and relationships were established by the time of  the third contribution agreement, coordination had evolved, according to  USAID officials. IOM officials said that although committee meetings  occur on an ad hoc basis under the third program contribution agreement,  coordination is stronger. For example, USAID and IOM coordinate closely  on strategic decisions, such as IOM\u2019s decision to rebid the contract to  renovate and expand the reception center at the Guatemalan Air Force  Base, after allegations of corruption arose surrounding the initial  contractor.", "Finally, USAID interacts in various ways with IOM, outside of the formal  terms of the contribution agreements. According to IOM and USAID  officials,", "USAID and IOM engage in regular discussions about the programs\u2019  progress and implementation challenges, to help IOM make decisions  and redefine plans of action if necessary.", "USAID is involved in IOM\u2019s strategic decisions, and IOM regularly  consults USAID for feedback and recommendations regarding  programming.", "USAID and IOM participated in forums such as conferences and a  workshop where lessons learned and best practices were discussed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Inter- American Foundation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact:", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments:", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Judith Williams (Assistant  Director), Joe Carney (Assistant Director), Julie Hirshen (Analyst-in- Charge), Kathryn Bassion, Neil Doherty, Daniela Rudstein, Aldo Salerno,  Michael Silver, and K.
