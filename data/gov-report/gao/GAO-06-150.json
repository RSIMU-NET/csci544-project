GAO reviewed (1) DHS's actions to develop a strategy to protect the chemical industry, (2) DHS's actions to assist in the industry's security efforts and coordinate with EPA, (3) industry security initiatives and challenges, and (4) DHS's authorities and whether additional legislation is needed to ensure chemical plant security. GAO interviewed DHS, EPA, and industry officials, among others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As part of a national framework for protecting the chemical sector, DHS is developing a Chemical Sector-Specific Plan. The plan is intended to, among other things, describe DHS's ongoing efforts and future plans to coordinate with federal, state, and local agencies and the private sector; identify chemical facilities to include in the sector, assess their vulnerabilities, and prioritize them; and develop programs to prevent, deter, mitigate, and recover from attacks on chemical facilities. DHS did not estimate when the plan will be completed. To date, DHS has taken a number of actions aimed at protecting the chemical sector from terrorist attacks. DHS has identified 3,400 facilities that, if attacked, could pose the greatest hazard to human life and health and has initiated programs to assist the industry and local communities in protecting chemical facilities. For example, the Buffer Zone Protection Program assists facility owners and local law enforcement with improving the security of areas surrounding plants. DHS also coordinates with the Chemical Sector Coordinating Council, an industry-led group that acts as a liaison for the chemical sector, and with EPA and other federal agencies. The chemical industry is voluntarily addressing plant security, but faces challenges in preparing against terrorism. Some industry associations require member companies to assess plants' vulnerabilities, develop and implement plans to mitigate vulnerabilities, and have a third party verify that security measures were implemented. Other associations have developed security guidelines and other tools to encourage their members to address security. While voluntary efforts are under way, industry officials said that they face challenges in preparing facilities against terrorism, including high costs and limited guidance on how much security is adequate. Because existing laws provide DHS with only limited authority to address security at chemical facilities, it has relied primarily on the industry's voluntary security efforts. However, the extent to which companies are addressing security is unclear. Unlike EPA, for example, which requires drinking water facilities to improve their security, DHS does not have the authority to require chemical facilities to assess their vulnerabilities and implement security measures. Therefore, DHS cannot ensure that facilities are taking these actions. DHS has stated that its existing authorities do not permit it to effectively regulate the chemical industry, and that the Congress should enact federal requirements for chemical facilities. Many stakeholders agreed--as GAO concluded in 2003--that additional legislation placing federal security requirements on chemical facilities is needed. However, stakeholders had mixed views on the contents of any legislation, such as requirements that plants substitute safer chemicals and processes that potentially could reduce the risks present at these facilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Across the nation, approximately 15,000 facilities produce, use, or store  more than threshold amounts of chemicals identified by the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) as posing the greatest risk to human health and  the environment if accidentally released into the air. These facilities  include chemical manufacturers, storage and distribution facilities,  fertilizer and pesticide facilities, pulp and paper manufacturers, water and  wastewater treatment facilities, and refineries, among others. Since the  events of September 11, 2001, government and other experts have  recognized the potential threat that chemical facilities pose because many  house toxic chemicals that could become airborne and drift to surrounding  areas or be used to create a weapon capable of causing harm. In this  regard, in 2003, the Department of Justice (Justice) reported that industrial  chemical plants remain viable targets and warned that al Qaeda operatives  may attempt to launch conventional attacks against U.S. chemical facilities  to cause contamination, disruption, and terror. While these facilities  potentially put large numbers of Americans at risk of injury or death in the  event of a chemical release, the chemicals they produce, use, store, and  distribute are critical to the nation\u2019s economy.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) and set forth its mission to, among other things,  prevent terrorist attacks in the United States and reduce the vulnerability  of the nation to terrorism. The President\u2019s February 2003 National Strategy  for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets sets  forth the federal government\u2019s roles, objectives, and responsibilities in  protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, including the chemical  industry. In addition, consistent with the Homeland Security Act, a  December 2003 presidential directive instructed DHS to produce a  comprehensive integrated plan outlining national goals, objectives,  milestones, and key initiatives for protecting critical infrastructure and key  resources. The directive also names DHS as the lead agency for the  chemical sector, a change from earlier national strategies that named EPA  as the lead. Under an interim national plan released in February 2005, DHS  is to identify and prioritize critical chemical facilities, evaluate the  chemical sector\u2019s vulnerabilities and risks, develop and implement  protective programs for high-priority chemical facilities, identify regulatory  options for protective measures, and maintain a relationship with all  stakeholders.", "The federal government\u2019s role in protecting chemical facilities from  terrorist attacks has been much debated since September 11, 2001. Public  debate has centered on whether the federal government should impose  security requirements on chemical facilities or continue to work with the  chemical industry to voluntarily address security concerns. Legislative  proposals that would grant DHS or EPA, or one of these agencies in  consultation with the other, the authority to require chemical facilities to  take security steps were introduced in every Congress from 2001 to 2005.", "In this context, you asked us to examine federal and industry efforts to  address security concerns at chemical facilities. Specifically, this report  discusses (1) DHS\u2019s actions to develop an overall strategy for protecting the  chemical industry; (2) DHS\u2019s efforts to identify high-risk chemical facilities,  assess their vulnerabilities, ensure that facilities are addressing security,  and coordinate with EPA in these efforts; (3) chemical industry security  initiatives and challenges; and (4) DHS\u2019s existing authorities and whether  additional legislative authority is needed to ensure that chemical facilities  take action to address vulnerabilities. In conducting our work, we  interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s Information Analysis and Infrastructure  Protection Directorate (IAIP), and EPA\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.  We also reviewed pertinent federal legislation; EPA data; and DHS  documents, including the Interim National Infrastructure Protection Plan,  an early draft of the Chemical Sector-Specific Plan; and other available  reports. We interviewed representatives of all 16 associations participating  on the Chemical Sector Coordinating Council, a group of chemical sector  associations that facilitate the sharing of industry views with DHS. To  obtain a broad range of industry views, we also spoke with at least one  member company belonging to 13 of the key chemical industry  associations. These companies included large chemical manufacturers;  small- and medium-sized chemical distributors; companies that  manufacture, distribute, and sell agricultural and specialty chemicals; and  plastics manufacturers, among others. We also interviewed other  organizations with chemical industry expertise, including the American  Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Center for Chemical Process Safety,  Sandia National Laboratories, and the Working Group on Community  Right-to-Know, among others.

Terrorist attacks involving the  theft or release of certain chemicals could significantly impact the health  and safety of millions of Americans; disrupt local or regional economies; or  impact other critical infrastructures that rely on chemicals, such as  drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. The disaster in Bhopal,  India, in 1984, when methyl isocyanate\u2014a highly toxic chemical\u2014leaked  from a tank, reportedly killing about 3,800 people and injuring anywhere  from 150,000 to 600,000 others, illustrates the potential threat to public  health from a chemical release. As we reported in 2003, Justice has been  warning of the terrorist threat to chemical facilities for a number of years  and has concluded that the risk of an attempt in the foreseeable future to  cause an industrial chemical release is both real and credible. On the basis  of analysis of trends in international and domestic terrorism and the  burgeoning interest in weapons of mass destruction among criminals and  terrorists, Justice warned of potential targeting of chemical facilities by  terrorists even before the events of September 11, 2001. In fact, according  to Justice, domestic terrorists plotted to use a destructive device against a  U.S. facility that housed millions of gallons of propane in the late 1990s.  According to news reports, terrorists also have targeted chemical facilities  in Europe. Furthermore, on May 15, 2005, bombs were detonated in Spain  by suspected Basque separatists at two chemical plants, a paint factory,  and a metal works facility, leading to minor injuries from toxic fume  inhalation.", "No one has yet comprehensively assessed security at the nation\u2019s chemical  facilities. In April 2005 testimony before the Senate Committee on  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on chemical facility security,  experts from the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institute  underscored the threat that U.S. chemical facilities pose and expressed  concern about the adequacy of security at these facilities. While federal and  state governments and the chemical industry have taken steps to address  security at chemical facilities, recent studies and media expos\u00e9s have  raised doubts about security at some plants. According to media accounts,  every year from 2001 to 2005, reporters and environmental activists gained  access to chemical tanks and computer centers that control manufacturing  processes at a number of facilities, including American Chemistry Council  (ACC) member company facilities. In addition, a 2004 survey of employees  at 189 chemical facilities conducted for the Paper, Allied-Industrial,  Chemical, and Energy Workers International Union found that employees  had doubts about the effectiveness of facilities\u2019 efforts to prevent a terrorist  attack. Less than half of the respondents (44 percent) indicated that their  companies\u2019 preventative actions, including security efforts, were effective  in reducing facility vulnerabilities to terrorist attack. The U.S. Chemical  Safety and Hazard Investigation Board also testified in April 2005 that gaps  in safety and emergency response preparedness at chemical facilities leave  Americans vulnerable. Furthermore, some environmental and advocacy  groups believe reducing safety risks should be an integral part of facilities\u2019  efforts to reduce the potential consequences of a terrorist attack. These  groups advocate reducing the inherent risks that toxic chemicals present  by substituting safer chemicals or switching to inherently safer  technologies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Universe of Chemical Facilities", "paragraphs": ["EPA regulates about 15,000 facilities under the Clean Air Act because they  produce, use, or store more than certain threshold amounts of specific  chemicals that would pose the greatest risk to human health and the  environment if they were accidentally released into the air. These facilities  must take a number of steps, including preparing a risk management plan  (RMP), to prevent and prepare for an accidental release and, therefore, are  referred to as RMP facilities. These facilities fall within a variety of  industries and produce, use, or store a host of products, including (1) basic  chemicals used to manufacture other products, such as fertilizers, plastics,  and synthetic fibers; (2) specialty chemicals used for a specific purpose,  such as a functional ingredient or a processing aid in the manufacture of a  range of products, including adhesives and solvents, coatings, industrial  gases and cleaners, and water management chemicals; (3) life science  chemicals consisting of pharmaceuticals and pesticides; and (4) consumer  products, such as hair and skin products and cosmetics. Some of these  facilities are part of critical infrastructure sectors other than the chemical  sector. For example, about 2,000 of these facilities are community water  systems that are part of the water infrastructure sector. In addition, other  facilities that house hazardous chemicals that are listed under the RMP  regulations are not subject to RMP requirements because the quantities  stored or used are below threshold amounts.

The act also established DHS\u2019s IAIP and made it responsible  for critical infrastructure protection and information analysis functions.  As part of its statutory responsibilities, IAIP must develop a comprehensive  national plan for securing the key resources and critical infrastructure of  the United States. IAIP\u2019s other responsibilities include identifying threats,  conducting comprehensive assessments of the vulnerabilities of key  resources, conducting risk assessments to determine the risks posed by  certain types of terrorist attacks, identifying priorities for protective  measures, and recommending measures to protect critical infrastructure  and key resources. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security  has given IAIP responsibility for creating and managing private sector  advisory councils composed of representatives of industries and  associations designated by the Secretary to advise the Secretary on various  matters, including private sector products, applications, and solutions, as  they relate to homeland security challenges.", "This act and the December 2003 presidential directive established the  framework under which IAIP carries out its responsibilities for  coordinating the overall national critical infrastructure protection effort.  The directive designates a lead federal agency for each critical  infrastructure sector, such as agriculture, banking and finance, and  chemical. DHS is now the lead, or sector-specific agency, for the chemical  infrastructure, which is a change from national strategies issued in July  2002 and February 2003 that named EPA as the lead agency. IAIP is  responsible for infrastructure protection activities for the chemical sector,  including developing a plan for protecting the chemical sector by July 2004.  Other IAIP chemical sector responsibilities include  collaborating with relevant federal agencies, state and local  governments, and the private sector;  conducting or facilitating vulnerability assessments of the chemical   encouraging risk management strategies to protect against and mitigate  the effects of attacks against chemical sector assets; and  collaborating with the appropriate private sector entities and continuing  to encourage the development of information-sharing and analysis  mechanisms and to support sector coordinating mechanisms.", "In February 2005, DHS released an Interim National Infrastructure  Protection Plan that also outlines the responsibilities of sector-specific  agencies. As the lead agency for the chemical sector, the national plan calls  for DHS to identify and prioritize critical chemical facilities, evaluate the  chemical sector\u2019s vulnerabilities and risks, develop and implement  protective programs for high-priority chemical facilities, identify regulatory  options for protective measures, and maintain a relationship with all  stakeholders.", "Currently, federal requirements address security at some U.S. chemical  facilities. A small number of chemical facilities must comply with the  Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA). MTSA and its  implementing regulations require maritime facility owners and operators to  conduct assessments of certain at-risk facilities to identify vulnerabilities,  develop security plans to mitigate these vulnerabilities, and implement the  measures discussed in the security plans. MTSA and implementing  regulations also require that the United States Coast Guard conduct  inspections at these facilities and prohibit operation of facilities that do not  have required security plans approved by the Secretary or that are not  operating in compliance with these plans. According to July 27, 2005,  testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee, the Coast Guard has reviewed and approved facility security  plans for 300 chemical facilities.", "Some states and localities have also created security requirements at  chemical facilities. For example, Maryland\u2019s Hazardous Material Security  Act requires RMP facilities in the state to perform vulnerability  assessments, develop and implement security measures, and report to the  state Department of the Environment. Under New York\u2019s Anti-Terrorism  Preparedness Act of 2004, the state Office of Homeland Security, subject to  available appropriations, must require certain chemical facilities to  conduct vulnerability assessments. Under the Domestic Security  Preparedness Task Force established by New Jersey law, New Jersey  Department of Environmental Protection officials work with the state\u2019s  chemical facilities to adopt security best practices. In addition, Baltimore,  Maryland, requires chemical manufacturers to follow a set of safety and  security regulations devised by its fire and police commissioners;  noncompliance can result in penalties, such as the withholding or  suspension of facility operating permits.", "Separate from its responsibilities for enhancing the protection of the  chemical sector from terrorist attacks, the federal government imposes  safety and emergency response requirements on chemical facilities that  may incidentally reduce the likelihood and consequences of terrorist  attacks. For example, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to  Know Act requires owners and operators of facilities that maintain  specified quantities of certain extremely hazardous chemicals to annually  submit information on their chemical inventory to state and local  emergency response officials. This information is used to help prepare  community response plans in the event of a chemical incident.  Furthermore, under the Clean Air Act, EPA requires owners and operators  of RMP facilities to prepare and implement a plan to detect and prevent or  minimize accidental releases. In addition to evaluating \u201cworst-case\u201d  accidental release scenarios, facility owners and operators must implement  a program to prevent accidental releases that includes safety precautions  and maintenance, and monitoring and training measures, and they must  have an emergency response plan. The Department of Labor\u2019s  Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s process safety  management standard also requires facilities to assess and address the  hazards of their chemical processes. All of these requirements could  potentially mitigate a terrorist attack by (1) providing an incentive to  facilities to reduce or eliminate chemicals below regulated threshold levels,  (2) requiring facilities to implement measures to improve the safety of  areas that are vulnerable to a chemical release, and (3) facilitating  emergency response planning that increases preparedness for a chemical  release\u2014whether intentional or unintentional."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Proposals", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, the Congress has considered a number of legislative proposals  that would give the federal government a greater role in ensuring the  protection of the nation\u2019s chemical facilities.

According to DHS officials, in  general, they consider the chemical sector to include facilities that  manufacture, distribute, and store chemicals, but not retail facilities. The  chemical sector also includes facilities that overlap with other critical  infrastructure sectors. For example, refineries, while considered part of the  energy sector, use large amounts of chemicals and are often colocated with  chemical manufacturing facilities. In addition, water purification and  sanitation facilities are part of the water sector, but they store large  amounts of chemicals on-site. Similarly, agricultural facilities house toxic  chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides.", "While the chemical sector includes a large number of facilities, DHS is  focusing its efforts for the sector by identifying high-priority facilities. As a  starting point, DHS has adapted EPA\u2019s RMP database of facilities with more  than threshold amounts of certain chemicals to develop an interim  inventory of chemical facilities of concern in the event of a terrorist attack.  DHS officials told us that, to prioritize facilities, they reduced the list of  RMP facilities in the database by eliminating entries that were redundant  and 3,000 facilities that were no longer in business or were no longer RMP  facilities (e.g., they had reduced the volume of chemicals on-site below the  RMP threshold). Furthermore, DHS determined that 8,000 of the  remaining sites were the responsibility of another critical infrastructure  sector. For example, DHS removed water treatment and distribution  facilities because they fall under the water critical infrastructure sector,  which is the responsibility of EPA. In addition, DHS removed agricultural  facilities, such as fertilizer and pesticide distributors. DHS\u2019s analysis  resulted in approximately 4,000 facilities. According to DHS officials, DHS  then conducted a consequence analysis of these remaining facilities to  identify those that, if attacked, would endanger the largest number of lives.  According to DHS, the analysis included the following:  Reviewing the amount and toxicity of RMP materials stored at sites. For  example, DHS eliminated some facilities with flammable chemicals  because they would not create catastrophic effects when released. DHS  focused on toxic chemicals that pose inhalation hazards and very high- order flammables and explosives.", "Reviewing the population density in the vicinity of facilities with large  amounts of toxic chemicals.

The top screen helps identify the consequences  of an attack at a facility, including the human, economic, and psychological  impacts. It would also identify such things as whether a facility produces a  product that is essential to the military or pharmaceutical industry, or that  is critical to the delivery of water or energy. On the basis of the results of  the screening tool, DHS will identify facilities of highest concern and ask  them to voluntarily complete a security vulnerability assessment, the  second step in the RAMCAP process. Facility owners/operators will be able  to use the results of previous vulnerability assessments they may have  conducted to assist them in completing the RAMCAP process. The security  vulnerability assessment will include the following steps:  assessment of facility characteristics, such as potential target areas and  facility attractiveness to attack;  threat characterization of specific scenarios of concern\u2014these  \u201cbenchmark threats\u201d of concern to the government will allow cross- sector comparison;  consequence analysis of the impacts that could be produced by an   vulnerability assessment of a facility\u2019s existing security measures in  place, including mitigation, detection, and response capability.", "According to DHS officials, DHS will work with industry associations to  distribute the RAMCAP screening tool to the highest consequence chemical  facilities. DHS officials expect that between 5 and 10 percent of those  chemical facility owners/operators will be asked to complete the self- vulnerability assessment.", "DHS has tested both the screening tool and the vulnerability assessment,  and several private sector companies have also volunteered to pilot test the  vulnerability assessment. In 2005, New York\u2019s Office of Homeland Security,  working with DHS, requested all chemical facilities in the state to complete  the RAMCAP screening tool. According to industry officials, however, the  companies that pretested the vulnerability assessment found the exercise  valuable but difficult to complete. They said that DHS officials assisted  their companies in completing the assessment and expressed concern that  some owners/operators may have difficulty completing the assessment  without DHS\u2019s help. Some chemical company officials who had not  participated in the pilot told us that they would be reluctant to complete  the RAMCAP assessment, citing concerns about the work involved, the  need for DHS to collect the information, and the ability of DHS to safeguard  information on the facilities' security vulnerabilities. In addition, DHS  recognizes that it will have difficulty in collecting information about  chemical facilities and verifying these data due to the large number of  facilities in the sector. While DHS plans to work with industry associations  to encourage owners/operators to share information, private sector  participation will be voluntary, and some companies do not belong to  industry associations and, therefore, may not be easily contacted.  According to DHS\u2019s draft Chemical Sector-Specific Plan, DHS does not  have the resources to verify asset data for all chemical facilities and will  have to rely in large part on the accuracy of information submitted by the  owners/operators and federal, state, and local agencies.

In general, a DHS team will visit a  chemical plant and consider the facility\u2019s vulnerabilities and the  community\u2019s capability to prevent and respond to an attack. Then, DHS  brings together the appropriate local emergency response officials and  provides training on how to assess buffer zone security and identify  specific measures to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities. Local officials  conduct an assessment and summarize their work and the protective  measures needed in a Buffer Zone Protection Plan. DHS reviews the plan  and provides funding assistance to the community for some of the  protective measures. According to DHS officials, the process helps  facilitate relationships between owners/operators and the various response  and law enforcement entities in the community. Several company officials  we contacted who had participated in buffer zone assessments agreed with  DHS\u2019s assessment of the process. For example, one company told us that  the process helped them develop a relationship with the local police, who  are not always involved in emergency response planning at facilities. After  the buffer zone assessment, the local police now patrols the company\u2019s  fence on every shift.", "Prior to March 2005, the Buffer Zone Protection Program was a loan  program. DHS purchased equipment directly for loan to the states for a   1-year period prior to formal transfer of ownership. DHS received buffer  zone plans for 10 chemical facilities and loaned over $260,000 in equipment  to these jurisdictions. DHS also has conducted 63 technical assistance  visits to assist chemical facility owners/operators and local law  enforcement in assessing their buffer zone security.", "In March 2005, DHS announced a targeted grant program for states to  purchase equipment that will enhance security measures around facilities.  DHS identified 259 chemical manufacturing plants and storage and  stockpile supply areas that are eligible under program guidelines for $12.95  million from the Buffer Zone Protection Plan grant program. According to  DHS officials, these are sites with 50,000 people living in close enough  proximity that, if attacked, some portion of this population would be at risk  of death or serious injury. States may apply for these grants on the behalf  of local jurisdictions that plan to implement protective measures. The  local jurisdictions must conduct a buffer zone assessment and prepare a  plan requesting funds for equipment on an approved list. Before the state  can allocate funds, the guidelines state that DHS must approve the buffer  zone plan and spending plan. States have until April 30, 2006, to apply for  these funds.", "Site assistance visits: To assess and identify vulnerabilities at chemical  facilities, DHS deploys teams of experts from both government and  industry to facilities to conduct a site assistance visit. The teams  conducting the visits have subject matter expertise in various areas,  including physical security measures, system interdependencies, and  terrorist attack planning. The teams have a field template to guide their  efforts, and a typical visit lasts 1 to 2 days. Officials at participating  facilities receive assistance in addressing security issues at their sites and  obtain current threat information. At the conclusion of the visit, DHS  suggests mitigation measures for the company to consider. As a result of  these visits, DHS learns valuable information about chemical facility  vulnerabilities and obtains information to assist in developing reports and  identifying training for industry.", "As of June 15, 2005, DHS had conducted 38 site assistance visits at  chemical facilities. These visits included trips to water/wastewater  treatment facilities that store and use chemicals, major refineries, and  chemical manufacturing facilities. DHS selected facilities to visit on the  basis of a variety of factors, including whether the facility (1) would have  significant economic or public health effects if attacked, (2) is near a  special event of national significance, or (3) is in the vicinity where another  site assistance visit is planned and whether the visit was requested by the  owner/operator. DHS plans to conduct additional site assistance visits to  chemical facilities in fiscal year 2006 on the basis of need.", "Maritime Transportation Security Act: The Coast Guard, now under DHS,  is responsible for the MTSA program at facilities located along waterways,  including 238 chemical sites. Program regulations established a process  and deadlines for maritime facilities to follow in assessing their security  risks and preparing related plans to include actions to mitigate any  identified vulnerabilities. The Coast Guard has approved plans for all of  these facilities and completed on-site compliance inspections. The Coast  Guard has stated that it will continue to visit annually these and all facilities  subject to MTSA to ensure compliance. The Coast Guard has awarded Port  Security Grants to a number of chemical facilities to provide assistance for  physical security enhancements.", "Other protective measure programs: DHS will place 68 protective security  advisors in metropolitan areas across the country. The advisors have  experience related to vulnerability reduction and physical security and  many have law enforcement or military backgrounds. The advisors serve as  a liaison between federal efforts and those by the state, local, and private  sector. The advisors have responsibility for assisting in identifying high- priority facilities, providing the local community with information on  threats and best practices, and coordinating training and facility visits.", "In addition, DHS has installed cameras for security monitoring at 10 high- consequence chemical facilities. These are facilities that could have a  significant effect on public health or the national or regional economy if  attacked. The cameras provide local law enforcement authorities with the  ability to conduct remote surveillance of the areas surrounding the facility  during elevated threat levels.

Through  ISAC, DHS provides the private sector with threat information by means of  daily electronic mail and a secure Web site. While ISAC was initially  designed to allow companies to report unexplained or suspicious incidents  involving chemical facilities, the system can no longer provide this function  because of technical constraints. To operate the center, ACC uses its  existing 24-hour communication network for sharing information about  chemical emergencies. Any company engaged in the production, storage,  transportation, sale, or delivery of chemicals may participate in ISAC\u2019s  activities. ISAC has almost 600 participants representing more than 430  chemical companies that receive daily intelligence reports as well as  episodic alerts and warnings.

The chemical sector is one of the first sectors to  pilot test the new system\u2014approximately 25 industry officials have access  to it. DHS plans to eventually enroll in the system all chemical company  employees with a need for access to sensitive security information.  According to ACC, legal concerns, such as who will operate the system and  how DHS will protect the information provided by industry from release  under the Freedom of Information Act, have delayed the use of the system.

These officials also believe that the  agency has expertise in a number of other areas that has not been tapped  and could support DHS\u2019s activities. In addition to EPA\u2019s expertise on RMP  data and its familiarity with RMP facilities, EPA maintains information on  hazardous chemicals and related facilities. For example, EPA collects some  information under the Toxic Substances Control Act on industrial  chemicals that may pose environmental or human health hazards and  collects information about oil and pesticides facilities under other  authorities. Furthermore, as the lead federal agency for hazardous  materials emergency response, EPA has infrastructure in place around the  country with designated on-site coordinators for hazardous materials  incidents. These officials, as well as field inspectors who visit chemical  facilities under a variety of environmental programs, are familiar with  chemical facilities across the country and have general knowledge of  process safety issues and expertise on hazardous material releases.

In June 2002, as part of its Responsible Care\u00ae Management  System, ACC adopted a security code requiring its members to adhere to a  set of security management principles. For physical site security, member  companies are to perform vulnerability assessments using an approved  methodology. Companies also must develop plans to mitigate  vulnerabilities, take actions to implement the plans, and have an  independent party verify that the facilities implemented the identified  physical security enhancements. Third-party reviewers can include  insurance representatives, local emergency responders, or local law  enforcement officials. These reviewers do not verify that a vulnerability  assessment was conducted appropriately or that actions taken by a facility  adequately address security risks. However, the Responsible Care\u00ae  Management System requires member companies to periodically conduct  independent third-party audits that include an assessment of their security  programs and processes and their implementation of corrective actions.

Furthermore, the Chlorine Institute, which represents approximately 220  companies involved in the production, distribution, and use of chlorine,  developed a seven-step process that smaller chlorine manufacturing and  distribution companies can use to assess their vulnerabilities. The process  takes companies through a series of steps that score facilities in different  areas to identify vulnerabilities.

The National Paint and Coatings Association, which  represents over 300 paint and coatings manufacturing and supply  companies, worked with its members to develop a safety and  environmental management system called Coatings Care. This system  includes security steps such as analyzing threats, vulnerabilities, and  consequences and implementing security measures. Member companies  have 1 year from the time they join the association to agree to follow  Coatings Care principles. However, the association does not require third- party verification of security steps. Similarly, the Chlorine Institute requires  executives at all member companies to sign an agreement stating that they  will meet nine safety and security requirements, including complying with  the Responsible Care\u00ae Management System, NACD\u2019s Responsible  Distribution Process, or another industry security program. While  companies that do not sign the agreement are not eligible for Chlorine  Institute membership, the institute does not require that companies take  steps to verify compliance with security programs. In addition, the  Fertilizer Institute, which represents approximately 190 companies that  make, sell, or transport fertilizer products, recommends but does not  require that members follow a Security Code of Management Practices that  involves screening facilities into priority tiers on the basis of potential  security hazards and conducting a vulnerability assessment, following a  timeline that is based on their tier level.", "Despite industry associations\u2019 efforts to encourage or require members to  voluntarily address security, the extent of participation in the industry\u2019s  voluntary initiatives is unclear.

Most of the chemical  associations we contacted stated that the cost of security improvements is  a challenge for some chemical companies. Industry officials we spoke with  said that some companies have already made significant investments to  improve security. For example, ACC reports that its members have spent  an estimated $2 billion on security improvements since September 11, 2001.  However, industry associations told us that while some companies have  implemented security enhancements, others may not be implementing  security measures because of cost concerns. Representatives of the  American Forest & Paper Association and the National Paint and Coatings  Association told us that small companies, in particular, may struggle with  the cost of security improvements or the cost of complying with any  potential government security programs because they may lack the  resources larger companies have to devote to security.", "Many industry officials suggested that federal assistance via grants or tax  incentives to offset security costs could help companies enhance facility  security. According to these officials, financial incentives to companies to  support both vulnerability assessments and security improvements would  be helpful. Representatives from two industry associations stated that  financial assistance from the government to support the cost of compliance  with voluntary programs such as the Responsible Care\u00ae Management  System would be helpful, noting that complying with voluntary programs is  very costly. Other industry officials suggested that DHS direct funding to  high-risk facilities it views as vulnerable. A number of officials also told us  that financial incentives for security improvements will make chemical  security legislation, if enacted, more palatable to industry. In this regard,  H.R. 713, introduced in the 109th Congress, would create a tax credit for 50  percent of the cost incurred by eligible agricultural businesses for  protecting hazardous chemicals or pesticides from unauthorized access.", "Industry stakeholders also cited the need for guidance on what level of  security is adequate. While DHS has issued guidance to state Homeland  Security Offices and the Chemical Sector Coordinating Council on  vulnerabilities and protective measures that are common to most chemical  facilities, several stakeholders expressed a desire for guidance on specific  security improvements. For example, representatives of the National  Petrochemical and Refiners Association stated that one reason the  association holds workshops and best practices sessions is to meet the  challenge of determining the types of security measures that constitute a  reasonable amount of security. Another association stated that  standardized security criteria would be useful in helping companies  determine adequate levels of security. In addition, a number of associations  told us that companies are operating on tight profit margins and want to  feel certain that the benefits of security improvements justify the cost.  According to these associations, while companies are addressing security  since the events of September 11, 2001, they have to make cost-effective  decisions about allocating their resources. Because it is unlikely that  sufficient resources will be available for companies to address all risks,  adopting a risk management framework can aid facilities in prioritizing  risks and the actions taken to reduce those risks, taking cost into  consideration.", "In addition, industry officials told us that the lack of threat information  makes it difficult for companies to know how to protect facilities. Two  associations told us that ISAC has not been very useful to members  because the information shared is not new or is very broad. Some officials  have attended classified briefings with DHS but reported that very little  specific information was provided. Other industry association officials told  us that DHS has withheld some threat information because it was  classified. Providing both classified and declassified or sanitized  information to associations would allow them to understand specific  threats and pass on unclassified information to members. An official with  an agricultural chemical company told us that many companies do not have  access to threat information applicable to rural areas that may have  different threats than companies located in urban areas. While companies  would like to receive very specific threat information, some officials  acknowledged that such information may not exist. Officials with one  association hoped that DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Information Network will  improve the quality of the threat information that DHS shares with industry.", "A few industry officials also mentioned limited guidance on conducting  vulnerability assessments and difficulty in conducting employee  background checks as challenges. One industry association stated that it  would like its members to receive guidance from DHS on how to conduct  vulnerability assessments. Another association expressed frustration  because none of the current vulnerability assessment tools address issues  specific to its members\u2019 facilities, which package and distribute chemicals,  and it would like DHS to help develop or approve a methodology for this  type of facility. Furthermore, representatives of forest and paper products  companies reported that the inaccessibility of government records has  made conducting background checks on employees difficult. Officials told  us that in addition to regular facility employees, the number of contractors  continuously moving through facilities could pose security risks without  the appropriate background checks. Access to employment and criminal  records would allow facility officials to conduct a more thorough check on  employees, thereby reducing the risk of hiring someone who could  threaten a facility.", "Finally, a number of stakeholders we contacted told us that emergency  response preparedness is a challenge for chemical companies. An official  with an industry-affiliated research center asserted that emergency  responders and communities in the United States are prepared to respond  to a toxic release. However, other stakeholders we spoke with stated that  many facilities have conducted security vulnerability assessments but may  not have done enough emergency response planning and outreach to the  responders and communities that would be involved in a release. A 2004  survey by a chemical workers union of workers at 189 RMP facilities found  that only 38 percent of respondents indicated that their companies\u2019 actions  in preparing to respond to a terrorist attack were effective, and 28 percent  reported that no employees at their facilities had received training about  responding to a terrorist attack since September 11, 2001. While  environmental laws require emergency response planning for accidental  chemical releases, several stakeholders told us facilities need to consider  very different scenarios with consequences on different orders of  magnitude when planning the emergency response for a terrorist incident.  An expert with Texas A&M University\u2019s National Emergency Response and  Rescue Training Center echoed this view, noting that chemical facility  employees are well-trained for an accidental release but may not be trained  in the emergency response for a terrorist release. According to this expert,  both facility employees and local emergency responders need to prepare  for terrorist-caused chemical releases that are less predictable and harder  to prepare for than accidental releases. Facilities should be aware of the  types of aid located within a 50-mile radius of the facility, such as welders,  neutralizing chemicals, and back-up protection equipment, according to  this expert. While some companies have formed mutual-aid groups in a  given geographic area, the expert cautioned that these groups may not  prove effective if facilities lock down and focus on protecting themselves  when terrorists attack."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Needs Additional Authority to Ensure That Chemical Facilities Are Addressing Security Issues", "paragraphs": ["Existing laws provide DHS with only limited authority to address security  concerns at U.S. chemical facilities, and additional legislation is needed to  place federal security requirements on these facilities.

As a result, DHS cannot ensure that facilities are assessing their  vulnerability to terrorist attacks and taking corrective actions, where  necessary. DHS has acknowledged that its existing authorities do not  permit it to effectively regulate the industry, and that the Congress should  enact federal security requirements for chemical facilities. Furthermore,  we concluded in 2003, and continue to believe, that additional legislation is  needed.

Under the Homeland Security Act, the Secretary of DHS is  responsible for coordinating homeland security issues with the private  sector to ensure adequate planning, equipment, training, and exercise  activities. The Homeland Security Act also makes the Special Assistant to  the Secretary (Private Sector) responsible for (1) promoting and  developing public-private partnerships for collaboration and mutual  support to address homeland security challenges, (2) assisting in  promoting and developing private sector best practices to secure critical  infrastructure, and (3) coordinating industry efforts to identify private  sector resources and capabilities that could effectively supplement  government efforts to prevent or respond to a terrorist attack.", "Existing laws also assign DHS responsibilities specifically related to the  protection of critical infrastructure, including chemical facilities. The  Patriot Act called for the establishment of the National Infrastructure  Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC)\u2014a partnership between Los  Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories\u2014under DHS to help protect  critical infrastructure by supporting counterterrorism, threat assessment,  and risk mitigation activities. NISAC is to provide support\u2014such as  modeling, simulation, and analysis of critical infrastructure systems\u2014to  facilitate modifying these systems to mitigate threats to them and to critical  infrastructure in general. In addition, the Homeland Security Act gives  DHS\u2019s Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure  Protection (IAIP) responsibilities related to protecting critical  infrastructure, including  accessing, receiving, analyzing, and integrating information from  federal, state, and local governments and private sector entities to  identify, detect, and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats to  the United States, and to understand these threats in light of actual and  potential vulnerabilities;  carrying out comprehensive assessments of the vulnerabilities of the  nation\u2019s key resources and critical infrastructure, including assessing  the risks posed by particular types of terrorist attacks within the United  States, the probability of success of such attacks, and the feasibility and  potential efficacy of various countermeasures to such attacks;  developing a comprehensive national plan for securing the nation\u2019s key  resources and critical infrastructure; and   recommending the necessary measures to protect these key resources  and critical infrastructure.", "While DHS\u2019s existing legal authorities provide it with access to some  information about critical infrastructure threats and vulnerabilities, DHS  does not have the authority to require all chemical facilities to conduct  vulnerability assessments. The Homeland Security Act provides DHS with  access to all information that may be collected, prepared, or possessed by  any federal agency concerning infrastructure or other vulnerabilities of the  United States to terrorism. Under the Homeland Security Act, DHS may  request information from the private sector through cooperative  agreements. In addition, the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and  Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (CSISSFRRA) required the Attorney General to  review and report on the vulnerability of certain chemical facilities to  criminal and terrorist activity and current industry practices regarding site  security. In 2003, $3 million was transferred from Justice\u2019s general  administration appropriation to DHS as part of the Consolidated  Appropriations Resolution, 2003, and the conferees stated that they  expected DHS to use the transferred funds to conduct the vulnerability  assessments under CSISSFRRA. However, CSISSFRRA does not give DHS  the authority to require facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments.  Similarly, the October 2004 conference report on DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2005  appropriations act directed IAIP\u2014within DHS\u2014to analyze whether DHS  should require private sector entities to provide IAIP with existing  information about their security measures and vulnerabilities in order to  improve its ability to evaluate critical infrastructure protection nationwide.  The conference report stated that the analysis should include all critical  infrastructure, including chemical plants, and evaluate the benefits of  securing the information and the costs to both the private sector and IAIP  for implementing this requirement. However, neither the appropriations  act nor any other legislation would require chemical facilities to provide  information about their security and vulnerabilities.", "Furthermore, DHS currently lacks the authority to enter all chemical  facilities without their permission to assess security or to require and  enforce security improvements. In this regard, except with respect to  certain chemical facilities covered under federal security requirements for  other critical infrastructures, existing laws do not give DHS the right to  enter a chemical facility to assess its vulnerability to a terrorist attack or  the authority to require and enforce the implementation of any needed  security improvements at these facilities. The Homeland Security Act, with  some limited exceptions, does not provide any new regulatory authority to  DHS and only transferred the existing regulatory authority of any agency,  program, or function transferred to DHS, thereby limiting actions DHS  might otherwise be able to take under the Homeland Security Act.  Therefore, DHS has relied solely on the voluntary participation of the  private sector to address facility security. As a result, DHS cannot ensure  that all high-risk facilities are assessing their vulnerability to terrorist  attacks and taking corrective action, where necessary.", "In contrast, some other critical infrastructure sectors are subject to federal  security requirements. For example, all commercial nuclear power plants  licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are required to take  security steps, including placing physical barriers outside of the operating  reactor area, limiting access to vital areas, and maintaining a trained  security force. In addition, community water systems that serve more than  3,300 people are required to conduct and submit a vulnerability assessment  to EPA and prepare an emergency response plan that incorporates the  results of the assessment.

While  DHS reports that most chemical companies have been eager to voluntarily  cooperate with agency efforts to address security issues at their facilities,  DHS determined that voluntary efforts alone will not sufficiently address  security for the entire sector. Echoing public statements by the Secretary of  DHS and the Administrator of EPA in 2002 that voluntary efforts alone are  not sufficient to assure the public of the industry\u2019s preparedness, in June  2005, both DHS and EPA called for legislation to give the federal  government greater authority over chemical facility security. Similarly, we  concluded in 2003, and continue to believe, that additional federal  legislation is needed because of the significant risks posed by thousands of  chemical facilities across the country to millions of Americans and because  the extent of security preparedness at these facilities is unknown.", "In testimony before the Congress in June 2005, the Acting Undersecretary  for IAIP stated that any proposed regulatory structure (1) must recognize  that not all facilities within the chemical sector present the same level of  risk, and that the most scrutiny should be focused on those facilities that, if  attacked, could endanger the greatest number of lives, have the greatest  impact on the economy, or present other significant risks; (2) should be  based on reasonable, clear, equitable, and measurable performance  standards; and (3) should recognize the progress that responsible  companies have made to date. He also stated that the performance  standards should be enforceable and based on the types and severity of  potential risks posed by terrorists, and that facilities should have the  flexibility to select among appropriate site-specific security measures that  will effectively address those risks. In addition, he said that DHS would  need the ability to audit vulnerability assessment activities and a  mechanism to ensure compliance with requirements.", "Beyond these general principles, DHS officials were reluctant to share with  us their views on the specific content and structure of chemical security  legislation. These officials explained that DHS provides its views on  proposed legislation to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as  part of the executive branch coordination process, and that OMB\u2014after  considering the points of view of all departments, agencies, and  independent operating entities\u2014establishes the unified executive branch  position on proposed legislation. Because the administration\u2019s unified  position had not yet been determined at the time of our discussion, DHS  officials believed that it was inappropriate to discuss their views on the  specific provisions of any legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders\u2019 Views on Chemical Security Legislation Are Mixed", "paragraphs": ["While many stakeholders\u2014including representatives from industry,  research centers, and government\u2014agreed on the need for additional  legislation that would place federal security requirements on chemical  facilities, they had mixed views on the content and structure of such  requirements. Representatives of three research organizations and three  environmental groups told us that DHS needs more authority to adequately  ensure that chemical facilities are taking action, based on the potential  harm that an attack on chemical facilities may cause. One expert stated  that chemical facility security is a public safety issue that warrants federal  oversight, while others said the number of facilities with potential off-site  consequences in proximity to population centers justifies federal  involvement in security. Furthermore, testifying in support of legislation  before the Congress in July 2005, a representative of a chemical workers  union underscored that workers and communities should not be placed at  risk because some companies choose not to prioritize security and that, in  the same vein, responsible companies should not be placed at an economic  disadvantage because they allocate resources to security. Half of the  industry associations we contacted also favor additional legislative  authority. ACC has publicly stated that they support chemical security  legislation for a number of reasons, including the belief that all of the  nation\u2019s chemical facilities should be required to take the security steps  that its members are taking under the Responsible Care\u00ae Management  System. One association supported federal legislation because its members  are encountering various state efforts to oversee facility security.  Concerned that member companies will be subject to different security  requirements in different states, officials with three associations would  rather the federal government take the lead on chemical facility security.", "Other stakeholders preferred that DHS continue to work with the industry  to voluntarily address security or were undecided about the need for  federal requirements. Two industry associations stated that the partnership  DHS has forged with the chemical industry has proven effective in working  to address security concerns. In July 2005 testimony before the Congress,  the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association expressed concern  that legislation giving DHS authority over chemical facility security will  negatively impact the cooperative relationship the industry and DHS have  established, noting that the level of information sharing could be  diminished if DHS becomes an industry regulator. Similarly, two research  centers affiliated with the industry did not advocate chemical security  legislation. One expressed concern that the goodwill that the industry has  shown to DHS will wane if DHS becomes a regulatory agency, while  another noted that the threat of new security regulations provides an  adequate incentive for facilities to take security steps. Notwithstanding  ACC\u2019s position, most of the individual chemical companies we contacted  also believed that legislation is not needed, or they were undecided about  whether DHS needed additional authority. Company officials generally told  us that industry self-regulation is preferable to federal oversight of facility  security. One company official also told us that states are better suited to  regulating facility security because they have greater knowledge about  facilities in their state.", "Stakeholders expressed a range of views about which facilities should be  covered if legislation is enacted; about whether legislation should address  inherently safer technologies; about EPA\u2019s role, if any; and about voluntary  industry programs. Stakeholders favoring legislation generally agreed that  legislation should target high-risk facilities, rather than applying the same  requirements to all facilities regardless of the different risks they pose.  These stakeholders told us that chemical facilities should be prioritized on  the basis of their potential impacts if attacked, with the highest-risk  facilities subject to stricter requirements than lower-risk facilities that do  not warrant the same degree of federal oversight. For example, in  testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs in July 2005, ACC explained that any regulatory  system must reflect the different risks posed by different facilities and  require security measures commensurate with those risks. At the same  hearing, a representative of SOCMA, which represents specialty chemical  manufacturers, recommended that legislation require facilities to perform a  risk screen on the basis of the potential consequences of an attack and the  attractiveness as a target. Facilities screened as high risk would then  perform a detailed vulnerability analysis. Representatives from two  research centers and two companies believed that RMP facilities provide a  good starting point for the universe of facilities that legislation should  cover because these facilities exceed a risk threshold on the basis of the  type and amount of chemicals they house. One company suggested that  chemical security legislation should require an analysis of RMP facilities  that ranks facilities on the basis of risk.", "Stakeholders expressed strongly divergent views on whether legislation  should require the substitution of safer chemicals and processes, referred  to as \u201cinherently safer technologies.\u201d Implementing inherently safer  technologies could potentially lessen the consequences of an attack by  reducing the chemical risks present at facilities. Justice, in introducing a  methodology to assess chemical facilities\u2019 vulnerabilities, recognized that  reducing the quantity of hazardous material may make facilities less  attractive to terrorist attack and reduce the severity of an attack.  Furthermore, DHS\u2019s July 2004 draft Chemical Sector-Specific Plan states  that inherently safer chemistry and engineering practices can prevent or  delay a terrorist incident, noting that it is important to make sure that  facility owners/operators consider alternate ways to reduce risk, such as  inherently safer design, implementing just-in-time manufacturing, or  replacing high-risk chemicals with safer alternatives. However, DHS told us  that the use of inherently safer technologies tends to shift risks rather than  eliminate risks, often with unintended consequences. Some previous  chemical security legislative proposals have included a requirement that  facility security plans include safer design and maintenance actions, or that  facility security plans include \u201cconsideration\u201d of alternative approaches  regarding safer design. Representatives from three environmental groups  told us that facilities have defined security too narrowly as guns, gates, and  guards, without focusing on reducing facility risks through safer  technologies. Noting that no existing laws require facilities to analyze  inherently safer options, these representatives believe legislation should  require such an analysis and give DHS or EPA the authority to require the  implementation of technologies if high-risk facilities are not doing so.  Process safety experts at one research organization recognized that  reducing facility hazards and the potential consequences of chemical  releases makes facilities less vulnerable to attack. However, these experts  also explained that inherently safer technologies can be prohibitively  expensive and can shift risks onto other facilities or the transportation  sector. For example, reducing the amount of chemicals stored at a facility  may increase reliance on rail or truck shipments of chemicals. These  experts support legislative provisions requiring analysis or consideration of  technology options but do not support giving the federal government the  authority to require specific technology changes because of the complexity  of these decisions. Representatives of two research centers affiliated with  the industry told us that while facilities should look at inherently safer  technologies when assessing their vulnerability to terrorist attack, safer  technologies are not a substitute for security.", "Industry associations and company officials voiced strong opposition to  any inherently safer technologies requirements. The majority of the  industry officials we contacted opposed an inherently safer technologies  requirement, with many stating that inherently safer technologies involve a  safety issue that is unrelated to facility security. Industry officials voiced  concerns about the federal government\u2019s second-guessing complex safety  decisions made by facility process safety engineers. Representatives from  four associations and two companies told us that, in many cases, it is not  feasible to substitute safer chemicals or change to safer processes. Certain  hazardous chemicals may be essential to necessary chemical processes,  while changing chemical processes may require new chemicals that carry  different risks. In July 2005 testimony before the Congress, a SOCMA  representative explained that while inherently safer technologies are  intended to reduce the overall risks at a facility, this could be achieved only  if a chemical hazard was not displaced to another time or location or did  not magnify another hazard. Furthermore, process safety experts and  representatives from associations and companies report that some safer  alternatives are extremely expensive. For example, reducing facility  chemical inventories by moving to on-site manufacturing when chemicals  are needed can cost millions of dollars, according to a stakeholder. One  company also voiced opposition even to a legislative requirement that  facilities \u201cconsider\u201d safer options. The official explained that the company  opposed such a provision\u2014even if legislation does not explicitly give the  government the authority to require implementation of safer  technologies\u2014because it might leave companies liable for an accident that  might have been prevented by a technology option that was considered but  not implemented.", "Stakeholder views also varied on whether EPA should play a role in  developing or enforcing security requirements. Many of the stakeholders  we contacted acknowledged that EPA has considerable expertise on  chemical facilities, although some noted that DHS lacks expertise specific  to the risks related to the chemicals and processes used at facilities. Some  of the experts we spoke with stated that EPA should be involved in  enforcing any security requirements because of the agency\u2019s expertise and  because it has an established field presence. Process safety experts also  suggested that DHS should work with EPA in identifying the chemicals of  concern that would determine which facilities are subject to chemical  security requirements. In contrast, all of the industry stakeholders we  spoke with about this issue believed that EPA should not have a prominent  role, if any, in chemical security legislation because of EPA\u2019s regulatory  function and because it lacks security expertise. One association said it  would be extremely difficult for its members to work with EPA on security  issues because the agency\u2019s focus on enforcement of environmental  regulations would undermine security discussions. Another association  was concerned that EPA would approach facility security as an opportunity  for further environmental regulation.", "Finally, a number of stakeholders believed that any legislation should  include provisions recognizing compliance with industry initiatives, such  as ACC\u2019s Responsible Care\u00ae Security Code, equivalent to federal security  requirements. Representatives from ACC, SOCMA, the National  Association of Chemical Distributors, and other associations underscored  that legislation, if enacted, should recognize voluntary industry security  programs so facilities that have acted to address security do not have to  duplicate efforts they have made to date. In testimony before the Senate  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in July 2005, an  ACC official emphasized the need for legislation to give credit for the  substantial voluntary expenditures ACC members have made implementing  the Responsible Care\u00ae Security Code. Representatives of three  environmental groups were not opposed to a provision making compliance  with the industry\u2019s currently voluntary security programs equivalent to  federal requirements, but they emphasized that these facilities should be  required to submit documentation of security steps for review by the  federal government. The Coast Guard, in implementing MTSA, approved  ACC\u2019s Responsible Care\u00ae Security Code and others as accepted alternative  security programs for the purposes of fulfilling security requirements under  MTSA. A number of the industry officials we interviewed praised MTSA as  a model for chemical security legislation because it allows participation in  industry security programs to meet security requirements, and because  MTSA\u2019s requirements are performance-based rather than prescribing  specific actions that all facilities must take. Some industry officials have  suggested that legislation should also exempt MTSA-covered chemical  facilities from security requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Challenges DHS Will Face in Implementing Chemical Security Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders identified a number of challenges DHS will face in  implementing chemical security requirements. First, some stakeholders  told us that identifying the appropriate universe of facilities to be covered  by requirements will be difficult, given the diversity of facilities that handle  hazardous materials. While the RMP program identifies facilities with  amounts of chemicals deemed hazardous to human health, stakeholders  told us non-RMP facilities may also need to be considered. For example,  process safety experts mentioned that some chemicals not on the RMP list  may need to be considered when identifying facilities, such as reactive  chemicals that are currently not included under RMP. New Jersey officials  noted that the state\u2019s chemical security efforts use criteria to identify  facilities that exceed RMP criteria, including facilities with RMP chemicals  below RMP threshold quantities and non-RMP chemicals that the state  deemed hazardous. Representatives from two agricultural chemical  companies stated that DHS will have a hard time identifying agricultural  facilities that house chemicals of concern, since these facilities range from  large plants to small rural facilities. Other stakeholders stated that some  RMP facilities should be excluded from security requirements.  Representatives of the ammonia refrigeration and forest products  industries stated that many of these facilities are not high risk in terms of  the possible terrorist threat they pose, even though they are subject to  RMP. Officials with two industry associations said that RMP data are not  the best indicator of terrorism risks, and that DHS will need to look beyond  RMP data to understand the complexities of the chemical sector and  identify those facilities with the greatest off-site consequences under  terrorist scenarios.", "Second, because some states have established their own chemical security  requirements, some stakeholders also were concerned about potentially  overlapping state and federal requirements. Representatives from two  industry associations stressed that the federal government needs to assert  its leadership over the chemical sector because states are stepping in  where they see a void. At least two states have passed chemical security  legislation. Maryland\u2019s Hazardous Material Security Act requires RMP  facilities in the state to perform vulnerability assessments, develop and  implement security measures, and report to the state Department of the  Environment. Under New York\u2019s Anti-Terrorism Preparedness Act of 2004,  the state Office of Homeland Security, subject to available appropriations,  must require certain chemical facilities to conduct vulnerability  assessments. Stakeholders report that other states have created chemical  security offices or are developing chemical security initiatives. Officials  with one industry association told us that state homeland security agencies  are getting involved in chemical facility security, even though they may lack  the resources to fully understand the issues these facilities face.  Furthermore, officials with three associations told us that many companies  have operations in multiple states and that cooperating with numerous  potentially conflicting state efforts would be a burden. Industry officials  also said that federal legislation would need to clearly preempt state  requirements in order for companies to avoid being subjected to both  federal and state laws. State officials from New Jersey and Texas also  voiced concern about duplicating efforts with the federal government.  State officials from New Jersey, which has used existing state  environmental authorities and a state homeland security task force to work  with chemical facilities on security issues, suggested that federal  legislation would provide industry with a reasonable and predictable set of  standards, rather than a patchwork of state requirements. New Jersey  officials also told us that although states have done their best to address  security concerns, many states, including New Jersey, lack specific  enforcement authority that could be provided for in federal legislation.", "Third, some stakeholders told us that enforcing chemical security  requirements, if enacted, will be a challenge for DHS. While legislation may  include enforcement provisions, stakeholders believe DHS may face  challenges in implementing any such provisions. Several stakeholders  questioned whether DHS has the expertise and resources to enforce  security requirements at chemical facilities. New Jersey state officials  believe that because DHS lacks experience in dealing with chemical  facilities, it should delegate implementation and enforcement authority to  states, allowing states to review facility activities and report back to DHS.  Unlike the Coast Guard, which conducts facility inspections under MTSA,  DHS currently does not have significant staff resources located throughout  the country. Some stakeholders suggested that DHS will need staff in the  field or will need contract support to enforce requirements.  Representatives from two industry associations suggested that allocating  federal resources to support chemical facility security preparedness will be  a challenge.", "Finally, some stakeholders were concerned about the federal government\u2019s  ability to protect information on facility vulnerabilities and security. Most  of the industry associations and company officials we spoke with raised  concerns about this issue, noting that information about facility  vulnerabilities and security measures could provide a roadmap for  terrorists. While the industry wants to cooperate with DHS on its chemical  security efforts, businesses are concerned that sensitive information could  be released. This concern arises from the conflict between the public\u2019s  \u201cright-to-know\u201d such information and security concerns about releasing  facility data. As an example, while federal regulations authorized the  posting of some RMP data on the Internet and in government reading  rooms, some industry officials opposed making this information available.  Following the events of September 11, 2001, various media reports  published RMP data on some facilities. Industry officials are willing to  share information with DHS about the vulnerability assessment process  and procedures, but they would prefer that vulnerability and security  information remain at the facility, where government officials can view  such information if needed. Reporting concerns about DHS\u2019s Protected  Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program, officials with four  associations said companies need additional information about DHS\u2019s  information protection procedures. Officials with one association added  that companies may not be comfortable with the PCII program until it is  tested in court. Officials with three industry associations also told us that  sharing information at the state level is a concern. In this regard, New  Jersey officials noted that they have faced a challenge in allaying industry  fears about sharing security information. These officials told us that while  some states do not have the ability to protect critical infrastructure  information, New Jersey state law exempts private sector information  provided for domestic security purposes from open records requirements.  In contrast to these views, representatives of three environmental groups  believe that some information about high-risk facilities should be publicly  available. Specifically, these representatives stated that communities need  to understand the risks posed by facilities in the area, and should have  access to information on the potential impacts of high-risk facilities\u2019 worst- case terrorist scenarios. These representatives told us that details about  specific facility vulnerabilities need not be released, but that the public  should have access to information about facilities that present the greatest  concern."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Across the nation, thousands of facilities produce, use, or store hazardous  chemicals in quantities that could potentially put large numbers of  Americans at risk. DHS, Justice, and other experts have warned that these  facilities present an attractive target for terrorists. A terrorist attack could  threaten human health and safety, cause economic disruptions, and impact  other critical infrastructures that rely on chemicals. However, the extent of  security preparedness at these facilities remains largely unknown.  Chemical industry associations have undertaken numerous initiatives to  raise awareness about security and to encourage\u2014and in some cases  require\u2014member companies to assess their vulnerabilities and act to  address them. While these efforts are laudable, participation in these  initiatives is voluntary and the extent to which individual companies across  the industry are addressing security issues is unclear. Furthermore,  voluntary efforts cannot ensure widespread participation and, unless  chemical facilities\u2019 vulnerabilities are identified and addressed on a  widespread basis across the sector, the security of the chemical industry as  a critical national infrastructure remains at risk. As the lead federal agency  for the chemical sector, DHS has developed a number of programs to assist  companies in protecting their chemical facilities. However, unlike other  federal agencies\u2014such as EPA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,  which require drinking water and nuclear facilities, respectively, to take  actions to improve their security\u2014DHS does not currently have the  authority to require the chemical industry to take such actions. On this  basis, DHS has concluded\u2014as we did in 2003\u2014that its existing patchwork  of authorities does not allow it to effectively regulate chemical sector  security. Since 2002, both DHS and EPA have called for legislation creating  security requirements at chemical facilities, and legislation has been  introduced in every Congress since the events of September 11, 2001. Our  work demonstrates the need to enhance DHS\u2019s ability to collect  information about industry preparedness and to ensure that facilities  evaluate and mitigate their vulnerability to terrorist attack. By granting  DHS the authority to require high-risk chemical facilities to take security  actions, policy makers can better ensure the preparedness of the chemical  sector.", "Among its activities to enhance chemical sector security, DHS has  developed methods for identifying high-priority facilities, assessing facility  vulnerabilities, and suggesting improvements to address these  vulnerabilities. In this process, DHS should take full advantage of EPA\u2019s  expertise on toxic chemical data sources, U.S. hazardous materials  facilities, and process safety issues, among other things, that the agency  has developed through its oversight of a number of chemical safety  programs. For example, EPA maintains data on RMP facilities\u2019 inventories  of toxic and flammable chemicals and facility worst-case release scenarios  and enforces compliance with a variety of environmental programs through  inspections of facilities located throughout the country.

However,  substituting safer technologies can be prohibitively expensive for some  companies and can shift risks onto other facilities or the transportation  sector. Also, in many cases, it may not be feasible to substitute safer  chemicals or change to safer processes. Therefore, given the possible  security and safety benefits as well as the potential costs to some  companies of substituting safer technologies, a collaborative study  employing DHS\u2019s security expertise and EPA\u2019s chemical expertise could  help policy makers determine the appropriate role of safer technologies in  facility security efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To enhance DHS\u2019s ability to collect comprehensive information on industry  preparedness and better ensure the security of the chemical sector, we  recommend that the Congress consider the following two actions:  granting DHS the authority to require high-risk chemical facilities to  assess their vulnerability to terrorist attacks and, where necessary, to  take corrective action and  providing DHS with the enforcement capability to ensure that facilities  are following these practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Because completion of the Chemical Sector-Specific Plan is critical to  DHS\u2019s efforts to enhance chemical facility security, we recommend that the  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security direct DHS to take the  following two actions:  ensure that the Chemical Sector-Specific Plan is completed in a timely   recognizing EPA\u2019s expertise in managing chemical risks, jointly study  with EPA whether chemical facilities\u2019 efforts to reduce vulnerabilities  would benefit from the use of technologies that substitute safer  chemicals and processes, referred to as \u201cinherently safer technologies.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS and EPA for their review and  comment. EPA provided no comments on the draft report. DHS agreed in  substance with two of the report\u2019s recommendations, but disagreed with  the third. DHS agreed that the Congress should consider granting DHS the  authority to require the chemical industry to address plant security. DHS  also agreed that completing and implementing the sector-specific plan is a  priority and stated that it is making progress toward developing this plan.  However, DHS disagreed with our recommendation that the department  work with EPA to study the security benefits to chemical plants of using  safer technologies. In this regard, DHS believes that the use of safer  technologies would not generally result in more secure chemical facilities  and would tend to shift risks rather than eliminate them. DHS stated that it  is unclear what role EPA would play in a study of the benefits of using safer  technologies or how DHS\u2019s interaction with EPA might be perceived among  DHS\u2019s private sector partners.", "We continue to believe, however, that the use of safer technologies may  have the potential to reduce security risks for at least some chemical  facilities by making them less attractive to a terrorist attack and reducing  the severity of the potential consequences of an attack. While we recognize  in our report that inherently safer technologies can shift risks onto other  facilities or the transportation sector, there may also be instances where  implementing safer technologies could reduce the likelihood and severity  of a terrorist attack. In fact, DHS\u2019s July 2004 draft of the Chemical Sector- Specific Plan states that inherently safer chemistry and engineering  practices can prevent or delay a terrorist incident. The draft also notes that  it is important to make sure that facility owners/operators consider  alternate ways to reduce risk, such as inherently safer design,  implementing just-in-time manufacturing, or replacing high-risk chemicals  with safer alternatives. Therefore, we continue to believe that studying the  costs and security benefits of using safer technologies would be a  worthwhile effort. While DHS, as the federal agency primarily responsible  for chemical facility security, should have the lead role in conducting such  a study, EPA\u2014charged with ensuring environmental and human health and  safety and having the key expertise needed to analyze the potential  environmental and health effects of a variety of alternative technologies\u2014 can provide valuable support. We acknowledge DHS\u2019s concern that its  working relationship with the chemical industry might be constrained by  too close association with EPA, which regulates the industry. However, we  do not believe that a DHS-EPA partnership to study the potential security  benefits of using safer chemicals and technologies would necessarily bring  the department into conflict with the industry, if the appropriate  informational safeguards and assurances are built into the process.  Through additional study, DHS\u2014in conjunction with EPA\u2014can help to  determine the appropriate role of inherently safer technologies in  government and industry efforts to bolster chemical facility security.  Through such an effort, DHS and EPA could also identify alternative ways  to reduce both security and environmental and health risks and share these  practices with private industry.", "DHS also provided a number of technical comments and clarifications,  which we have incorporated into the report as appropriate.

We revised the report to state that DHS expects to conduct six  Comprehensive Reviews, and that they will coordinate these reviews  with state and local officials.  8. As DHS suggested, we deleted the list of principles for proposed  chemical security legislation that DHS officials provided us in October  2005 and substituted the language suggested by DHS, which was, in  part, already included in the draft report.  9. As we state in our response to DHS\u2019s views on our recommendation, we  continue to believe that the use of safer technologies may potentially  reduce both security and environmental and health risks at some  chemical facilities. We retained the draft report\u2019s existing discussion of  the issue, including DHS\u2019s and the industry\u2019s views, but added DHS\u2019s  specific statement from its comment letter that \u201cthe use of inherently  safer technologies tends to shift risks rather than eliminate risks, often  with unintended consequences.\u201d We also included information from  DHS\u2019s draft Chemical Sector-Specific Plan, which states that inherently  safer chemistry and engineering practices can prevent or delay a  terrorist incident, and that it is important to make sure that facility  owners/operators consider alternate ways to reduce risk, such as  inherently safer design, implementing just-in-time manufacturing, or  replacing high-risk chemicals with safer alternatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition, Vincent P.
