The FBI has also not completed updating its strategic plan and has not developed a strategic human capital plan, although it has made some progress in both these areas. To better ensure focus on the highest priorities, over the last year, several actions were taken, including permanently redirecting a portion of the field agent workforce from criminal investigative programs to counterterrorism and counterintelligence. However, the FBI continues to face challenges in critical staffing areas including: (1) utilizing staff resources from other criminal investigative programs to address counterterrorism, and (2) a lack of adequate analytical and technical assistance and administrative support personnel.

The FBI continues to stand at the forefront of our domestic  intelligence efforts to defend the public from the threat of terrorism, while  still maintaining responsibility for investigations of other threats to our  public safety such as those from drugs, violent crime, public corruption,  and crimes against children. As I pointed out last June, any changes at the  FBI must be part of, and consistent with, broader governmentwide  transformation efforts that are taking place, especially those resulting  from the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and in  connection with the intelligence community.", "To effectively meet the challenges of the post-September 11, 2001,  environment, the FBI needs to consider employing key practices that have  consistently been found at the center of successful transformation efforts.  These key practices are to    ensure that top leadership drives the transformation;    establish a coherent mission and integrated strategic goals;   focus on a key set of principles and priorities;    set implementation goals and a timeline;    dedicate an implementation team to manage the process;    use a performance management system to define responsibility and    establish a communication strategy;   involve employees; and    build a world class organization that continually seeks to implement best  practices.", "Strategic human capital management is the centerpiece of any change  management initiative, including any agency transformation effort.

The FBI  currently uses a pass/fail system to rate its employees\u2019 performance. This  type of system does not provide enough meaningful information and  dispersion in ratings to recognize and reward top performers, help  everyone attain their maximum potential, and deal with poor performers.

The Office of  Strategic Planning is in the process of incorporating them into the revised  strategic plan. As of June 2003, the Counterterrorism and Criminal  Investigative Divisions\u2019 program plans were in the final stages of  development. FBI officials indicated that the implementation of two staff  reprogrammings and delays in the appropriation of its fiscal year 2003  budget, as well as the war in Iraq, delayed the completion of these  program plans. FBI officials estimate that a new strategic plan should be  completed by the start of fiscal year 2004. It is unclear, however, whether  the FBI will achieve this milestone, and because the plan has not been  completed we cannot comment on the quality of its contents.", "As noted earlier, employee involvement in strategic planning, and  transformation in general, is a key practice of a successful agency as it  transforms.

Human capital planning should include both  integrating human capital approaches in the development of the  organizational plans and aligning the human capital programs with the  program goals. The FBI has not completed a strategic human capital plan,  but has taken some steps to address short-term human capital needs  related to implementing its changed priorities, as well as made progress,  through a variety of initiatives, to begin to link human capital needs with  the FBI\u2019s strategic needs.

These include (1) initiating several  reengineering projects on human capital issues, such as succession  planning, enhancing the FBI\u2019s communication strategy and streamlining its  hiring process; (2) initiating the staffing of the Office of Intelligence, a key  component of building the FBI\u2019s intelligence mission; (3) realigning agents  and support staff to counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and cyber  crime investigations to address priority areas; and (4) implementing plans  to enhance recruitment and hiring for critical skill needs and training staff  shifted to priority areas to address the change in the FBI\u2019s priorities.

The use of such flexibilities should be based on a data-driven  assessment of the FBI\u2019s specific needs and capabilities. Such an analysis  should be outlined in the FBI\u2019s strategic human capital plan. After fully  maximizing the use of its recruiting flexibilities, if they prove to be  inadequate in helping the FBI meet its recruiting and retention goals, the  FBI may then want to seek additional legislative authority.", "Finally, as the FBI has yet to hire a Human Capital Officer to oversee these  efforts, it is critical that this individual have the appropriate expertise in  strategic human capital management, as well as the necessary resources to  continue to develop and implement long-term strategic human capital  initiatives.

This encourages a return to  the days when the FBI sent agents into churches and other organizations  during the civil rights movement, in an attempt to block the movement and  suppress antigovernment dissent.", "These officials also noted that liberalization of the Guidelines which  allows the FBI to access and analyze data from commercial and private  sector databases will result in a return to profiling of individuals and  building of intelligence dossiers. The inaccuracy or misuse of such data  could lead to innocent persons being suspected of crimes.", "None of the private sector officials we met with could provide specific  examples of the FBI abusing the new authorities granted under the  Guidelines.

Regarding  the authority to visit public places and events, FBI field office managers  told us that, considering the number of legitimate leads coming in and the  number of ongoing preliminary inquiries and investigations, agents are  fully tasked to support existing work and do not have the time or need to  visit public places or surf the Internet to generate additional leads. Based  on our field visits, however, we found that some agents are proactively  using the new investigative authorities granted under the revised  Guidelines. As shown in table 12, as of April 2003, 64 (about 36 percent) of  the 176 agents who completed our questionnaire indicated they had  accessed commercial information or databases, 53 (about 30 percent)  conducted online Internet searches or accessed online sites, and 31 (about  18 percent) visited public places or events, prior to opening a preliminary  inquiry or investigation. In addition, most of the agents who completed the  questionnaire indicated prior supervisory approval was not needed to  perform these activities.", "To help assuage public concerns about civil liberties issues, the FBI has  been reaching out to communities to assure them that, despite the  emphasis on counterterrorism, investigating abuses remains a high priority  of the FBI. FBI field offices have been tasked to contact Muslim leaders  for the purpose of establishing a dialogue and discussing procedures for  alerting the FBI to civil rights abuses. For example, in one field office we  visited, five meetings were held during the first 4 months of 2003\u2014 including meetings with Muslim community leaders and a panel discussion  to answer questions from the public\u2014covering topics related to homeland  security, FBI employment, and community outreach. Throughout the FBI,  over 500 outreach meetings occurred during the first 5 months after  September 11, 2001.
