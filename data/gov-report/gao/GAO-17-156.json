Although this represents progress, more needs to be done to establish a data governance structure that is consistent with key practices to ensure the integrity of standards over time. The upcoming transition to a new administration presents risks to implementing the DATA Act, potentially including shifted priorities or lost momentum. The lack of a data governance structure for managing efforts going forward jeopardizes the ability to sustain progress as priorities shift over time.", "Implementation plan updates. The 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies continue to face challenges implementing the DATA Act, according to information in their implementation plan updates. GAO identified four categories of challenges reported by agencies that may impede their ability to implement the act: systems integration issues, lack of resources, evolving and complex reporting requirements, and inadequate guidance. To address these challenges, agencies reported changing internal policies and procedures; leveraging existing resources; and using external resources, and manual and temporary workarounds, among other actions.", "Operationalizing data standards and technical specifications for data reporting. OMB issued additional guidance on how agencies should report data involving specific transactions, such as intragovernmental transfers, and how agencies should provide quality assurances for submitted data. However, this guidance does not provide sufficient detail in areas such as the process for providing assurance on data submissions and it does not address others, such as how agencies should operationalize the definitions for data elements (e.g., primary place of performance and award description). Treasury released a new version of the DATA Act Broker\u2014a system that collects and validates agency data\u2014in October 2016 and is making minor adjustments to its functionality. Agencies have reported making progress creating and testing their data submissions, but some report needing to rely on interim solutions for initial reporting while they wait for automated processes to be developed.", "Pilot to reduce recipient reporting burden. GAO reviewed the revised design for both the grants and procurement portions of the pilot and found that they partly met each of the leading practices for effective pilot design. Although this represented significant progress since April 2016, GAO identified an area where further improvement is still needed. Specifically, the plan for the procurement portion of the pilot does not clearly document how findings related to the centralized certified payroll reporting portal will be applicable to other types of required procurement reporting. This is a particular concern given the diversity of federal procurement reporting requirements. To date, all six components of the grant portion are underway.

Such  a framework is key for ensuring that the integrity of data standards is  maintained over time. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB and  Treasury establish a clear set of policies and procedures for developing  and maintaining data standards that are consistent with leading  practices.", "OMB and Treasury generally agreed with our recommendation and, in  response, engaged a contractor to interview key stakeholders and  develop a set of potential next steps. The first of these steps was to  establish a new Data Standards Committee that will be responsible for  maintaining established standards and developing new data elements or  data definitions that could affect more than one functional community  (e.g., financial management, financial assistance, and procurement).  According to OMB staff, the Data Standards Committee held its inaugural  meeting on September 15, 2016, and will meet on a monthly basis. The  committee has also drafted a charter that will delineate the scope of the  committee\u2019s work, as well as the composition and responsibilities of its  members. According to OMB staff, members include representatives from  a range of federal communities including the grants, procurement,  financial management and human resources communities, as well as  representatives of several interagency councils including the Chief  Information Officers Council and the Performance Improvement Council.  OMB staff told us that the committee will focus on clarifying existing data  standard definitions, including the definition of predominant place of  performance, and identifying new standards that may be needed going  forward.

We have previously reported that, given the  importance of continuity when implementing complex, government-wide  initiatives, the potential for gaps in leadership that can occur as  administrations change can impact the effectiveness and efficiency of  such efforts, potentially resulting in delays and missed deadlines. Such  transitions may disrupt the momentum for meeting implementation  timeframes or cause the government to fail to continue to build on  previous accomplishments.

One agency reported future estimated  costs, but did not report costs to date. Two agencies did not provide  any cost estimates. Total cumulative and future estimated costs for  full DATA Act implementation that was reported by 22 CFO Act  agencies in their implementation plan updates ranged from  approximately $1.0 million to $59.1 million, for a total of about $202.4  million. This total estimated cost reported by CFO Act agencies to  implement the DATA Act includes costs for systems integration and  modernization. It is important to note that the estimated total costs  reported by CFO Act agencies to implement the DATA Act  requirements is relatively small when compared to the almost $81  billion spent on information technology by the CFO Act agencies in  fiscal year 2016 alone.", "See appendix III for more details about the information that OMB required  CFO Act agencies to include in their implementation plan updates,  remaining actions to implement the suggested steps in Playbook 2.0, and  the number of CFO Act agencies that included the information.", "In our July 2016 report, we reported on challenges agencies included in  their initial implementation plans. The implementation plan updates  indicate that 19 of the 24 CFO Act agencies continue to face challenges  in their efforts to implement the DATA Act. Based on our review of the 24  CFO Act agency implementation plan updates, we identified four  overarching categories of challenges reported by agencies that may  impede their ability to effectively and efficiently implement the DATA Act:  systems integration issues, lack of resources, evolving and complex  reporting requirements, and inadequate guidance. See table 4 in  appendix III, which describes the categories of challenges and the  number of CFO Act agencies reporting challenges in each category.  Some of the challenges reported by the CFO Act agencies in their  updates include the following:  Systems integration. Nineteen of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported  challenges related to systems integration, which include concerns with  systems limitations, modernization efforts, and timing. For example, one  agency reported that validation presents challenges because its financial  systems are not properly integrated with procurement and grant systems.  Similarly, the agency reported that several of its components are  undergoing grant, procurement, or financial system improvements that  coincide with implementing the DATA Act, which could pose a risk to  timely DATA Act implementation if the improvements are delayed.  Another agency reported that, for one of its legacy systems, obtaining the  unique identifier to generate award financial data will likely be a manual  process. The lack of properly integrated systems increases the risk that  agencies may have difficulty compiling and validating the information they  are required to report under the DATA Act by the May 2017 reporting  deadline for agencies to submit their financial and payment information.", "Resources. Fourteen of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported challenges  related to staffing issues or funding constraints. For example, one agency  reported that expertise related to feeder systems and data will be needed  to successfully implement the DATA Act, but such subject matter experts  may not be available. Another agency reported that meeting the reporting  deadline is highly dependent on receiving requisite funding and  resources. The lack of sufficient resources, including staff expertise and  proper funding, increases the risk that agencies may have difficulty taking  all the actions needed in a timely manner to fully implement the  requirements of the DATA Act.", "Reporting. Thirteen of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported challenges  related to mandatory DATA Act reporting requirements, including  concerns with data quality and their ability to report all the required data  elements in their initial DATA Act submissions, as well as senior  accountable officials (SAO) certification and reporting non-financial  data. For example, one agency reported that its SAO may be unable to  certify the quality of data if OMB\u2019s guidance for the SAO certification  cannot be supported by existing processes. Another agency reported  concerns with the burden of reconciling account data with financial and  award data. In addition, two agencies reported challenges with reporting  beginning balances at the level of detail required by the DATA Act. Two  agencies reported concerns with protecting sensitive and classified data.  One agency also reported ongoing issues with inconsistent quality of data  submitted from their financial systems. Another agency reported that  certain data elements are not currently available for all document types,  and is considering pulling these data elements from other source systems  to the extent possible. A lack of complete and accurate agency data  increases the risk that agencies may not be able to meet the DATA Act  reporting requirements within the mandated timeframes.", "Guidance. Eleven of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported ongoing  challenges related to the timely issuance of, and ongoing changes to,  OMB policy and Treasury guidance. Eight agencies reported that if policy  or technical guidance continues to evolve or be delayed, the agencies\u2019  ability to comply with the May 2017 reporting deadline could be affected.  Some agencies also reported concerns about the requirement for SAOs  to certify the data reported quarterly. For example, one agency reported  that if guidance clarifying certification procedures is delayed, it may not  have time to implement appropriate validation steps needed to give  assurance over the data. Because of the lack of timely and consistent  guidance, agencies may need to continuously update or change their  processes, which could adversely affect their ability to meet the DATA Act  requirements.", "As noted above, the information reported by the CFO Act agencies in  their implementation plan updates indicates that some agencies are at  increased risk of not meeting the May 2017 reporting deadline because of  these challenges. In addition, inspectors general for some agencies, such  as the Departments of Labor and Housing and Urban Development, have  issued readiness review reports that also indicate their respective  agencies are at risk of not meeting the reporting deadline. As discussed  further below, the technical software requirements for agency reporting  are still evolving, so any changes to the technical requirements over the  next few months could also affect agencies\u2019 abilities to meet the reporting  deadline.", "In August 2016, in response to our prior recommendation, OMB  established procedures for reviewing and using agency implementation  plan updates that include procedures for identifying ongoing challenges.  In its procedures document, OMB states that it has received input from a  significant number of agency staff via office hours, emails, regular  meetings, agency visits, and other methods regarding the challenges  agencies are experiencing as they work toward implementation since the  submission of their original plans. OMB\u2019s document also states that it has  worked to address these challenges and provide both policy and technical  guidance as needed. Further, the document stated that requiring  agencies to update plans will allow OMB to address challenges that  agencies are not directly reaching out to OMB about or that numerous  agencies are experiencing. According to the procedures document, OMB  will also be monitoring progress toward the statutory deadline and setting  up meetings with any of the 24 CFO Act agencies that OMB identifies as  being at risk of not meeting the implementation deadline. OMB will  schedule these visits by reviewing the implementation plan updates and  discerning which agencies appear to be experiencing the most challenges  to implementation.", "To help address their challenges, 16 of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported  that they use certain mitigating strategies in their implementation plan  updates. Based on our review, we identified seven overarching categories  of mitigating strategies reported by these agencies to address DATA Act  implementation challenges: making changes to internal policies and  procedures, leveraging existing resources, using external resources,  continuing communications, employing manual and temporary  workarounds, monitoring and developing guidance, and enhancing  existing systems. These strategies, as a whole, were similar to the  mitigating strategies reported by agencies in their initial implementation  plans. The most commonly reported categories of mitigating strategies  were changing internal policies and procedures and leveraging existing  resources.

In January 2016 we  reported that ensuring that data definitions are generally consistent with  leading practices is important because limitations with the definitions  could lead to inconsistent or inaccurate reporting, among other issues.  We also reported that although the standardized data element definitions  issued by OMB largely adhered to leading practices for establishing data  definitions, several definitions had limitations that could lead to  inconsistent reporting. While OMB\u2019s additional guidance addresses some  of the limitations we identified, it does not address all the clarity issues we  identified.", "Specifically, OMB\u2019s additional guidance addresses (1) reporting financial  and award level data, (2) establishing linkage between agency award and  financial systems using a unique award identifier, and (3) providing  assurances that data submitted to Treasury for publication on  USASpending.gov is sufficiently valid and reliable. For example, OMB\u2019s  Management Procedures Memorandum No. 2016-03 directs agencies to  leverage existing procedures for providing assurances of the quality of  their DATA Act data submissions and directs agency SAOs to provide  reasonable assurance that their internal controls support the reliability  and validity of the data submitted to Treasury for publication on  USASpending.gov. OMB\u2019s memorandum notes that assurance means that, at a minimum, the data reported are based on appropriate internal  control and risk management strategies identified in OMB Circular A- 123. OMB expects SAO assurance of the data through this process  would mean that data submitted to Treasury by May 2017 complies with  existing controls for ensuring the data quality.", "However, our prior work has shown that relying on these quality  assurance processes is not sufficient to address the accuracy and  completeness challenges that we have previously identified.  Additionally, as we reported in August 2016, Offices of Inspector General,  which are required to assess the completeness, timeliness, quality, and  accuracy of data submitted under the act, have expressed concerns  about agencies\u2019 abilities to provide assurances of the quality of their  data. The inspectors general are particularly concerned about their  agencies\u2019 ability to provide quality assurances for data that are not  directly provided by the agency, such as data submitted by non-federal  entities who receive federal awards.", "To address these concerns, OMB released draft guidance in August 2016  that specifies DATA Act reporting responsibilities when an  intragovernmental transfer (both allocation transfers and buy/sell  transfers) is involved, explains how to report financial assistance awards  with personally identifiable information (PII), and clarifies the SAO  assurance process over the data submitted to the broker. OMB staff told  us that this most recent policy guidance was drafted in response to  questions and concerns reported by agencies in their implementation plan  updates, as well in meetings with senior OMB and Treasury officials  intended to assess agency implementation status. Among other  challenges, agencies indicated the need for additional guidance on  reporting intergovernmental transfers, providing assurances over their  data, and reporting insurance information. For example, officials from  USDA, one of our case example agencies, told us that they are waiting  for guidance on insurance and indemnity reporting, but no guidance has  been issued. Absent any new guidance, they plan to report insurance as  they have under the Federal Funding and Accountability and  Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA). OMB staff told us that they received  feedback from 30 different agencies and reviewed over 200 comments on  the draft guidance. The final guidance, OMB M-17-04, was issued on  November 4, 2016.", "Although OMB has made some progress with these efforts, other data  definitions lack clarity\u2014including primary place of performance and award  description\u2014which still needs to be addressed to ensure agencies report  consistent and comparable data.

Treasury expects the guidance provided in the schema version 1.0 will  provide a stable base for agencies to develop the necessary data  submission procedures. We have previously reported that a significant  delay in releasing version 1.0 of the schema would likely have  consequences for timely implementation of the act. Agencies are using  schema version 1.0 to plan what changes are needed to systems and  business processes to be able to capture and submit the required data.  Under the act, agencies must report data in compliance with established  standards by May 2017.

This document also  recognized that the iterative approach being used to develop and release  guidance has posed challenges for some agencies as changes in the  guidance may require them to re-work some of their implementation  project plans. Our analysis of the implementation plan updates submitted  by the agencies to OMB confirms this. We found that 11 of the 24 CFO  Act agencies highlighted challenges related to the guidance provided by  OMB and Treasury in their implementation plan updates. One of the  commonly cited challenges concerned complications arising due to the  iterative nature or late release of the guidance. For example, one agency  reported that developing its implementation plan was highly dependent  upon the concurrent development of the schema version 1.0 and  technical guidance being developed by Treasury.

Treasury officials told us that although they plan  to continue to refine the broker to improve its functionality and overall  user experience, they have no plans to alter these key functions.", "According to Treasury guidance documents, agencies are expected to  use the broker to upload three files containing data pulled from the  agencies\u2019 internal financial and award management systems. These files  will undergo two types of validation checks in the broker before being  submitted to Treasury: data element validations and complex validations.  Data element validations check whether data elements comply with  specific format requirements such as field type and character length.  Complex validations perform tasks such as checking data against other  sources or using calculation rules to verify whether certain data elements  sum up to each other. Treasury has configured these complex validation  rules so that if a rule is not met, the broker can either produce a warning  message while still accepting the data for submission or produce a fatal  error, which prevents submission of the data altogether. As of September  30, 2016, data uploaded to the broker needs to successfully meet less  than a quarter of these complex validation checks in order to be accepted  for submission to Treasury. Treasury officials said that this choice was  made in order to allow agencies more flexibility to test the broker, and that  the data submissions will be required to pass more of these validation  rules at a later date. According to Treasury documents, in a future  release of the broker, data uploaded to the broker will need to  successfully meet about half of the complex validation checks in order to  be accepted for submission to Treasury. Treasury officials said that  having about half of the validation rules produce warnings rather than  fatal errors would provide agency officials with the flexibility to correct  issues flagged by the broker or not to do so, depending on their  knowledge of the context and situation of specific data elements. For  example, for some of the programs, grants award-level information may  not be reported for security reasons.", "In addition to assisting agencies in collecting and validating agency- generated data, the broker also extracts award and sub-award  information from existing government-wide award reporting systems and  helps ensure these files are in the standard format. This function was  added during software development efforts in late September and early  October 2016. Unlike the files submitted by agencies, these extracted  files with award and sub-award information are not subject to any  validations in the broker. However, Treasury implemented additional  validation checks on the file containing agency financial assistance award  information through its source system, the Award Submission Portal.  These checks include verifying that required information is present and  formatted correctly.", "Treasury officials told us that the responsibility for ensuring the accuracy  of these files lies with the DATA Act SAO at each agency. For example,  OMB Management Procedures Memorandum 2016-03 specifies that  SAOs must provide reasonable assurance that their internal controls  support the reliability and validity of the agency account-level and award- level data submitted to Treasury for publication. Before final submission  of the data files in the broker, the SAO is responsible for assuring that, at  a minimum, the data reported are based on appropriate internal control  and risk management strategies identified in OMB Circular A-123.  Treasury officials said that if SAOs are not able to provide this assurance,  their agency will be prevented from submitting the files and their data will  not be included in the data reporting based on the current broker design.  Currently, the broker does not allow agencies to submit their data with  qualifications, such as known quality limitations, so data that does not  completely meet the criteria for SAO assurance will not be reported, even  with qualifications. OMB staff and Treasury officials said that they are  reconsidering this position and are exploring ways that agencies can  submit data with qualifications and how these qualifications can be  conveyed to the public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Data Submissions are Under Development", "paragraphs": ["Agencies have made progress toward creating their data submissions  and testing them in the broker, but work remains to be done before actual  reporting can begin.

As of October 2016, 21 of 24 CFO  Act agencies reported that they had begun testing their data files in the  broker, but only the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had  completed testing the broker and revised its data files accordingly.  Treasury also collects data from the four shared service providers that are  helping to manage data submissions for their agency clients. As of  October 2016, two of these shared service providers reported to Treasury  that they had finished building the data files for submission to the broker.", "In August 2016, we reported that agencies we reviewed are relying on a  series of software patches from their enterprise resource planning (ERP)  vendors to facilitate their data submissions. ERP vendors are  developing patches that will extract data to help their clients develop files  that comply with DATA Act requirements. According to vendors, these  patches will help link an agency\u2019s financial and award systems, create  additional fields in existing systems to report new data elements, and  extract data files formatted for submission to Treasury. Patches that will  facilitate the generation of agency file submissions were planned to be  completed between August 2016 and February 2017. As of September  2016, the release of one of these patches has been delayed. Oracle, one  of the ERP vendors developing these patches, had planned to release a  patch that would allow award attributes to be captured in their clients\u2019  core purchasing systems and general ledger journals in August 2016, but  the release was delayed until September 13, 2016. Representatives from  SAP, another such ERP vendor, said that they were able to deliver one of  the needed patches to their clients in August 2016 and an additional  patch in October. But, they also said that changes and adjustments to the  broker had delayed their progress towards creating a patch that can  format their clients\u2019 data files for submission.", "It will be more difficult for agencies that are relying on ERP vendor  patches to test their data files in the broker until the patches have been  implemented since the patches will enable them to construct and format  their files for submission to the broker. Two agencies reported in their  implementation plan updates that a delay in the release of the patches  could jeopardize complete and timely data submission for May 2017.  Treasury officials told us that agencies should still be able to create and  submit the required files to the broker without these patches. These  officials said that when designing the schema and broker, they chose to  use a simple file format for data submissions so that agencies would be  able to create these files without a specialized software solution. Treasury  officials acknowledged that patches will make the submission process  easier, but also pointed out that not every agency is able to take  advantage of software patches. Some agencies reported in their  implementation plan updates that they developed plans for interim  solutions to construct these files until the patches can be developed,  tested, and configured. However, some of these interim solutions rely on  manual processing, which can be burdensome and increase the risk for  errors. For example, USDA officials said that the effort to create an  interim solution has been very resource intensive. This process involved  surveying USDA\u2019s bureaus to identify how their systems are configured  and using that information to modify the financial system. HHS has also  developed an interim reporting solution that can generate the required  files without depending on a patch. However, HHS officials said this  interim solution is complex and their processes cannot be fully automated  until the Oracle patch is released. Furthermore, since these processes  are not fully automated, they carry a risk of errors being introduced  though human error. Agencies that are developing interim solutions will  only have until May 2017 to test the data before the reporting deadline.  An OMB document commended these agencies for developing robust  contingency plans since this will better position them for timely  implementation, but acknowledged that that long-term reporting solutions  are still needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Updated Design of Section 5 Pilot Meets DATA Act Requirements and Mostly Reflects Leading Practices, but the Procurement Portion Does Not Clearly Document How its Focus on Certified Payroll Reporting Will Apply to Other Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Revised Pilot Design Meets DATA Act Requirements", "paragraphs": ["As required by the DATA Act, OMB is conducting a pilot program, known  as the Section 5 Pilot, aimed at developing recommendations for reducing  reporting burden for grantees and contractors. The Section 5 Pilot has  two primary focus areas\u2014federal grants and federal contracts  (procurements). OMB partnered with HHS to design and implement the  grants portion of the pilot and with the General Services Administration  (GSA) to implement the procurement portion. As the executing agent for  the grants portion of the pilot, HHS developed six \u201ctest models\u201d to  evaluate different approaches to potentially reducing grantee reporting  burden. On the procurement portion of the pilot, OMB\u2019s Office of Federal  Procurement Policy (OFPP) worked with GSA\u2019s 18F to develop and test  a proof of concept reporting portal for reports required by the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and is piloting it with the centralized  reporting of certified payroll by contractors working construction projects  in the United States. In March 2016, a revised plan describing the  design of the grants portion of the pilot was released, which updated the  November 2015 version we previously reviewed.

Based on our review  of design documents as well as interviews with cognizant agency staff,  there has been substantial improvement in this area since our last review,  when the design lacked specifics in the procurement portion of the pilot,  which made it difficult to determine whether the design of the overall pilot  would meet these requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grants and Procurement Portions of the Pilot Partially Reflect All 5 Leading Practices for Pilot Design", "paragraphs": ["Both the grants and procurement portions of the pilot showed substantial  improvements in the extent to which they reflect leading practices for pilot  design (shown in the textbox below).

For example, in our April 2016 review we found that  the grants design lacked specific details regarding how the data will be  analyzed and how conclusions will be reached about integrating the pilot  activities into overall grant reporting efforts. Based on our feedback, OMB  and HHS developed a plan to analyze survey and other data prior to the  start of data analysis. This plan specifies the types of quantitative and  qualitative data analysis HHS intends to conduct for each test model and  how that assessment links back to the stated hypotheses.

For example, the revised procurement design identified hypotheses for  each objective and contained objectives that were linked to metrics that  should facilitate OMB\u2019s ability to collect appropriate evaluation data. The  revised design also provides additional details regarding the procurement  portion\u2019s intended assessment methodology.

However, the plan does not take the next step of clearly describing and  documenting how findings related to centralized certified payroll reporting  will be more broadly applicable to the many other types of required  reporting under the FAR beyond citing general concepts such as data  pre-population and system integration. More specifically, the current  design lacks a plan for testing the assumption that the experiences  contractors have with centralized certified payroll reporting will be similar  when they use the system to meet different reporting requirements and  other databases.

The updates were to (1) update timeline and  milestones and explain the agency\u2019s progress to date and the remaining  actions it would take to implement the act in accordance with the  suggested steps in the DATA Act Implementation Playbook (Version 2.0)  (Playbook 2.0), (2) report costs to date and estimated total future costs,  and (3) explain any new challenges and mitigation strategies.", "Treasury\u2019s DATA Act Implementation Playbook (Version 1.0) contained  eight suggested steps and a timeline for agencies to use as they began to  develop their DATA Act implementation plans. Steps 1 through 4 were to  be completed by September 2015. However, as of October 2016, only 16  of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported that they had completed all steps 1  through 4. For example, there were four agencies reporting that they had  not completed their inventory of data and identified the gaps in systems  and processes for data elements (step 3).", "DATA Act Implementation Playbook (Version 1.0) indicated that agencies  would be working on steps 5 through 8 throughout fiscal years 2016 and  2017. Playbook 2.0\u2014issued June 24, 2016\u2014includes, among other things, expanded guidance on actions to be included in steps 5 through 8.  Playbook 2.0 did not include expected timeframes for agencies to  complete each step, rather, it referred agencies to Treasury\u2019s  implementation roadmap, which includes high level milestones for  Treasury\u2019s technical deliverables. Playbook 2.0 states that agencies can  use the milestones in Treasury\u2019s implementation roadmap to help  determine their own implementation milestones. Descriptions of steps 5  through 8 from Playbook 2.0 follow:", "Step 5: Prepare Data for Submission to the Broker. This step  involves reviewing the schema version 1.0, extracting data from  source systems, mapping agency data to the schema version 1.0, and  implementing system changes as needed to collect and link data.", "Step 6: Test Broker Outputs and Ensure Data are Valid. Agencies  may use the broker to verify the data files the agency plans to submit  to Treasury. The broker uses validation rules to test the completeness  and accuracy of the data elements and linkages between financial  and award data. The broker also tests whether the data passes basic  validations within the schema version 1.0.", "Step 7: Update Data. This step involves updating information and  systems. If data does not pass validation (see Step 6), the broker will  provide error details to the agency. The agency should then reference  the authoritative data sources and address the discrepancies.", "Step 8: Submit Data. Once the data is linked, validated, and  standardized, agencies are to submit the data to Treasury for posting  on USASpending.gov or a successor system. Agency senior  accountable officials (SAO) are to provide reasonable assurance that  their internal controls support the reliability and validity of the agency  account-level and award-level data they submit to Treasury. This  assurance is to be provided quarterly with data submissions beginning  with fiscal year 2017 second quarter data. The SAO assurance  means, at a minimum, that data reported are based on appropriate  internal controls and risk management strategies identified in OMB  Circular A-123.", "Table 3 shows the information that OMB required CFO Act agencies to  include in their implementation plan updates, information on remaining  actions the agencies should take to implement suggested steps 5 through  8 in Playbook 2.0, and the number of CFO Act agencies that included the  information.", "Table 4 describes the categories of challenges reported by 19 of the 24  CFO Act agencies in their implementation plan updates and the number  of agencies reporting challenges in each category.

We recommended that the Office of Management and Budget clearly document how the results of the procurement portion of the pilot can be applied to other required federal reporting."]}
