The treaty, now in force with its 1978 protocol, includes five annexes. Annex V regulates the discharge from ships of garbage and other solid waste\u2014paper, cardboard, metal, glass, and a wide range of plastics (such as garbage bags, coffee cups, shrink wrap, and wire insulation). It prohibits the discharge of paper, cardboard, metal, and glass waste near land and in \u201cspecial\u201d areas and of plastics anywhere at sea. The treaty exempts warships and other naval vessels of the signing states, but encouraged governments to apply the pollution controls to such ships to the extent practicable. To implement the treaty, Congress passed the Act for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships in 1980. The act exempted U.S. Navy ships from its coverage. Later in 1987, Congress required the Navy to comply with the discharge requirements of Annex V by December 31, 1993. If unable to comply, the Navy was to report to Congress by December 31, 1991.", "The Navy sent its compliance report to Congress in August 1993. As required by law, the report listed (1) actions taken in response to the 1987 amendments; (2) impediments to meeting prohibitions on discharge of plastics anywhere at sea, discharge requirements of solid waste near land by December 31, 1993, and solid waste discharges in special areas; and (3) ships that cannot achieve full compliance. This report recommended changes to requirements. Specifically, the Navy requested Congress to extend the compliance deadline to December 31, 1998; permit discharge of nonplastic, nonfloating processed solid waste in special areas; and provide certain exemptions for submarines. In November 1993, Congress extended the Navy\u2019s compliance deadlines, but did not change the requirements. Specifically, the solid waste compliance date for surface ships was extended to December 31, 1998; the special area compliance date for surface ships was extended to December 31, 2000; and the submarine compliance date was extended to December 31, 2008.", "In August 1994, we provided a chronology of Navy actions to develop solid waste processing equipment. Appendix I expands and updates this chronology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initial Plans Were Not Accepted and Current Planning Lacks Specifics", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s 1993 plan assumed that it would be exempted from complying with statutory requirements in certain areas, but Congress did not approve exemptions for the Navy. As a consequence, the Navy lost valuable time that could have been used to develop a compliance plan and now must restart the process for all but plastics. Also, the Navy would benefit from establishing detailed tasks and milestones for nonplastic waste and from further investigating lessons learned from other federal agencies and commercial carriers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Planning Assumptions Were Not Accepted by Congress", "paragraphs": ["Since 1987, the Navy has put forth two separate planning proposals that were ultimately not successful and is now in the process of developing a third plan.", "In 1987, Navy officials testified before Congress that the Navy was preparing a plan to bring the Navy into compliance with future legal requirements quickly. However, Navy planning at that time envisioned compliance beyond 10 years. The Navy\u2019s 1987 Shipboard Solid and Plastics Waste Management Program Plan set two objectives. First, within 5 years, the Navy planned to reduce overboard discharges of plastics by decreasing the amount of plastics brought onboard and by segregating and storing plastics onboard. Second, by 1998\u20145 years after the date called for in the law\u2014Navy-unique versions of shipboard solid waste processing equipment would be developed and installed on Navy ships.", "In 1993, the Navy developed its second compliance plan, with no interim milestones for measuring progress toward minimizing waste. Although Congress had required the Navy to report on any inabilities to comply with discharge requirements by the end of 1991, it was not until August 1993 that the Navy reported to Congress that it could not meet the December 31, 1993, deadline. The Navy\u2019s revised plan stated that it would comply with discharge requirements by December 31, 1998. However, this was based on an assumption that Congress would revise requirements so the Navy could discharge waste overboard as long as it did not float and was not plastic.", "In the 1993 amendments to the 1980 act, Congress extended the Navy\u2019s compliance deadline, but did not grant the Navy\u2019s requested changes to the Annex V requirements. Congress also mandated some milestones. The Navy was to issue a request for proposals for the plastics processors by October 1, 1994, and to install the first production unit of the plastics processor in a Navy ship by July 1, 1996. The requirement to install processors for plastics increased from 25 percent of ships needing the processor by March 1, 1997; to 50 percent by July 1, 1997; 75 percent by July 1, 1998; and all ships needing the processor by December 31, 1998.", "In addition, the 1993 amendments required the Navy to develop its third plan by November 30, 1996. To oversee development of the plan, in April 1994, the Navy established the Shipboard Solids and Plastics Waste Steering Committee. The Committee is to facilitate preparation, agency consultation, public participation, and submittal of the plan. Thus far, with the assistance of a senior staff-level working group, the Committee has developed a work plan and a milestone schedule for preparing the final plan. Developing the plan is estimated to cost $7.5 million, principally for salaries and studies. In one study, the Center for Naval Analyses is exploring options other than Navy-unique versions of equipment.", "In developing the plan, the Navy is consulting with other federal agencies and the public to explore technologies and ideas. It will then group these alternatives into various categories, which will be subsequently analyzed. The analyses are planned to be reviewed by federal agencies beginning in late 1995 and by the public in early 1996.", "For significant portions of the Navy\u2019s compliance planning, neither specific tasks nor associated milestones accomplishing those tasks have been set. For example, the stated planning does not include a task to identify whether current non-Navy ship and Navy ship practices can be used to achieve near-term compliance with Annex V requirements. Furthermore, the Navy plans no actions until 1996, after Congress comments on its third plan. In addition, by 1996, when the Navy\u2019s plan is scheduled to be completed, the Navy will have about 4 years left to develop and install new technologies to meet requirements in special areas for surface ships, and only about 2 years in other areas.", "For submarines, the compliance date is not until 2008, but the Navy now has no tasks or milestones at all\u2014for example, to describe current practices, quantify discharges, and identify preliminary options. The Navy does not expect to identify tasks or milestones until after it submits its 1996 plan to Congress. At present, according to the Navy, a technology has not been identified that would allow submarines to comply with requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Factors Considered Unique by the Navy", "paragraphs": ["According to Navy officials, the Navy has several operational characteristics that make it distinctive. As a result of these, the Navy believes that technologies that work effectively for other federal agencies and commercial carriers are not suitable for its ships. Characteristics cited by the Navy include the following:", "Navy ships are unique because of their mission and special operating constraints.", "The ships\u2019 design and operational characteristics are different than most commercial ships.", "The Navy\u2019s mission requires that ships sustain operations at sea for long periods, including replenishment of supplies.", "Navy ships have large crews that require handling and processing a large volume of solid waste and potentially increase space constraints for waste storage.", "Navy ships normally operate in harsh environments. Therefore, waste processing equipment must be designed and constructed for sustained performance in a combat environment.", "Since Navy personnel perform most of the repairs onboard, the equipment must also require minimum maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Non-Navy Ships Have Implemented Approaches to Achieve Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Non-Navy ships are using various approaches to meet discharge requirements. These practices include incinerating plastics, compacting solid waste, and establishing shipboard recycling programs. In contrast to the Navy\u2019s 3/20-day rule, the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration prohibit discharging plastics anywhere at sea and prohibit discharging solid waste near land and in special areas.", "Although the Navy must maintain flexibility to meet its mission, our work indicates that operational characteristics cited by the Navy are not in all cases exclusive to the Navy. For example, the Coast Guard\u2019s two polar icebreaker cutters are at sea for 6 months at a time and, as well as other Coast Guard cutters, contend with limited storage space. Also, transoceanic cruise ships have trip segments exceeding 3 days, carry a large number of passengers, and generate a large volume of waste. Although the Navy\u2019s characteristics may delay its full compliance with the future requirements, we identified practices used by other federal agencies and commercial carriers that could apply to the Navy\u2019s efforts to comply with discharge requirements.", "Compaction is a key element in other federal and commercial solid waste management programs. For example, the Coast Guard plans to install 182 compactors by the end of fiscal year 1996 for solid waste onboard its cutters. In addition, officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and commercial carriers said that compaction is important in their processing of solid waste.", "Non-Navy ships\u2019 efforts to meet discharge requirements have been aided by recycling programs. For example, some commercial carriers we visited recycled plastics, glass, paper, aluminum, tin, and cardboard. Additionally, the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have agencywide recycling programs. The Coast Guard has issued an instruction establishing its shore facilities and shipboard recycling program. The Navy has an established shore-based recycling program, but its shipboard recycling effort varies by operating units."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Progress in Achieving Program Results", "paragraphs": ["Two Navy ships reported progress in compliance, and headquarters\u2019 initiatives have improved operations in some respects. Headquarters\u2019 initiatives have included such operational improvements as supply system changes to reduce the amount of wrapping materials brought onboard. However, Navy headquarters had limited coordination with fleet operating units. The headquarters primary focus has been on developing equipment that met Navy specifications, but three of its four long-term projects have been canceled, suspended, or reduced."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Two Navy Ships Reported Progress in Achieving Compliance", "paragraphs": ["USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Saratoga officials told us that they achieved compliance beyond the Navy\u2019s 3/20-day rule by compacting, storing, and offloading materials and by burning waste, including plastics. Some Navy ships burned all solid waste, including medical and dental waste. USS Theodore Roosevelt personnel said that they achieved compliance with discharge requirements in part by storing compacted materials aboard ships and offloading them at designated port reception facilities.", "The ships\u2019 strategies were affected by Navy headquarters actions during 1993. The Navy decided in March 1993 that the requirement for trash compactors no longer existed because the Navy decided that the pulper and shredder could better meet its needs. At that time, the Navy terminated its contract. In August 1993, the Navy directed fleet operating units to stop incinerating plastics at sea. Navy headquarters officials said that they discontinued burning plastics at sea due to the concerns of environmental groups represented in the Keystone Dialogue Group.", "However, the Navy provided no alternative plan with its changes, so the ships reverted to the Navy\u2019s 3/20-day rule. In a 6-month deployment that began in March 1993, the USS Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s log showed no reported plastics discharge prior to the Navy\u2019s August 1993 message prohibiting the incineration of plastics. Within days after the message, the USS Theodore Roosevelt logged periodic discharges of plastics.", "In discussing this issue, headquarters Navy officials said that the above ship was using the Navy\u2019s prototype pulper, which can process nonfood waste.

This reduction has been accomplished by product substitution and by minimizing plastic packaging and packing materials. For example, the program led to the Navy canceling a contract for 1 million plastic laundry bags, substituting paper cups for styrofoam cups, and introducing paper trash bags. Such initiatives have resulted in the Navy avoiding the acceptance of over 500,000 pounds per year of plastic items.", "Also in 1989, the Navy established a policy that Navy surface ships follow the 3/20-day rule to control plastics discharges at sea.

In 1979, the Navy\u2019s first contract to design a trash compactor was awarded. The trash compactor was to be designed to process nonindustrial and nonhazardous waste into trash slugs that sink to the bottom of the ocean. In 1985, the Navy began developing a solid waste pulper. The pulper was designed to tear and grind food, paper, and cardboard waste into a slurry of small particles that could be pumped overboard and dispersed in the sea. In 1987, the Navy began developing a plastics waste processor, which generally consists of a shredder and three compress-melt units that shred, compress, and heat plastics into solid plastic disks. The plastic disks are stored onboard ships for later landfill disposal. In 1993, the Navy began developing a metal/glass shredder. The shredder was initially designed to crush and cut metal and glass into pieces that will sink in bags to the bottom of the sea. In 1994, preproduction prototypes of the pulper, shredder, and plastics processor were installed on the USS George Washington for evaluations, which are still underway.", "Through fiscal year 1994, the Navy had appropriations of $79.8 million to research, develop, procure, and operate shipboard solid waste processing equipment (see table 1).
