For example, officials from Customs  and Border Protection\u2019s Air and Marine Operations Division stated they  consolidate O&S funds within a single account, which makes them more  responsive to mission changes. If a new mission requires a specific  aircraft capability, flexible O&S funds will support using that asset, as  opposed to another. This flexibility is also apparent in other kinds of  change or trade-offs components can make in deploying their systems.  We could not identify the frequency with which programs or operators  made these operational trade-offs because of limitations in the data we  obtained. A few examples include the following:  Asset Trade-Off: Customs and Border Protection officials told us they  manage aircraft usage to meet mission needs while remaining within the  overall O&S budget for the Integrated Operations PPA. At times, they use  a less expensive and less capable asset that can still complete the  mission as a cost-saving technique. For example, officials told us the UH- 60 Helicopter cost per flight hour is nearly three times the cost of a  smaller helicopter. The smaller aircraft does not have the same  capabilities as the UH-60, but operators can save money and sufficiently  complete the mission with this aircraft, according to officials.", "Inventory Trade-Off: Coast Guard officials responsible for maintaining  aircraft, such as the Medium Range Surveillance Aircraft, noted that  recent budget constraints affected their ability to buy sufficient spare  parts. To address this shortfall, they sometimes pulled working parts from  aircraft that were grounded and awaiting maintenance to install on aircraft  already undergoing maintenance.", "Contract or Upgrade Trade-Off: Immigration and Customs  Enforcement\u2019s TECS Modernization program requested $3 million in O&S  funding for fiscal year 2017, but the program did not receive this funding.  To mitigate this unexpected shortfall, officials described how they adapted  their contracting strategy to stretch funding through the fiscal year until  they could receive full funding in fiscal year 2018. Officials stated that  additional proposed funding cuts in fiscal year 2018 would leave the  program unable to meet its minimum operating costs. According to  officials, the program has several mitigation plans that will reduce cost  through a new contract and reductions in data housing center costs.", "Because O&S funding represents the money available to end users to  carry out their missions, we attempted to use program-level data to  identify O&S funding shortfalls for our selected programs. Potentially, this  information could also identify how frequently system users are making  these trade-offs. However, the components\u2019 use of consolidated funds for  certain programs makes O&S costs difficult to see, particularly at  Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Air and Marine Operations Division.

This document\u2019s mission-oriented reporting within the O&S section  continues to combine program-level data within PPAs, as they were for  previous budgets. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, DHS added O&S  information to the individual program funding request summaries that  appear in the procurement, construction, and improvements section of the  budget justification, which describes acquisition funding requests.  According to officials, this line shows requested funding for O&S for the  coming fiscal year and two prior years.", "Our review of the fiscal year 2018 congressional budget justification found  this information for 5 of our 11 selected programs.

Three were Coast Guard programs: the Long Range  Surveillance Aircraft program, the Medium Range Surveillance Aircraft  Program, and the National Security Cutter. Both of these components  consolidate their O&S funds, meaning they can direct available funds  based on program needs. As stated above, this practice also makes it  difficult to provide program-level O&S cost information and as a result, the  O&S information DHS added to its procurement section is blank for these  programs. This new information also does not include programs that  completed their procurement phase as DHS requests O&S funds for  programs in the deployment phase. Therefore programs in deployment  still lack clear program-level O&S data in the congressional budget  justification.

For  example, the Customs and Border Protection PPA cited above would  include multiple programs in the same way.", "Visibility of DHS\u2019s O&S costs by program is further limited in  congressional budget submissions, as personnel costs are not fully  captured. For nearly all of our selected programs, we could not identify  funding for personnel who operate and maintain program assets within  the congressional budget justification or monthly execution report.  Program officials stated that, in certain cases, personnel costs are funded  in mission\u2013oriented PPAs not clearly associated with the program.  According to officials, Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Integrated Fixed  Towers program is an example of this scenario. In other cases, the  personnel funding associated with a program appears within the same  PPA but may fund operations for more than one program. As a result, the  full O&S cost of a program\u2014inclusive of operating and supporting  personnel\u2014is not clear in the budget request and execution report.", "Federal standards for internal control state that managers should  communicate quality information to external bodies. DHS is not clearly  communicating to Congress the full O&S costs of its programs\u2014inclusive  of operating and supporting personnel\u2014in congressional budget  justifications and execution reporting. By comparison, agencies such as  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the  Department of Defense directly request individual programs\u2019 O&S costs,  at least until projects launch or begin operations in NASA\u2019s case. Further,  our best practices on capital decision making state that good budgeting  requires that the full costs of a project be considered when making  decisions to provide resources. Providing data on full program costs  permits Congress to better understand the long term costs of a program  and the budgetary and programmatic effect of its decisions.

Similar to the results of our  comprehensiveness analysis, the Next Generation Network Priority  Services program did not meet our selected accuracy criteria because it  did not include O&S costs in its LCCE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Programs Are Generally Following DHS Requirements to Update LCCEs", "paragraphs": ["While we could not determine that selected programs\u2019 LCCEs were  accurate based on the information reviewed, we found that the  department is regularly updating LCCEs, a GAO best practice that  promotes accuracy. All of the programs met DHS requirements to update  their LCCE at each acquisition decision event, as applicable, a policy that  also aligns with our cost estimating best practices. Updating LCCEs is  an important step to maintain the utility of an estimate throughout a  program\u2019s life-cycle and is critical to budget development. Outdated O&S  estimates hamper a program\u2019s ability to analyze changes in costs over  time. For example, they may not reflect fluctuation in the price of fuel,  which could lead to a program requesting insufficient funds for annual  operations. DHS relies on the programs\u2019 LCCEs to develop initial budget  requests, which it subsequently updates with actual expenditures as the  program matures.", "As of November 2017, 10 of our 11 selected programs also met DHS\u2019s  requirement for programs not yet in the deployment phase to update their  LCCEs annually. These new requirements to update LCCEs are making  this acquisition document more relevant throughout the life of a program  to inform budget requests. The Coast Guard\u2019s Long Range Surveillance  Aircraft program is the only program we selected that did not meet this  requirement for fiscal year 2017. Coast Guard officials explained that the  program is in the process of revising its LCCE, which is why it did not  have a submission within fiscal year 2017.", "While components are following DHS policy, programs may vary in their  approach to updating O&S reporting elements as newer versions of the  LCCE document are developed and approved. For about half of our  programs, we observed changes to O&S cost elements in the LCCE,  which can reflect program changes. This situation is consistent with our  cost estimating best practices, which note that cost elements should be  updated as changes occur and the program becomes better defined. For  example, the Coast Guard\u2019s Medium Range Surveillance Aircraft  program\u2019s original LCCE was completed in 2009, when the Coast Guard  planned to procure a single aircraft type. Since then, the Coast Guard  revised its LCCE in 2012 and 2016 to account for changes to the  program, namely the addition of a second aircraft type. The Medium  Range Surveillance Aircraft program\u2019s 2016 LCCE now includes an  entirely new set of O&S cost elements for both aircraft. Conversely, a  program that has very stable cost elements may not need to make such  changes. Officials from Customs and Border Protection TECS  Modernization program explained they did not alter its cost elements  between its original 2014 LCCE and its 2016 revision because O&S costs  are stable and well-known as the program enters its deployment phase."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Operations and Support (O&S) is the bulk of the taxpayer\u2019s investment in  major acquisition programs and is necessary to meet end user\u2019s needs  for spares, maintenance, and operations. To support this mission, DHS  manages its budget to maximize components\u2019 flexibility to use O&S funds  across major acquisition programs. This aspect of the department\u2019s  budget management did not change with enactment of the common  appropriation structure.", "We do not take issue with DHS\u2019s mission-oriented budget management  approach; however, with this reliance on broader O&S mission-oriented  program/project activity (PPAs) in reporting, program-specific O&S  information is difficult to discern. DHS\u2019s addition of program-level O&S  information to the procurement, construction, and improvements section  of the congressional budget justification is a positive step, but still does  not address this shortfall for all programs. The identifier pilot program  DHS has underway could add details on O&S costs for major acquisition  programs in addition to those already contained in programs\u2019 life-cycle  cost estimates. Such an action will require additional reporting from the  components, which may be challenging due to the department\u2019s  fragmented financial management systems, as we have observed and  made recommendations on in prior reports. DHS could work with  Congress to identify ways to strengthen its congressional budget  justifications and monthly execution reports by including information on  O&S costs.", "DHS\u2019s recent proposal to shift back to reporting program-level O&S  funding in the Future Years Homeland Security Program report  demonstrates that the department sees value in providing such  information to Congress and that such information is available to some  extent.
