The programs associated with these 15 agencies accounted for $132 billion (or about 96 percent) of the reported $136.7 billion government-wide improper payment estimate for fiscal year 2015. In addition, the inconsistent IG compliance determinations in the IGs' fiscal year 2015 IPERA compliance reports may present potentially misleading information. Specifically, certain IGs reported compliance based on the presence or absence of the required analysis or reporting, regardless of whether the IGs identified flaws, whereas certain other IGs reported agencies as noncompliant based on their performance of some degree of evaluative procedures to determine whether the analysis or reporting that the agency produced was substantively adequate. While the severity of the IGs' findings may have resulted in the IGs reporting noncompliance for some agencies, similar findings were identified for both the compliant and noncompliant agencies. IPERA and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance does not specify what, if any, evaluative procedures should be conducted as part of the IGs' compliance determinations. The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), which represents the IGs, has also not issued such guidance.", "IGs reported programs at 7 agencies as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years as of the end of fiscal year 2015 and, as a result, were required to submit certain information to Congress.

When agencies do not submit the required information, Congress may lack the information necessary to effectively monitor the implementation of IPERA and take action to address problematic programs in a timely manner.", "The IGs' IPERA compliance reviews serve a key function: to reasonably assure that federal dollars are not misspent and that improper payment estimates are accurate, reliable, and complete. To that end, 20 of the 24 IGs reported in their fiscal year 2015 IPERA compliance reports that they also performed one or more optional procedures, which included evaluating the accuracy and completeness of their agencies' reporting.

The focus of this review is fiscal year 2015, and for that  year 122 agency programs reported estimated improper payments  totaling $136.7 billion. It is important to note that these estimates  themselves may not be accurate, reliable, or complete, as we have  reported that the federal government is unable to determine the full extent  of improper payments and to reasonably assure that actions are taken to  reduce them. In addition, certain inspectors general (IG) have reported  issues with agencies\u2019 reported improper payment estimates because of  insufficient sampling methods and flawed estimation methodologies were  used to calculate and report improper payment estimates. Fiscal year  2015 marked the fifth year of the implementation of the Improper  Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), which, among  other things, requires federal agencies\u2019 IGs to annually assess and report  on whether the agencies under their jurisdiction complied with the six  criteria listed in IPERA.

Specifically, this  report discusses the following:  1.  A summary of IPERA compliance determinations by the IGs for the  24 agencies listed in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as  amended (CFO Act), including the extent to which the agencies  complied with the criteria listed in IPERA for fiscal years 2011 through  2015 as reported by their IGs; the criteria and programs the IGs  concluded were responsible for agency noncompliance and the  number of programs that were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more  consecutive years as of fiscal year 2015; and the extent to which the  responsible agencies submitted the required information to Congress.  2.  The extent to which the IGs reported that they performed optional  procedures during their fiscal year 2015 reviews, as outlined in Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance.  3.  The extent to which the IGs\u2019 fiscal years 2011 through 2015 IPERA  compliance reports included recommendations and the status of these  recommendations as of December 31, 2016, and for the open  recommendations associated with noncompliant agencies, the extent  to which the recommendations were designed to address agencies\u2019  noncompliance with one or more of the six IPERA criteria.", "To determine the number of CFO Act agencies (hereafter referred to as  agencies) and programs that were reported as compliant or noncompliant  under IPERA, including those reported as noncompliant for 3 or more  consecutive years as of fiscal year 2015, we reviewed the fiscal years  2011 through 2015 reports prepared by the IGs at the 24 agencies and  summarized their findings and conclusions. We selected these  24 agencies because they represented over 99 percent of the  government-wide improper payment estimate in fiscal year 2015. To  determine if agencies submitted the required information to Congress to  address consecutive reported noncompliance, we interviewed officials  from the Offices of Chief Financial Officer at relevant agencies and  reviewed supporting documentation. Additionally, we reviewed the  improper payments information reported in the agencies\u2019 fiscal years  2015 and 2016 agency financial reports (AFR) or performance and  accountability reports (PAR) to determine the total improper payment  estimate reported for the 24 agencies. To determine the extent to which  the IGs performed any optional procedures as outlined in OMB guidance,  we reviewed the IGs\u2019 fiscal year 2015 reports. In addition, to determine  the number and status of the IGs\u2019 recommendations, we reviewed the  IGs\u2019 fiscal years 2011 through 2015 IPERA compliance reports and  obtained recommendation status information from the IGs. Additionally,  we reviewed and categorized the IGs\u2019 open recommendations, as of  December 31, 2016, to determine whether the IGs associated with the  15 noncompliant agencies had recommended actions designed to  address the agencies\u2019 noncompliance with one or more of the six IPERA  criteria.

The amended legislation  requires executive branch agencies to (1) review all programs and  activities and identify those that may be susceptible to significant  improper payments (commonly referred to as a risk assessment),   (2) publish improper payment estimates for those programs and activities  that the agency identified as being susceptible to significant improper  payments, (3) implement corrective actions to reduce improper payments  and set reduction targets, and (4) report on the results of addressing the  foregoing requirements.", "In addition to the agencies\u2019 identifying programs and activities that are  susceptible to significant improper payments, OMB also designates as  high-priority the programs with the most egregious cases of improper  payments. Specifically, OMB is required by IPERIA to annually identify a  list of high-priority federal programs in need of greater oversight and  review. In general, OMB has implemented this requirement by  designating high-priority programs based on a threshold of $750 million in  estimated improper payments for a given fiscal year.", "IPERA calls for executive agencies\u2019 IGs to annually determine and report  on whether their respective agencies complied with the following six  criteria: publish a report in the form and content required by OMB\u2014typically  an AFR or a PAR\u2014for the most recent fiscal year, and post that report  on the agency website;  conduct a program-specific risk assessment for each program or  activity; publish improper payment estimates for all programs and activities  deemed susceptible to significant improper payments under the  agency\u2019s risk assessment; publish corrective action plans for those programs and activities  assessed to be at risk for significant improper payments; publish and meet annual reduction targets for all programs and  activities assessed to be at risk for significant improper payments; and  report a gross improper payment rate of less than 10 percent for each  program and activity for which an improper payment estimate was  published.", "IPERA states that if an IG reports that an agency is not in compliance  with any of the IPERA criteria for 1 fiscal year, the agency head must  submit a plan to appropriate congressional committees and OMB  describing the actions that the agency will take to come into compliance.  If an agency is found noncompliant with respect to the same program for  2 consecutive years, IPERA directs OMB to review the program and  determine if additional funding would help bring the program into  compliance and, if so, directs the agency to use any available  reprogramming or transfer authority, or request further reprogramming or  transfer authority from Congress, to aid in the program\u2019s remediation  efforts. For programs determined to be noncompliant for more than  3 consecutive years, IPERA requires the agency to submit to Congress  within 30 days of the IG\u2019s report either (1) a reauthorization proposal for  the program or (2) proposed statutory changes necessary to bring the  program or activity into compliance. Because the legal requirement to  report to Congress is triggered by the IG reporting noncompliance, rather  than the noncompliance itself, agencies are not subject to the  congressional reporting requirement until their IGs report their  determinations. In addition, as we previously reported, when agencies  determine that reauthorization or statutory changes are not considered  necessary to bring the programs into compliance, the agencies should  state so in their letters to Congress.", "Furthermore, IPERIA requires the IGs at agencies with OMB-designated  high-priority programs to perform additional procedures. OMB also  provides guidance, in OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C (OMB M-15- 02), to the IGs regarding their annual IPERA compliance reports. This  guidance restates the statutory requirements and adds procedures that  the IGs are encouraged to adopt at their discretion during their annual  IPERA reviews (hereafter referred to as optional procedures). It is  important to note that some of the optional procedures outlined in OMB  guidance are similar to those required for programs designated by OMB  as high-priority; however, whether to perform such procedures for   non-high-priority programs is up to the IGs.

The remaining agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA), had not submitted the required information to Congress, despite  our prior recommendation, as well as USDA IG recommendations, to do  so. Specifically, 5 USDA programs were reported as noncompliant for at  least 3 consecutive years as of fiscal year 2015.

However, almost 3 years later, USDA has still not  issued the letter. The USDA OCFO stated that it plans to submit the  required information for all 5 programs by the end of fiscal year 2017.  However, IPERA and OMB guidance calls for the information to be  submitted within 30 days of the IG\u2019s reported noncompliance.

Specifically, as shown in figure 6, noncompliance with the IPERA criterion  to publish and meet annual improper payment reduction targets has been  the primary reason agencies were reported as noncompliant by their  respective IGs for 5 consecutive years. For instance, for fiscal years 2011  through 2015, IGs reported that 11 agencies did not comply with this  criterion. Of these 11 noncompliant agencies, 8 agencies have been  noncompliant with this criterion every year since fiscal year 2011. While  the IGs generally reported that agencies published reduction targets for  applicable programs, the targets were regularly not met as the actual  rates exceed the targets.", "Although reported noncompliance for several IPERA criteria increased or  stayed the same in fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014, the  total instances of noncompliance (i.e., sum of all instances of IG-reported  agency noncompliance for all six IPERA criteria) has declined since  IPERA was first implemented in fiscal year 2011, as noted in figure 7.  Specifically, in fiscal year 2011, the IGs reported 38 total instances of  noncompliance for all six IPERA criteria, compared to 28 reported  instances of noncompliance in fiscal year 2015.", "Although agencies\u2019 continued noncompliance is concerning, we have  previously reported that an agency\u2019s failure to meet reduction targets and  report improper payment rates below 10 percent may not necessarily  suggest that the agency failed to adequately monitor its programs\u2019  improper payments. For example, certain IGs reported increases in improper payment rates because of factors such as improved sampling  and emphasis on training, which enhanced their agencies\u2019 ability to detect  improper payments. Specifically, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  IG reported in its fiscal year 2015 report that 2 VA programs\u2014Community  Care and Purchased Long-Term Services and Support\u2014reported  improper payment rates of 54.77 percent and 59.14 percent, respectively.  According to the VA IG, these rates were significantly higher than those in  the prior year when both programs reported improper payment rates  slightly below 10 percent. According to the VA IG, the dramatic increase  in improper payment rates for the 2 programs occurred primarily because  of improved sample evaluation procedures in fiscal year 2015, which  resulted in more improper payments being identified. Significant  improvements in sampling, training, and the ability to detect improper  payments could considerably reduce the likelihood that an agency will  meet a predetermined reduction target or report an improper payment  rate below 10 percent.", "As previously discussed, for the past 5 years, IGs reported that there  were 11 agencies that did not meet the IPERA criterion that required  agencies to publish and meet reduction targets. For fiscal year 2015, 4 of  the 11 agencies\u2014the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of  Education (Education), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and  Social Security Administration (SSA)\u2014that did not meet reduction targets  were compliant with the remaining five IPERA criteria. Therefore, once  these 4 agencies implement the necessary controls to prevent and detect  improper payments, they may be able to meet their reduction targets,  which in turn, could result in these 4 agencies becoming compliant under  IPERA overall in future years. Furthermore, 3 other agencies\u2014the  Department of Labor (DOL), VA, and Small Business Administration  (SBA)\u2014out of the 11 that did not meet reduction targets were reported by  their IGs as being noncompliant with only one other IPERA criterion (to  report improper payment rates below 10 percent). Therefore, these  3 agencies may also become compliant under IPERA once they  implement the necessary controls to prevent and detect improper  payments, as they may be able to meet their reduction targets and report  improper payment rates below 10 percent.

Some IGs reported compliance based on the presence or absence of the  required analysis or reporting (hereafter referred to as a pass/fail  determination by the IG), regardless of whether the IGs identified flaws,  whereas other IGs reported agencies as noncompliant based on the IGs  performing some degree of evaluative procedures to determine whether  the agencies\u2019 analyses or reports were substantively adequate (hereafter  referred to as a determination based on evaluative procedures). IPERA  does not clearly indicate whether, for example, an IG should report an  agency as compliant under the criteria regarding publication of improper  payment estimates if the agency reports an improper payment estimate  that is based on a flawed methodology. While we recognize that the  severity of the issues may have resulted in the IGs\u2019 reporting  noncompliance for some agencies, we found, as noted in some of the  examples below, the types of issues identified for both the compliant and  noncompliant agencies were similar.", "IPERA criterion: Publish an AFR or PAR. One IG reported its  respective agency as noncompliant with this criterion. While this IG  reported the Department of Transportation (DOT) noncompliant as a  result of finding issues with improper payment information included in  the AFR (i.e., noncompliance based on evaluative procedures), six  other IGs reported their respective agencies\u2014the Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Department of State (State),  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA), General Services Administration  (GSA), and Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\u2014as compliant  despite finding similar issues with the improper payment information  included in the agencies\u2019 published AFRs or PARs (i.e., compliance  based on pass/fail determinations). For example, the DOT IG reported  noncompliance with this criterion as a result of identified issues with  the outlays reported in DOT\u2019s AFR, which is the same issue that was  identified by another IG that reported its agency (GSA) as compliant.  As shown in table 1, if the IGs consistently determined compliance  with this IPERA criterion based on pass/fail determinations or based  on evaluative procedures, the number of agencies reported as  noncompliant with this IPERA criterion could have decreased by 1  (from 1 agency to none) or increased by 6 (from 1 to 7 agencies),  respectively.", "IPERA criterion: Conduct program-specific risk assessments. Four  IGs reported their respective agencies as noncompliant with this  criterion. One of the 4 IGs reported its agency, the Department of the  Interior (DOI), as noncompliant because the agency did not prepare a  required risk assessment (i.e., compliance based on pass/fail  determinations). The remaining 3 IGs reported their respective  agencies\u2014the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  HUD, and OPM\u2014as noncompliant based on identified issues with the  risk assessments (i.e., noncompliance based on evaluative  procedures). However, 6 other IGs reported their respective  agencies\u2014EPA, GSA, NASA, the National Science Foundation  (NSF), State, and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)\u2014as  compliant despite finding similar issues with the risk assessments  (i.e., compliance based on pass/fail determinations). For example, 2  IGs reported that their respective agencies (HUD and OPM) were  noncompliant with the IPERA risk assessment criterion as a result of  their agencies not considering all nine required risk factors, as  outlined in OMB guidance, during program-specific risk assessments,  whereas another IG reported its agency (NSF) as compliant with this  IPERA criterion, despite also finding issues with the agency\u2019s  consideration of the nine required risk factors. In addition, although  the State IG reported that the qualitative risk assessments conducted  by State included an evaluation of the nine risk factors required by  OMB, the State IG also reported that the agency could have improved  its risk assessment process regarding one of the nine risk factors\u2014 significant increases in funding. Specifically, the State IG reported that  there was a deficiency with State\u2019s process for identifying programs  with significant funding changes. The State IG recommended that  State expand its process to identify programs with significant funding  changes to consider additional factors that may increase the risk of  significant improper payments, including, at a minimum, the  percentage increase of the change. According to the State IG, if the  State\u2019s risk assessment process does not consider the percentage  increase, then the agency may not identify all programs that had  increased risks of improper payments because of increased funding.  For example, the State IG stated that a program that had  expenditures of $101 million in year one and experienced an increase  in expenditures of $99 million (98 percent) in year two would not meet  the $100 million threshold and, as a result, would not be identified as  a program with significant funding changes, which would require a risk  assessment. As shown in table 1, if the IGs consistently determined  noncompliance with this IPERA criterion based on pass/fail  determinations or based on evaluative procedures, the number of  agencies reported as noncompliant with this IPERA criterion could  have decreased by 3 (from 4 to 1 agencies) or increased by 6 (from 4  to 10 agencies), respectively.", "IPERA criterion: Publish improper payment estimates. This criterion  did not apply to 5 agencies. For the remaining 19 agencies, 5  agencies were reported as noncompliant with this criterion. Two of  these agencies (GSA and HHS) were reported as noncompliant  because the agencies did not publish required estimates (i.e.,  compliance based on pass/fail determinations), and the remaining  3 agencies (USDA, DOI, and OPM) were reported as noncompliant  because of identified issues with their estimates (i.e., noncompliance  based on evaluative procedures). While the IGs for these 3 agencies  reported noncompliance as a result of identified issues with the  estimates, there were 6 other IGs that reported their respective  agencies (DOD, DOL, Education, HUD, SBA, and VA) were compliant  despite finding similar issues with the estimates (i.e., compliance  based on pass/fail determinations). For example, 1 IG (USDA)  reported that its respective agency was noncompliant with the IPERA  improper payment estimate criterion because the agency was not  using sufficient sampling methods to report improper payment  estimates, whereas another IG (Education) reported its agency as  compliant with the same IPERA criterion, despite reporting that its  agency used flawed estimation methodologies to calculate its  estimates. As shown in table 1, if the IGs consistently determined  noncompliance with this IPERA criterion based on pass/fail  determinations or based on evaluative procedures, the number of  agencies reported as noncompliant with this IPERA criterion could  have decreased by 3 (from 5 to 2 agencies) or increased by 6 (from 5  to 11 agencies), respectively.", "IPERA criterion: Publish corrective action plans. This criterion did not  apply to 9 agencies. Of the remaining 15 agencies, 1 (HHS) was  reported as noncompliant with this criterion because it did not publish  a corrective action plan for one of its eight risk-susceptible programs.  Although we did not find any instances of IGs reporting  noncompliance as a result of identified issues with the corrective  action plans, we identified 5 IGs that reported their respective  agencies (DOD, GSA, OPM, USDA, and HUD) as compliant despite  finding issues with the corrective action plans (i.e., compliance based  on pass/fail determinations). For example, 1 IG reported that its  respective agency was compliant with this IPERA criterion, but the IG  also reported that the agency\u2019s corrective action plans did not explain  how it addressed the root causes identified and did not include  planned or actual completion dates of the actions. As shown in  table 1, if the IGs consistently determined noncompliance with this  IPERA criterion based on evaluative procedures, the number of  agencies reported as noncompliant with this IPERA criterion could  have increased by 5 (from 1 to 6 agencies). There would be no  changes to the number of agencies reported as noncompliant if such  determinations were made based on pass/fail basis, as the 1 IG would  have still reported its agency as noncompliant for failing to publish a  corrective action plan.", "For the two remaining IPERA criteria, which required agencies to publish  and meet reduction targets and report improper payment rates below  10 percent, we found that the IGs consistently made pass/fail  determinations. Specifically, 11 agencies were reported as noncompliant  because they each had at least 1 program that did not meet its reduction  target, and 6 agencies were reported as noncompliant because they had  at least 1 program that did not report an improper payment rate below  10 percent. As a result, for these two IPERA criteria, table 1 shows no  differences between the original IG noncompliance determinations and  the potential noncompliance results if determinations were consistently  based on pass/fail or evaluative procedures.", "We believe that the variations in the IGs\u2019 determinations reduce their  usefulness for comparing compliance and progress across agencies. As  shown in table 1, compliance results could change significantly if the IGs  consistently determined compliance by performing either pass/fail determinations or the evaluative procedures that some IGs use, which we  describe in this report. Specifically, if the IGs had all performed IPERA  compliance determinations based on pass/fail determinations, the number  of noncompliant agencies could decrease by 1 agency (OPM), from 15 to  14 agencies. In addition, the total instances of noncompliance for all six  IPERA criteria could have been 21 as compared to 28 instances as  originally reported by the IGs. Alternatively, if the IGs had consistently  determined compliance based on the evaluative procedures some IGs  used, the number of noncompliant agencies could have been over   one-third higher\u2014an increase of 4 noncompliant agencies (State, EPA,  NASA, and NSF), for a total 19 noncompliant agencies for fiscal year  2015. Also, the number of instances of noncompliance for all six IPERA  criteria could increase from the originally reported 28 instances to  51 instances.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should establish measurable objectives that are stated in a  form that permits reasonably consistent measurement.

In addition, there are no specific requirements for IGs  to be consistent with one another when determining agency compliance.

To put  this in perspective, in fiscal year 2015, there were 122 programs that  published improper payment estimates, and OMB designated 16 of those  programs as high-priority programs. Therefore, only those 16 programs  were required to undergo the IGs\u2019 evaluations of their risk assessments  and improper payment estimates (two IPERA criteria). While $127 billion  of the $136.7 billion fiscal year 2015 government-wide improper payment  estimate was attributable to the 16 OMB-designated high-priority  programs, there was $9.7 billion in reported estimated improper payments  for the remaining programs that are not considered high-priority. Although  the IGs were not required to perform annual evaluative procedures to  identify issues with the agencies\u2019 risk assessments and estimation  methodologies for the non-high-priority programs, as noted in figure 8,  some IGs elected to perform these evaluative procedures for such  programs. OMB staff stated that they believe that performing evaluative  procedures is beneficial to addressing government-wide improper  payments, and, for that reason, they encourage IGs to do more  substantive, in-depth work during their annual IPERA compliance  reviews.", "The following examples provide additional details regarding the IGs\u2019  performance of these optional procedures:", "Evaluation of agency\u2019s risk assessment(s) for non-high-priority  programs: As noted in figure 8, we found that 11 IGs reported that  they evaluated the agency\u2019s program-specific risk assessment(s). Of  these 11 agencies, we identified 3 IGs (USDA, Treasury, and NASA)  that performed their own independent risk assessments and/or  analysis and, as a result, identified additional agency programs that  they believed should have been identified as susceptible to significant  improper payments during the agencies\u2019 own risk assessments. As a  result of performing this optional procedure, certain IGs recommended that the agencies revise their program-specific risk assessment  processes to reduce the risk of the agencies not identifying all  programs susceptible to significant improper payments. The  recommended improvements included revising the processes to  include factors such as quantitative assessments in addition to (or  instead of) qualitative assessments.", "Evaluation of agency\u2019s estimation methodologies for non-high-priority  programs: As noted in figure 8, we found that 10 IGs reported that  they evaluated the quality of the agencies\u2019 improper payment  estimates and methodologies for certain non-high-priority programs.  Specifically, we found that these IGs reported that the published  improper payment estimate for at least 1 agency program was  unreliable because the agencies used inaccurate data, incomplete  data, or insufficient sampling methodologies. As a result of performing  this optional procedure, certain IGs provided recommendations to  help the agencies improve the precision of their improper payment  estimates, such as using improved sampling methodology prepared  by a trained statistician.", "Evaluation of the accuracy and completeness of agency reporting: As  noted in figure 8, this was the most frequently performed optional  procedure. Specifically, we found that 15 of the 24 IGs reported that  they evaluated the accuracy and completeness of their agencies\u2019  reporting on improper payments. Specifically, we found most of these  IGs reported that they identified errors in improper payment-related  information in the agencies\u2019 published AFRs. As a result of performing  this optional procedure, these IGs provided recommendations to help  the agencies improve the accuracy of the improper payment-related  information published in their reports, such as recommending that the  agencies implement additional internal controls.", "Evaluation of agencies\u2019 performance in recapturing improper  payments: As noted in figure 8, we found that 9 IGs reported that they  evaluated their agencies\u2019 efforts to recapture improper payments and  in some cases found that more improper payments were actually  recaptured by the agencies than the agencies reported. Specifically,  certain agencies\u2019 summaries of recaptured improper payments failed  to include all identified and recaptured improper payments identified  through sources outside of the agencies\u2019 recapture audits, such as  those payments identified through IG audits. As a result of performing  this optional procedure, these IGs made recommendations to help the  agencies improve the accuracy and completeness in reporting of their  recaptured payments, such as recommending that the agencies  develop written policies and procedures detailing the process for  reporting overpayments identified and recaptured from sources  outside of payment recapture audits.", "Evaluation of agency corrective action plans: As noted in figure 8, we  found that 6 IGs reported that they determined whether their agencies\u2019  corrective action plans were (1) robust and focused on the appropriate  root causes of improper payments, (2) effectively implemented, and  (3) prioritized within the agency.

One potential reason for the significant difference in the  number of recommendations per agency could be the extent to which the  agencies were compliant under IPERA over the past 5 years. For  example, NRC has been reported as compliant for the past 5 years,  whereas HUD has been reported as noncompliant for the past 3 years.", "As noted in figure 10, there were 105 recommendations open as of  December 31, 2016. While the majority of the open recommendations  were made in the past 2 years, and the agencies may not have had  sufficient time to implement the necessary corrective actions, there was  1 recommendation from fiscal year 2011 that was still open at the time of  our review. Specifically, in the HHS IG\u2019s fiscal year 2011 IPERA  compliance report issued in March 2012, the HHS IG recommended that  HHS develop an improper payment estimate (one of the six IPERA  criteria) for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)  program and, if necessary, seek statutory authority to require state  participation in such a measurement. In the HHS IG\u2019s fiscal year 2015  IPERA compliance report issued in May 2016, the HHS IG made another  recommendation for HHS to publish an estimate for TANF. Specifically,  the IG recommended that HHS continue to work with OMB to implement  one of the OMB-suggested potential alternative approaches to reporting  on TANF improper payments in fiscal year 2016.", "According to HHS\u2019s fiscal year 2016 AFR, issued in November 2016,  HHS plans to encourage Congress to consider statutory modifications  that would affect the development of an improper payment estimate when  legislation is considered to reauthorize TANF. In addition, in a June 2016  letter to Congress, HHS stated that it wanted to work with Congress to  address a set of issues concerning the TANF program related to  accountability and how funds are used. Until HHS develops an improper  payment estimate for TANF, HHS will continue to be reported as  noncompliant with the IPERA criteria that agencies publish improper  payment estimates and corrective action plans for all susceptible  programs. Based on the HHS IG\u2019s fiscal year 2015 compliance report,  HHS was noncompliant with five of the six IPERA criteria; however, its  noncompliance with the IPERA criteria to publish an improper payment  estimate and publish a corrective action plan was based on the TANF  program only.", "The open recommendations address a number of improper payment  issues, including compliance under IPERA. We reviewed the open  recommendations for the 15 agencies reported as noncompliant for fiscal  year 2015, and as shown in figure 11, we found that agencies generally  had open recommendations for each of the IPERA criteria for which they  were reported as noncompliant. If the agencies take the necessary  corrective actions to address the IGs\u2019 open recommendations, the  number of noncompliant agencies could decrease in future fiscal years, if  no new compliance issues arise. In addition, as shown in figure 11,  recommendations designed to address noncompliance with certain  IPERA criteria were closed by some of the IGs after their fiscal year 2015  IPERA compliance reports were issued. Although these agencies may  have taken corrective actions that resulted in the IGs closing the  recommendations, the compliance results for these agencies for fiscal  year 2016 were not published at the time of our review.", "As noted in figure 11, the 3 agencies (DOL, SBA, and Treasury) that did  not report improper payment rates below 10 percent either submitted  plans to address noncompliance to Congress or submitted proposed  statutory changes. For example, in June 2015, Treasury submitted  proposed statutory changes to reduce the improper payment rate of the  Earned Income Tax Credit program, which reported an estimated  improper payment rate of 23.8 percent in fiscal year 2015. Specifically,  according to the Treasury IG\u2019s fiscal year 2015 IPERA compliance report,  the proposed statutory change would help prevent the improper issuance  of billions of dollars in refunds as it would provide the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) with expanded authority to systematically correct erroneous  claims that are identified when tax returns are processed, which,  according to Treasury, would allow the IRS to deny erroneous Earned  Income Tax Credit refund claims before they are paid. However, as of  March 2017, legislation had not been enacted to provide Treasury with  this authority.", "Related to its noncompliance with the IPERA criterion to report an  improper payment rate below 10 percent, DOL submitted a legislative  proposal in October 2016 to make changes to the federal-state  unemployment compensation system to help reduce improper payments.  DOL\u2019s Unemployment Insurance program was its only program that  reported an improper payment rate over 10 percent, and that program  was compliant with the remaining IPERA criteria. However, as of March  2017, legislation had not been enacted to make changes to the   federal-state unemployment compensation system. Related to SBA\u2019s  fiscal year 2015 noncompliance with the IPERA criterion to report an  improper payment rate below 10 percent, its IG noted that the improper  payment rate for one program (Disbursements for Goods and Services)  increased from 8.46 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 13.52 percent in fiscal  year 2015. Although the IG did not issue a recommendation in its fiscal  year 2015 IPERA compliance report to address such noncompliance, the  IG reported that SBA submitted a letter to Congress and OMB detailing  how it would become compliant under IPERA.
