It is estimated that criminals smuggle $18 billion to $39 billion a year in bulk cash across the southwest border. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is responsible for reducing the risk of cross-border smuggling of funds through the use of devices called stored value, such as prepaid cards. GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent of actions taken by CBP to stem the flow of bulk cash leaving the country and any challenges that remain, (2) the regulatory gaps, if any, of cross-border reporting and other anti-money laundering requirements of stored value, and (3) if gaps exist, the extent to which FinCEN has addressed them. To conduct its work, GAO observed outbound operations at five land ports of entry. GAO also reviewed statutes, rules, and other information for stored value. This is a public version of a law enforcement sensitive report that GAO issued in September 2010. Information CBP deemed sensitive has been redacted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In March 2009, CBP created an Outbound Enforcement Program aimed at stemming the flow of bulk cash leaving the country, but further actions could be taken to address program challenges. Under the program, CBP inspects travelers leaving the country at all 25 land ports of entry along the southwest border. On the Northern border, inspections are conducted at the discretion of the Port Director. From March 2009 through June 2010, CBP seized about $41 million in illicit bulk cash leaving the country at land ports of entry. Stemming the flow of bulk cash, however, is a difficult and challenging task. For example, CBP is unable to inspect every traveler leaving the country at land ports of entry and smugglers of illicit goods have opportunities to circumvent the inspection process. Other challenges involve limited technology, infrastructure, and procedures to support outbound operations. CBP is in the early phases of this program and has not yet taken some actions to gain a better understanding of how well the program is working, such as gathering data for measuring program costs and benefits. By gathering data for measuring expected program costs and benefits, CBP could be in a better position to weigh the costs of any proposed expansion of the outbound inspection program against likely outcomes. Regulatory gaps of cross-border reporting and other anti-money laundering requirements exist with the use of stored value. For example, travelers must report transporting more than $10,000 in monetary instruments or currency at one time when leaving the country, but FinCEN does not have a similar requirement for travelers transporting stored value. Similarly, certain anti-money laundering regulations, such as reports on suspicious activities, do not apply to the entire stored value industry. The nature and extent of the use of stored value for cross-border currency smuggling and other illegal activities remains unknown, but federal law enforcement agencies are concerned about its use. FinCEN is developing regulations, as required by the Credit CARD Act of 2009, to address gaps in regulations related to the use of stored value for criminal purposes, but much work remains. FinCEN has not developed a management plan that includes, among other things, target dates for completing the regulations. Developing such a plan could help FinCEN better manage its rulemaking effort. When it issues the regulations, law enforcement agencies and FinCEN may be challenged in ensuring compliance by travelers and industry. For example, FinCEN will be responsible for numerous tasks including issuing guidance for compliance examiners, revising the way in which it tracks suspicious activities related to stored value, and addressing gaps in anti-money laundering regulations for off-shore entities that issue and sell stored value."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CBP, among other things, gather data on program costs and benefits and that FinCEN develop a plan, including target dates, to better manage its rulemaking process. CBP and FinCEN concurred with these recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Moving illegal proceeds across our nation\u2019s borders presents a significant  threat to national security.  Mexican drug trafficking organizations,  terrorist organizations, and other groups with malevolent intent finance  their operations by moving funds into or out of the United States.  For  example, a common technique used for taking proceeds from drug sales in  the United States to Mexico is a method known as bulk cash smuggling.   Smuggling methods can involve taking bulk cash by private or commercial  vehicles through land ports of entry, by private plane or boat through air  and sea ports of entry, or through other means, including underground  tunnels, parcels sent by mail, or by foot between ports of entry.  Because  of its clandestine nature, the extent of bulk cash smuggling is difficult to  quantify with any certainty.  The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC)  estimates that proceeds from drug trafficking generated in this country are  smuggled across the southwest border and the proceeds total between $18  billion and $39 billion a year.  NDIC also estimates that Canadian drug  trafficking organizations smuggle significant amounts of cash across the  Northern border from proceeds of drugs sold in the United States.  In the  largest known case of bulk cash smuggling, over two tons of currency,  mostly in $100 banknotes, totaling $205 million was seized in Mexico City  in 2007.  In addition to bulk cash smuggling, 21st century methods and  technologies of laundering money have emerged.  In 2009, the NDIC stated  that new financial products and technologies present unique opportunities  for money launderers as well as unprecedented challenges to the  intelligence, law enforcement, and regulatory communities.  Among other  money laundering techniques, NDIC and others cited the use of prepaid  cards or gift cards that are loaded with currency or value\u2014also called  stored value\u2014as presenting a compact and easily transportable method  that has been used to move money into and out of the United States.  U.S.  law enforcement officials agree that stored value is an emerging cash  alternative for legitimate consumers and criminals alike.", "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\u2014a major component in the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014is the lead federal agency in  charge of securing our nation\u2019s borders.  CBP carries out its responsibility  by, among other things, inspecting travelers at land, air, and sea ports of  entry.  In March 2009, the Secretary of Homeland Security called on CBP  to help stem the flow of bulk cash and weapons moving south by  inspecting travelers leaving the United States for Mexico.  As a result of  this request, CBP increased its effort to stem the flow of bulk cash  smuggling.  This effort\u2014called outbound operations\u2014expanded CBP\u2019s  primary mission of inspecting travelers who seek to enter the United  States.  In addition to addressing the threat of bulk cash and arms that  leave the country, CBP outbound operations may also, among other things,  identify and pursue criminals or fugitives attempting to flee the country  and travelers who attempt to take stolen vehicles across the border.   CBP\u2019s responsibility for inspecting travelers who leave the country is a  difficult task because it must also facilitate the cross-border movement of  legitimate travelers and billions of dollars in international trade.", "The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\u2014a bureau in the  Department of the Treasury\u2014seeks to deter and detect criminal activity  and safeguard the financial system from the risk that terrorists and other  criminals may fund their operations through financial institutions in the  United States.  Among other things, FinCEN is responsible for  administering certain laws aimed at preventing criminals from abusing  financial systems in the United States.", "Given the important role that CBP and FinCEN play in national security,  you asked us to review the progress that they have made in stemming the  flow of bulk cash leaving the country and in ensuring financial entities  whose businesses involve stored value carry out anti-money laundering  practices, respectively.  In response, in September 2010, we issued a law  enforcement sensitive report to you that addressed the following  questions:      To what extent has CBP taken actions to stem the flow of bulk cash  leaving the country through land ports of entry and what challenges, if  any, remain?", "What regulatory gaps, if any, exist for cross-border reporting and other  anti-money laundering requirements involving the use of stored value?", "If any regulatory gaps exist for cross-border reporting and other anti- money laundering requirements involving the use of stored value, to  what extent has FinCEN taken action to address them?", "This report is a public version of the prior sensitive report that we  provided to you.  DHS deemed some of the information in the prior report  as law enforcement sensitive, which must be protected from public  disclosure.  Therefore, this report omits sensitive information about CBP\u2019s  outbound inspection efforts, including techniques used to carry out  inspections and data on staffing, infrastructure, and technology that  support outbound inspections.  In addition, at DHS\u2019s request, we have  redacted data on the specific ports of entry where bulk cash has been  seized.  Although the information provided in this report is more limited in  scope, it addresses the same questions as the sensitive report.  Also, the  overall methodology used for both reports is the same.", "To address the question on CBP efforts to stem the flow of bulk cash  leaving the country at land ports of entry, we conducted site visits,  reviewed CBP data, and interviewed CBP officials.  We visited and  observed outbound operations at five ports of entry (Blaine, Washington;  Buffalo, New York; El Paso, Texas; Laredo, Texas; and San Ysidro,  California).  We selected these ports of entry to provide us with examples  of outbound operations at land ports of entry on the Northern and  southwest border that have high volumes of traffic.  At each location, we  interviewed managers and CBP officers knowledgeable about outbound  operations to determine actions that have been taken to stem the flow of  bulk cash as well as ways to strengthen the program.  While we cannot  generalize our work from our site visits to all ports of entry, the results  from this work provided us with valuable insights about outbound  operations.  Among other things, we reviewed and analyzed data on the  amount of bulk cash seized from March 2009 through June 2010.  We  assessed the reliability of these data by interviewing staff responsible for  the data and reviewing relevant documentation.  We concluded that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review.  We  reviewed data on the number of license plate readers installed on  outbound lanes as of July 2010.  We interviewed CBP staff responsible for  collecting these data and determined that the data were sufficient for our  review.  We also reviewed CBP\u2019s policies and procedures and strategic  plan for its outbound operations.  We interviewed staff at CBP  headquarters involved in (1) implementing the outbound program and (2)  assessing staffing, technology, and equipment for outbound operations.   We also reviewed documents on the budget for outbound operations,  policy guidance, and relevant statutes related to bulk cash smuggling.  We  reviewed assessments of bulk cash smuggling, including the 2009 and 2010  National Drug Threat Assessments issued by the National Drug  Intelligence Center, a National Drug Intelligence Center report on bulk  cash smuggling, and a Mexican Bulk Currency study issued by U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  We found these  assessments to be acceptable for use in our report.  We also reviewed  January 2010 data from the Texas Center for Border Economic and  Enterprise Development and interviewed center staff members to  determine the reliability of the data.  We concluded that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our review.  In addition, our investigators tested  outbound operations at three ports of entry on the southwest border.  Our  investigators did their work in accordance with quality standards for  investigations established by the Council of the Inspectors General on  Quality and Efficiency.  While we cannot generalize the work of our  investigators to all ports of entry, the results from this work provided us  with valuable insights about outbound operations.  We reviewed  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and compared  the standards for monitoring and controls with CBP\u2019s policies and  procedures and performance measures for its Outbound Enforcement  Program. Our scope did not include an examination of outbound  operations at air or sea ports of entry.", "To address the questions on regulatory gaps, if any, of cross-border  reporting and anti-money laundering requirements involving the use of  stored value and the status of FinCEN efforts to address any identified  gaps, we reviewed and analyzed information on the ways in which stored  value has been used to smuggle currency across the nation\u2019s borders and  to launder money.  We also reviewed current regulations and statutes that  govern issuers, sellers, and redeemers of stored value.  To obtain further  information on vulnerabilities related to stored value, we interviewed  officials or obtained information from federal law enforcement agencies  that are involved in efforts to interdict or investigate the illicit use of  stored value, including ICE, the U.S. Secret Service, and CBP\u2014 components in DHS, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the  Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\u2014components in the Department  of Justice (DOJ), and Criminal Investigation of the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS)\u2014a component in the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury).   In addition, we reviewed a random, probability sample of 400  reports on suspicious activities submitted by depository institutions and  money services businesses (MSB) from October 2008 through April 2010 to  identify examples of suspicious activities related to stored value.  To  obtain information on the status of Treasury\u2019s efforts to address identified  vulnerabilities (on stored value), we interviewed officials from Treasury\u2019s  Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, FinCEN, and the Office of  Fraud/Bank Secrecy Act, within IRS\u2019 Small Business/Self Employed  Division (SB/SE).  We reviewed relevant legislation, such as the Credit  Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit  CARD Act) and the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to stored  value issued by Treasury in June 2010.

First, CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations is responsible for inspecting the  flow of people and goods that enter and leave the country through air,  land, and sea ports of entry.  Second, CBP\u2019s Border Patrol works to  prevent the illegal entry of persons and merchandise, including  contraband, into and out of the United States between the ports of entry  and at checkpoints located in major traffic routes away from the border.   In doing so, the Border Patrol is responsible for controlling nearly 7,000  miles of the nation\u2019s land borders between ports of entry and 95,000 miles  of maritime border in partnership with the United States Coast Guard.  Third, CBP\u2019s Office of Air and Marine helps to protect the nation\u2019s people  and critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of an integrated  force of air and marine resources and provides mission support to the  other CBP components. For fiscal year 2010, CBP had a $11.4 billion  budget, of which $2.7 billion was for border security and trade facilitation  at ports of entry.  For outbound operations, CBP\u2019s budget was about $109  million in fiscal year 2009 and is an estimated $145 million for fiscal year  2010.", "In carrying out its responsibilities, CBP operates 327 ports of entry,  composed of airports, seaports, and designated land ports of entry along  the Northern and southwest border.  While CBP does not know the  number of travelers that leave the United States through land ports of  entry, it estimates that it inspected over 360 million travelers who entered  the country in fiscal year 2009 through land, air, and sea ports of entry.

In contrast, CBP officers  ask a different set of questions of travelers leaving the country.   To  determine whether travelers are in compliance with the reporting  requirements for the international transport of currency and monetary  instruments, officers may ask travelers whether they (1) intend to leave  the country by asking where they are going (i.e., Mexico on the southwest  border and Canada on the Northern border), (2) are carrying more than  $10,000 in currency, checks, money orders, or any other type of monetary  instrument, and (3) are transporting any weapons or ammunition into  Mexico or Canada. While carrying more than $10,000 in currency or other  type of monetary instrument across the border is legal, failure to report  the currency or monetary instrument with the intent to evade the reporting  requirement is illegal.

Other examples include cards that students may use  to purchase food on college campuses or that passengers use on  subway systems or phone cards.  Generally, closed system cards are  limited in use in that they can only be used to purchase goods or  services from a single merchant.  These cards may be limited to the  initial value posted to the card or may allow the card holder to add  value.

Such cards are easy to buy and can be bought on-line or in person.   Open system cards may not require a bank account or face-to-face  verification of the card holder\u2019s identity.  Domestically, companies may  voluntarily place a dollar limit on the cards.  Such cards may be used  to access cash from ATMs in and out of the United States and can be  reloaded to add value on the card.

The vast majority of this currency, 97  percent, was seized along the southwest border.  While CBP seized more  than twice the amount of bulk cash during the first year of the outbound  program as compared to the year prior, total seizures account for a small  percentage of the estimated $18 billion to $39 billion in illicit proceeds  being smuggled across the southwest border and out of the United States  annually.", "CBP was most successful in seizing bulk cash during the first 6 months of  the Outbound Enforcement Program.  As shown in table 1 below, CBP  seized nearly $21 million from March 2009 through August 2009, averaging  about $3.5 million each month.

The spikes in March  and April 2009, totaling $6.4 million and $8.2 million respectively, were  each driven by a single incident in which CBP seized a large amount of  currency.  For example, of the $6.4 million CBP seized in March 2009  across all ports of entry, CBP seized more than $3 million during a single  incident at a port of entry.  In contrast, the $6.3 million spike in September  is comprised of multiple seizures of smaller amounts of currency, with no  single seizure larger than $803,000.", "From March 2009 through June 2010, CBP had at least one bulk cash  seizure at 21 of the 25 land ports of entry along the southwest border while  conducting outbound operations; however, the total amount seized  varied significantly by port.

Our  investigators observed that CBP officers and Border Patrol agents were  interviewing travelers, inspecting vehicles, and performing secondary  inspections at each port.  At each of these locations, our investigators  bypassed opportunities to turn around and proceeded on a traffic lane at  the entrance to the port of entry marked as the route to Mexico, signaling  their intent to leave the country.

At  two of the three ports of entry our investigators claimed that they only  wanted to see the border and would like to turn around when approached  by CBP officers and Border Patrol agents conducting outbound  inspections.  At both of these ports of entry, officers and agents allowed  the investigators to turn around without searching the vehicle, asking for  identification, or probing further to determine whether our investigators  posed a risk of smuggling.  In addition, the officers and agents did not  question our investigators on why they did not turn around earlier when  they had an opportunity to do so.

Another benefit that is difficult to quantify is the intelligence  information that officers may obtain by conducting outbound operations,  including information that may help in discovering smuggled cash,  weapons and drugs. To address this type of difficulty, OMB encourages  agencies to enumerate any other benefits beyond those that can be  quantified.

How  much CBP spends to combat such activities could be indirectly affected by  the efforts of other agencies involved in interdiction activities.  For  example, if local police officers were to increase enforcement on highways  leading to the border, they may intercept bulk cash before it gets to the  border, potentially changing the results of CBP\u2019s efforts.  Additionally, if  CBP increases its outbound operations, criminals may respond to the  increased difficulty of smuggling bulk cash by changing tactics to use  other means of moving currency out of the country, such as using stored  value.

Upon further investigation, the agents  uncovered that the passenger had over 1,000 stolen credit card  numbers and was working as part of a credit card fraud operation. The  passenger explained that for his work, he was paid with prepaid gift  cards. The man used these gift cards to purchase prepaid phone cards,  which he smuggled into Mexico and sold for a profit.", "The second method involves moving illicit proceeds out of the country by  shipping stored value cards out of the country, where co-conspirators can  use the cards to make purchases or to withdraw cash from local ATMs.  Many cards can also be reloaded with additional value remotely via the  Internet. For example, in 2008, DEA agents in Connecticut were  investigating a narcotics and money laundering organization allegedly  using stored value cards to launder narcotics proceeds. The investigation  revealed that illicit proceeds were loaded onto stored value cards, which  were then shipped to Colombia, South America. In Colombia, co- conspirators withdrew the money from local ATMs. The investigation  revealed that in a 5-month period, conspirators withdrew more than $7  million from the stored value cards at a single location in Medellin,  Colombia.", "As discussed above, stored value devices are not subject to cross-border  reporting requirements. As a result, individuals are not required to file any  report if they physically transport, mail, or ship more than $10,000 in value  in the form of stored value products.  Four of six law enforcement  agencies with whom we spoke expressed concern about the lack of a  cross-border transport reporting requirement for stored value. For  example, CBP senior officials report that because stored value is not  subject to CMIR requirements, they lack the authority to seize stored value  devices at the border without establishing probable cause or linking the  stored value devices to a specified unlawful activity. In contrast, an IRS  special agent told us that a cross-border reporting requirement would not  entirely address the illicit use of stored value because there are other  mechanisms by which stored value can be used to transport funds  internationally. For example, smugglers could physically carry or ship  stored value cards with no value out of the country and then add value to  the cards remotely.", "Beyond the use of stored value for cross-border currency smuggling, law  enforcement examples and reported suspicious activities demonstrate that  stored value can be used for other illicit purposes, such as money  laundering, tax fraud, and identity theft.

This process involves steps that  range from drafting a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to  publication of the final rule at least 60 days before its effective date.  In  June 2010, FinCEN issued a NPRM.

The NPRM proposes that providers of  prepaid access must (1) register with FinCEN as a MSB, (2) identify  each prepaid program for which it is the provider of prepaid access,  and (3) maintain a list of its agents.  However, sellers, such as grocery  stores or drug stores, of prepaid access would not have to register.   According to FinCEN, it is proposing to exempt the seller from  registering with FinCEN because the seller\u2019s role is complementary  with, but not equal to, the authority and primacy of the provider of  prepaid access, and the seller is generally acting as an agent on behalf  of the provider.

IRS Fraud/BSA officials told us that  most MSBs they examined for fiscal years 2007 through 2009 provided  some other financial service (e.g. money transmission, check cashing, and  issuing and selling traveler\u2019s checks) as their primary financial service, and  may have conducted stored value transactions as an auxiliary financial  service.  IRS Fraud/BSA work plans during this period as well as for the current fiscal year (2010) excluded examination of MSBs whose primary  financial service is stored value for the following two reasons:  (1) most  MSBs that were examined provided multiple financial services of which  stored value may have been only one of them, and (2) the existing  statutory requirements for entities that offer stored value products are  minimal and IRS resource expenditures would be more beneficial in  focusing on other MSBs.", "FinCEN\u2019s Efforts to Close Gaps in Anti-Money Laundering  Regulations for Off-Shore Entities Has Made Progress, but More  Work Remains  Combating the use of stored value by criminals involves not only efforts to  implement anti-money laundering practices domestically, but also involves  extending these efforts to international financial markets.  Stored value  issuers outside of the United States are generally not subject to FinCEN\u2019s  anti-money laundering regulations, even though the stored value products  they issue may be used in the United States or elsewhere in the world.   Such devices can be used to load money from this country and download  money in foreign countries through ATMs.", "Prior to enactment of the Credit CARD Act, FinCEN had begun the  process of proposing a new rule to address, among other things, off-shore  MSBs that market their stored value products in the United States but the  final rule is being delayed. As of April 2010, agency officials told us its  final rule related to off-shore MSBs will be delayed and issued at the time  FinCEN issues the final rule addressing the requirements under the Credit  CARD Act.  This would allow for the provisions in both rules to be  synchronized along with appropriate references because the two rules are  closely related to one another.", "Meanwhile, one way Treasury and FinCEN are addressing off-shore  providers of stored value is through an intergovernmental entity called the  Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  FATF\u2019s purpose is to establish  international standards and to develop and promote policies for combating  money laundering and terrorist financing.  In 2006, FATF issued a study  concluding that providers of new payment methods, such as stored value  and mobile payments that are outside the jurisdiction of a given country,  may pose additional risks of money laundering when (1) the distribution  channel being used is the Internet, (2) there is no face-to-face contact with  the customer, and (3) the new payment network operates through an open  network that can be accessed in a high number of jurisdictions (e.g. ATMs  worldwide).  More recently, in its Strategic Plan (2008-2012) FinCEN  recognized that to address the risk of cross-border transport and money  laundering through the use of such devices calls for an approach that  involves international cooperation with regulatory and law enforcement  agencies outside of the United States.  The degree to which FinCEN will  succeed in gaining the cooperation of agencies outside of the United  States in regulating stored value remains an open question.  Officials at  three of six law enforcement agencies we spoke with expressed concern  about the risk of money laundering from off-shore MSBs.", "According to Treasury officials we interviewed, the agency led the 2006  effort to disclose risks of money laundering related to off-shore MSBs that  sell and issue stored value products and informed us that a new effort is  currently under way to update the conditions and findings to see what  more needs to be done to deter the use of such products for money  laundering and terrorist financing activities.  Treasury officials told us the  updated report is being co-chaired by FATF representatives from Germany  and the Netherlands with Treasury as a participating member.  Although  originally scheduled for June 2010, the revised issuance date for the  updated report on new payment methods is October 2010.", "FinCEN May Need to Evaluate Alternative Approaches to the  Proposed Rule   In the NPRM, FinCEN has included a request for comments on the  proposed rule, as well as 15 questions it asks stakeholders to comment on.   For example, FinCEN\u2019s proposed rule exempts certain types of prepaid  devices from anti-money laundering requirements.  Specifically, the  proposed rule exempts those devices that are (1) used to distribute payroll  or benefits; (2) used to distribute government benefits; or (3) used for  pre-tax flexible spending accounts for health care and dependent care  expenses.  The proposed rule also exempts programs offering closed  system products that can only be used domestically as well as products  that limit the maximum value and transactions to $1,000 or less at any  given time.  As stated in the NPRM, FinCEN recognizes that some  members of the law enforcement community have expressed concern  about exempting prepaid access payroll programs from anti-money  laundering requirements.  To address concerns such as these, FinCEN has  requested comments on methods for ensuring that the company and its  employees are legitimate, and that the program is valid.  FinCEN has also  asked for comments on the $1,000 a day threshold as it may apply to  transactions involving multiple MSBs.  According to FinCEN, it will  consider this matter and any comments that it receives.  In doing so, when  FinCEN reviews the comments it receives, it may need to evaluate  alternatives to exempting such prepaid programs to address the risk of  money laundering and the transport of such devices across the nation\u2019s  borders to finance illegal activities.  OMB Circular A-4 and Executive  Order 12866, as amended, indicate that analysis of alternatives is a key  component in assessing proposed rules.", "FinCEN Acknowledges that Outreach Will Help Ensure Industry  Compliance With the New Rules   While the June 2010 NPRM proposes regulations that would require each  \u201cprovider of prepaid access\u201d to register with FinCEN and carry out anti- money laundering requirements related to prepaid access, the degree to  which providers will register with FinCEN and carry out the proposed  requirements remains an open question.  FinCEN may face two challenges  in this regard.  First, while the proposed rule describes characteristics of  MSBs that may qualify as a provider, entities in the prepaid access industry  may not immediately know whether they are a provider without further  clarification from FinCEN.  This condition could lead to entities not  registering as a provider when FinCEN intends that they follow the anti- money laundering requirements for such entities.  Second, while sellers  are exempt from registration requirements under the proposed rule, they  are required to comply with certain anti-money laundering requirements.   Not knowing whether the universe of providers and sellers is complete  and accurate may hinder compliance efforts.  As a result, FinCEN may  face a higher risk of noncompliance without a program to educate industry  about the rule and how to apply it.", "In July 2010, FinCEN officials told us that they typically develop and  conduct industry outreach, as resources allow, supporting the  implementation of major new rulemakings.  FinCEN officials explained  that these outreach activities greatly assist covered industries in better  understanding the new rules and how the new rules are to be applied.   Because the prepaid access rulemaking is ongoing and FinCEN is awaiting  feedback on its proposed regulations, preparations and planning for  outreach to providers of prepaid access and other affected industry  participants are in the initial phases, according to agency officials.   Officials told us that FinCEN will continue its discussions with the Bank  Secrecy Act Advisory Group and its Subcommittees to gain insight on how  best to reach those affected by any final regulations.  According to  FinCEN, the level of effort associated with a major industry outreach  effort of this kind will be significant."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Moving illegal proceeds across the border, whether in the form of bulk  cash or stored value, represents a significant threat to national security.   While CBP\u2019s outbound inspection effort has shown some early results,  particularly in terms of bulk cash seized, the program\u2019s future is uncertain.   If DHS continues to conduct outbound inspections, CBP faces important  decisions regarding resources and processes for outbound inspections,  and without all the necessary information, CBP may be unable to most  effectively inform decisions on where scarce resources need to be applied.   In addition, CBP could also improve its Outbound Enforcement Program  by directing and ensuring ports of entry develop guidance that addresses  officer safety.  Also, by establishing performance measures related to  program effectiveness, CBP could be better positioned to show the degree  to which its efforts are stemming the flow of cash, weapons, and other  goods that stem from criminal activities.  While we recognize that this is a  new program, without data and information to inform resource decisions,  help ensure that officers are safe, and measure program effectiveness,  CBP risks that the program could result in an inefficient use of resources,  that officers will be endangered, and that Congress could not have the  information it needs for its oversight efforts.", "Even if efforts to reduce the flow of bulk cash into Mexico are successful,  drug trafficking organizations and other criminal elements may shift their  tactics and use other methods to smuggle illegal proceeds out of the  United States, such as through the use of stored value. FinCEN is in the  process of developing and issuing regulations related to the issuance of  stored value, as required by the Credit CARD Act, but work remains and it  is unclear when the agency will issue the final regulation. By developing a  management plan with timelines for issuing final rules, FinCEN could be  better positioned to manage its rulemaking efforts and to reduce the risk  of cross-border smuggling and other illicit uses of stored value by drug  trafficking organizations and others.  Developing policies and procedures,  such as for transaction testing for monitoring MSBs that issue, sell, and  redeem stored value could help ensure that such MSBs carry out current  and future anti-money laundering requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen CBP\u2019s implementation of the Outbound Enforcement  Program as well as its planning efforts related to the program, we  recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the  Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection to take the following  three actions:    Collect cost and benefit data that would enable a cost/benefit analysis  of the Outbound Enforcement Program to better inform decisions on  where scarce resources should be applied.  These data could include  cost data on training and using currency canine for outbound  operations as part of the Outbound Workload Staffing Model, cost  estimates for equipping officers, installing technology to support  outbound operations, assessments of infrastructure needs at port of  entry outbound lanes, an estimate of the costs resulting from travelers  waiting to be inspected, and information on quantifiable benefits, such  as seizures, as well as non-quantifiable benefits resulting from  outbound inspections.", "Direct and ensure that managers at land ports of entry develop policies  and procedures that address officer safety, such as detailing how  officers should conduct outbound inspections on a busy highway  environment.", "Develop a performance measure that informs CBP management,  Congress, and other stakeholders about the extent to which the  Outbound Enforcement Program is effectively stemming the flow of  bulk cash, weapons, and other goods that stem from criminal activities  by working with other federal law enforcement agencies involved in  developing assessments on bulk cash and other illegal goods leaving  the country.", "To strengthen FinCEN\u2019s rulemaking process and to ensure IRS compliance  examiners consistently apply the anti-money laundering requirements  under the Credit CARD Act, we recommend that the Director of FinCEN  take the following two actions:    Update its written plan by describing, at a minimum, target dates for  implementing all of the requirements under the Credit CARD Act to  include FinCEN\u2019s overall strategy and risk mitigation plans and target  dates for issuing notices of proposed rulemaking and final rules.", "Revise its guidance manual to include specific examination policies  and procedures, including for transaction testing, for IRS examiners to  follow at a MSB that issues, sells, and/or redeems stored value."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the sensitive version of this report to DHS, the  Department of the Treasury, and DOJ for comment.

For example, DHS stated that it is  collecting cost data as well as identifying quantifiable and non-quantifiable  benefits of the outbound program to conduct cost/benefit analysis.  In  addition, DHS stated that it will update its National Outbound Operations  Policy Directive to ensure each Port Director establishes a standard  operating procedure for officer safety.  DHS also stated that it will work to  develop effective performance measures that accurately assess its surge- type outbound operations.  CBP stated that it will coordinate with other  law enforcement entities, including other DHS components and DOJ as  well as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy to enhance  CBP interdiction efforts.  DHS also stated that it is investigating the  implementation of a random sampling process in the outbound  environment that would provide statistically valid compliance results for  outbound operations.
