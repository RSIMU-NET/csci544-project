Many of the SSP's resources are expected to transition to Constellation while others will be dispositioned or preserved for their historic value. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 directed GAO to assess NASA's plans and progress in transitioning and retiring the SSP's facilities and equipment. More specifically, GAO examined 1) the challenges NASA faces in defining the scope and costs of transition and retirement activities, and 2) whether the cost of these efforts is transparent in NASA's budget requests.

For example, because the Constellation program is still finalizing its requirements, the agency does not yet know what SSP property it needs to retain or the full cost of the transition effort. In addition, NASA faces other challenges that hamper its efforts to manage the transition and develop firm estimates of SSP transition and retirement scope and costs. For example, NASA has not developed final plans and/or cost estimates for making artifacts-- including the orbiters Atlantis, Discovery, and Endeavour--safe for public display. The total cost of SSP transition and retirement is not transparent in NASA's current budget request and is not expected to be reflected in its fiscal year 2010 budget request. This is due in part to delays in estimating costs, but also to where costs are being reflected. For example, although SSP's direct transition and retirement costs are identified in the SSP budget line, indirect costs related to environmental clean-up and restoration, maintenance of required real property facilities during the gap in human spaceflight, and demolition of excess facilities are not. In addition, NASA plans to offset some transition costs by utilizing an \"exchange/sale\" authority that allows executive agencies to exchange or sell non-excess, non-surplus personal property and apply the proceeds toward acquiring similar replacement property."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After providing the United States unrivaled access to space for decades,  the space shuttle is slated to make its last flight in 2010. The National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to retire the Space  Shuttle Program (SSP) to make resources available for the Constellation  program, which is expected to achieve initial operational capability in  2015. The transition and retirement of the SSP\u2019s facilities and assets  represent an immense undertaking. The SSP occupies approximately 654  real property facilities and holds about 1.2 million line items of personal  property. NASA estimates the total replacement value of all SSP facilities  is approximately $5.7 billion, which accounts for nearly one-fourth of the  value of the agency\u2019s total facility inventory. The total SSP personal  property acquisition value is estimated by NASA at about $12 billion, and  there are numerous locations where government personal property is  used. The SSP transition and phase-out effort will be complex and  challenging, especially when coupled with simultaneously finalizing the  designs for the Ares I crew launch vehicle and Orion crew exploration  vehicle and conducting potentially the most complicated sequence of  shuttle flights ever attempted\u2014completing the International Space Station  and conducting a fifth servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope all  by the end of 2010.", "In light of the magnitude of this undertaking, in a joint explanatory  statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (Pub.

More specifically,  GAO examined 1) the challenges NASA faces in defining the scope and  costs of transition and retirement activities, and 2) whether the cost of  these efforts is transparent in NASA\u2019s current and upcoming budget  requests. To address these objectives, we obtained and analyzed SSP  transition and retirement plans and schedules, budget formulation  guidance, and transition property assessments. We also interviewed  responsible and cognizant government and contractor officials at relevant  NASA centers and NASA headquarters. For our full scope and  methodology, see appendix I. We conducted this performance audit from  February 2008 to August 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

As part of the Vision, NASA is developing  new vehicles under the Constellation program, with an initial operational  capability currently scheduled for 2015. In order to accelerate  development and minimize development costs, NASA elected to pursue  shuttle-derived options and the use of heritage systems for the new  systems. The agency also found that shuttle-derived options are more  affordable, safe, and reliable and provide the use, in some instances, of  existing personnel, infrastructure, manufacturing and processing facilities,  transportation elements, and heritage system hardware.", "NASA will transfer whatever real (land, buildings, and facilities) and  personal (e.g., system hardware, tools, plant equipment) property is  practical given program requirements to Constellation and other programs  to offset the need for new acquisitions. Transferring property provides  NASA with distinct financial benefits. First, the receiving program avoids  the cost of acquiring the needed property. Second, the SSP avoids the  costs associated with disposing of the property. The SSP and its  contractors are currently conducting transition property assessments  (TPA) of property belonging to the SSP in two phases. In Phase 1 the  agency is identifying existing SSP personal property and determining  property category, item status, availability date, and whether the property  should be transferred or declared excess. This process is ongoing and  continues to identify SSP property. For example, as of May 2007 NASA had  identified about 1 million line items of SSP personal property. By May 2008  this number had increased to about 1.2 million line items. During Phase 2  of the TPA process, the agency is developing detailed plans for disposing  of excess SSP personal property including identifying hazardous materials,  cataloging recoverable precious metals, providing historical artifact  justification, and identifying final destinations. Based on discussions  between the Space Shuttle and Constellation programs, it is estimated that  about 40 to 47 percent of SSP personal property will be transferred to  Constellation and other NASA programs and the remaining property will  be declared excess.", "NASA has yet to include an official estimate of the total cost of the SSP  transition and retirement in any of its budget requests. Although NASA has  developed a series of cost estimates for it\u2014ranging from the $4.4 billion  reported by the NASA Inspector General in January 2007, to the  approximately $1.8 billion estimate prepared by the agency to support its  fiscal year 2009 budget request\u2014and has been funding SSP transition and  retirement activities out of its approved Shuttle budget, the agency has not  included any of the estimates for fiscal years 2011 and beyond in its budget  requests to the Congress. NASA transition managers maintain that NASA  made a strategic decision not to release an estimate of transition and  retirement costs for fiscal years 2011 and later until the scope of the effort  and the associated costs and schedule were better defined. According to  NASA transition managers, the agency has now accomplished this better  definition and plans to include an estimate substantially lower than the  earlier $1.8 billion estimate for the total cost of SSP transition and  retirement in its fiscal year 2010 budget request.", "We have previously reported on NASA\u2019s management of the billions of  dollars of government equipment under its control.

According to SSP and Constellation transition managers,  there is a symbiotic push and pull relationship between the SSP and the  Constellation program. Ideally, in this relationship the SSP would push the  property that it no longer needs for the safe operation of the space shuttle  to the Constellation program in order to avoid property maintenance  and/or disposal costs. Likewise, in order to avoid acquisition costs, the  Constellation program would pull the SSP property that it has designated  as needed. Thus far, however, this relationship has not worked as well as  the agency has desired. Essentially, the Constellation program has not  finalized its requirements for personal and real property from the SSP  because it is still in the process of defining its own programmatic  requirements. For example, at the time of our review, the Constellation  program had yet to hold its Preliminary Design Review during which it will  finalize its preliminary design and operations concepts, two key steps in  determining the Constellation program\u2019s hardware and processing facility  needs. Further, according to the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate  (ESMD) Transition Manager, the Constellation program is just now  realizing the importance of \u201cpulling\u201d SSP assets to avoid costs, as any and  all of the SSP transition and retirement costs post-2010 will be borne by  NASA at the expense of the follow-on program(s) or Center Management  and Operations budgets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Will Not Complete the TPA Process Until After the Agency\u2019s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2010 Is Submitted", "paragraphs": ["NASA will not complete the last phase of the TPA process until after the  agency\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2010 is submitted and may not  complete all TPA activity until the end of fiscal year 2009.
