The expansion from TFTEA has resulted in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facing a growing workload. According to CBP officials, the most significant change from TFTEA is that it is now easier to qualify for certain drawback refunds. Industry representatives explained that new claimants are seeking drawback refunds and existing claimants are able to increase claim amounts.

Substitution manufacturing drawback may be claimed on exported  or destroyed articles that have been manufactured or produced  in the United States using domestic merchandise substituted for  imported duty-paid merchandise meeting the statutory criteria,  where the articles have not been used in the United States. As a  result, domestic producers can select the most advantageous  sources for their raw materials and components without regard to  duties, saving them production costs. For example, a claimant  could claim a drawback refund on exported pants made in the  United States using domestic fabric substituted for imported  foreign fabric. (See fig. 3.)  a.  Direct identification unused merchandise drawback may be  claimed on imported merchandise that was exported or destroyed  under CBP supervision, without having been used within the  United States. For example, a claimant could claim a drawback  refund on unused imported designer dresses upon their  destruction. (See fig. 4.)  b.  Substitution unused merchandise drawback may be claimed on  goods that were exported or destroyed under CBP supervision,  without being used, and were substituted for imported  merchandise meeting the appropriate criteria.

In one  example, the representative explained that a chemical company with  a product classified as a basket provision successfully petitioned for a  new statistical breakout. The company produces chemical methanol  and was unable to file a TFTEA drawback claim in 2018 because of  the basket provision restriction. Such requests are generally  considered by the committee twice a year.", "Standardizing time limits: TFTEA also expanded eligibility for drawback  refunds by standardizing the drawback filing deadline. Previously,  drawback claim filing deadlines varied based on type of claim and time  between import and export or destruction, ranging from 3 years to 5 years  from importation to exportation or destruction, followed by a 3-year  window to file a claim. TFTEA generally standardized the timelines for the  acceptance of claims to be up to 5 years from import. CBP expects the  new eligibility time frames will give some drawback claimants more time  to file for drawback and potentially increase drawback eligibility for some  claimants.", "Expanding taxes and fees: TFTEA expanded the scope of drawback  refunds by explicitly including taxes and fees for manufacturing drawback  claims. Prior to TFTEA, the drawback statute did not specify that taxes  and fees were eligible for manufacturing drawback. TFTEA extended  drawback refunds to taxes and fees for manufacturing claims.

Between February 2019 and July 2019, CBP  also received about 50 applications for new manufacturing rulings, which  it has not yet begun to process. These processes remain paper-based  (see fig. 10). CBP officials explained that CBP generally does not process  manufacturing drawback claims until claimants are issued up-to-date  ruling numbers. Until the new or modified manufacturing rulings are  approved, CBP officials explained, they will not provide accelerated  payment or process manufacturing claims.

Prior to TFTEA, the number of  drawback claims per calendar year ranged from 11,690 to 13,291. CBP  saw a large increase in the number of drawback claims in 2018 and 2019.  (See table 2.)", "CBP limited the number of lines in a drawback claim in ACE, which  increased the number of drawback claims filed. Prior to TFTEA, claims  were not limited by line. Because of system constraints, claims filed in  ACE are restricted to 10,000 lines per claim. CBP had predicted that  this ACE line limitation would increase the number of claims by a factor of  four. Evidence to date indicates a significant increase in workload for  certain Drawback Centers. For example, the Chicago Drawback Center  noted that two claimants had filed over 4,000 claims between February  24, 2018 and February 23, 2019, whereas these same claimants had filed  less than 50 claims in the prior year. According to the industry  representatives we spoke with, the line limit in ACE added more work for  industry and CBP because it made it necessary for claimants to break up  the volume of their claims into different applications. For example, one  broker used to file drawback claims four times a year on behalf of one  refinery, but now has to file 300 times per year to account for the line limit.  Drawback specialists pointed out that each claim stands on its own. As a  result, they explained that they must liquidate each claim in ACE, which  involves a number of quality control steps such as verifying that the claim  is ready to be liquidated, relevant rulings are valid, and all validation  activities are complete.", "As discussed earlier, the changes to the substitution standard have also  led to an increase in new drawback claimants, according to CBP  officials. CBP has received applications from over 500 new claimants  since February 24, 2018. New claimants require additional work, including  drawback specialists\u2019 manual reviews of claims, privilege applications,  and ruling requests, as follows.", "Claims. Drawback specialists explained that drawback claims from  new claimants are subject to a full desk review. The specialists will  request supporting documentation to ensure that the appropriate  statutory and regulatory requirements are met. They also determine  drawback due on the basis of the completed drawback claim, the  applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific  manufacturing drawback ruling, and any other relevant evidence or  information. According to CBP, the time it takes a drawback  specialist to conduct a full desk review varies by claim, based on the  nature of the claim and the experience of the drawback specialist.  CBP reported that it could take more than 3 years for CBP to conduct  a full desk review and determine the final disposition of a drawback  claim.", "Privilege applications. Claimants can also apply for privileges  including accelerated payment privileges, a waiver of prior notice of  intent to export or destroy, or a one-time waiver of prior notice of  intent to export or destroy. Claimants must continue to submit paper  applications for such privileges and drawback specialists must  manually review the privilege applications. According to CBP, most  claims are eligible for accelerated payment of drawback refunds.", "Manufacturing rulings. Lastly, if a claimant is seeking either a direct  identification manufacturing drawback or a substitution manufacturing  drawback, it must manually apply for a manufacturing ruling using a  paper form submitted through email, which may require significant  documentation and review, as discussed earlier. CBP maintains the  manufacturing rulings as paper files. For example, the Drawback  Center in Newark stores manufacturing rulings in rows of filing  cabinets. (See fig. 11.)", "Additionally, CBP has not been able to respond to all privilege  applications within 90 days, as set forth in the regulations. Between  February 2018 and July 2019, CBP received almost 600 new privilege  applications. CBP missed the 90-day deadline about 60 percent of the  time. According to drawback specialists, they missed this deadline  because of their workload. According to an industry representative,  delays in processing privilege applications mean companies cannot  receive their drawback money in a timely manner. Such delays cause  uncertainty for industry, potentially impeding trade.", "Drawback specialists face new obstacles to managing automatic  liquidation of drawback claims in ACE. According to CBP officials,  previously, drawback specialists had at least 10 days of lead time to address an automatic liquidation. Now, Drawback Centers must  continually monitor the automatic liquidation reports. Because of the way  ACE operates, drawback specialists may only have 1 day of lead time  before a claim automatically liquidates. According to drawback  supervisors, such monitoring is significantly increasing their workload.  Further, drawback specialists told us that one way they were managing  their increased workload was by extending automatic liquidation, which  can be done up to three times, as discussed in appendix II. This practice  goes directly against CBP\u2019s guidance. Moreover, if they continue this  practice, specialists may be forced to liquidate claims at zero if they run  out of extensions.", "Further, as the workload continues to grow, Drawback Centers continue  to face staffing shortages. As of October 26, 2019, CBP met the  congressionally mandated staffing level for drawback specialists of 37 for  the first time in over 5 years. In CBP\u2019s 2017 Resource Optimization  Model, it reported an optimal staffing level of 40 to meet its drawback  staffing needs. CBP\u2019s staffing level of 37, as of October 2019, did not  meet this target. According to CBP officials, although Drawback Centers  are utilizing overtime, the drawback specialists are not able to keep up  with the influx of work.", "CBP has not adequately managed its drawback workload because it did  not anticipate the increase in workload and did not plan for the increase  accordingly. Federal standards for internal control note that management  should evaluate performance and hold individuals accountable for their  internal control responsibilities, which include evaluating pressure on  personnel to help personnel fulfill their assigned responsibilities in  accordance with the entity\u2019s standards of conduct. Management can  adjust excessive pressures using many different tools, such as  rebalancing workloads or increasing resource levels. However, CBP has  not brought staffing to its optimal level, and has not adjusted the workload  in Drawback Centers through ACE to account for the increase in claims,  rulings, and privilege applications. Prior to TFTEA, CBP officials  explained that CBP could not control the workload of the Drawback  Centers because claimants mailed their paper-based claims to the  Drawback Center of their choice. Now, CBP has greater visibility and  flexibility to potentially control the work flow to the Drawback Centers  through ACE, but has not done so. CBP officials said they had anticipated  that ACE automation would reduce drawback specialists\u2019 workload, but  experience, to date, indicates that workload increased. Until CBP  develops a plan for managing its increased workload, it risks further  delays in drawback claim processing that result in uncertainty for industry,  potentially impeding trade\u2014which runs counter to its strategic goal of  enhancing U.S. competitiveness by enabling lawful trade and travel, such  as by reducing barriers to the efficient flow of trade and streamlining and  unifying processes and procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Taken Steps to Address Certain Risks of Improper Payments in the Drawback Program under Modernization, but Has Not Addressed Others TFTEA Made Three Key Changes to the Drawback Process That CBP Expects to Strengthen Its Ability to Validate Claims and Recover Inaccurately Claimed Drawback Refunds", "paragraphs": ["CBP has taken steps to mitigate improper payment risks in the drawback  program.

On February  24, 2019, the drawback program fully transitioned to ACE.  Specifically, all drawback claims are now required to be filed  electronically in ACE and include drawback entry summary data at  the more detailed line item level. Line item reporting requires  claimants to provide certain relevant information for the designated  imported merchandise on a drawback claim associated with the line  item on an import entry summary, including the tariff classification,  quantity, and value, as well as the duties, taxes, and fees assessed  thereon.", "With electronic filing and line item reporting, CBP can now  automatically compare and verify the amounts of duties, taxes, and  fees claimed on the drawback claim against the amounts paid on the  import entry summary, which CBP expects will help ensure that it  does not overpay funds. CBP\u2019s prior system for filing drawback  claims did not have the capability to electronically compare and verify  claims against underlying import entries upon which the drawback  claim was based to determine whether an excessive amount had  been claimed at the individual line item level, according to prior  independent audits. CBP\u2019s transition to ACE is intended to mitigate  risks of improper payments on drawback-related imports, by helping  to ensure through automated validations that the amount paid for  drawback claims against a given import entry does not exceed 99  percent of the duties, taxes, and fees collected at the individual line  item level.", "Extending the record retention period for certain drawback  claims. For all TFTEA drawback claims, supporting records must now  be maintained for a period of 3 years from the date of liquidation of  the claim, rather than 3 years from the date CBP pays a drawback  claimant. This new time frame requires claimants with accelerated  payment privileges to maintain supporting records for a longer period  than before modernization. Prior to modernization, the drawback  record retention period sometimes fell short of the time in which CBP  liquidated a drawback claim, preventing CBP from substantiating a  claim with complete documentation. The extension of the record  retention period provides CBP with more time to request documents  needed to verify claims during desk reviews, which in turn should  strengthen its ability to recoup over claimed drawback refunds.", "According to CBP officials, if a claimant fails to provide documents as  directed, or if the documents do not support the claim as presented,  CBP can liquidate the claim at $0, or other diminishment as  appropriate, and ACE will then issue a bill for outstanding funds owed.", "Broadening liability for drawback claims. Following TFTEA, liability  for the full amount of a drawback claim shifted from the claimant to  both the claimant and the importer of the designated imported  merchandise upon which drawback refunds are claimed. CBP expects  that establishing joint and several liability, consistent with TFTEA, will  help it to recoup over claimed drawback refunds by holding the  importer of record, in addition to the claimant, responsible for payment  of erroneous or false drawback claims. According to the industry  representatives we spoke to, the impact of the joint and several  liability change remains to be seen, but it could limit the incentive of  importers to engage in drawback filing with exporters or claimants to  avoid liability.", "In addition to implementing these statutory changes, CBP has been  working with a statistician to develop a more robust basis for sampling  and selecting claims for review.

CBP guidance notes  that a statutory prohibition on multiple drawback claims is set forth in 19  U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(v), which restricts the use of merchandise that is exported  or destroyed to a single claim for drawback. Unlike import information,  which is included in ACE to allow CBP to electronically compare and  verify claims against underlying import entries, similar export information  is not included in ACE. Therefore, CBP cannot perform electronic  comparisons of export data within ACE to help ensure that it does not  make overpayments on drawback-related exports. For example, if a  claimant exported 10 widgets and filed one drawback claim for six  exported widgets and another claim for five exported widgets, CBP would  not be able to systematically verify that the second drawback claim was  excessive and thus invalid. To compensate for the lack of automated  controls, CBP designed an internal control for the drawback program that  targets a selection of claims for a manual full desk review by drawback  specialists.

CBP officials noted that, while export documentation could be  used across multiple claims, by law, claimants cannot file multiple  drawback claims based on the same exported merchandise, as discussed  above. Under TFTEA, a person claiming drawback refunds based on the  exportation of an item must provide proof of export. Such proof must  establish fully the date and fact of exportation and the identity of the  exporter and may be established through the use of records kept in the  normal course of business or through an electronic export system, as  determined by CBP. To comply with this requirement, CBP requires  claimants to (1) provide summary data as part of the drawback claim in  ACE that includes the date of export, name of exporter, description of the  goods, quantity and unit of measure, tariff classification number, and  country of ultimate destination; and (2) maintain actual proof of export,  which can be records kept in the normal course of business, and provide  such proof upon demand by CBP.

CBP also sought public comments on these estimates and  did not receive any, according to officials.

Specifically, we  reviewed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015  (TFTEA), the Modernized Drawback Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,  and the Modernized Drawback Final Rule to identify key changes  resulting from amendments made to the drawback statute and  implementing regulations. We also reviewed CBP\u2019s internal guidance,  which defines the standards that drawback specialists must meet when  processing claims for drawback refunds in the Automated Commercial  Environment (ACE) and under TFTEA. To understand the regulations and  policies for drawback modernization, we interviewed CBP officials with  the Offices of Regulations and Rulings and Trade Policy and Programs  within the Office of Trade. To gain insight into how drawback  modernization is working, in practice, we interviewed CBP officials from  the Office of Field Operations and the four Drawback Centers. We visited  the largest Drawback Centers, located in Newark, New Jersey, and San  Francisco, California, to observe how they manage their workload and  process claims. As context for CBP\u2019s increasing workload following  drawback modernization, we also collected data on the following:", "The number of drawback claims filed in calendar years 2018 and  2019, as of August 21, 2019. We also compared these data against  the historical number of drawback claims filed from 2009 through  2017, as reported by CBP in its Regulatory Impact Analysis of the  Modernized Drawback Final Rule (RIA). In addition, we reported on  the amount of drawback claimed during this period as context for the  size of the drawback program. TFTEA (1) provided for a transition  period, from February 24, 2018 to February 23, 2019, during which  drawback claimants could file under either the amended provisions or  the drawback law as it existed previously; and (2) thereafter required  all claims to be filed under TFTEA starting on February 24, 2019.

Based on our  interviews with agency officials, we found these data to be sufficiently  reliable for providing context for CBP\u2019s growing workload since  modernization. We then discussed steps that CBP had taken to manage  its workload, such as how it had updated its staffing models, managed  processing privilege applications, and managed automatic liquidation. We  assessed CBP\u2019s responses against federal standards for internal control,  which call for agency management to evaluate pressure on personnel to  help personnel fulfill their assigned responsibilities in accordance with the  entity\u2019s standards for conduct.", "We reviewed staffing data covering fiscal years 2014 through 2019 for  drawback specialists.

To determine staffing shortfalls, we compared actual staffing  data against the minimum staffing level mandated by the Homeland  Security Act and the optimal staffing level identified in CBP\u2019s Resource  Optimization Model for 2017. We determined these data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of comparing actual to optimal and  mandated staffing levels.", "In addition, to understand how CBP is implementing the changes to the  drawback program under modernization and the impact of the changes to  the program, we interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 industry  representatives from a variety of sectors who (a) had submitted public  comments on the proposed rule, (b) were part of CBP\u2019s Trade Support  Network Drawback Subcommittee, or (c) met our criteria for both (a) and  (b). According to CBP officials, this subcommittee was CBP\u2019s primary  forum through which officials obtained input on the modernized drawback  regulations from industry. We developed a standard set of questions to  ask industry representatives, for example, regarding their company\u2019s  involvement in the drawback program, how drawback modernization has  impacted their company, what industries have been most impacted by the  changes, and any unexpected or unintended results of the modernization.", "To examine the extent to which CBP has taken steps to address risks of  improper payments in the program, we reviewed prior independent audits  of the program, as well as statutory, regulatory, and agency documents  delineating changes to the program, to understand how the changes are  expected to remediate prior audit findings. These documents included  TFTEA, as well as CBP\u2019s proposed and final rules for modernized  drawback, the RIA, and internal and external guidance for filing and  processing drawback claims. We also interviewed agency officials in  headquarters and in the field to discuss prior audit findings and the  successes and challenges, if any, to drawback modernization addressing  identified issues. We then assessed steps that CBP had taken to mitigate  improper payment risks in the drawback program against federal  standards for internal control, which call for agency management to  identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined  objectives.

We then compared our  assessments against applicable Department of the Treasury standards to  determine if a future assessment could overcome the prior data  limitations, warranting a limited review of certain aspects of an existing  rule. However, we did not comprehensively assess the RIA (a 251-page  document containing more than 90 tables) or assess it against the Office  of Management and Budget\u2019s standards for regulatory impact analysis.

Claims are (1) submitted for initial acceptance or rejection, (2) reviewed  for drawback eligibility as applicable, and (3) liquidated with full, partial, or  no payment. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials  indicated that while the transition from the Automated Commercial  System (ACS) to the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) under  drawback modernization has automated the initial intake of drawback  claims, the review of claims to determine drawback eligibility, as  presented, remains largely a manual process.  1.  Claim submission. Prior to modernization, claimants had to file  paper claims, including supporting documentation. CBP was required  to accept or reject claims and authorize accelerated payment within  90 days of receiving the paper claim. However, claimants could also  submit an electronic summary of the claim, known as a shell record,  through ACS. For accelerated payment claims with a shell record,  CBP was required to certify the approved claim for payment within 21  days of receiving the electronic summary of the claim.", "Under modernization, claims must be filed electronically. The  drawback claim is transmitted electronically via ACE and supporting  documentation, when required, is uploaded via the Document Image  System component of ACE. CBP officials explained that the  transition to ACE had automated the initial intake process of drawback  claims. Instead of a drawback specialist having to manually validate  the claim for completeness and mail a response back to the claimant,  ACE is able to make that determination within seconds and provide  immediate feedback to the claimant on whether the claim is accepted  or, if rejected, what errors need to be addressed.  2.  Claim review. CBP policy before and after modernization has been to  require a full or limited desk review of selected claims, according to  CBP officials. Claims necessitating a drawback specialist\u2019s full desk  review will undergo a more comprehensive verification of the  complete drawback claim that often requires additional information  from the claimant. If additional information is required to process the  drawback claim, CBP will send a formal request for information to the  claimant. Additionally, CBP officials said that before and after  modernization, if CBP identified compliance issues during its review of  a drawback claim, the drawback specialist could target any  subsequent claims filed by the claimant for a limited desk review.  According to CBP officials, the time it takes a drawback specialist to  conduct a desk review varies by claim, based on the nature of the  claim and the experience of the drawback specialist. CBP reported  that it could take more than 3 years for CBP to conduct a full desk  review and determine the final disposition of a drawback claim.  3.  Claim liquidation and payment. Prior to modernization, CBP would  manually verify that drawback claimants had the accelerated payment  privilege on file. CBP stated that claimants with the privilege of  accelerated payment of drawback generally received their refunds 14  days after CBP accepted claims and authorized accelerated payment.  Now, under drawback modernization, a claimant can receive  accelerated payment without a drawback specialist\u2019s involvement.  ACE is programmed to automatically make accelerated payment on  claims that have on file the accelerated payment privilege and a  drawback bond that equals or exceeds the amount of the claim(s).  CBP stated that claimants with the privilege of accelerated payment  generally receive their refunds within 21 days of claim acceptance.", "Before and after modernization, drawback claims are set to  automatically liquidate if all the designated import entries within a  claim are liquidated and final within 1 year of the claim date, according  to CBP officials. CBP officials said that drawback specialists must  extend the claim to prevent it from automatically liquidating before the  necessary reviews have been completed. Drawback claims can be  extended for three 1-year periods. CBP officials explained that  liquidation extensions are intended to provide additional time to obtain  information or documentation necessary to complete the review of a  drawback claim. If the claimant fails to provide documents as directed,  or if the documents do not support the claim as presented, the claim  will be liquidated based on the information on file, which may result in  liquidation at $0, or other diminishment, as appropriate.", "CBP officials described the liquidation and payment of drawback  claims with and without accelerated payment privileges, as follows. At  the time of liquidation, for claims with accelerated payment privileges,  ACE issues an additional refund if the final claimed amount is greater  than the accelerated payment amount, or a bill, if the accelerated  payment amount is greater than the final claimed amount. If the  accelerated payment amount is the same as the amount determined  at liquidation, no further action is necessary. For claims without  accelerated payment privileges, ACE will issue a refund for the  drawback amount approved at liquidation. Claimants have 30 days  from the issuance of a bill to repay CBP any amount due. Claims may  be reliquidated up to 90 days from the date of an original liquidation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kim Frankena (Assistant  Director), Alana Miller (Analyst-in-Charge), Andrew Kurtzman, and Esther  Toledo made key contributions to this report.
