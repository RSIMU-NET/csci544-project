Cooperative agreements between federal and nonfederal firefighting entities--which are developed and agreed to by the entities involved--provide the framework for cost sharing and typically list several cost-sharing methods available to the entities. The agreements GAO reviewed, however, often lacked clear guidance for federal and nonfederal officials to use in deciding which method to apply to a specific fire. As a result, cost-sharing methods were applied inconsistently within and among states, even for fires with similar characteristics. For example, GAO found that in one state, the costs for suppressing a large fire that threatened homes were shared solely according to the proportion of acres burned within each entity's area of fire protection responsibility, a method that traditionally has been used. Yet, costs for a similar fire within the same state were shared differently. For this fire, the state agreed to pay for certain aircraft and fire engines used to protect the wildland-urban interface, while the remaining costs were shared on the basis of acres burned. In contrast to the two methods used in this state, officials in another state used yet a different cost-sharing method for two similar large fires that threatened homes, apportioning costs each day for personnel, aircraft, and equipment deployed on particular lands, such as the wildland-urban interface. The type of cost-sharing method ultimately used is important because it can have significant financial consequences for the entities involved, potentially amounting to millions of dollars. Both federal and nonfederal agency officials raised a number of concerns about the current cost-sharing framework. First, some federal officials were concerned that because guidance is unclear about which cost-sharing methods are most appropriate in particular circumstances, it can be difficult to reach agreement with nonfederal officials on a method that all parties believe distributes suppression costs equitably. Second, some nonfederal officials expressed concerns that the emergence of alternative cost-sharing methods is causing nonfederal entities to bear a greater share of fire suppression costs than in the past. In addition, both federal and nonfederal officials believed that the inconsistent application of these cost-sharing methods has led to inequities among states in the proportion of costs borne by federal and nonfederal entities. Finally, some federal officials also expressed concern that the current framework for sharing costs insulates state and local governments from the increasing costs of protecting the wildland-urban interface. Therefore, nonfederal entities may have a reduced incentive to take steps that could help mitigate fire risks, such as requiring homeowners to use fire-resistant materials and landscaping. On the basis of a review of previous federal reports and interviews with federal and nonfederal officials, GAO believes that these concerns may reflect a more fundamental issue--that federal and nonfederal entities have not clearly defined their basic financial responsibilities for wildland fire suppression, particularly those for protecting the wildland-urban interface."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss how federal and nonfederal  entities share the costs of suppressing wildland fires that burn or threaten  both federal and nonfederal lands and resources. As you know, fighting  wildland fires\u2014which can burn across federal, state, and local  jurisdictions\u2014requires significant investments of firefighting personnel,  aircraft, equipment, and supplies, resulting in substantial and increasing  fire suppression expenditures. Since 2000, federal suppression  expenditures alone have averaged more than $1 billion annually.  Firefighting efforts are mobilized through an interagency incident  management system, which depends on the close cooperation and  coordination of federal, state, tribal, and local fire protection entities. At  the federal level, five principal agencies are involved in firefighting  efforts\u2014the Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture and the  Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife  Service, and National Park Service within the Department of the Interior.  Federal and nonfederal firefighting entities share their personnel,  equipment, and supplies and work together to fight fires, regardless of  which entity has jurisdiction over the burning lands. Agreements between  cooperating entities, commonly referred to as master agreements, govern  these cooperative fire protection efforts and include general provisions for  sharing firefighting costs.", "My testimony today summarizes the findings of our report released on  June 13, 2006, which discusses (1) how federal and nonfederal entities  share the costs of suppressing wildland fires that burn or threaten both of  their lands and resources and (2) concerns federal and nonfederal entities  have with the existing cost-sharing framework. To address these  objectives, we reviewed applicable federal statutes, policies, and  procedures; and federal and nonfederal studies related to wildland fire  suppression costs. We reviewed master agreements between federal and  nonfederal entities governing cooperative fire protection in 12 western  states that frequently experience wildland fires. We also reviewed fire  records and interviewed federal and nonfederal firefighting officials to  discuss methods chosen to share suppression costs for eight recent fires\u2014 two each in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah\u2014which burned or  threatened both federal and nonfederal lands and resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Although wildland fires triggered by lightning are a natural, inevitable, and  in many cases a necessary ecological process, past federal fire suppression  policies have led to an accumulation of fuels and contributed to larger and  more severe wildland fires. In recent years, both the number of acres  burned by wildland fires and the costs to suppress fires have been  increasing. From 1995 through 1999, wildland fires burned an average of  4.1 million acres each year; from 2000 through 2004, the fires burned an  average of 6.1 million acres each year\u2014an increase of almost 50 percent.  During the same periods, the costs incurred by federal firefighting entities  to suppress wildland fires more than doubled, from an average of  $500 million annually to about $1.3 billion annually. Although efforts to  fight these larger, more severe fires have accounted for much of the  increase in suppression costs, the continuing development of homes and  communities in areas at risk from wildland fires and the efforts to protect  these structures also contribute to the increasing costs. Forest Service and  university researchers estimate that about 44 million homes in the lower  48 states are located in the wildland-urban interface. When fire threatens  the wildland-urban interface, firefighting entities often need to use  substantial resources\u2014including firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft to  drop retardant\u2014to fight the fire and protect homes.", "As wildland fire suppression costs have continued to rise, increasing  attention has focused on how suppression costs for multijurisdictional  fires are shared. To share suppression costs for a specific fire, local  representatives of federal and nonfederal firefighting entities responsible  for protecting lands and resources affected by the fire\u2014guided by the  terms of the master agreement\u2014decide which costs will be shared and for  what period. They document their decisions in a cost-sharing agreement  for that fire. According to federal officials, cooperating entities  traditionally shared suppression costs on the basis of the proportion of  acres burned in each entity\u2019s protection area because the method was  relatively easy to apply and works well when the lands affected by a  wildland fire are similar.

The federal government paid the full costs for the northern portion of the  fire.", "For the Florida Fire, federal and nonfederal officials were unable to reach  an agreement on how to share costs. Officials from the affected national  forest proposed a cost-sharing agreement, whereby the state would pay  the costs of firefighting personnel, equipment, and aircraft used to protect  the wildland-urban interface, and all other fire suppression costs would be  paid by the federal government. The state official, however, did not agree  with this proposal. He believed that the Forest Service, not the state, was  responsible for protecting areas of the wildland-urban interface threatened  by the Florida Fire and that he was not authorized to agree to the terms of  the proposed agreement.", "Methods used to share suppression costs for fires with similar  characteristics also varied among states. For example, costs for the fires  we reviewed in California and Colorado were shared using methods  different from those used for similar fires we reviewed in Arizona and  Utah.", "In California, federal and nonfederal officials agreed to share the costs of  two fires using the cost-apportionment method\u2014that is, costs were  apportioned on the basis of where firefighting personnel and equipment  were deployed.

According to federal and state officials, the nonfederal entities bore a  larger share of the cost than they would have under an acres-burned  method because of the efforts to protect nonfederal lands and resources.", "For the Pine Fire, using cost apportionment, federal entities paid $5.2  million, and nonfederal entities paid $8.1 million. Had an acres-burned  method been used, federal entities would have paid about $2 million less,  and nonfederal entities would have paid that much more. According to a  federal official who worked on apportioning costs for that fire, the higher  costs that the federal entities paid under cost apportionment were largely  due to extensive firefighting efforts on federal land to ensure that the fire  was extinguished.", "In Colorado and Utah, the differences in federal and state entities\u2019 shares  between the methods used and the acres-burned method were less  pronounced, likely because the cost-sharing methods used still relied  heavily on acres burned. In each case, federal entities\u2019 shares would have  been more and nonfederal shares less had an acres-burned method been  used, due to the efforts to protect the wildland-urban interface. For  example, the federal share of costs for the Blue Springs Fire in Utah would  have been about $400,000 more and the nonfederal share that much less if  an acres-burned method had been used for the whole fire.

A federal official said that  because of the state officials\u2019 unwillingness to use a method other than  acres burned on one of the fires and because of the lack of clear guidance  about which cost-sharing method should be used, he agreed to use an  acres-burned method and did not seek a cost-sharing agreement that  would have assigned more of the costs to the nonfederal entities. Some  federal officials in Arizona expressed similar views, saying that the lack of  clear guidance on sharing costs can make it difficult to reach agreement  with nonfederal officials.

State officials  said that if a state\u2019s suppression costs in a given year exceed the funds  budgeted, they must seek additional state funds, which can be difficult.  Moreover, they said, in many states, protecting structures is primarily a  local responsibility, and many local entities are unable to pay the costs of  fighting a large fire that threatens the wildland-urban interface.

As we have previously reported, a variety of protective  measures are available to help protect structures from wildland fire  including (1) reducing vegetation and flammable objects within an area of  30 to 100 feet around a structure and (2) using fire-resistant roofing  materials and covering attic vents with mesh screens. However, some  homeowners and homebuilders resist using these protective measures  because they are concerned about aesthetics, time, or cost. As a result,  federal and nonfederal officials said, it can be politically difficult for state  and local governments to adopt\u2014and enforce\u2014laws requiring such  measures, and many at-risk areas have not done so. The states and  communities we visited exhibited various degrees of progress in adopting  laws requiring protective measures. For example, California requires  homeowners in the wildland-urban interface to maintain 100 feet of  defensible space and, in areas at particularly high risk from wildland fires,  also requires new structures to be constructed with fire-resistant roofing  materials and vents. The other states we visited do not have such  statewide requirements, but they are taking a variety of steps to require or  encourage protective measures. For example, Utah passed a law in 2004  requiring its counties to adopt standards for landscaping and building  materials if they want to be eligible to receive state funds to assist with fire  suppression costs. Other counties had efforts underway to educate  homeowners about measures they could use to reduce their risk without  requiring that such measures be used.", "Federal officials expressed concern\u2014and some nonfederal officials  acknowledged\u2014that the use of cost-sharing methods that assign more  costs to federal entities, and the availability of federal emergency  assistance, insulate state and local governments from the cost of providing  wildland fire protection. These federal officials pointed out that wildland  fires threatening structures often require added suppression efforts. Under  some cost-sharing methods, such as acres burned, federal entities often  end up paying a large proportion of the costs for these efforts. Some  federal and nonfederal officials also noted that the availability of FEMA  assistance to nonfederal entities\u2014which can amount to 75 percent of  allowable fire suppression costs for eligible fires\u2014further insulates state  and local governments from the cost of protecting the wildland-urban  interface. Of the eight fires included in our review, nonfederal officials  were seeking reimbursement for the allowable costs of the five fires that  FEMA determined met eligibility requirements. Federal officials suggested  that to the extent that state and local governments are insulated from the  cost of protecting the wildland-urban interface, these governments may  have a reduced incentive to adopt laws requiring homeowners and  homebuilders to use protective measures that could help mitigate fire  risks. Some officials said that by requiring homeowners and homebuilders  to take such measures, more of the cost of protecting the wildland-urban  interface would then be borne by those who chose to live there."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials\u2019 Concerns May Reflect Ambiguity over Financial Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our review of previous federal reports and interviews with  federal and nonfederal officials, we believe that the concerns we identified  may reflect a more fundamental issue\u2014that federal and nonfederal  firefighting entities have not clearly defined their fundamental financial  responsibilities for wildland fire suppression, particularly those for  protecting the wildland-urban interface. Federal officials said that the  continuing expansion of the wildland-urban interface and rising fire  suppression costs for protecting these areas have increased the  importance of resolving these issues. Federal wildland fire management  policy states that protecting structures is the responsibility of state, tribal,  and local entities; but the policy also says that, under a formal fire  protection agreement specifying the financial responsibilities of each  entity, federal agencies can assist nonfederal entities in protecting the  exterior of structures threatened by wildland fire. Federal and nonfederal  officials agreed that federal agencies can assist with such actions, but they  did not agree on which entities are responsible for bearing the costs of  these actions. Federal officials told us that the purpose of this policy is to  allow federal agencies to use their personnel and equipment to help  protect homes but not to bear the financial responsibility of providing that  protection. Nonfederal officials, however, said that these actions are  intended to keep a wildland fire from reaching structures, and financial  responsibility should therefore be shared between both federal and  nonfederal entities.", "Further, the presence of structures adjacent to federal lands can  substantially alter fire suppression strategies and raise costs. A previous  federal report and federal officials have questioned which entities are  financially responsible for suppression actions taken on federal lands but  intended primarily or exclusively to protect adjacent wildland-urban  interface. Fire managers typically use existing roads and geographic  features, such as rivers and ridgelines, as firebreaks to help contain  wildland fires. If, however, homes and other structures are located  between a fire and such natural firebreaks, firefighters may have to  construct other firebreaks and rely more than they otherwise would on  aircraft to drop fire retardant to protect the structures, thereby increasing  suppression costs. Nonfederal officials in several states, however,  questioned the appropriateness of assigning to nonfederal entities the  costs for suppression actions taken on federal lands. These officials, as  well as officials from the National Association of State Foresters, said that  accumulated fuels on federal lands is resulting in more severe wildland  fires and contributing to the increased cost of fire suppression. They also  said that federal agencies are responsible for keeping wildland fires from  burning off federal land and should, therefore, bear the costs of doing so.  Federal officials in the states we visited recognized this responsibility, but  some also said that with the growing awareness that wildland fires are  inevitable in many parts of the country, policy should recognize that  wildland fires will occur and are likely to burn across jurisdictional  boundaries. In their view, those who own property in areas at risk of  wildland fires share a portion of the financial responsibility for protecting  it. Previous federal agency reports also have recognized this issue and  have called for clarifying financial responsibility for such actions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Wildland fires are inevitable and will continue to affect both federal and  nonfederal lands and resources. Federal, state, and local firefighting  entities have taken great strides to develop a cooperative fire protection  system so that these entities can effectively work together to respond to  these fires.

The need for clear  guidance on when to use a particular cost-sharing method is becoming  more acute as the wildland-urban interface continues to grow and  wildland fire suppression costs continue to increase. Before such guidance  can be developed, however, federal and nonfederal entities must agree on  which entity is responsible for the costs of protecting areas where federal  and nonfederal lands and resources are adjacent or intermingled,  particularly in the wildland-urban interface. Without explicit delineation of  financial responsibilities, federal and nonfederal entities\u2019 concerns about  how these costs are shared are likely to continue.", "Thus, to strengthen the framework for sharing wildland fire suppression  costs, we recommended that the Secretaries of Agriculture and the  Interior, working in conjunction with relevant state entities, provide more  specific guidance as to when particular cost-sharing methods should be  used and clarify the financial responsibilities for suppressing fires that  burn, or threaten to burn, across multiple jurisdictions.", "In responding to our report, the Forest Service and the Department of the  Interior generally agreed with the findings and recommendations.
