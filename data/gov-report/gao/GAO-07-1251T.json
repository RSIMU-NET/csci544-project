In 1986, legislation passed that allowed ANCs to participate in the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a) program. Since then, Congress has extended special procurement advantages to 8(a) ANC firms, such as the ability to receive sole-source contracts for any dollar amount and to own multiple subsidiaries in the 8(a) program. We were asked to testify on an earlier report where we identified (1) trends in the government's 8(a) contracting with ANC firms, (2) the reasons agencies have awarded 8(a) sole-source contracts to ANC firms and the facts and circumstances behind some of these contracts, and (3) how ANCs are using the 8(a) program. GAO also evaluated SBA's oversight of 8(a) ANC firms. GAO made recommendations aimed at improving SBA's oversight of 8(a) ANC contracting activity and ensuring that procuring agencies properly oversee 8(a) contracts they award to ANC firms. SBA has either taken action or plans to take action on the recommendations. The procuring agencies generally agreed with our recommendation to them. We believe implementation of our recommendations will provide better oversight of 8(a) ANC contracting activity and provide decision makers with information to know whether the program is operating as intended."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While representing a small amount of total federal procurement spending, obligations for 8(a) contracts to ANC firms increased from $265 million in fiscal year 2000 to $1.1 billion in 2004. Over the 5-year period, agencies obligated $4.6 billion to ANC firms, of which $2.9 billion, or 63 percent, went through the 8(a) program. During this period, six federal agencies--the departments of Defense, Energy, the Interior, State, and Transportation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--accounted for over 85 percent of 8(a) contracting activity. Obligations for 8(a) sole source contracts by these agencies to ANC firms increased from about $180 million in fiscal year 2000 to about $876 million in fiscal year 2004. ANCs use the 8(a) program as one of many tools to generate revenue with the goal of providing benefits to their shareholders. Some ANCs are heavily reliant on the 8(a) program for revenues, while others approach the program as one of many revenue-generating opportunities. GAO found that some ANCs have increasingly made use of the congressionally authorized advantages afforded to them. One of the key practices is the creation of multiple 8(a) subsidiaries, sometimes in highly diversified lines of business. From fiscal year 1988 to 2005, ANC 8(a) subsidiaries increased from one subsidiary owned by one ANC to 154 subsidiaries owned by 49 ANCs. In general, acquisition officials at the agencies reviewed told GAO that the option of using ANC firms under the 8(a) program allows them to quickly, easily, and legally award contracts for any value. They also noted that these contracts help them meet small business goals. In reviewing selected large sole-source 8(a) contracts awarded to ANC firms, GAO found that contracting officials had not always complied with certain requirements, such as notifying SBA of contract modifications and monitoring the percentage of work that is subcontracted. SBA, which is primarily responsible for implementing the 8(a) program, had not tailored its policies and practices to account for ANCs' unique status and growth in the 8(a) program, even though SBA officials recognized that ANCs enter into more complex business relationships than other 8(a) participants. Areas where SBA's oversight fell short included determining whether more than one subsidiary of the same ANC was generating a majority of its revenue in the same primary industry, consistently determining whether awards to 8(a) ANC firms had resulted in other small businesses losing contract opportunities, and ensuring that the partnerships between 8(a) ANC firms and large firms were functioning in the way they were intended."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our April 2006 report on Alaska  Native Corporation (ANC) 8(a) firms. In December 1971, Congress  enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to resolve long-standing  aboriginal land claims and to foster economic development for Alaska  Natives. This legislation created ANCs, which would become the vehicle  for distributing land and monetary benefits to Alaska Natives in lieu of a  reservation system. As of December 2005, there were 13 regional ANCs  and 182 village, urban, and group corporations.", "In 1986, legislation was enacted that allowed ANC-owned firms to  participate in the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) 8(a) program\u2014 one of the federal government\u2019s primary means for developing small  businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  Since then, Congress has extended special procurement advantages to  ANC firms. For example, ANC firms are permitted to receive  noncompetitive contracts for any amount, whereas other 8(a) companies  are subject to competitive thresholds of $5 million for manufacturing  contracts or $3 million for all other contracts. ANCs can also own multiple  subsidiaries participating in the 8(a) program, unlike other 8(a) firms that  may own only one in a lifetime and no more than 20 percent of another  8(a) firm.", "Our 2006 report on 8(a) ANC contracting identified (1) trends in  contracting with ANC firms, (2) the reasons agencies have awarded   8(a) sole-source contracts to ANC firms and the facts and circumstances  behind some of these contracts, and (3) how ANCs are using the   8(a) program.

It is important to note that there is no readily  available central source of information on ANC 8(a) contracting activity.  We obtained each ANC firm\u2019s Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS)  number and used this information to obtain data from the Federal  Procurement Data System (FPDS) and agencies. To assess the reliability  of the procurement data, we (1) compared FPDS and agency data to verify  its accuracy, (2) reviewed related documentation, including contract files,  and (3) worked closely with agency officials to identify and resolve any  data problems. When we found discrepancies, we brought them to the  agency\u2019s attention and worked with them to correct the discrepancies  before conducting our analyses. We also analyzed 16 large, sole-source  8(a) contracts awarded to ANC firms from the departments of Defense,  Energy, the Interior, State, Transportation, and Homeland Security and the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We selected the  contracts based on high ultimate award values and high dollar obligations  that represented a variety of contractors and services.  We traveled to  Alaska and met with executives of 13 regional ANCs and 17 village or  urban corporations. The report on which this testimony is based was  prepared in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "Our work did not include within its scope an objective or analyses that  either support or challenge special ANC advantages within the 8(a)  program.

For  example:    Federal regulation requires that when 8(a) firms subcontract under an  8(a) service contract, they incur at least 50 percent of the personnel  costs with their own employees. The purpose of this provision, which  limits the amount of work that can be performed by the subcontractor,  is to ensure that small businesses do not pass along the benefits of  their contracts to their subcontractors.

Without stronger  oversight, we noted the potential for abuse and unintended consequences.", "In our April 2006 report, we made 10 recommendations to SBA on actions  that can be taken to revise its regulations and policies and to improve  practices pertaining to its oversight of ANC 8(a) procurements. Our  recommendations and SBA\u2019s June 2007 response are as follows.", "We recommended that the Administrator of SBA:  1.  Ascertain and then clearly articulate in regulation how SBA will  comply with existing law to determine whether and when one or more  ANC firms are obtaining, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair  competitive advantage in an industry.", "SBA response: SBA is exploring possible regulatory changes that  would address the issue of better controlling the award of sole- source 8(a) contracts over the competitive threshold dollar  limitation to joint ventures between tribally and ANC-owned 8(a)  firms and other business concerns.  2.  In regulation, specifically address SBA\u2019s role in monitoring ownership  of ANC holding companies that manage 8(a) operations to ensure that  the companies are wholly owned by the ANC and that any changes in  ownership are reported to SBA.", "SBA response: SBA is building a Business Development  Management Information System to electronically manage all  aspects of the 8(a) program. According to SBA, this system,  scheduled to be completed in fiscal year 2008, will monitor  program participants\u2019 continuing eligibility in the 8(a) program and  could include an ANC element in the electronic annual review that  would monitor the ownership of ANC holding companies that  manage 8(a) operations and ensure that any changes in ownership  are reported to SBA.  3.  Collect information on ANCs\u2019 8(a) participation as part of required  overall 8(a) monitoring, to include tracking the primary revenue  generators for 8(a) ANC firms to ensure that multiple subsidiaries  under one ANC are not generating their revenue in the same primary  industry.", "SBA response: The planned electronic annual review can collect  information on ANCs\u2019 multiple subsidiaries to ensure that they are  not generating the majority of their revenues from the same  primary industry. Further, to ensure that an ANC-owned firm does  not enter the 8(a) program with the same North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) code as another current or former  8(a) firm owned by that ANC, the ANC-owned applicant must  certify that it operates in a distinct primary industry and must  demonstrate that fact through revenues generated. SBA notes that  the planned annual electronic reviews can validate this  information.  4.  Revisit regulation that requires agencies to notify SBA of all contract  modifications and consider establishing thresholds for notification,  such as when new NAICS codes are added to the contract or there is a  certain percentage increase in the dollar value of the contract. Once  notification criteria are determined, provide guidance to the agencies  on when to notify SBA of contract modifications and scope changes.", "SBA response: SBA stated that its revisions to its partnership  agreements with federal agencies address this recommendation.  However, we note that the revised agreement does not establish  thresholds or include new criteria for when agencies should send  SBA contract modifications or award documentation. The  agreement states that agencies \u201cshall provide a copy of any  contract\u2026including basic contracts, orders, modifications, and  purchase orders\u201d to SBA.  5.  Consistently determine whether other small businesses are losing  contracting opportunities when awarding contracts through the 8(a)  program to ANC firms.", "SBA response: SBA stated that it plans to require the contracting  agencies to include impact statements in their contract offer letters  to SBA.  6.  Standardize approval letters for each 8(a) procurement to clearly  assign accountability for monitoring of subcontracting and for  notifying SBA of contract modifications.", "SBA response: SBA agreed with the recommendation but did not  indicate an action taken or planned.  7.  Tailor wording in approval letters to explain the basis for adverse  impact determinations.", "SBA response: SBA agreed with the recommendation but did not  indicate an action taken or planned.  8.  Clarify memorandums of understanding (known as partnership  agreements) with procuring agencies to state that it is the agency  contracting officer\u2019s responsibility to monitor compliance with the  limitation on subcontracting clause.", "SBA response: SBA has implemented this recommendation by  revising the partnership agreements with the procuring agencies. It  added several provisions that delineate the agencies\u2019  responsibilities for oversight, monitoring, and compliance with  procurement laws and regulations governing 8(a) contracts,  including the limitation on subcontracting clause.  9.  Evaluate staffing levels and training needed to effectively oversee ANC  participation in the 8(a) program and take steps to allocate appropriate  resources to the Alaska district office.", "SBA response: SBA stated that the planned Business Development  Management Information System should help the Alaska district  office more effectively oversee ANC participation in the 8(a)  program. It stated that it is providing training to the Alaska district  office. However, no plans were in place to evaluate staffing levels  at the office.  10. Provide more training to agencies on the 8(a) program, specifically  including a component on ANC 8(a) participation.", "SBA response: SBA has provided training to agencies on the  revised 8(a) partnership agreements; however, our review of the  slides SBA used for the training found no reference to ANC 8(a)  firms specifically. According to an SBA official, SBA will include a  component on ANC 8(a) participants in future training sessions.", "We also recommended that procuring agencies provide guidance to  contracting officers to ensure proper oversight of ANC contracts. The  procuring agencies generally agreed with the recommendation. Some  agencies are waiting for SBA to implement our recommendations before  they take their own actions, but others have taken steps to tighten their  oversight of contracts with 8(a) ANC firms. The Department of Homeland  Security, for example, recently issued an \u201cacquisition alert\u201d requiring that  its heads of contracting activities provide guidance and training on the use  of 8(a) firms owned by ANCs. The alert provides that use of the authority  to award sole-source 8(a) contracts to ANCs must be judicious with  appropriate safeguards to ensure that the cost/price is fair and reasonable,  that the ANC has the technical ability to perform the work, that the ANC  will be performing the required percentage of the work and that the award  is in the best interests of the government. The Department of Energy  revised its acquisition guidance regarding small business programs to  remind contracting officers to use care in awarding and administering  ANC contracts, to include notifying SBA of contract modifications and  monitoring the limits on subcontracting. The Department also provided  training on the 8(a) program, to include contracting with ANC firms. By  providing contracting officers with appropriate training on these issues,  the government is taking steps to ensure that the ANC firms are operating  in the program as intended, thereby mitigating the risk of unintended  consequences or abuse of some of the privileges provided to these firms.", "This concludes my testimony.
