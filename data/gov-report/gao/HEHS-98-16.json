It is expected to cost this country billions of dollars annually, with severe consequences to patients and informal caregivers as well as to the health care system. Valid estimates of disease prevalence\u2014that is, how many people have a disease at a given time\u2014as well as projections of prevalence in the future, can play an important role in setting health research priorities and in identifying the need for services. A number of published studies have cited AD prevalence rates that range from 2 percent to 12 percent of the population older than 64.", "Meta-analysis is an analytic method that can be used, as we do in this report, to (1) estimate the number of people with AD, (2) project the numbers of people with AD in the near future, and (3) determine the prevalence rates of AD for both men and women of specific ages. Meta-analysis uses existing studies to quantitatively integrate prevalence data. This approach uses data from all relevant studies to derive prevalence estimates that are not likely to be affected by the biases of any individual studies. Because of limitations associated with the estimates presented in this report, we also identify ongoing efforts by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to develop more accurate prevalence estimates, including ones applicable to racial and ethnic minorities.", "Our analysis was developed from 18 studies (see app. I) that (1) estimate prevalence rates for populations that are considered relevant to the United States and (2) use widely accepted diagnostic criteria for finding cases of AD (see app. II for a list of the criteria). Many of the studies we relied on are of European populations. The major limitation of the studies is that they include mainly whites and few members of the other racial groups that are part of the U.S. population, such as African-Americans and Asian-Americans. However, since whites currently represent a majority (about 83 percent of the population in 1997), we would not expect our results to change substantially if others were represented in proportion to their numbers.", "Using meta-analysis, we integrated the prevalence estimates in order to provide age- and gender-specific estimates of AD prevalence rates. We used the prevalence rates, in combination with population estimates and projections from the Bureau of the Census, to estimate (1) the number of Americans in 1995 with AD at any level of severity and those with moderate or severe AD and (2) the number of Americans likely to have the disease in the near future.", "We also adjusted the overall AD prevalence estimates to account for two limitations of the age- and gender-specific rates presented in the literature. Specifically, we estimated the AD prevalence rates, over all ages and both genders, that would be obtained if all studies (1) counted cases of mixed dementia\u2014persons with both AD and another kind of dementia\u2014as cases of AD and (2) corrected the estimates, when necessary, for the expected number of cases missed by insufficiently sensitive screens.", "At all stages of our work, we consulted with experts in the fields of AD, disease measurement, and the quantitative integration of research results, including experts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Details of our methods for (1) defining and locating the most relevant studies, (2) extracting prevalence rates from them, and (3) integrating these rates quantitatively are provided in appendixes III, IV, and V, respectively. Our evaluation of some of the strengths and limitations of the studies integrated is presented in appendix VI. Our adjustments to the data are described in appendix VII.", "We conducted our study from May 1995 to December 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["AD is a kind of dementia, with the essential feature the development of multiple cognitive deficits, including memory impairment, and at least one other deficit, such as impaired language functioning (aphasia). The definition of dementia also requires that the condition be severe enough to cause a significant impairment in social or occupational functioning that represents a decline from a previous level of functioning. Common clinical signs of dementia include emotional and behavioral disturbances.", "AD is a dementia of gradual onset and progressive decline. It may be difficult to distinguish clinically between mild\u2014that is, early\u2014AD and normal aging, but severe AD is characterized by a need for much help with personal care as the result of incontinence and almost total lack of comprehension of the environment. AD is said to be differentiated from other dementias on the basis of its cause, but that cause is not, in fact, well understood. That AD is accepted as a distinct disease entity is because AD patients manifest specific kinds of abnormalities in the brain\u2014observable only in those who are autopsied or undergo a brain biopsy, a rare procedure\u2014differing from the abnormalities found in other dementias with better understood causes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Measuring the Extent of AD", "paragraphs": ["The prevalence of AD is defined as the number of people in a specific population who suffer from the disease at some specified time. It is often expressed as a rate, the number of cases of that disease existing at a given point in time divided by the total population at that same time. When the number of cases in the target population is too costly to count, prevalence may be estimated by testing, in a prevalence survey, a representative sample of the population. An alternative is to develop a register of people seeking services, but this does not work well for AD because many cases are not treated.", "The restriction of AD prevalence surveys to the elderly population, 65 years of age or older, makes sense because the majority of cases of AD are elderly. In addition, because AD prevalence tends to increase sharply with age, doubling about every 5 years, at least over the age range of 65 to 85 years, it is common to estimate age-specific prevalence rates of AD. Thus, the population studied is divided into age groups\u2014for example, 65 to 69 years, 70 to 74 years, 75 to 79 years\u2014and a prevalence rate is estimated for each group. This is especially important when comparing AD rates across groups so that differences in prevalence stemming from differences in age distribution can be separated from those stemming from real health differences.", "Although the dependence of AD rates on gender is not as well established in the scientific literature as dependence on age, there is some tendency for prevalence to be greater for women than for men; therefore, rates that are specific to both age and gender are of interest. The reasons for this tendency are not known. It may be that (1) women are more likely than men to contract the disease or (2) women live longer once they get AD and are therefore more likely to be counted when a prevalence survey is conducted or (3) both of these factors operate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measuring the Severity of AD", "paragraphs": ["When severity is measured, people with AD are categorized into degrees or levels of illness; thus, for every specific prevalence rate, several categories are used to describe the different levels of severity. For the dementias (including AD), descriptive categories like mild, moderate, and severe are commonly used to indicate how severe a person\u2019s AD is. Sometimes a borderline category, \u201cquestionable,\u201d is used for those whose impairment is not great enough to qualify as even mild AD. Today, there are standardized systems for rating severity, often using such descriptive categories. According to one system, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), a person with mild AD needs only prompting in personal care activities, a person with moderate AD needs some assistance, and a person with severe AD needs much assistance and is frequently incontinent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Estimated Number of People With AD", "paragraphs": ["The results of our meta-analysis, based on the pooling of the data of individuals from each of the studies, were used to project the numbers of Americans, in 1995, with (1) AD of any level of severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and (2) moderate or severe AD (see table 1). The AD prevalence estimates are generated by multiplying prevalence rates (discussed in the section below called \u201cEstimated Prevalence Rates\u201d) by the corresponding age- and gender-specific 1995 estimates from the Bureau of the Census.When these results are summed over the several age intervals and both genders, the overall estimate for Americans 65 years of age or older with any AD is 1.9 million. Of these 1.9 million cases, an estimated 1.1 million have moderate or severe AD.", "To see how this overall prevalence estimate compares with the projections that would be derived from individual studies, we calculated comparable estimates when it was possible to do so. Most of the people with AD\u201458 percent, or 1.1 million\u2014fall between the ages of 75 and 89. Within this age group, it was possible to project from 9 of the 15 studies dealing with any AD and provide age- and gender-specific estimates for the population based on each study. Two of the studies yield estimates below 1 million. Six fall between 1.1 million and 1.4 million; one (the East Boston study) provides the basis for an estimate of 3.2 million. (For further detail, see app. VIII.)", "These numbers correspond to overall percentages for Americans 65 years of age or older of 5.7 and 3.3 with any AD and with moderate or severe AD, respectively. When adjusted for the cases of mixed dementia and missed cases not included in some of the studies, these percentages become 6.3 and 4.1, respectively. As noted, individual studies of the AD prevalence rate have produced varied estimates of the percentage of elderly with any AD, ranging from less than 2 percent to 12 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Projections for Numbers of People With AD", "paragraphs": ["We also developed projections into the next century of the number of AD cases and the number of AD cases requiring assistance. We derived these results from the prevalence rates, which we used in conjunction with age- and gender-specific population projections from the Bureau of the Census. These projections, which take the aging of the U.S. population into account, are presented in 5-year intervals until 2015. As shown in table 2, based on the Bureau\u2019s middle series of population projections, the numbers of cases of AD are expected to increase approximately 12 percent every 5 years. When adjusted to include all mixed cases and missed cases, the numbers in this table increase by 10 percent and 24 percent for any AD and moderate or severe AD, respectively. These adjustments yield, for example, in 2015, 3.2 million cases for any AD and 2.1 million cases for moderate or severe AD.", "Because prevalence is partially determined by the length of time people with AD survive, improvements in AD care will tend to increase future prevalence, just as any general improvements in human longevity will.Thus, significant unanticipated improvements in the longevity of either the elderly in general or people with AD in particular may lead to even greater numbers of people with AD in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Prevalence Rates", "paragraphs": ["We developed age- and gender-specific prevalence rates based on our meta-analysis, stopping at the age of 95, when the data become sparse for both any AD and moderate or severe AD (see tables 3 and 4). Our first step in generating these estimates was to take severity of disease into account by excluding any data presented in the 18 published studies that included persons with questionable AD. Even with this exclusion, the estimates of AD prevalence for a given combination of age and gender that we obtained from the 18 studies varied greatly. (See app. II for a list of the studies.) For example, the estimated prevalence for men in the age interval from 85 to 95 ranged from 12 percent to 54 percent (see app. IV). Before attempting to integrate these data, we took severity of disease further into account by dealing separately with the three studies\u2014numbers 1, 5, and 18 (see table IV.1)\u2014that excluded mild cases.", "In our first integration of these data, the results of our meta-analysis show prevalence rates for any AD in the 15 studies that do not exclude mild cases.

These rates are each increased by 10 percent when all mixed cases and missed cases are included.", "These results demonstrate that the AD prevalence rate increases sharply with age, doubling about every 5 years at least until about the age of 85, as expected from previous reports of this relationship. In addition, the rate is greater for women than for men.", "In our second integration of these data, we included only studies that provided number of cases with moderate or severe AD. These studies either excluded mild cases (the three studies mentioned earlier) or enabled us to exclude mild cases by presenting the data for these cases separately (numbers 6 and 13). When only cases with moderate or severe AD are counted, the rates are lower. But the increase in prevalence with age and the higher rates for women are observed at the moderate and severe levels too. These rates are each increased by 24 percent when all cases of mixed dementia and missed cases are included.", "Two of the studies allow for the counting of only the cases with severe AD.

The results of these studies are expected to be published within the next several years. When they are, our knowledge about the extent of AD in the United States will be enhanced. Not only will our ability to estimate AD prevalence for the whole country improve but so will our ability to make such estimates for specific racial and ethnic populations. Projections for future numbers with AD will then be able to take into account the changing demographics of the country.", "The implications of these findings lie in the specific results and projections presented. The number of people with AD is at least 1.9 million now and can, with relatively conservative assumptions about population growth, be expected to grow to at least 2.9 million by 2015. Depending on severity, these cases will need some kind of long-term care. Such care will also be required by people with other disabling diseases, both dementias and nondementias.

First, NIA noted that only 3 of the 18 studies are of U.S. populations and questions whether our combining of U.S. and non-U.S. populations is warranted, given that the U.S. data tend to yield higher prevalence rates than do the non-U.S. data.", "Second, NIA was concerned about variation in how some of the studies we reviewed applied diagnostic criteria. The agency was concerned that most of the questionable cases in the studies reviewed, which we did not include in our estimates, were actually mild cases of dementia. Further, NIA believes that many of the studies we relied on had insufficiently sensitive initial screens that led to their missing many mild cases of dementia. NIA was also concerned that in many of the studies reviewed, only persons with pure AD were coded as cases of AD but not those persons with a mixed dementia, including AD as a component. Third, NIA commented that the meta-analytic method we used cannot compensate for the large differences in rates observed across studies.", "Although we have made some adjustments to account for NIA\u2019s criticisms, we believe our methodology remains useful for estimating AD prevalence. First, with regard to the use of non-U.S. studies, we note that when severity is taken into account, the results of U.S. and non-U.S. studies are comparable when one of the U.S. studies is excluded. This study, the East Boston study, yields prevalence estimates that are far higher than any of the other studies, suggesting a disparity in methodology rather than in population characteristics.", "As for NIA\u2019s criticisms related to diagnostic criteria, we recognize the utility of including cases of mixed dementia and of adjusting for insensitive screens; we have, therefore, included in this report estimates to reflect these adjustments. We disagree, however, with the idea that questionable cases should be included. Although such people may become demented, they do not at the time of the prevalence survey satisfy the accepted diagnostic criteria for dementia or AD.", "Finally, we disagree with NIA\u2019s conclusion that meta-analysis is an inappropriate method because of the heterogeneity of the prevalence rates in the studies we reviewed. With severity accounted for, 17 of the 18 studies we reviewed reported relatively homogeneous rates, with one outlying study.", "We also received a letter from the Alzheimer\u2019s Association expressing similar concerns about our methodology. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association is especially concerned about how forthcoming data from studies currently underway may change the picture of AD prevalence we present. Again, we acknowledge that NIA is supporting new and hopefully better studies of the extent of AD in the U.S. and that these should improve our understanding of how the disease is distributed in all the major subpopulations.", "The full text of NIA\u2019s comments, along with our response, is included in appendix IX.", "We will send copies of this report to the directors of the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute on Aging, and the Administration on Aging.

To integrate the data for a given level to arrive at estimates of age- and gender-specific prevalence, we used a method previously employed by Maria Corrada and her associates at Johns Hopkins University. This method, which pools the data of individuals from each of the studies, involves fitting a logistic regression model to the data\u2014age interval midpoints, gender, numbers of participants, numbers of cases, and levels of severity\u2014from a series of relevant prevalence studies so as to estimate the age- and gender-specific prevalence rates for each level of severity. Such a model implies that (1) AD prevalence at a given level is determined by age and gender and (2) the quantitative nature of the relationship is of the kind known to statisticians as logistic.", "Logistic regression models are similar to the more commonly encountered linear regression models, but they are especially designed to analyze variables that take on only two values (variables that may be called binary or dichotomous). An example of such a variable is the presence or absence of disease in a person. The status of all people in a population with respect to this binary variable determines the prevalence rate for that population. Thus, logistic regression is an appropriate method for analyzing data for prevalence rate.", "We applied the approach of Corrada and her colleagues. Our work differs from theirs both in that we were able to include some more recent studies than they were and in the way in which we took severity into account. The approach was applied to three sets of data. One set was composed of the age- and gender-specific AD prevalence rates from the 15 studies that include such rates for cases with any AD. The second set was composed of the rates from the five studies that include these rates for cases with moderate or severe AD. The third set was composed of the rates from the two studies that include these rates for cases with severe AD. The results of this application are presented in tables 3 and 4, which correspond to the first two sets of data. The results of the application to the third set are not presented because these results included relatively imprecise prevalence estimates. We did not extend our estimates beyond the age of 95 because of the few people in the study older than 95.", "These results can be compared with other reviews of the AD literature. Most published reviews of the literature on AD prevalence rates are qualitative. These reviews have not been designed so as to obtain prevalence estimates through a systematic quantitative integration of the study data, such as that provided by meta-analysis. One representative qualitative review notes that rates are typically estimated at about 0.5 percent, 3 percent, and 10 percent for the ages of 65, 75, and 85, respectively, both genders combined.

Although each sample represents a well-defined population and each population provides estimates of AD, the samples, taken individually or combined, are not representative of the U.S. population with respect to all likely determinants of the AD prevalence rate. Two of the possibly significant ways the study populations differ from the U.S. population are discussed here. In addition, the geographic difference must be acknowledged: most of the studies included in our analysis are based on European populations. We know of no argument, however, that the prevalence of AD for white Americans differs from that of Europeans.", "None of the studies include significant amounts of data from major U.S. subpopulations, such as blacks (that is, African-Americans). It is not known whether blacks or other minorities (for example, Native Americans) have different prevalence rates than do whites and Europeans. As indicated in appendix III, there is some evidence that Asian-American rates differ little from the rates of white populations, in spite of the racial similarity between Asian-Americans and Asians; Asian rates tend to be systematically lower than those for whites. If minorities do have different rates, it is desirable to know their rates for at least two reasons: (1) these rates affect the overall U.S. estimates and (2) the kinds of care these minorities require may differ, for cultural reasons, from the kinds required by other Americans. NIH supports research designed to compare the AD prevalence rates of different racial and ethnic groups.", "Most of the studies include institutionalized people in the populations they survey, but two of the three U.S. studies do not. Logically, one might expect that since AD rates for the institutionalized are most likely higher than those for the noninstitutionalized (that is, community dwellers), omitting the institutionalized would lower prevalence estimates. There is little evidence from a previous analysis, however, that such omission has any effect. Further, the two U.S. studies that omit the institutionalized present prevalence estimates that are high relative to those from most of the other studies. It may be that too small a proportion of the elderly population is institutionalized for the assumed higher AD prevalence rate to have mattered much in these studies. Nevertheless, prevalence studies of AD should ideally include all elderly people, whether institutionalized or noninstitutionalized. We have no reason to conclude, however, that variation across studies in the handling of institutional status compromises the validity of the estimates to any significant extent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adjustments Based on Alternative Conventions", "paragraphs": ["All prevalence studies are based on conventions that may be questioned. When a convention is judged to be inappropriate for a given purpose, it may lead to biased prevalence estimates. Our use of quantitative integration to generate estimates and projections is, in part, an attempt to get around some of the inappropriate conventions in individual studies by diluting them, if not by canceling them out.", "Two common conventions, in particular, seem inappropriate for our purposes, although they were reasonable to those who adopted them in the 1980s and early 1990s, when most of the reviewed work was done. One is that people with mixed dementia (AD and another kind of dementia) should not be counted as AD cases. Most of the studies we reviewed have counted as cases of AD only people with \u201cpure\u201d AD, AD in the absence of other dementia. Although this convention was useful for isolating those with no known cause of dementia\u2014those with AD only\u2014it is illogical if one wants to know how many people have AD. A person with both AD and another dementia is logically a person with AD. If we drop the usual convention and instead treat all cases of AD the same, regardless of other dementias, we can then infer that the estimates presented are too low. This is because only four of the studies include mixed cases in the age- and gender-specific AD rates; therefore, our estimates, based on an integration of the published rates, underestimate the true rates of all AD cases.", "Given the available data, it is not possible to derive, on the basis of our revised convention, age- and gender-specific estimates of the true rates of all AD. We can provide rough overall ones, however. Ten of the studies enable us to estimate the overall percentage increase in the number of AD cases that would be obtained if mixed cases are added. These estimates vary, with a median (middlemost) value of 20 percent. If none of the studies reviewed included mixed cases, then it would be reasonable to assume that this 20 percent is the adjustment factor needed to increase our estimates by taking into account the mixed cases. However, the 11 studies of mild or more severe dementia that do not include mixed cases in their AD counts also include only 29 percent of the participants in the studies of any AD; in addition, these 11 studies happen to use, on the average, relatively small samples. Thus, the value of 20 percent greater prevalence with mixed cases can only be applied to this 29 percent of the participants in the studies of any AD, yielding an overall percentage bias of 5.8 percent (20 percent times 29 percent).", "The 20-percent adjustment for mixed cases can also be applied to 90 percent of the participants in studies of moderate or severe AD since this is the percentage of participants in studies of similar populations that exclude mixed cases from their AD counts. The resulting adjustment factor is 18 percent (20 percent times 90 percent). When this factor is applied to the estimates given above, the findings for 1995 are 2 million people with AD of any kind and 1.3 million cases of moderate or severe AD, rather than the 1.9 million and 1.1 million, respectively, that were originally reported.", "The other common convention that now seems inappropriate is that prevalence counts are not corrected for the likely number of people with AD missed by initial screening tests (and therefore not given workups for dementia). In some of the studies we reviewed, we found a potential problem: Some AD cases were missed as a result of the use of insufficiently sensitive screens for which no corrections in the age- and gender-specific rates were made. When such a problem is likely, it is illogical to present prevalence rates without correcting the prevalence estimates for the expected number of people with AD missed by the screen. Because studies that do not avoid the problem of missed cases generate rates that are too low, our estimates, to the extent they are based on such studies, are underestimates of the true rates.", "As with the adjustment for mixed cases, it is not possible to derive age- and gender-specific rates adjusted for missed cases, but a rough overall adjustment factor can be derived. Of the 15 studies we reviewed that investigated mild dementia, 5 can be identified as having a known or possible problem with missed cases. Of these five studies, two present their overall percentage increases as a result of missed cases (although they do not correct the age- and gender-specific rates for these); the higher of these two increases is 7.2 percent. The correction rate undoubtedly varies with the specific screen used, but we adopted this 7.2 percent as a representative value. If all the studies we reviewed had a possible problem with missed cases, then it would be reasonable to assume that this 7.2 percent is the adjustment factor needed to increase our estimates so as to take into account the expected missed cases. The five studies known to have a possible problem with missed cases, however, use relatively large samples, including 50 percent of all participants in the studies of any AD. Thus, the value of 7.2 percent greater prevalence with missed cases can be applied only to the 50 percent of the participants in the studies of any AD, yielding an overall percentage bias of 3.6 percent (7.2 percent times 50 percent).", "The 7.2-percent adjustment for missed cases can also be applied to 71 percent of the participants in studies of moderate or severe AD. This is because 71 percent is the percentage of the participants in studies of severe AD without correction to all or part of the data for missed cases. The resulting adjustment factor is 5.1 percent (7.2 percent times 71 percent). These adjustments for missed cases, when made in addition to the adjustment for mixed dementia that was already made, yield an increase of 10 percent in 1995, for an adjusted estimate of 2.1 million cases for any AD. The corresponding adjustment for moderate or severe AD is 24 percent, for a 1995 total of 1.4 million cases at these levels of severity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of AD Cases for Persons 75 to 89 Years Old Based on Individual Studies and on the Meta-Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Table VIII.1 facilitates the comparison of the individual studies reviewed in the meta-analysis of the prevalence of any AD.

We disagree with NIA\u2019s comment about the countries in which the prevalence studies were conducted.

None of the populations studied, including those from the United States, is representative of the white U.S. population with respect to ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic variables, but these have not been shown to determine AD prevalence rates. The relatively high rates of the combined U.S. studies are driven by the contributions of a single study that focused on the population of East Boston. This study, the one that NIA bases its estimates on, yields rates that are higher than those of all other studies, including the other U.S. studies. The difference between the U.S. and non-U.S. studies reduces to a difference between East Boston and all other studies. 2.

The report has been changed to reflect the likely role of excluding mixed dementia. 5. To examine the role of heterogeneity among studies in our meta-analysis, we took the following steps: We analyzed the data for any AD, focusing on each study as a possible source of variation. Then we dropped the one study (East Boston) found to be a statistically significant source of variation relative to the set of studies as a whole, and we reanalyzed the remaining ones. No other study was a statistically significant source of variation, and thus the heterogeneity among studies was eliminated with the elimination of that single outlier. If the remaining studies are used to generate prevalence estimates, these are somewhat lower than the original ones, for example, by 5 percentage points for men at the age of 95.
