GAO analyzed fiscal year 2009 through 2013 data provided by VA\u2014the most recent years available; reviewed applicable federal laws, regulations, and program policies; visited six regional offices selected for their differing accuracy rates, workload, and geography; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of claims; and spoke with rating specialists, experts, and VSO representatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of older veterans receiving Individual Unemployability benefits, a disability supplement, has been increasing, as has the total amount of benefit payments. In fiscal year 2013, 330,000 veterans received this benefit, which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides to disabled veterans of any age who are unemployable because of service-connected disabilities. From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the most recent data available, there was a 22 percent increase in the number of veterans receiving these benefits, and a 73 percent increase in the subgroup of beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Moreover, among new beneficiaries in 2013, about 2,800 veterans were 75 and older, of which more than 400 were 90 and older. These trends have given rise to questions about what constitutes \u201cunemployability.\u201d Only a small proportion, 4 to 6 percent, of beneficiaries had benefits discontinued during these years\u2014about 70 percent of which were due to the death of the beneficiary. During the 5-year study period, disability payments to those receiving Individual Unemployability\u2014the base payment plus the supplement\u2014increased by 30 percent (to $11 billion in fiscal year 2013). For that year, GAO estimated $5.2 billion for the supplement alone.", "VA's procedures do not ensure that Individual Unemployability benefit decisions are well-supported. For example, contrary to federal internal control standards, the guidance on determining unemployability is incomplete for ensuring consistency. In discussion groups with GAO, VA's rating specialists said they disagreed on the factors they need to consider when determining unemployability, weighed the same factors differently, and had difficulty separating allowable from non-allowable factors. Some specialists said these challenges create the risk that two raters could examine the same evidence and reach an opposite decision to approve or deny a claim. Also, VA's quality assurance approach primarily checks the procedural accuracy of decisions and does not ensure a comprehensive assessment of whether decisions are complete, accurate, and consistent. In addition, VA does not independently verify self-reported earnings information supplied by applicants and beneficiaries, although the agency has access to Internal Revenue Service data for this purpose. VA officials said they are waiting for a data system, expected in 2016, to conduct verifications. However, by postponing verification of self-reported earnings, the benefit is at risk of being awarded to ineligible veterans.", "Based on a review of literature, GAO identified various options for revising eligibility requirements and the structure of the Individual Unemployability benefit. Six options focus on eligibility requirements, such as considering additional criteria when determining unemployability and applying an age cap of 65. The seventh option would change the benefit structure by reducing payments as beneficiaries earn income in excess of the poverty threshold. Experts and representatives of veterans service organizations (VSO) that GAO interviewed identified the potential strengths of each option (such as improved decision accuracy) and potential challenges (such as increased need for fiscal and administrative resources). In addition, VA's advisory committee recommended in 2012 that the agency study age and require vocational assessments when weighing veterans' unemployability; VA agreed to study both, but has not yet taken action."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA issue updated guidance to determine eligibility; identify a comprehensive quality assurance approach to assess benefit decisions; verify veterans' self-reported income; and move forward on studies suggested by its advisory committee.

When veterans are deemed to have a service-connected disability,  the level of compensation they are awarded is based on an assessment  of disability ranging from 0 to 100 percent (in increments of 10 percentage  points) and is intended to reflect an average loss in earning capacity  resulting from their service-connected disability. In recognition of its  position that \u201caverage loss\u201d does not always adequately compensate  individual veterans in their particular circumstances, VA provides a  supplemental compensation for veterans with a demonstrated need.  Specifically, the Total Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU) benefit  is provided to veterans, irrespective of age, who are deemed to be unable  to obtain or maintain gainful employment due to their service-connected  disability (VA assigns these veterans a 100 percent disability rating).", "In 2003, GAO designated federal disability programs, including VA\u2019s  Disability Compensation program, as high risk due in part to challenges  agencies face in keeping their criteria for evaluating disability and  determining compensation consistent with advances in medicine,  technology, and changes in the labor market and society. Meanwhile,  more veterans are receiving disability benefits, including TDIU, and many  disabled veterans are living longer and collecting disability benefits for  longer periods of time. These trends have led to questions regarding  TDIU benefits including whether this supplement to the regular disability  compensation benefit should be provided to veterans of retirement age.  For example, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), as part of a  broader examination to reduce the federal deficit, estimated that  restricting TDIU benefits to veterans younger than their full Social  Security retirement age would reduce costs by $15 billion between 2015  and 2023.

What alternative options have been proposed for revising the eligibility  requirements and design structure for TDIU benefits?", "To describe the age-related trends in the population of TDIU  beneficiaries, we obtained and analyzed data from VA regarding new and  continuing beneficiaries covering fiscal years 2009 through 2013 (the  most recently available data). The data included information such as the  beneficiaries\u2019 age, schedular disability ratings, benefit discontinuations  and total amounts paid in disability benefits. To assess the reliability of  the data, we obtained detailed information from agency officials on the  methods used to generate the data requested, including limitations and  assumptions made by VBA officials. In addition, we performed logic  testing of the computer program VA used to extract the data. Through  these means, we found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of analyzing age-related trends in the TDIU beneficiary  population and the benefit payments.", "To describe the procedures VA uses to support TDIU eligibility decisions,  we examined relevant federal laws, regulations and procedures for new  and continuing claim determination decisions, including the TDIU policy  manual and guidance documents. We also conducted interviews with VA  and its Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) officials in their central  office, and six regional offices. These offices were selected to represent a  range of TDIU caseloads, percentages of claims resulting in granted  benefits, accuracy of eligibility reviews, and geographic locations (Boston,  Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; Manchester, New Hampshire; New  Orleans, Louisiana; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, Washington). During  our visits to five of these regional offices (the sixth office served as a  preliminary site visit), we held 11 discussion groups of 2 to 3 rating  specialists using an interview protocol. We also interviewed quality review  team (QRT) coaches, QRT members, and regional office management.  We reviewed training materials and quality assurance data provided by  the regional officials.

Since 1925, VA  has used the Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD)  to assign disability ratings to veterans based upon the existence and  severity of service-connected disabilities. The severity of a disability is  based on an average reduction in earning capacity across a group of  veterans with similar physical or mental impairments brought on by their  service. This degree of severity is expressed as a percentage and is often  referred to as a \u201cschedular rating.\u201d For veterans with multiple service- connected disabilities, VA calculates the rating using a table that applies  a formula for combining multiple ratings into a single rating. The rating  dictates the amount of monthly compensation\u2014set by law\u2014a veteran  receives, as shown in table 1. Veterans receiving a 100 percent rating are  deemed to have a total disability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of the TDIU Benefit and the Eligibility Decision-Making Process", "paragraphs": ["In 1934, VA revised its disability compensation program to establish TDIU  compensation. VA has testified that the TDIU supplemental benefit was  created to allow veterans to be deemed totally disabled even if they do  not meet the criteria for a 100 percent rating. VA provided the rationale  that while the rating schedule is intended to identify impaired earnings  reduction for the average veteran, it does not always adequately  compensate individual veterans based on their particular circumstances.  The TDIU benefit was established during the Depression, when Social  Security retirement benefits were passed into law. In 1945, VA  established that age was not to be considered a factor in evaluating  entitlement to TDIU.", "Today, TDIU benefits are generally a way VA can increase an eligible  veteran\u2019s schedular disability rating to 100 percent based on the veteran\u2019s  inability to earn income above the amount set by federal poverty  guidelines because of their service-connected disabilities. To be eligible  for TDIU compensation, a veteran must have a single service-connected  disability rated at least 60 percent or multiple disabilities with a combined  rating of at least 70 percent (with at least one disability rated at 40  percent or higher). In addition, the veteran must be unable to obtain or  maintain \u201csubstantially gainful employment\u201d as a result of these service- connected disabilities. VA generally considers \u201csubstantially gainful  employment\u201d to be employment above the federal poverty guidelines\u2014 $11,490 for an individual with no dependents in 2013. VA refers to the  inability to maintain gainful employment as \u201cunemployability.\u201d Because a  TDIU award yields a higher rating percentage, it leads to higher levels of  compensation above the base schedular rating amount. For example, the  rating for a veteran with no dependents could be increased from 60  percent ($1,026 per month) to 100 percent ($2,816 per month), an  increase of $1,790 per month\u2014or $21,480 a year.", "Disability compensation claims processing, including TDIU claims, is  performed at 57 VBA regional offices.

VA terminates the  supplemental TDIU benefits for those who do not provide the required  information or are determined no longer eligible. VA requires beneficiaries  to annually self-certify their employment and income. Specifically, in an  Employment Questionnaire required for the continuation of TDIU benefits,  the beneficiaries report their employment status during the previous 12  months including the type of work, hours worked, time lost for illness, and  highest gross earnings per month.

First, rating  specialists in some (5 of 11) of the discussion groups we held at five  regional offices disagreed on whether they are permitted to consider  additional factors that are not specifically mentioned in VBA\u2019s guidance.  Rating specialists held varying opinions on whether factors such as  enrollment in school, education level, or prior work history should be used  to decide the benefit claim. Some examples of the variability in decisions  this incomplete guidance results in are shown in the examples below:", "A rating specialist recently reviewed a claim for TDIU that was  submitted by a veteran suffering from traumatic brain injury. The  rating specialist found that the veteran was enrolled in school part  time and earning A\u2019s in engineering classes, which the specialist felt  clearly demonstrated employability. However, another rating specialist  within the group stated that the veteran\u2019s enrollment in classes would  not be part of her decision-making.", "A rating specialist granted benefits to a veteran with an 8th grade  education because the specialist felt the veteran was unqualified for  work other than the lumberjacking he had performed since leaving the  military, despite the fact that the examiner found that the veteran  could work in a job with fewer physical demands. A fellow rating  specialist agreed that the veteran was qualified for few jobs, but would  not have granted the benefit because the veteran\u2019s physical  restrictions did not disqualify the veteran from certain other jobs.", "Another rating specialist denied benefits for a veteran who was a  retired dentist. The veteran\u2019s medical examiner submitted a written  opinion that the veteran could not perform dental work due to his  inability to stand; however, the rating specialist decided the veteran\u2019s  prior work in such a high-skilled career was an indication that he could  engage in a different line of work. Yet, another rating specialist stated  that he would have instead relied solely on the opinion of the medical  examiner and consequently granted the TDIU benefit.", "Second, rating specialists noted that for those factors that rating  specialists can consider in their decision-making process, the guidance is  silent on which factors, if any, should be given greater priority or weight.  We confirmed that this information was not in the manual or guidance  provided by VBA. As a result, during 5 of our 11 discussion groups with  rating specialists, we heard differences in opinion about the primacy of  factors rating specialists applied when making a decision on  unemployability. The majority of rating specialists in the discussion  groups (7 of 11) specifically noted that they could come to an opposite  decision when reviewing the same evidence if the evidence were weighed  differently. For example, during a few of these discussion groups, rating  specialists told us they relied heavily on medical opinions while others  considered Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments as the  strongest marker of a veteran\u2019s inability to work. In another instance, a  rating specialist told us that a medical opinion was always weighted more  heavily than all other evidence in the veteran\u2019s file while another specialist  expressed a hesitancy to rely too much on the examiner\u2019s opinion.", "Third, the guidance does not provide instruction on how to separate  extraneous factors from allowable ones. Some of the discussion groups  (6 of 11) told us that not having this guidance was a significant challenge  for them. Findings from our case file reviews also illustrate this issue: one  file described a 77-year-old veteran claiming TDIU benefits for blindness  that was caused by (1) a service-connected disability, (2) glaucoma, and  (3) macular degeneration. However, because all three conditions related  to the veteran\u2019s quality of vision, the rating specialist noted in the file her  difficulty separating the effect of the service-connected disability from the  non-service-connected glaucoma and macular degeneration due to the  man\u2019s age. Rating specialists also told us that despite guidance to the  contrary, they still consider age as a factor. At one end of the age  spectrum, specialists in the majority (7 of 11) of the discussion groups  told us that they have difficulty rationalizing granting benefits to veterans  beyond 65 years of age. In each of these groups, at least one rating  specialist provided an example of when they may consider age as a  factor in the TDIU benefit decision. For example, one rating specialist  shared a case of an older veteran who retired from police service more  than 10 years before applying for TDIU benefits. He specifically had a  concern with program rules which did not allow him to consider the  veteran\u2019s age and retirement status.

Federal  internal control standards highlight the need for collecting, consolidating,  and distributing pertinent information in a form that allows employees to  perform their duties efficiently. For several reasons, VBA\u2019s guidance  falls short of this standard.

The regional offices  use QRT reviews to identify trends in error and review individual rating  specialist\u2019s performance (for past claim decisions as well as claims still in  review). However, VBA officials in almost all (5 of 6) of the regional offices  told us that these reviews generally include very few TDIU claims.  Moreover, QRT reviews apply a similar approach to calculating errors as  STAR reviews. For example, QRT reviews give deference to professional  opinion and officials we spoke with noted that questionable decisions  made by rating specialists are typically coded as a \u201ctraining comment\u201d  rather than as an \u201cerror.\u201d In such instances, QRT officials discuss the  claim with the rating specialist. Only one of the regional offices we visited  was systematically tracking the type of TDIU errors in its QRT review  process.", "Quality assurance approaches that VBA has used with non-TDIU  disability compensation claims suggest that other options may be  available to generate additional insight into a comprehensive assessment  of the completeness, accuracy, and consistency, as well as possible  enhancements, of TDIU claims decisions. For example, as we reported in  2014, VBA conducted a targeted review of military sexual trauma claims  using a consistency questionnaire to test rating specialists\u2019 understanding  and interpretation of policies in response to concerns that post-traumatic  stress disorder claims related to military sexual trauma were not being  accurately decided. Performing a similar review to gauge the degree of  consistency in TDIU claim decisions could help VBA identify differences\u2014 perhaps beyond reasonable limits\u2014in how rating specialists interpret the  guidance and apply their professional judgment. Further, measuring  consistency of decisions for specialists working in different regional  offices could provide additional insight. VBA has used other quality  assurance approaches to assess non-TDIU disability compensation claim  decision-making, which are discussed in greater detail in appendix II.

To begin receiving  and remain eligible for TDIU benefits, veterans must meet the income  eligibility requirements. VBA first determines a claimant\u2019s income by  requesting information on the last 5 years of employment on the claim  form and subsequently requires beneficiaries to annually attest to any  income changes. Rating specialists use the information provided by  claimants to request additional information from employers and, when  possible, verify the claimant\u2019s reported income, especially for the year  prior to applying for the benefit. In order to receive verification, VBA sends  a form to the employers identified on the veteran\u2019s benefit claim and asks  them to provide the income earned by the veteran. However, VBA  officials indicated that employers provide the requested information only  about 50 percent of the time. This estimate was consistent with what we  heard from our discussion groups of rating specialists and the number of  completed forms found in the files we reviewed. Rating specialists in 5 of  the 11 discussion groups told us the low response rate is often due to  businesses having closed, lack of incentives to return the form, and staff  at human resources offices being unfamiliar with the veteran. If VBA does  not receive verification from a veteran\u2019s employer after multiple attempts,  it accepts the veteran\u2019s claimed earnings. None of the rating specialists in  the 11 discussion groups we held in five regional offices discussed other  ways of verifying the self-attested income that beneficiaries\u2019 report on the  initial TDIU claim or the annual form that must be submitted to continue to  receive benefits. However, one rating specialist explained that in the rare  instances when beneficiaries indicate earning above the income  threshold, the specialists review additional documents, such as tax  documents, submitted by the veteran.", "VBA previously conducted audits of beneficiaries\u2019 reported income by  obtaining income verification matches from Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) earnings data through an agreement with the Social Security  Administration (SSA), but is no longer doing so. For example, VBA  obtained reported income annually and compared lists of TDIU  beneficiaries to their self-reported income. VBA officials told us that the  agency is not performing income verification matches for TDIU claims  despite having standing agreements with the IRS and SSA to do so. In  2012, VBA suspended income verification matches to allow for the  development of a new system that would allow for more frequent,  electronic information sharing. VBA officials told us that they plan to roll  out a new electronic data system that would allow for compatibility with  SSA data sources in fiscal year 2015. They noted that they plan to use  this system to conduct more frequent and focused income verifications to  ensure beneficiaries\u2019 continued entitlement. VBA officials also anticipate  being able to use the system to conduct income verifications for initial  TDIU applicants beginning in fiscal year 2016. However, they did not  provide us with a plan or timeline for implementing this verification  system.", "In addition, VA has not fully taken advantage of previous opportunities to  use the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) to verify self-reported  income information for the TDIU program. The NDNH, which is  maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), was  established in part to help states enforce child support orders against  noncustodial parents and contains more timely state wage information.  The NDNH also includes data from state directories of new hires, state  records of unemployment insurance benefits paid, and federal agency  payroll data, all of which can be used to help establish a picture of a  claimant\u2019s work history and earnings. NDNH data are updated at least  quarterly, providing a more recent snapshot of earnings than the IRS  wage information that SSA obtains. However, access to the NDNH is  limited by statute. In our 2006 report on VA\u2019s TDIU benefits, we  recommended that VA use this directory to enforce earnings limits in their  programs. VA was subsequently granted temporary statutory authority,  twice, to access the NDNH for use in employment and income  verification. Specifically, VA had such access from December 26, 2007,  through November 18, 2011, and again for a period of 180 days  beginning on September 30, 2013. VA, however, never reached an  agreement with HHS to use the data during these time periods due to its  limited financial and workforce resources at the time, according to  officials. VA no longer has statutory authority to access the NDNH data.  SSA, on the other hand, does have statutory access to NDNH data, and  SSA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) recently reviewed the  accuracy and effectiveness of NDNH data in identifying overpayments for  SSA benefit programs including SSDI.

We did  not independently assess the individual merits or accuracy of the views  expressed by these experts and VSO representatives; however, we  recognize that weighing and possibly implementing any of these revisions  would be a complex process.

This option was proposed by the Congressional  Budget Office (CBO) in 2013. CBO based this option on the rationale  that most veterans who are older than Social Security\u2019s full retirement age  would not be in the labor force because of their age, and that a lack of  earnings among them would probably not be attributable to service- connected disabilities. CBO also noted that veterans over age 65 who  currently receive TDIU benefits\u2014most of whom began receiving them in  their 50s\u2014would likely have income from other sources, including the  regular VA disability compensation benefit and Social Security retirement  benefits. CBO also provided an argument for retaining the current policy,  noting that the benefit should be based solely on an ability to work and  that using age as a factor would be unfair. CBO stated that some disabled  veterans would not be able to replace the TDIU supplement and that their  Social Security retirement benefit and personal savings are low. If the  option to discontinue TDIU payments when the veteran reaches Social  Security\u2019s full retirement age were implemented, the veteran would  continue to receive disability compensation payments at a dollar amount  appropriate to the underlying VA disability rating.

Unfortunately, the integrity of the  decision-making process for the TDIU benefit is at risk due to incomplete  guidance that leaves much open to interpretation. As a consequence,  rating specialists may be using and interpreting evidence differently to  determine unemployability\u2014this could mean that benefits could be  granted for one veteran and possibly denied for another veteran with  similar circumstances and impairments. Within this environment, VA\u2019s  quality assurance approach may not be fully identifying the extent to  which errors made by rating specialists are occurring or providing  adequate assurance on the overall soundness of the TDIU benefit  decision-making process. Specifically, little if anything is known about the  consistency of TDIU decision-making across individuals in the same  regional office as well as across regional offices. We heard about the  subjectivity and challenges in the claims decision-making process  throughout our visits to VBA regional offices, which elevate the need to  use a thorough process to ensure that rating specialists are bringing  reasonably consistent judgments to benefit decisions\u2014which for some  individual veterans, could result in 50 or more years of benefits. In  addition, VA does not use available third-party earnings data to verify  veterans\u2019 self-attested employment history and income information.  Without such verification, VA cannot adequately ensure that the eligibility  standards are being met, which places these benefits at risk of being  awarded to ineligible veterans. These deficiencies also have the potential  of increasing the cost of TDIU benefits because some ineligible veterans  may be receiving benefits and other deserving veterans could be denied  benefits.

We assumed that the  population of new beneficiaries had only been receiving payments at the  100 percent disability rate or at their regular disability rate for 6 months  and that the rest of the beneficiary population had been receiving  payments at the 100 percent rate or at their regular disability rate for the  full fiscal year.

We assumed that the benefit payments had been  discontinued for this population for 6 months, on average. In addition, we  calculated a range for the benefits paid to the discontinued beneficiaries  at their regular disability rating. One estimate in the range assumed the  discontinued beneficiaries were all rated as 60 percent disabled, the  lowest disability rating at which a veteran would be eligible for TDIU. The  second estimate in the range assumed the discontinued beneficiaries  were all 90 percent disabled, which was the highest rating a veteran could  receive before experiencing an increase in payments due to TDIU. We  also assigned dependent categories to the discontinued beneficiaries  where we assumed that the distribution of this population was  proportional to the population of (1) TDIU beneficiaries as a whole, (2)  beneficiaries who were rated as 60 percent disabled, or (3) beneficiaries  who were rated as 90 percent disabled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selection of VA Regional Offices for Interviews and Review of TDIU Claims", "paragraphs": ["We selected six regional offices we would visit to gather additional  information on the TDIU claims review and quality assurance processes,  including the challenges associated with such reviews.

In addition,  information is provided on other approaches VBA has used to assess  non-TDIU claims.", "Since fiscal year 1999, VBA has used its STAR review to measure the  accuracy of disability compensation claims decisions. Through the STAR  process, VBA reviews a stratified random sample of completed claims,  and certified reviewers use a checklist to assess specific aspects of each  claim. Specifically, for each of the 57 regional offices, completed claims  are randomly sampled each month and the data are used to produce  estimates of the accuracy of all completed claims. VA reports national  estimates of accuracy from its STAR reviews to Congress and the public  through its annual performance and accountability report and annual  budget submission. VBA also produces regional office accuracy  estimates, which it uses to manage the program. Regional office and  national accuracy rates are reported in a publicly available performance  database, the Aspire dashboard.", "Prior to October 2012, VBA\u2019s estimates of accuracy were claim-based;  that is, claims free of errors that affect veterans\u2019 benefits were considered  accurate and, conversely, claims with one or more errors that affect  benefits were considered inaccurate. Beginning in October 2012, VBA  also began using STAR data to produce issue-based estimates of  accuracy that measure the accuracy of decisions on the individual  medical conditions within each claim. For example, a veteran could  submit one claim seeking disability compensation for five disabling  medical conditions. If VBA made an incorrect decision on one of those  conditions, the claim would be counted as 80 percent accurate under the  new issue-based measure. By comparison, under the existing claim- based measure, the claim would be counted as 0 percent accurate unless  the error did not affect benefits when considered in the context of the  whole claim. VBA uses these STAR review results to guide other quality  assurance efforts. According to VBA officials, the agency has used STAR  data to identify error trends associated with specific medical issues, which  in turn were used to target efforts to assess consistency of decision- making related to those issues.", "In March 2012, VBA established QRTs with one at each regional office.  Although regional offices were previously responsible for assessing  individual performance, QRTs represent a departure from the past  because QRT personnel are dedicated primarily to performing these and  other local quality reviews. The QRT reviews individual rating specialist  performance across the parts of claims that an individual processed  (individual quality reviews). Also, QRTs review claims the regional office  is still processing (in-process reviews) to help prevent inaccurate  decisions. In-process reviews specifically aim to help prevent inaccurate  decisions by identifying specific types of common errors and serve as  learning experiences for staff members and are not used to assess  individual performance. Quality reviewers are also responsible for  providing feedback to claims processors on the results of their quality  reviews, typically as reviews are completed, including formal feedback  from the results of individual quality reviews and more informal feedback  from the results of in-process reviews. In addition, according to VBA, the  focus of in-process reviews performed by QRTs has been guided by  STAR review error trend data. Originally, VBA established these reviews  to help the QRTs identify and prevent claim development errors related to  medical examinations and opinions, which it described as the most  common error type. More recently, VBA has added two more common  error types\u2014incorrect rating percentages and incorrect effective benefit  dates\u2014to its in-process review efforts.

For example, in our 2014 report on military  sexual trauma, we reported on a special accuracy review VBA  conducted in response to concerns that adjudicators were not making  accurate decisions for post-traumatic stress disorder claims related to  military sexual trauma. The VBA review found errors in 98 of 385  randomly selected claims that had been denied (about 25 percent). In  particular, the review identified 61 cases where the adjudicators  should have identified markers and ordered medical exams rather  than denying the benefit. The VBA reviewers made several  recommendations for improving the adjudication process such as to:  (1) clarify VA policies on markers, (2) build expertise in adjudicating  such claims, and (3) develop training.", "Inter-rater reliability (IRR) studies: Since fiscal year 2008, VBA has  used IRRs to assess the extent to which a cross-section of rating  specialists across all regional offices agree on an eligibility  determination when reviewing the entire body of evidence from the  same claim. These studies are, however, time intensive and only  review one claim. The process was administered by proctors in the  regional offices and the results were hand-graded by national VBA  staff. Given the resources involved, IRR studies have been typically  limited to 300 to 500 (about 25 to 30 percent) claims processors,  randomly selected from the regional offices.", "Consistency questionnaires: As of 2013, VBA has used  questionnaires as its primary means for assessing consistency of  decision-making across individual rating specialists. A questionnaire  includes a brief scenario on a specific medical condition for which a  rating specialist must correctly answer several multiple-choice  questions. The questionnaires are intended to test for understanding  and interpretation of policy and test takers receive feedback. The  questionnaires are administered electronically through the VA Talent  Management System, removing the need to proctor or hand-grade the  tests, which has allowed VBA to significantly increase employee  participation. For example, a recent consistency questionnaire was  taken by about 3,000 claims processing employees\u2014representing all  employees responsible for rating claims. Further, VBA now  administers these studies more frequently, from about 3 to 24 per  year. According to VBA officials, they plan to further expand the use of  consistency studies from two questionnaires per month to six to eight  per month, pending the availability of additional funding.
