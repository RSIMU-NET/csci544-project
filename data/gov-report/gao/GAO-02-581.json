The act,  as amended, requires the Department of the Interior to identify at-risk  species that may be candidates for listing and work to conserve them  (candidate conservation); when warranted, list species as threatened or  endangered and identify their critical habitat\u2014habitat essential to the  species\u2019 conservation\u2014that requires special management (listing); work  with groups whose proposed projects could harm the listed species to  mitigate such harm (consultation); and develop and implement plans to  improve the status of listed species until they no longer need protection  (recovery). Interior delegated its responsibility for the Endangered Species  Act to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), which established an  endangered species program within its ecological services program to  implement the requirements of the act. The Service, a decentralized agency,  is organized into seven regions, each with a regional office managing a  number of field offices. Some field staff divide their time between this  program and other programs, such as environmental contaminants, carried  out by the ecological services field offices. In fiscal year 2001, the Service  received $210 million for ecological services, of which $121 million was for  the endangered species program. Of the endangered species funding,  recovery received $59.8 million, or almost 50 percent, of the program\u2019s  funds; consultation, $42.8 million; candidate conservation, $7.1 million;  listing, $6.3 million; and landowner incentives, $5 million.", "For many years, environmental groups, landowners, federal agencies, and  developers have voiced concerns about how the Service has implemented  the endangered species program. Specific areas of concern include the  pace of recovery; the Service\u2019s  performance in meeting certain of the act\u2019s  requirements\u2014for example, reviewing petitions for listing species within  90 days of their receipt; and the Service\u2019s interpretation of certain aspects  of the act related to critical habitat designation. These concerns have  increasingly led to litigation and court orders that, according to Service  officials, have influenced how the Service does its work. The Congress also  has had concerns about the program and has not reauthorized or amended  the act since 1988, even though more than 50 reauthorizing or amending  bills have been introduced since 1995.", "Given these concerns and your oversight responsibility, you asked us to  review several aspects of the Service\u2019s implementation of the endangered  species program. Accordingly, this report provides information on (1) how  the Service budgets and allocates its endangered species program funds  and (2) how field office staff spent their time in the endangered species  program in fiscal year 2001. In addition, in performing our work, we  identified certain factors that affected the implementation of the  endangered species program. Our report highlights the nature and extent of  those factors as well.", "To collect information on program activities in the field, we asked all seven  regional offices about their funding allocation methods and workload. To  obtain more detail on field office activities, we conducted two surveys:  (1)  a survey of supervisors at the 60 field offices that implement the  endangered species program (100 percent response) and (2) a survey of the  767 scientific and technical staff (hereafter referred to as field staff) who  worked in the field on the program in fiscal year 2001 (83 percent  response). Our survey results are in appendixes I and II, and highlights of  selected national and regional information are in appendix III. We  discussed our survey results with regional and headquarters officials to  obtain their views on the factors that drove their workload and actions they  are taking to improve program implementation. More detailed information  on our scope and methodology is contained in appendix IV.", "Finally, during the course of our work, we became aware of several legal  services contracts awarded in a few field offices that were funded through  the endangered species program. We questioned whether the field offices  had the authority to enter into the contracts and whether the use of these  program funds was proper. Interior's Solicitor advised us that the Service  did not have the required authority to enter into these legal services  contracts, but did not address whether the funds could be used to pay for  legal services. We have concluded that since the Office of the Solicitor  receives a specific appropriation for employing attorneys and doing legal  work, use of endangered species program funds for legal services contracts  was improper. The results of our work on this issue will be conveyed to you  through separate correspondence.", "We conducted our review from April 2001 through March 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Congress enacted the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to prevent the  extinction of threatened or endangered plant and animal species. The act  defines a threatened species as one that is likely to become endangered in  the foreseeable future; and an endangered species as one that faces  extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Under the act,  the Secretary of the Interior is to determine whether any species is  threatened or endangered as a result of such factors as the present or  threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;  overuse for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;  or disease or predation. The act also prohibits the \u201ctaking\u201d of a listed  species.", "During the 29 years since the Endangered Species Act was enacted, the  Fish and Wildlife Service has listed more than 1,200 species in the United  States as threatened or endangered. Of these, 32 have since been delisted,  13 as a result of recovery efforts. The other 19 were removed from the  threatened or endangered species list because they became extinct (7) or  were no longer deemed to be at risk because further scientific analysis  found evidence of other information that made listing unnecessary (12). In  addition, as of September 30, 2001, the Service was in the process of listing  35 more species and had identified 236 candidate species\u2014species that  qualify for listing but for which the listing process has not yet begun  because of resource limitations or higher priorities for other species.", "In fiscal year 2001, Congress appropriated $1.26 billion for the Fish and  Wildlife Service. Of this amount, $121 million was directed to the  endangered species program, which is one of three subactivities within the  ecological services activity of the resource management appropriation (see  fig. 1). In addition, the Service received additional funds from other federal  agencies through reimbursable agreements. For example, the Service  receives funds from Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management and the  Department of Agriculture\u2019s U.S. Forest Service to conduct consultations  on fire programs.", "For fiscal year 2001, the Service\u2019s $121 million for the endangered species  program was divided into five separate budgets that corresponded with the  program areas, as shown in table 1.", "The Service administers the endangered species program through its  headquarters office, seven regional offices, and 60 of its 78 ecological  services field offices throughout the country that carry out endangered  species program activities. Figure 2 shows the seven regions and the  locations of the regional offices; appendix IV lists the 60 field offices we  surveyed.", "Headquarters officials set overall priorities for the endangered species  program, develop policy and guidance, and allocate funding to the regions.  Regional office staff perform similar functions for their field offices.  Regional directors make most decisions on how to spend endangered  species funds within each program area. However, the Service director  decides whether to list a species as threatened or endangered and whether  to issue regulations (e.g., formal guidance on requirements for habitat  conservation planning). The regional offices are responsible for managing  their field offices\u2019 program activities. They assess office operations,  prepare and implement work plans, hold meetings to communicate work  priorities to field offices throughout the year, and track field office  activities through frequent telephone conversations and/or the creation and  maintenance of regional databases to supplement national tracking  systems.", "The field offices are responsible for implementing the program and setting  priorities for projects they will undertake. For example, field staff develop  partnerships and agreements with landowners for conservation activities,  consult with federal agencies on proposed actions that may affect a listed  species, and develop and implement recovery plans for listed species. In  addition, other programs within the Service (e.g., fisheries, refuges, and  wildlife programs) and state, federal, and private sector partners carry out  activities that contribute to the Service\u2019s ultimate mission of species  recovery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Endangered Species Program Funds Are Tied to Specific Program Areas at Each Organizational Level", "paragraphs": ["Funding for the endangered species program is tied directly to the major  program areas (recovery, consultation, candidate conservation, listing, and  landowner incentives\u2014for fiscal years 1999-2001 only) and kept segregated  by these program areas at each organizational level. The Service allocates  funds to its regional offices in two phases. For each program area, the  Service first distributes monies that were congressionally targeted for  specific endangered species projects and any other region-specific funds  (e.g., cost of living increases). The Service then allocates the remaining  amount to the regional offices using program-specific formulas that take  into consideration the number of candidate and listed species found within  each region and their habitats. The regional offices maintain these separate  budgets when allocating funds to the field offices on the basis of staff and  workload considerations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Service Headquarters Budgets and Allocates Its Endangered Species Program Funds by Program Area", "paragraphs": ["Congress provides funding for the endangered species program through the  resource management appropriations account. The appropriations  committee conference report provides direction for funding in the separate  program areas. The Service maintains these distinct program area budgets  as it allocates funds to the regional office, doing so in two steps. First, each  regional office receives funds for congressional directives\u2014specific  amounts for projects or other entities outlined in appropriations committee  conference reports. For example, for recovery in fiscal year 2001, the  conference report designated $5 million in matching grants for Pacific  salmon conservation and restoration in Washington State and more than $2  million for recovery for specific listed species, including the gray wolf,  Lahontan cutthroat trout, and black capped vireo. In addition, each region  receives funds for specific purposes such as cost of living increases and  \u201ccapability funding\u201d\u2014a set amount of funding that supports one to two  staff per program area to ensure that the regional office can maintain  expertise in each of the program areas.", "Second, the Service allocates the remaining funds for each program area to  the regional offices according to specific formulas generally based on the  number and complexity of candidate, proposed, and listed species found in  the region or for which the regional office has lead responsibility. These  formulas reflect the fact that not all species require the same level of  funding or effort in order to achieve their conservation and recovery. The  formulas are based on weighting factors that are assigned to species by  assessing the species type (animal or plant) and its range and habitat type  (e.g., migratory, aquatic, endemic). As table 2 shows, the regions vary in the  number of species for which they have lead responsibility.", "To some extent, the Service also considers the program area\u2019s  characteristics when it allocates funds to the regional offices. For example,  in the consultation program area, the Service follows two methodologies  when allocating funds:  (1) funds for consultations with federal agencies  and habitat conservation planning with nonfederal groups are allocated  according to the weighted number of candidate, proposed, and listed  species found in each region, and (2) a set amount every year ($2 million in  fiscal year 2001) is allocated across regional offices for implementing and  monitoring habitat conservation plans based on specific formulas that take  into account such factors as the size of the planning area and the number of  participating partners.", "In contrast, when allocating funds for listing, the Service considers a  priority list of different types of anticipated listing actions that is approved  by the director of the Service. At the top of the priority list are actions  required by court orders and settlement agreements, and emergency  listings. Other listing actions, such as preparing final rules for listing  species and responding to petitions to list species are of lower priority. In  fiscal year 2001, the Service could only fund listing actions responding to  specific court orders and settlement agreements. To allocate these funds,  Service headquarters officials estimated the average cost of listing actions  in each region and allocated a specified amount for each field office  responsible for carrying out the required actions. In its fiscal year 2002  budget justification, the Service stated that the listing program will  continue to be driven by litigation, largely over missed deadlines and the  Service\u2019s \u201cnot prudent\u201d determinations for designation of critical habitat for  listed species.

Regional officials told us that they  maintain the integrity of the program area budgets when allocating funds to  the field offices. In allocating each program area budget, they retain only  enough funds to cover their fixed costs (e.g., salaries, travel, uniforms) and  program administration and implementation costs, such as those  associated with contracts let and projects led by the regional office.  Regional offices\u2019 methods for allocating funds vary by region and by  program area but are all based on staffing levels; previous years\u2019 funding  levels; and past or anticipated activities, such as the number of  consultations completed or the number of recovery plans in need of  completion. For example, Region 2 officials told us that they increased  consultation funding to one field office because of an historic and  continuing heavy consultation workload and funded additional positions in  another field office because of the need to consult on over 7,000 grazing  allotments and large water projects involving the San Juan, Rio Grande,  and Colorado Rivers.

These percentages do not reflect the time field staff  spent on general endangered species program activities (see footnote 4).  Staff reported spending more time on consultation largely because they  had to meet statutory requirements and mandatory time frames associated  with these activities. Staff spent 10 percent of their time on the listing  program area, including adding new species to the threatened or  endangered species list and designating critical habitat. For these activities,  responding to litigation primarily drove the workload. Regional officials  cited the need for more guidance on designating critical habitat in order to  reduce the number of legal challenges to the Service\u2019s critical habitat  designations, better defend those that are brought, and spend more time on  other listing activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Consultation Program Area Accounted for the Largest Amount of Field Staff Time", "paragraphs": ["The consultation program area comprises two main activities under the  Endangered Species Act\u2014section 7 consultations with federal agencies  and section 10 habitat conservation planning activities with landowners.   Both section 7 consultations and section 10 habitat conservation planning  are initiated by applicants whose actions may affect a listed species. In the  case of formal section 7 consultations, the Service must respond within  statutory and regulatory time limits. The act establishes a time frame of 90  days to complete a formal consultation, unless the Service and the  applicant mutually agree to an extension. Regulations require the Service  to deliver a biological opinion within 45 days of the conclusion of formal  consultation. Similarly, in the case of habitat conservation planning, the  Service has limited control over the number of applicants requesting  assistance or the amount of technical assistance needed. While there are no  statutory time frames associated with section 10, all applicants expect  timely attention.", "For fiscal year 2001, field staff reported spending 42 percent of their total  time devoted to the endangered species program on the consultation  program area. Staff spent about 80 percent of this time working with  federal agencies on section 7 consultations, which included over 46,000  informal and more than 1,000 formal consultations. They spent the other 20  percent of their time on habitat conservation planning, which included  working on more than 300 habitat conservation plans (HCPs) and  approving over 100 incidental take permits.  HCPs vary by the type of  applicant, the activities addressed, and the number of listed species  involved\u2014from a single landowner to a state government, from half-acre  lots to many acres, from forestry and agricultural activities to beach  development, and from a single species to dozens of species.", "Regions 1 and 2 accounted for more than 74 percent of the formal  consultations and more than 92 percent of habitat conservation plans  approved for incidental take permits, the majority of which involved  applicants who were individual landowners. Region 1 has seen a large  increase in section 7 consultations over the past 5 years as a result of (1)  litigation that required other federal agencies to consult with the Service,  and (2) an increase in interagency agreements, such as the Forest Service\u2019s  National Fire Plan and the Department of Defense\u2019s Integrated Natural  Resource Management Plans. Officials in Region 2 stated that in the past  several years, federal agencies that historically have not consulted with  them on certain activities have now entered into formal consultations on  these activities because of litigation.  They added that some consultations  on major river system projects (e.g., the Colorado and Rio Grande river  systems) have consumed large amounts of staff time because of the  projects\u2019 size, complexity, and potential impact. Other regional variations  are shown in appendix III.", "Over 50 percent of the field staff who carried out activities in the  consultation program area were concerned that they were not spending  enough time on (1) conducting fieldwork in order to determine whether  formal consultations were needed and (2) monitoring agency compliance  with the terms and conditions of biological opinions associated with these  consultations. Field staff reported spending only 2 percent of their  consultation time on fieldwork and only 2 percent on monitoring. Regional  and headquarters officials recognized the importance of monitoring the  terms and conditions of the biological opinions to ensure that the  agreements reached during consultation are being carried out. These  officials noted, however, that other, more pressing consultation work often  takes precedence over conducting fieldwork and monitoring activities.", "Officials in all but one region agreed that consultation has taken staff time  away from recovery efforts. However, officials in several regions stated  that some consultation and recovery activities can be closely connected  because some recovery tasks are imbedded in consultation actions and in  broadly scoped habitat conservation plans that have a recovery focus.  Additionally, once a species is listed, the Service\u2019s subsequent actions are  directed to its ultimate goal of recovery, and biologists work towards this  goal in all they do, according to regional officials. Region 6 officials were  concerned that the amount of time their field staff reported spending on  consultation might have been overstated because several biologists who  work solely on three recovery programs in their region were not included  in our survey. They suggested that if these biologists\u2019 time had been  included, the region\u2019s results would have shown a larger percentage of time  spent on recovery and therefore less on consultation. (We did not include  these biologists in our survey because they were not working in field  offices originally identified by the region as responsible for implementing  the endangered species program.)", "Regional efforts to better address the increased consultation workload  include the development of a regional database that tracks consultations  and efforts to encourage more proactive land management practices that  avoid the taking of species and therefore minimize the need for formal  consultations and habitat conservation plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recovery Activities Were Constrained by Other Program Area Priorities", "paragraphs": ["Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act requires the Service to develop  and implement recovery plans for listed species.

At that point, the Service can delist  the species. While the act does not specify certain actions or time frames to  develop and implement a recovery plan, the Service\u2019s policy is to complete  the development of a plan within 2-\u00bd years of the species\u2019 listing date.

Twenty percent of the field office  supervisors reported their offices worked towards the delisting of 21  species. During fiscal year 2001, the Aleutian Canada goose was officially  delisted. According to Service officials, because recovery activities do not  have strict statutory requirements or time frames, staff who would  normally focus on recovery efforts are frequently pulled from recovery  planning and implementation to work on higher priority work, such as  section 7 consultations and responses to litigation.", "More than 54 percent of the field staff who carried out recovery efforts  were concerned that they could not spend enough time on activities more  directly associated with recovery, such as implementing specific tasks  included in recovery plans or monitoring the status of species. Regional  officials attributed this lack of direct involvement to the changing role of  field office staff in the recovery program area. Officials said that previously  field staff conducted \u201con the ground\u201d fieldwork and now they largely  administer contracts and coordinate cooperative agreements with outside  parties that implement recovery efforts, such as monitoring the status of  listed species. In fiscal year 2001, the Service used 13 percent of its  recovery funds as grants and an additional amount, varying by region, to  obtain services from third parties. In addition, Service officials noted that  they use recovery funds to provide technical assistance to states as part of  an intergovernmental effort to conserve species required by section 6 of the  Endangered Species Act. Section 6 grants provide federal aid for states to  develop programs to conserve, monitor, and recover threatened and  endangered species. According to Service officials, these programs  contribute to species recovery and therefore costs associated with the  technical assistance provided by field office staff are an appropriate use of  recovery funds but leave less money available for more direct recovery  activities to be carried out by Service staff.", "Regional officials were aware that staff are not able to spend as much time  on all aspects of recovery activities as they would like, and officials cited a  number of actions they are taking to improve their recovery efforts:  developing multi-species recovery plans, involving state and federal  agencies in recovery activities, setting priorities for specific recovery  projects for field offices, and requiring annual reports on field office  accomplishments. Additionally, the Service recently established a working  group to target select aspects of the recovery program for improvement.  For example, the group is revising recovery guidance to help improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of recovery planning\u2014including assessing the  optimum number of stakeholders who should be involved in developing  recovery plans and increasing training on negotiation and communication  skills for recovery biologists.

Each year, the Service reviews the  status of at-risk species, including assessing the magnitude and immediacy  of threats they face and decides if any species warrants listing. If listing is  warranted but higher priority tasks take precedence, then the species will  be placed on the candidate list. Staff also carry out conservation activities  for at-risk or candidate species. They identify landowners with these  species on their property and work with them to conserve habitat through  such means as candidate conservation agreements. These voluntary  agreements between the Service and one or more private or public  landowners (e.g., states, territories, federal agencies), establish measures  to stabilize and conserve species and specify how these measures will be  implemented and monitored. The Service views these early conservation  actions as critical for several reasons:  more conservation options may still  be available for at-risk species; early conservation efforts are more likely to  be successful; potential land use conflicts that may be caused by listing  may be avoided; and flexibility for landowners can be maintained.", "For fiscal year 2001, field staff reported spending 13 percent of their total  time devoted to the endangered species program on candidate  conservation activities. Of this amount, they spent 26 percent of their time  assessing candidates for listing, 68 percent on conservation activities, and 5  percent monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of these activities.

Within 90 days of  receiving a petition to list a species, the Service must determine whether  the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information to  indicate that listing may be warranted. If the Service determines the  petition presents such information, it reviews the species\u2019 status and must  determine whether the petitioned action is warranted. It must make this  determination within 12 months of receiving the petition. If the petitioned  action is warranted, the Service will then publish a proposed rule for  comment in the Federal Register. Within a year of publishing the rule for  comment, the Service must issue a final rule to implement the listing action  or withdraw the proposed rule if the available evidence does not justify the  listing action. If the listing is warranted but other listing actions take  priority, such as an emergency listing for a species on the verge of  extinction, the species is placed on the candidate list for future action.

For fiscal year 2001, the listing cap was $6.3 million. The listing cap  keeps other program area funds from being reprogrammed to address the  significant backlog of listing activities that have resulted from litigation,  court orders, and settlement agreements. The Service has been sued  primarily because it has missed statutory listing deadlines and because  litigants have challenged the Service\u2019s decisions that it was \u201cnot prudent\u201d to  designate critical habitat for many listed species because doing so provided  little or no additional conservation benefits to the species. According to the  Service, it has a substantial backlog of (1) listing petitions that it has not  had sufficient funds to review and complete and (2) critical habitat  designations that are now required because the court has held that past  \u201cnot prudent\u201d determinations were invalid.", "For fiscal year 2001, field staff reported spending 10 percent of their total  time devoted to the endangered species program on listing activities, with  51 percent of this time on adding new species to the threatened or  endangered species list and 49 percent spent on designating critical  habitats. In addition, 27 percent of field office supervisors reported that  their offices worked toward the listing of more than 40 species in fiscal  year 2001. According to the Service, it completed proposals for 14 listings  during this period. Sixty-five percent of field office supervisors reported  that their offices worked on 429 actions that contributed to the designation  of critical habitat for one or more species (see footnote 10) and finalized  critical habitat designations for 21 species in fiscal year 2001. According to  Service officials, all of these activities resulted from litigation, court orders,  or settlement agreements. Officials in Region 1 stated that the amount of  litigation challenging the merits of the Service\u2019s listing and critical habitat  decisions has been increasing over the last 5 years and created a backlog of  court-ordered \"rework\" of previous decisions or actions. For example,  federal courts have recently ruled that the Service\u2019s past decisions not to  designate critical habitat for listed species because it was \u201cnot prudent\u201d  were inconsistent with the intent of the act. These rulings resulted in court  orders requiring the Service to designate critical habitat for many listed  species. Officials from Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor and Service regional  officials told us that field staff now need more guidance from headquarters  to help them deal with critical habitat designation issues in a more  consistent manner and help avoid future litigation and rework.", "The Service has stated that because listing activities have been driven by  court orders and settlements, staff have been unable to focus on listing  species at the greatest risk of extinction or to undertake a more balanced  listing program. A balanced program would respond to new listing  petitions, add new species to the threatened or endangered species list, and  designate critical habitat. The Service is currently revising its listing  priority guidance to better balance the listing program and eventually  reduce the backlog and plans to have the guidance finalized by the fall of  2002. In addition, in June 1999, the Service published a notice in the Federal  Register soliciting comments on its intention to develop guidance to clarify  the role of critical habitat in conserving endangered species.

For example, through a competitive selection  process, landowners were eligible to receive funding for fencing, planting,  or other habitat restoration activities on their land. Private landowners  who undertook voluntary conservation measures under certain agreements  with the Service (e.g., Safe Harbor Agreements) were assured that these  actions would not lead to additional restrictions under the endangered  species program in the future if the species were subsequently listed as  threatened or endangered. In fiscal year 2002, the landowner incentives  program was discontinued.", "Field staff reported spending 6 percent of their total time devoted to the  endangered species program on landowner incentive activities in fiscal  year 2001.

Seventy-one percent of field office staff reported  that a heavy workload created competing priorities that made their work  take longer than it would normally have taken. One regional official  explained that when staff have to complete many high-priority tasks, they  often split their time among these tasks and thus may need more time to  complete each task because they cannot focus on one task at a time. All  regional officials agreed that their regions are faced with competing  priorities in many areas of the endangered species program. Some stated  that they are able to set priorities for the work within each of the program  areas.

In  addition, almost 50 percent of the supervisors reported difficulties in  retaining field staff and cited heavy workload as the principal reason.", "Almost all field office supervisors (80 percent) identified methods they  developed for addressing their heavy workload and carrying out activities  more efficiently. They most often cited consultations that were streamlined  (i.e., concurrent agency actions) and programmatic (i.e., multiple actions  on a program or regional basis). In fiscal year 2001, supervisors reported  that their staff worked on 187 streamlined and 272 programmatic  consultations (see footnote 10). Several supervisors noted that their offices  also developed form letters to respond to common requests, such as lists of  threatened and endangered species found in an area or for technical  assistance.

Thirty-five percent  of field office supervisors reported that their office charged staff time to  another program area once funds in the relevant program area were  depleted. Our survey did not measure how often or to what extent this  shifting of time charges occurred. Headquarters officials were surprised to  learn that supervisors were reporting that staff time was charged  incorrectly and wondered why supervisors did not make reprogramming  requests.", "Moreover, only half of the field staff responding to our survey reported that  they personally recorded the time charges for the program areas on their  time sheets. The other half did not record their time charges; instead,  someone else (e.g., supervisor, timekeeper, budget officer) recorded their  time. Of those staff who did not record their own time charges, 44 percent  reported that they had no basis to judge whether the time charges recorded  by others accurately reflected the work they had performed. Regional  officials explained that staff in large field offices were more specialized and  often worked on activities in only one or two program areas. In these cases,  timekeepers would know what program areas to charge even if staff did not  record their own time. In smaller field offices with only one or two staff  working on endangered species activities, regional officials assumed that  timekeepers could keep track of each staff member\u2019s activities. One  regional official told us that it was the region\u2019s policy to have staff and their  supervisors review and sign their time sheets. Other regional officials  stated that they expected the field office supervisors to ensure the  accuracy of time charges.", "With the exception of the listing program area, Service headquarters has  delegated decisions about timekeeping practices to the regional offices.  Headquarters does not provide guidance on what specific activities staff  should charge to each of the other  program areas and how to charge time  when activities overlap program areas. Regional officials told us that  timekeeping practices varied among their field offices and were often left  to the discretion of the field office supervisor. Furthermore, they noted,  program activities often overlap because, as the endangered species  program has evolved, the separate program areas have become more  integrated. For example, field staff could conduct recovery, consultation,  and candidate conservation activities simultaneously when working with a  rancher whose federally permitted grazing allotment and private property  contain both candidate and listed species. This overlap in activities could  make it more difficult for staff and/or their timekeepers to determine which  program area codes to use when charging time.", "Since the program\u2019s funds are used chiefly to pay staff salaries, accurately  tracking time spent in each program area would allow the Service to  develop accurate historical data on how program funds are used and to  determine whether appropriated funds are spent in accordance with  budgetary direction. Concerns about the Service\u2019s time charges are not  new. In 1990, Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General raised concerns about  the Service\u2019s failure to track actual time spent on the major program areas  of listing, consultation, and recovery. The Service has since modified its  system for tracking how time is spent by program area. However, our  survey results cast doubt on the accuracy of the data being entered into the  system, and therefore, the amount of staff resources reportedly devoted to  each program area. Incorrect time charges could thus affect the Service\u2019s  ability to make informed decisions about program operations and resource  needs and to provide accountability to Congress on how resources are  being spent. For example, headquarters, regional, and field office staff told  us they were concerned that they could not spend more time on recovery;  and in response to our survey, field staff reported spending only 28 percent  of their time on recovery. However, Service reports on how staff spent their  time, which are based on staff time charges, showed that in fiscal year  2001, 45 percent of staff time was spent on recovery activities. Some  regional officials told us that the difference between 28 and 45 percent  could have occurred because administrative staff (who did not participate  in our surveys) also may have charged time to endangered species program  activities, including recovery. On the other hand, this difference could have  occurred because field staff charged their time to recovery when other  budgets were exhausted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The endangered species program poses a monumental challenge\u2014 identifying all species at risk of extinction and their critical habitat,  conducting multiple activities to reduce that risk, and ultimately recovering  listed species. According to the Service, a lack of resources and a heavy  workload have made it even more difficult to carry out the act\u2019s  requirements, but staff have found ways to make their work processes  more efficient. Nevertheless, meeting statutory requirements and  mandated time frames and responding to litigation largely drive the  workload in some program areas.", "Officials in the regions and in the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of the  Solicitor cited another opportunity for improved work processes that could  help avoid future litigation. These officials noted that staff would benefit  from more headquarters guidance on designating critical habitat after  listing a new species. Better guidance would help reduce the number of  legal challenges to the Service\u2019s critical habitat designations and allow the  Service to better withstand legal challenges when they arise. Spending less  time responding to litigation would help reduce rework and backlogs and  allow the Service to implement other listing activities, such as reviewing  listing petitions and adding species at the greatest risk of extinction to the  list. The Service is taking first steps toward developing such guidance, but  it has not set a time for completing this guidance. In the interim, the Service  is subject to continuing legal challenges on its decisions on designating  critical habitat.", "The Service clearly directs how the regional and field offices should  implement the endangered species program by dividing appropriated funds  into a separate budget for each program area. Recovery\u2014the program\u2019s  overall mission\u2014receives almost 50 percent of program funds. However,  Service officials at all organizational levels acknowledged that staff time  available to spend on recovery has been reduced by other more pressing  workload priorities that are driven by statutory and legal requirements. Our  survey results support this observation, but Service data on how staff spent  their time do not fully reflect these circumstances. The difference between  the Service\u2019s data and the field offices\u2019 reported experiences may have  resulted from incorrect time charges, which would have presented an  inaccurate picture of how staff spent their time. No one knows the extent  of this problem. Moreover, many staff activities overlap program areas,  making it more difficult to determine which program area to charge when  reporting time spent. Consequently the Service is less able to make  informed decisions about future program operations and resource needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the influence of litigation on the listing program area, we  recommend that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Service to expedite  its efforts to develop guidance on designating critical habitat for listed  species.", "To better understand the relative emphasis given to program areas in the  endangered species program and determine whether appropriated funds  are being spent in accordance with budgetary direction, we recommend  that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Service to review the processes  being used across the agency to record time charges.

It highlighted several  intermediate steps the Service has taken to ensure a more consistent  approach to critical habitat designation. For example, in December 2001,  the Service held a national \u201clisting\u201d workshop for field and regional staff  and solicitors at which the Service provided guidance on critical habitat  designations and listing decisions.

The total hours spent on a program area was the sum, across all  respondents, of the number of hours spent on that program area.  4.
