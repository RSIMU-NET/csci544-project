This report (1) describes the status of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) implementation of Recovery Act tax provisions; (2) examines whether IRS captured or planned to capture data on the use of the provisions; (3) assesses IRS's efforts to determine potential abuse of the provisions; and (4) discusses possible lessons learned for future tax administration. GAO analyzed IRS's implementation and data-collection plans for each provision; reviewed IRS and Department of the Treasury (Treasury) risk-management documents; interviewed federal and industry officials; and focused on five provisions implemented in 2009: Build America Bonds (BAB), Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), First-Time Homebuyer Credit (FTHBC), Making Work Pay Credit, and Net Operating Loss carrybacks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act posed significant implementation challenges for IRS because it had more than 50 provisions, many of which were immediately or retroactively available and had to be implemented during the tax filing season--IRS's busiest time. Some provisions affected the 2009 filing season (2008 tax year), while others mainly will affect the 2010 and 2011 filing seasons. IRS responded quickly to its challenges. IRS went beyond its typical data-collection efforts and plans to collect some data to track many Recovery Act provisions. Specifically, IRS currently has detailed data-collection plans for 17 or about 31 percent of the provisions and 63 percent of the total estimated cost of the tax provisions. Initial collections did not fully or accurately capture the use of some provisions. In addition, very little of the data that IRS has collected on the tax provisions has been released publicly. Similar to what GAO has found about the act's spending projects, the tax provisions' economic stimulus effect cannot be precisely isolated. Economists use evidence from macroeconomic forecasting models and models that extrapolate from historical data to assess stimulus effects. These approaches, however, are imprecise because historical experience may not apply well given the magnitude of the Recovery Act. The effect of some provisions on specific aspects of the economy may be described in general terms. For example, the Council of Economic Advisers noted that in addition to other policy actions affecting residential real estate, the FTHBC may have moderated construction-industry job losses. As a result of IRS's FTHBC prerefund compliance reviews, as of February 1, 2010, IRS had frozen about 140,000 refunds pending civil or criminal examination, and, as of December 2, 2009, had identified 175 criminal schemes and had 123 criminal investigations open. Although IRS addressed some challenges with the FTHBC in these ways, it still needs to finalize a way to identify individuals who fail to report home sales and might be required to repay part of the credit because their homes ceased to be their principal places of residence within 3 years of purchase. A form already exists that could be used for this purpose--Form 1099-S, \"Proceeds from Real Estate Transactions,\" but it is not clear IRS could use the form for this purpose under current legislative authority. As GAO's review ended, IRS identified third-party data that it expected to use and then evaluate the results. Issues IRS encountered in its Recovery Act experience could provide useful guidance for the future. Officials intend to do a lessons-learned study after the 2010 filing season but have yet to develop plans for doing so."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) is  an estimated $787 billion initiative intended to address the most serious  economic crisis since the Great Depression. Although the Recovery Act  primarily consists of new funding for programs and other investments  designed to stimulate the economy, more than a third of the act consists of  tax relief to the American public. The Recovery Act calls for  unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability in how Recovery  Act dollars are being spent, but information on the tax provisions is  generally not included in mandatory Recovery Act reporting. We raised the  issue of providing similar oversight of the tax provisions in previous  testimony. GAO reports and testimonies on the Recovery Act are available  at www.gao.gov/recovery.", "As part of an effort to provide the Congress and others with relevant  oversight information on the tax provisions in the Recovery Act, we  performed this review under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to  conduct evaluations. Our objectives were to (1) describe the status of the  Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) implementation of Recovery Act tax  provisions; (2) analyze IRS\u2019s plans to collect data on the provisions,  examine whether and how IRS captured data on the use of selected  provisions, and discuss the provisions\u2019 overall effect; (3) assess IRS\u2019s  efforts to determine potential abuse of the provisions and IRS\u2019s steps for  minimizing it; and (4) discuss possible lessons learned for future tax  administration. To meet our objectives, we obtained and analyzed IRS\u2019s  implementation and data-collection plans for each provision; reviewed  IRS, Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and Treasury Inspector  General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) planning, implementation, risk  management, and other documents; and interviewed federal officials and  industry representatives.", "We reviewed IRS\u2019s plans and actions for 54 provisions that it had a role in  administering. Of these, we focused our analysis on five provisions\u2014Build  America Bonds (BAB), Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  (COBRA) premium subsidies, the First-Time Homebuyer Credit (FTHBC),  the Making Work Pay Credit (MWPC), and net operating loss (NOL)  carrybacks. We selected these provisions because they were all being  implemented in 2009; included some that were among the largest in terms  of estimated revenue loss; most were refundable, meaning that taxpayers  may receive a tax refund even if they do not have any tax liability; and  covered most of IRS\u2019s categories of Recovery Act provisions. We also  reviewed a sixth provision\u2014the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC)\u2014but  limited our work to data-collection issues because we are doing a separate  review of the HCTC, which is due in March 2010 as mandated by the  Recovery Act. See the Background section or appendix I for a description  of the provisions we reviewed. See appendix II for a full description of our  scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2009 through February  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives and found the IRS data we  used reliable for the purposes of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IRS received approximately $197 million to implement 54 Recovery Act  provisions. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that these  54 provisions would cost about $325 billion between fiscal year 2009 and  fiscal year 2019. (App. III shows the estimated cost of each provision.)  JCT\u2019s estimate can be reconciled with the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s  (CBO) estimate of $212 billion in reduced revenue and the administration\u2019s  $288 billion in tax relief shown on its Recovery Act Web site,  recovery.gov. JCT\u2019s estimate includes the effect on the budget of  provisions of the act administered through the tax code, but CBO\u2019s $212  billion estimate, which is based on JCT\u2019s estimate, includes only the effect  on revenue collections. The primary difference is that CBO\u2019s estimate does  not include some provisions that result in additional federal outlays rather  than only reduced tax collections. This occurs under several provisions  when taxpayers can receive a refund even if they do not have any tax  liability. On recovery.gov, the administration includes both categories to  arrive at its estimate of $288 billion in tax relief. The JCT estimate of $325  billion also includes the cost of COBRA and economic recovery payments  provisions that IRS administers.", "IRS had a role in administering 54 Recovery Act provisions. However, IRS  is not responsible for implementing all provisions included in the tax  section of the Recovery Act, such as grants in lieu of credits and the New  Markets Tax Credit. Grants were authorized because the effectiveness of  particular credits was thought to be undermined by economic conditions;  the grant provisions are administered elsewhere in Treasury. In a recent  report, TIGTA\u2019s count of Recovery Act provisions also differed from ours;  for example, it included the New Markets Tax Credit, which is being  administered by Treasury\u2019s Community Development Financial  Institutions Fund.", "To facilitate management of the provisions, as shown in figure 1, IRS  grouped the provisions into six categories, with individual credits as the  largest category by far in terms of dollars. A seventh category, withholding  on government contractors, appears in the figure because it is being  administered by IRS; however, IRS did not consider it to be a category  because the Recovery Act only delayed the effective date for the  withholding.", "The bulk of the stimulus to be provided by the tax provisions is expected  to be in fiscal year 2010, as shown in figure 2.", "As previously mentioned, we focused our work on five provisions and  performed limited work on a sixth. A brief description of each provision  follows. (See app. I for a more thorough description of these provisions,  including provision requirements.)", "Build America Bonds (BAB): BABs are taxable government bonds that can  be issued with federal subsidies for a portion of the borrowing costs  delivered either through nonrefundable tax credits provided to holders of  the bonds (tax credit BAB) or as refundable tax credits paid to state and  local governmental issuers of the bonds (direct payment BAB). Direct  payment BABs are a new type of bond that provides state and local  government issuers with a direct subsidy payment equal to 35 percent of  the bond interest they pay. Tax credit BABs provide investors with a  nonrefundable tax credit of 35 percent of the net bond interest payments  (excluding the credit), which represents a federal subsidy to the state or  local governmental issuer equal to approximately 25 percent of the total  return to the investor. State and local governments may issue an unlimited  number of BABs through December 31, 2010, and all BAB proceeds must  be used for capital expenditures.", "Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA): Recently  extended, the COBRA provision originally provided a 65 percent health  insurance subsidy for up to 9 months for individuals who lost health  insurance coverage due to involuntary termination between September 1,  2008, and December 31, 2009. Former employers, or in some cases  multiemployer health plans or insurers, pay 65 percent of insurance  premium costs and are reimbursed through a tax credit against their  payroll tax liability or through a tax refund if the credit exceeds their  payroll tax liability.", "First-Time Homebuyer Credit (FTHBC): The Recovery Act expanded the  FTHBC, which was initially established under the Housing and Economic  Recovery Act of 2008, to provide taxpayers a refundable tax credit of up  to $8,000 for the purchase of a home. Taxpayers are generally not required  to repay the credit unless the home ceases to be the taxpayer\u2019s principal  residence within 3 years of purchase. Several of the issues with the  FTHBC that are discussed in this report include differences between the  2008 and 2009 credits. The 2008 credit differs from the 2009 credit in that it  provided taxpayers up to $7,500, which has to be repaid in $500  increments over the course of a 15-year period. We testified on the use of  the FTHBC and implementation and compliance challenges in October  2009.", "Making Work Pay Credit (MWPC): The MWPC is a refundable tax credit  that provides up to $400 and $800, respectively, to working individuals and  married couples who file joint returns. Taxpayers may receive the credit  throughout the year in the form of lower amounts of tax withheld from  their paychecks. Taxpayers who do not have taxes withheld throughout  the year will not benefit from the credit until they claim it on their annual  tax return.", "Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carryback: The NOL carryback provision  allows eligible small businesses\u2014those that had a 3-year gross receipts  average of no more than $15 million\u2014to apply for a refund for taxes paid  in up to 5 previous years if the business experienced a loss in 2008.", "Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC): The HCTC can be claimed (1) by  workers who have lost manufacturing or service jobs due to international  trade or have lost public agency jobs and are eligible for a form of Trade  Adjustment Assistance or (2) by those who are receiving payments from  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Among other things, the  Recovery Act increased the health insurance premium subsidy rate from  65 percent to 80 percent of the premiums for an eligible taxpayer\u2019s  qualified health insurance plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Moved Quickly to Address the Recovery Act\u2019s Significant Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["While IRS has implemented major pieces of legislation in the past, the  Recovery Act posed significant implementation challenges because it was  a large piece of legislation and many provisions were immediately or  retroactively effective and had to be implemented during the tax filing  season\u2014IRS\u2019s busiest time of year. IRS officials moved quickly to  implement the Recovery Act, aided by their efforts to organize internally  and consult externally with lawmakers and industry groups before the  act\u2019s passage. IRS put its highest priority on implementing 14 of the 54 IRS  provisions in 2009 because they required immediate action. Some of  these provisions, such as the FTHBC and NOL carrybacks, were  retroactive and could be claimed on a 2008 tax return. IRS started taking  action on many of the remaining 40 provisions in 2009 as well. Some  provisions affected the 2009 filing season (for tax year 2008), while others  mainly will affect the 2010 and 2011 filing seasons.", "To implement the provisions, IRS quickly issued forms and guidance,  communicated with taxpayers and tax return preparers, and made  computer programming or processing changes. For example, within days  of the act\u2019s passage, IRS issued revised withholding tables for the MWPC  and produced new or updated tax forms and instructions for it and  COBRA. As shown in table 1, as of January 12, 2010, IRS either completed  or initiated steps to issue new forms and instructions and revise many  others for 48 of the 54 provisions, or 89 percent of the total. When we first  checked on progress, as of August 20, 2009, or about 6 months after the  Recovery Act\u2019s enactment, the percentage was also greater than 80  percent. In addition, as of January 12, 2010, IRS communicated with  taxpayers and tax return preparers through a variety of avenues, such as  news releases, postings on irs.gov, podcasts, and You Tube videos for 47 of  the 54, or about 87 percent of the provisions. IRS also made computer  programming changes to enable processing for paper and electronically  filed returns for 39, or about 72 percent of the provisions. IRS did not plan  to engage in guidance and instruction for 6 provisions or education and  outreach activities for 7 provisions, or make processing and programming  changes for 15 provisions because, according to IRS officials, some did not  require activities to inform the public or ready IRS systems. We agree with  this decision because, as we saw, some of the tax provisions without  implementation activities were extensions or expansions of previously  existing tax provisions, modified previously existing tax rules, or gave  additional guidance. For example, one provision amended the Work  Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to create two new categories of targeted  groups, and as a result, IRS updated the instructions to the related tax  form to be filed with IRS but did not isolate amounts related to these  categories on the form itself or make any substantive processing and  programming changes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Responding Quickly Entailed Tradeoffs, and Subsequent Improvements Were Made", "paragraphs": ["IRS management had to make tradeoffs, often balancing other factors,  such as not making some computer changes to collect data, against the  need to quickly process claims and get tax information and assistance out  to the public, in order to implement the Recovery Act. For provisions we  reviewed in detail, IRS\u2019s initial actions were at times later substantively  adjusted.", "As a first example of a tradeoff, because IRS needed to quickly issue a new  set of withholding tables so taxpayers could immediately benefit from the  MWPC through reduced federal tax withholding, Treasury decided not to  fully account for the effect of the MWPC on taxpayers whose incomes  were in the MWPC phaseout range. As a result, taxpayers with incomes in  the phaseout range did not receive a precisely calculated tax reduction. In  November 2009, IRS issued new withholding tables for 2010 that included  two new brackets to better recognize the effect of the MWPC on taxpayers  in the phaseout range.", "The withholding changes for the MWPC may also have unfavorable  consequences for some other taxpayers. For instance, TIGTA recently  reported that over 15 million taxpayers, such as those receiving pensions  and joint filers with two or more jobs between them, may be negatively  affected by the MWPC. These taxpayers may owe taxes or receive a  lesser or no refund because not enough taxes were withheld from their  paychecks to satisfy their eventual tax obligation or maintain previous  withholding levels. IRS and Treasury have taken steps to deal with  potential underwithholding for these taxpayers. IRS has conducted  outreach to encourage taxpayers to look more closely at their tax  withholding and plans to do more outreach. IRS\u2019s Web site contains  publications and other guidance, including a tax withholding calculator,  instructing taxpayers how to adjust their withholding in light of the  MWPC. To address potential underwithholding for pensioners, Treasury  developed supplemental withholding tables that pension administrators  can use in conjunction with the previously issued tables to offset the effect  of the MWPC.", "In addition, because of the MWPC, some taxpayers could be subject to tax  penalties as a result of the credit. TIGTA estimated that over 1 million  taxpayers could be assessed a tax penalty or have their tax penalty  increased because of the MWPC. IRS has taken steps to address these  concerns as well, as it will allow taxpayers to use Form 2210,  \u201cUnderpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts,\u201d to  request that the penalties be waived. IRS has alerted taxpayers to this  option and how to exercise it by adding information to the instructions for  the Form 1040, \u201cU.S. Individual Income Tax Return,\u201d and, according to  TIGTA, also plans to add information to Publication 505, \u201cTax Withholding  and Estimated Tax.\u201d", "A second tradeoff involved the FTHBC. Because of the compressed time to  implement the revised credit, IRS did not make computer changes to easily  collect data, including the home purchase date, from the Form 5405, \u201cFirst- Time Homebuyer Credit,\u201d the form used to claim the credit. This was  problematic because without the home purchase date IRS was unable to  easily distinguish 2008 and 2009 FTHBC claims, a problem we noted in our  October 2009 testimony. Distinguishing between the two credits is critical  because the acts establishing them contain different requirements,  including whether and how the credit is to be repaid. In studying FTHBC  claims, TIGTA found that, as of May 29, 2009, IRS had not properly  categorized more than 43,000 returns, considering them as 2008 claims  instead of 2009 claims. According to TIGTA, if further action is not taken,  some taxpayers who bought a home in 2009 could receive a letter from IRS  incorrectly indicating that they must repay the credit. IRS plans to verify  the date of purchase on past claims and make any necessary adjustments  when it begins enforcing the 2008 FTHBC repayment provisions. IRS also  plans to make the computer changes needed to collect all significant data  for 2009 claims, including home purchase date, from a revised Form 5405.", "As a third example of a tradeoff, because of the limited time to make  necessary computer programming changes that would have enabled  payments by direct deposit, IRS issued BAB direct payments by paper  check instead of electronic payments. According to IRS officials, IRS\u2019s use  of paper checks possibly increased the costs of issuing BAB direct  payments at least nominally. For 2010, IRS plans to change Form 8038-CP,  \u201cReturn for Credit Payments to Issuers of Qualified Bonds,\u201d to include  bank routing numbers so that payments can be made electronically.", "Also, because of the limited time, IRS used an existing tax-exempt  government bond form, Form 8038-G, \u201cInformation Return for Tax- Exempt Government Obligations,\u201d for state and local governments to  report 2009 BAB information. Governmental issuers were required to  submit a copy of Form 8038-G, to identify the issue as a BAB and to record  information on the issue price, weighted average maturity, yield  percentage, and the use of bond proceeds. However, unlike what is  required for other bond issues, BAB issuers were also required to attach a  separate schedule to identify the type of bond issue. For 2010, IRS plans to  use a new form specifically designed for BABs. The new form will collect  the same information that was collected in 2009, but issuers will be able to  identify the type of BAB and provide information on the type of bond issue  all on the form itself, requiring no attachment.", "Another effect of the limited time available to implement BABs was that  BAB work took priority over already-existing bond projects, delaying the  other projects somewhat, according to Treasury and IRS officials.", "As a final example, IRS also made tradeoffs when implementing NOL  carrybacks.", "As soon as the Recovery Act was enacted, taxpayers began filing 3-, 4-, and  5-year NOL carryback claims, which allowed them to use 2008 small  business losses to reduce taxable income from 3, 4, or 5 years before and  get tax refunds quickly. Because taxpayers made claims before IRS issued  its guidance on March 16, 2009, taxpayers made what IRS officials  considered invalid or unclear elections on their NOL carryback claims.  Despite the March 16th guidance, taxpayers continued to file unclear  carryback claims because they appeared to have not followed the  instructions in the guidance, which told taxpayers to attach a statement to  their tax return indicating certain information. Officials processed the  claims and decided to issue on May 11, 2009, a second piece of guidance  superseding the March 16th one in order to make the process easier for  taxpayers. The May 11th guidance reduced the burden on taxpayers by  allowing them to file the appropriate NOL carryback form without having  to attach an election statement. By reviewing the computations on the  appropriate form, IRS was able to find the information it needed to  process the claim.", "When processing takes more than 45 days, IRS has to pay interest on NOL  refunds, just as it must for other refunds taking more than 45 days to  process. In order to process the claims on time, IRS initially took one to  two revenue agents at seven campus locations away from examination  cases for 1 to 2 days per week to determine whether small businesses\u2019 3- year average gross receipts were under a $15 million ceiling, making them  eligible for the NOL carryback refunds. This lasted for about 2 months  until IRS developed a Gross Receipts Average Calculator tool. This tool  replaced the need for extensive revenue agent involvement by  automatically calculating a taxpayer\u2019s average gross receipts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Data-Collection Efforts Have Limitations, and the Tax Provisions\u2019 Economic Stimulus Effect Cannot Be Precisely Isolated", "paragraphs": ["Collecting data on the tax provisions is important to (1) ensure Recovery  Act funds are used efficiently, (2) ensure program compliance, and (3)  determine program effectiveness. Without appropriate data, it may be  either impossible or costly to determine the extent to which the tax  benefits were used, when they were used, whether they were used  effectively and as intended, and whether any lessons could be learned. In  previous reports, we noted that IRS did not collect sufficient information  to determine the use and effectiveness of certain tax provisions. In the  report on Indian reservation depreciation, we noted that the lack of  sufficient data impeded IRS\u2019s ability to ensure program compliance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Has Plans to Collect Some Data to Track Many Provisions", "paragraphs": ["In the past, IRS officials said that IRS\u2019s role is to collect data only to the  extent that the data help it to administer the tax code. However, for the  Recovery Act, IRS went beyond its typical efforts in order to provide  transparency over the use of the tax provisions and to collect more  reportable data on the tax provisions. For example, IRS did not collect any  additional data related to the 5-year NOL carryback for the Job Creation  and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, but it is collecting carryback data for  the Recovery Act\u2019s NOL provision.", "Throughout the year after the Recovery Act was enacted, IRS developed  plans for collecting data. For example, as shown in table 2, of the 54  provisions that IRS has a role in implementing, IRS had detailed data- collection plans for 17, or about 31 percent. These 17 provisions cover  about $207 billion, or 63 percent, of the $325 billion total cost that JCT  estimated for the 54 provisions. For about 33 percent of the 54 provisions,  covering about $96 billion, or 30 percent, of the total cost, IRS had  identified preliminary data sources, but not what, if any, data it will  compile and report.", "For the remaining 19 provisions covering about 7 percent of the total cost,  IRS does not plan to compile or report any data. For 9 of these provisions,  covering about $5 billion, or 1 percent of total cost, IRS officials stated  that no data are available on tax forms and IRS does not plan to modify tax  forms to enable data collection. As an example, the WOTC is included in  this group. The Recovery Act expands the credit by adding two categories  of eligible individuals. IRS does not plan to modify the tax form to enable  data collection on the newly eligible individuals as it currently does not  collect data on any of the eligible individuals. For the final 10 provisions,  covering about $18 billion or 6 percent of total cost, IRS did not plan to  collect data or report any information because, according to IRS officials,  this category included 9 provisions relating to guidance or reflecting rule  changes. For the other provision, IRS had a minimal role, and Treasury\u2019s  Financial Management Service (FMS) took the lead in administering it.  We agree with IRS\u2019s decision not to report on these 10 provisions.", "Very little of the data that IRS has collected on the tax provisions has been  released publicly. On September 3, 2009, Treasury released preliminary  data collected on its Recovery Act programs, including the use of BABs,  economic recovery payments, and the FTHBC. Recovery.gov includes a  chart on the estimated dollars distributed through the tax provisions, but  this estimate is not based on actual provision use. Rather, it prorates  estimates that were created by Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis before  the act\u2019s implementation. Data collected for individual tax provisions that  specify the number of provision users and dollar amount of claims made  were not reported on recovery.gov, as of January 20, 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initial Data Collection Did Not Fully or Accurately Capture the Use of Some Recovery Act Provisions", "paragraphs": ["During much of our review, IRS focused on collecting and internally  reporting data on four provisions\u2014BABs, COBRA, the FTHBC, and the  HCTC. (See app. IV for information on the use of these provisions.) Some  of the data IRS collected did not accurately capture taxpayers\u2019 use of  Recovery Act provisions, as provision use was sometimes incompletely  described or overstated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BAB Data Do Not Show Specific Bond Use", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019s reporting requirements for BABs are minimal in contrast to  requirements for Recovery Act infrastructure and other direct spending  projects, even though such projects may be similar. For example, funding  for both Recovery Act spending projects and BABs may be used for  highway, school, water, sewer, or utility improvements. Currently, IRS  requires state and local governments to submit an information return at  the time of bond issuance that describes the type of bond issue, issue  price, weighted average maturity, yield percentage, and the use of bond  proceeds. As shown in appendix IV, as of January 1, 2010, state and local  governments reported 443 BAB issuances valued at about $32.4 billion.  One hundred and thirty-one BABs were issued for education, which was  more issuances than for any other type, except the \u201cother\u201d category.", "Spending projects undertaken under the Recovery Act by state and local  governments are subject to additional reporting requirements. Section  1512 of the act requires nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act grants,  contracts, and loans to provide information on each project or activity,  including a description of the project and its purpose, an evaluation of its  status toward completion, the amount of recovery funds spent, and the  number of jobs created and retained. The reporting required for spending  projects is intended to increase accountability and transparency. In  addition, federal agencies are required to submit reports that describe the  amount of Recovery Act funds made available and paid out to the states  through contracts, grants, and loans. Although IRS is not required to  publicly report data on BAB use, doing so could increase accountability  and transparency. As part of its bond outreach efforts, Treasury has asked  governmental issuers to report how their government has used BABs.  Treasury plans to compile this information for its internal use only. There  are no efforts by other federal agencies to compile or publish BAB  information. The limited data collected and publicly reported for BABs  does not reflect the same emphasis as that for spending projects.", "According to the Director of IRS\u2019s Tax-Exempt Bonds division, more  detailed information reporting on BAB-financed projects, such as that  required on the Schedule K of Form 990, \u201cSupplemental Information on  Tax-Exempt Bonds,\u201d may increase compliance over the life of bonds  because government issuers would be reminded of bond requirements  each year when filing the form and would be more likely to keep and  maintain required documentation. Charitable organizations are required to  submit Schedule K annually with their tax returns, although no similar  yearly bond reporting requirement exists for governmental bond issuers.  The rationale for the Schedule K was that significant noncompliance with  recordkeeping requirements for charitable organization tax-exempt bonds  existed, making it hard for IRS to determine if the bonds remained  qualified for tax exemption throughout their life. Accordingly, Schedule K  and its instructions ask for a description of the bond\u2019s purpose\u2014 constructing a hospital or acquiring office equipment are examples cited\u2014 and the year the project was substantially completed, just like the  reporting requirements for Recovery Act spending projects.", "IRS officials said that yearly BAB reporting similar to the Schedule K  would help IRS know whether bonds remained qualified for their tax- advantaged status. One hundred percent of BAB proceeds are to be used  for qualified capital expenditures, and yearly reporting by governmental  issuers would allow IRS to more easily identify issuers who have not  adhered to this standard or maintained the required documentation to  show how bond proceeds were used. It could also help lawmakers or  others in determining the overall effectiveness of the newly created bonds.  Any additional cost of reporting, such as those already borne for spending  projects, could be tempered by having a minimum reporting threshold or  delaying the onset of requirements, as was the case when reporting for  charitable organizations was instituted. However, if IRS required more  specific reporting for BABs, it could not publicly release it for individual  issuers.

To assess the  effects of stimulus policies such as tax incentives, economists use  evidence from macroeconometric forecasting models and models that  extrapolate from historical data. The forecasting models are based largely  on historical evidence, and the analyses estimate behavior based on how  economic variables such as gross domestic product (GDP) have  responded to stimulus policies in the past. Neither type of model uses  current data to assess the effect of the stimulus. The models are used to  estimate \u201cmultipliers,\u201d which represent the cumulative effect of a  particular incentive, such as a tax cut, on GDP over time. For example, a  multiplier of 1.0 means a dollar of stimulus financed by borrowing results  in an additional dollar of GDP. Generally, multipliers can provide insights  into the potential effect on GDP of different types of public spending.  Because of the limited historical experience with a fiscal stimulus of the  magnitude of the Recovery Act, there is uncertainty about the extent to  which multipliers based on historical evidence about the effect of previous  business cycles will accurately reflect the stimulus effect this time.  However, economists use the models as a basis for constructing  reasonable ranges of values for multipliers.

According to CEA\u2019s analysis, the bonus depreciation  provision, which allows businesses to recover the costs of acquired  property at a faster rate than they otherwise would, benefited businesses  and may have led to a slower investment decline in the second quarter of  2009 than would have occurred in the absence of such provisions.  Additionally CEA concluded that although the MWPC, along with other  provisions of the Recovery Act and other economic recovery policies,  helped stabilize consumption, a small drop in consumption in the second  quarter could indicate that households were using the MWPC mainly to  increase savings and pay off debt.

However, IRS and  TIGTA reviews of early FTHBC filings identified additional compliance  issues, such as instances where taxpayers who had previously owned a  home claimed the credit. Based on its review of early filings, IRS  implemented additional computer filters to better determine taxpayer  eligibility before refunds were issued. For example, IRS developed filters  to check for indications of prior homeownership within the past 3 years.  As a result of its prerefund checks, as of February 1, 2010, IRS had frozen  about 140,000 refunds pending civil or criminal examination, and, as of  December 2, 2009, had identified 175 criminal schemes and had 123  criminal investigations open.", "IRS faces a challenge in knowing whether homebuyer credit recipients sell  their homes.

Currently, IRS annually receives some Forms 1099-S,  \u201cProceeds from Real Estate Transactions,\u201d from agents closing real estate  transactions such as home sales. The form provides information such as  the seller\u2019s name and Social Security number and the sale price of the  home and is to be used by IRS to determine if taxpayers have filed returns  and reported all of their proceeds from real estate transactions. However,  closing agents are generally exempt from reporting information on the sale  of principal residences sold for $250,000 or less if the agent receives  written certification from the seller that certain assurances are true.  Moreover, it is not clear whether IRS has the authority to require Form  1099-S be filed by third parties currently exempted for purposes of  recapture from FTHBC recipients. If Form 1099-S information reporting  could be required for all home sales or for those taxpayers who do not  certify that they had not claimed the FTHBC, IRS might be better able to  identify the taxpayers who need to repay part or all of the credit. Because  Form 1099-S contains the seller\u2019s Social Security number, IRS could match  the identification numbers on the Forms 1099-S to those reported on  returns claiming the FTHBC, isolating Form 1099-S filers who should have  reported their home sale on the FTHBC form, but did not.", "As we were completing our review, IRS officials identified an alternative  way to analyze whether homebuyer credit recipients sell their homes and  are, therefore, possibly subject to payback requirements.

As a result, it was only aware of the  number of individuals an employer reported on Form 941 and the total  amount of the subsidy claimed.

Those  individuals and married couples filing joint tax returns with modified  adjusted incomes above $125,000 and $250,000, respectively, are required  to report on their tax returns that they received COBRA assistance. This  requirement is in place because the COBRA subsidy phases out for those  taxpayers with higher incomes, and those above the phaseout range are  ineligible. IRS plans to conduct a review of filed returns to identify high- income taxpayers who did not report the subsidy as an addition to tax.  However, rather than rely solely on audits to determine if these taxpayers  are subject to additional tax, IRS has taken some steps to obtain this  information. For example, IRS worked with tax-preparation software  companies to ensure that pointed questions are asked during tax return  preparation to determine if individuals received COBRA during the year.  IRS also has plans to use a compliance initiative project to test whether  taxpayers did not report the subsidy as an addition to tax and decide if  further action is needed.", "Individuals are allowed to receive a COBRA subsidy for up to 9 months  after their involuntary termination, but, since IRS does not know from the  Form 941 who is receiving COBRA subsidies, it also does not have the  information to know when an individual\u2019s eligibility period ends. Claims  beyond 9 months may not be widespread because some studies have  shown that, even with the subsidy, COBRA is generally more expensive to  employees than employer-sponsored plans. Thus, in most circumstances,  individuals have an incentive to terminate their COBRA coverage when  other options exist. However, employers may have an incentive to  continue claiming the credit even when former employees are no longer  eligible. A past report of ours noted that businesses facing economic  hardship may take advantage of the tax system by diverting payroll taxes  for their own uses. Employer audits are one of the ways IRS learns if an  employer claimed the credit for employees for longer than 9 months. IRS  will not be able to audit all employers. To address this concern, IRS has  conducted outreach with the employer and payroll communities  emphasizing the time limit and planned to continue doing so in the coming  months.

Over the years, the Congress has granted  IRS MEA for specified purposes. For example, when a taxpayer makes an  entry on a tax return for a deduction or credit in an amount that exceeds  the statutory limit for that deduction or credit, IRS uses its MEA to correct  the error during tax return processing. MEA is an automated and low-cost  means to protect federal revenue and avoid the need for costly audits.

It followed our  suggestion that, to reduce IRS\u2019s reliance on costly and burdensome audits  of the credit, the Congress should consider providing IRS with additional  MEA. Specifically, we suggested that the Congress consider giving IRS  MEA to use tax return information to automatically verify taxpayers\u2019  compliance with the 2008 FTHBC payback provision and to ensure that  taxpayers do not improperly claim the credit in multiple years. In addition  to following these suggestions, based on noncompliance identified by  TIGTA, the Congress granted IRS MEA to assess additional tax without the  notice of deficiency otherwise required if a taxpayer did not meet the  credit\u2019s age requirement or did not submit the settlement statement used  in the home purchase.", "The Congress has been incrementally adding MEA authorizations for  almost a century. The first basic exemption to the deficiency procedures  for mathematical errors can be found in the Internal Revenue law in 1926.  In 1976, the Congress expanded the authority beyond mathematical errors  to clerical errors and gave taxpayers the right to ask that IRS reverse the  math error assessment and follow IRS\u2019s normal deficiency procedures. In  the 1990s, the Congress extended MEA multiple times to help IRS  determine eligibility for certain tax exemptions and credits. As a recent  example of where MEA could also be useful, in 2008 we suggested that the  Congress provide IRS with the authority to automatically correct returns  for individual retirement account (IRA) contributions that violated certain  dollar or age limits. In 2004, IRS had found IRA contribution overclaims  by taxpayers under age 50 resulting in $23.2 million in underreported taxes  but did not have the MEA to use age-based data to check for age-based  eligibility. Also, on September 30, 2009, after finding more than $600  million of inappropriately claimed Hope Credits for higher education,  TIGTA recommended that the Congress give IRS MEA to disallow claims  for the Hope Credit for more years than allowed by law. In a November  2009 report, TIGTA listed four examples of other reports it had issued in  fiscal years 2008 and 2009 with issues related to MEA, three  recommending that specific MEA be obtained or studied.", "Authorizing the use of MEA on a broader basis rather than case-by-case,  with appropriate controls, could have several benefits to IRS and  taxpayers.

Consequently, the Congress incorporated certain taxpayer  safeguards into the legislation, such as requiring IRS to explain to the  taxpayer the errors it asserted. Still, the Taxpayer Advocate was  concerned that taxpayers, especially low-income taxpayers, might not  proactively ask, within 60 days after being assessed tax by IRS, to have  their assessment reversed by IRS, and thus might be unable to challenge  an IRS notice through normal deficiency procedures or in the Tax Court.  She was also concerned that MEA notices to taxpayers did not contain the  type of information the Congress envisioned that clearly explained to  taxpayers the nature of the error that IRS addressed through MEA.", "The Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s 2002 annual report recommended that the  Congress specifically limit the scope of the assessment authority for  mathematical or clerical errors and provide standards by which to judge  any proposed expansion of this authority.

For example, the Congress  could require IRS to submit a report on a proposed new use of MEA. The  report could include how such use would meet the standards or criteria  outlined by the Congress. The report could also describe IRS\u2019s or the  Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s assessment of any potential effect on taxpayer rights.  Or, the Congress could require a more informal procedure whereby IRS  simply notifies a committee, such as JCT, of its proposed use and  subsequently submits a report after such use is underway.

BAB subsidies can be either nonrefundable  tax credits provided to holders of the bonds (tax credit BABs) or  refundable tax credits paid to state and local governmental issuers of the  bonds (direct payment BABs). Direct payment bonds are a new type of  bond that provides state and local government issuers with a direct  subsidy payment equal to 35 percent of the bond interest they pay.  Because of this feature, state and local governments are able to offer the  bonds to investors at a higher interest rate than they can with tax-exempt  bonds. Direct payment BABs may appeal to a broader market than  traditional tax-exempt bonds because a wider range of investors, such as  pension funds that pay no taxes and therefore have less incentive to invest  in tax-exempt bonds, are able to take advantage of them and receive a  return comparable to taxable debt instruments. Tax credit BABs provide  investors with a nonrefundable tax credit of 35 percent of the net bond  interest payments (excluding the credit), which represents a federal  subsidy to the state or local governmental issuer equal to approximately 25  percent of the total return to the investor. This subsidy is expected to  make investors indifferent between the tax credit bond and a taxed bond  that is otherwise similar. As a result, each dollar of federal revenue  foregone for both direct payment and tax credit BABs benefits state and  local governments. One hundred percent of the proceeds from BABs must  be used for capital expenditures.

The act provided up to 9 months of premium assistance at a  lower rate to individuals who were involuntarily terminated from their  jobs. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub. L. No.  111\u2013118) extended the duration of premium assistance from 9 months to  15 months. Individuals pay no more than 35 percent of premium costs and  their former employers pay the remaining 65 percent. Employers are  reimbursed for their COBRA subsidies through a tax credit against their  payroll tax liability or through a tax refund if the credit exceeds their  payroll tax liability.

This $8,000 credit is a  refundable tax credit, meaning that it is paid out even if there is no tax  liability.

Other eligibility requirements for individuals include that they not be  entitled to benefits from a government health insurance program and that  they be enrolled in a qualified health plan.

We focused on education  and outreach, guidance and instruction, and processing and programming  activities because they were part of a framework that IRS used to  implement Recovery Act tax provisions.", "To further address this objective as well as others, we selected five  Recovery Act tax provisions to review in detail\u2014Build America Bonds  (BAB), Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)  premium subsidies, the First-Time Homebuyer Credit (FTHBC), the  Making Work Pay Credit (MWPC), and net operating loss (NOL)  carrybacks.

By choosing provisions being implemented in  2009, we could study how IRS\u2019s forms, guidance, systems, and processes  were used to implement change relatively quickly. In addition, more  reliable data would be available than for provisions that could not be  claimed until the future.", "Estimated revenue loss. We chose estimated revenue loss as another  criterion to make sure we included provisions estimated to have a large  effect on revenue. We were interested in whether a provision\u2019s estimated  revenue loss was among the largest of the 54 provisions. The six  provisions we selected had total estimated revenue losses of about $153  billion over the period from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2011,  almost half the estimated losses for all 54 provisions.", "Refundable components. We chose refundability as a third criterion  because IRS has frequently noted that refundable tax provisions are more  susceptible to abuse than other tax provisions. Further, when IRS actually  refunds money to taxpayers, recouping it can be difficult if the monies  were paid erroneously.", "Coverage. As shown earlier in table 1, IRS grouped Recovery Act  provisions into the following categories: individual tax credits, tax  incentives for business, renewable energy, various bond incentives, health  coverage improvement, and COBRA. We chose coverage as a fourth  criterion in order to ensure that we considered at least one provision from  most of the IRS categories. We did not select provisions from the  Renewable Energy group because none of them was being implemented in  2009. We selected the BAB and NOL carryback provisions in spite of their  relatively small dollar estimates to achieve wider coverage of IRS  categories.", "Table 5 summarizes how the five provisions we selected for further study  addressed these criteria and also shows how the HCTC relates to the  criteria.", "For the second objective, dealing with IRS\u2019s collection of data on the  Recovery Act provisions, we analyzed IRS planning documents for  collecting data for the 54 provisions. For the 5 selected provisions and the  HCTC, we analyzed whether IRS would be able to identify provision users  and the extent of use. To see how these data could relate to estimating  IRS\u2019s Recovery Act provisions\u2019 effect on the overall economy, we  consulted with GAO economics experts, including the Chief Economist\u2019s  office, and studied Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports.", "To meet the third objective, relating to the potential abuse of provisions,  we determined what risk assessments and risk-mitigation plans IRS had  done or planned for the future and discussed them with IRS and  Department of the Treasury officials. We also assessed IRS\u2019s risk- management efforts against GAO and other published criteria on  mitigating abusive noncompliance. For the five selected provisions, we  examined the potential for abuse by reviewing IRS documentation and risk  assessments and interviewing Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration (TIGTA) and IRS officials.", "We used the results of our work and TIGTA\u2019s to answer our fourth  objective\u2014discussing possible lessons learned for future tax  administration.
