LM is taking some actions to address these challenges. For example, at its Rocky Flats, Colorado, site, LM is repairing an aging landfill that was damaged by extreme rainfall events. However, LM has not yet planned for how to address challenges at some sites that may require new cleanup work that is not in the scope of LM's expertise and resources. By developing agreements and procedures with the entities that would be responsible for conducting this new cleanup work, LM can help mitigate risks to human health and the environment. In addition, LM has not made plans to assess the effects of climate change on its sites or to mitigate those effects, as called for in its strategic plan.

Rather, many sites will require  surveillance and maintenance to ensure the continued protection of  human health and the environment for as long as contamination  remains\u2014in many cases, hundreds or thousands of years into the future.  The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for such surveillance and  maintenance, and in 2003, it created the Office of Legacy Management  (LM) to manage those responsibilities. Specifically, LM is charged with  providing environmental surveillance, facility and site maintenance,  records management, and pension and benefit program oversight for  sites where active cleanup has been completed, among other things.

To assess the reliability of  these data, we reviewed accompanying documentation on LM\u2019s sites and  its guidance on estimating its environmental liability, interviewed  knowledgeable officials from LM and DOE\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial  Officer about the department\u2019s systems for collecting and maintaining the  data, and conducted checks for data completeness and other factors. For  example, we confirmed the completeness of the data by verifying that the  number and types of sites represented in LM\u2019s data align with  documentation listing its current sites as of fiscal year 2019.

To develop interview questions for site-level officials, we  analyzed relevant reports from the National Academies of Science,  Engineering, and Medicine on DOE\u2019s long-term management of post- cleanup sites. We categorized major areas of challenges identified in  these reports and used these categories to develop questions for site- level officials about potential challenges facing LM in providing long-term  surveillance and maintenance of sites. In developing these questions, we  also drew on challenges identified by LM headquarters officials. We  visited and toured one of LM\u2019s category 3 sites\u2014the Rocky Flats site in  Colorado.

According to the  report, a variety of hazards would remain at many DOE sites after these  sites had been cleaned up in accordance with applicable requirements.  These hazards include long-lived radionuclides left in place in soils or  contained in on-site disposal cells and residual contaminants in surface  water and groundwater. The report cited technical challenges\u2014such as  lack of existing technology for completely removing some types of  waste\u2014and economic limitations\u2014such as prohibitive costs to employ  available technology\u2014as reasons why these hazards would remain. As  a result, DOE reported that long-term management would be needed at  these sites to ensure that the cleanup remedies\u2014i.e., the actions,  systems, or other measures put in place to clean up a site\u2014would protect  human health and the environment from these hazards into the future.  Several DOE organizations, including the Office of Environmental  Management (EM), were responsible for long-term management of post- cleanup sites until the department established LM in 2003.

Established in 1989, DOE\u2019s EM is responsible for the cleanup of  legacy waste that resulted from the development and production of  nuclear weapons and government-sponsored nuclear energy  research dating back to World War II and the Cold War. Such waste  includes radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel and nuclear material,  and contaminated soil and water, among other things. EM cleaned up  83 of the 100 sites that are now within LM\u2019s portfolio. Key laws that  governed EM\u2019s cleanup of these sites include the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 as  amended (CERCLA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  of 1976 as amended (RCRA); and Title I of the Uranium Mill Tailings  Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA). Title I of UMTRCA  authorizes a cleanup program for uranium mill tailings sites\u2014which  produced uranium for nuclear weapons and other defense purposes\u2014 that were no longer operational as of 1978, the year of the law\u2019s  enactment. DOE is generally responsible for financing the cleanup  of these sites. EM also cleaned up sites that are now within LM\u2019s  portfolio under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program  (FUSRAP). This program was established in 1974 to identify,  investigate, and clean up sites where radioactive contamination  remained from Manhattan Project and early Atomic Energy  Commission operations. EM was responsible for cleaning up  FUSRAP sites until 1997, when Congress directed the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (USACE) to assume responsibility for the cleanup  work of the remaining designated FUSRAP sites.", "USACE. USACE cleaned up 10 FUSRAP sites that are now within  LM\u2019s portfolio. Under a memorandum of understanding signed by  DOE and USACE in 1999, DOE is responsible for the long-term  management of FUSRAP sites after USACE completes cleanup. Key  requirements that govern USACE\u2019s cleanup of FUSRAP sites include  CERCLA and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution  Contingency Plan.", "Private licensees. LM\u2019s portfolio includes seven sites cleaned up by  private licensees, i.e., commercial operators who were permitted to  operate uranium mills or other facilities under a license from the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). In all except one case,  private licensees cleaned up these sites under Title II of UMTRCA,  which assigned responsibility to the licensee for reclamation of  uranium mill sites operating on or after the law\u2019s enactment in 1978.  When a private licensee has completed all cleanup requirements,  NRC approves transfer of a site to LM for long-term management.", "Cleanup activities conducted by these entities included decontaminating,  decommissioning, and demolishing buildings; containing and disposing of  a variety of hazardous and radioactive wastes; excavating and stabilizing  contaminated soil; constructing engineered disposal cells for  contaminated materials; containing and treating contaminated surface  water and groundwater; and preparing the land for future public,  industrial, or commercial use. Depending on the legal and regulatory  framework governing cleanup, other agencies or groups may have played  a role in setting cleanup standards and helping to select a site\u2019s cleanup  remedy. For example, sites cleaned up under Title I of UMTRCA must  meet regulatory cleanup standards established by the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). For certain sites cleaned up under CERCLA  and RCRA, DOE has entered into agreements with EPA and the relevant  state regulator regarding the necessary cleanup actions, and EPA and  the state have provided input in selecting the cleanup remedy.", "As cleanup of a site nears completion, LM works with the entity  responsible for cleanup to prepare the site for transition into LM\u2019s  portfolio. The transition process for a given site may take up to 5 years,  during which time LM and the cleanup entity develop a long-term  surveillance and maintenance plan. Depending on the authority under  which a site has undergone cleanup, this plan may require approval by  regulators such as EPA or NRC. Other transition responsibilities include  identifying and preserving records and checking that administrative  institutional controls and other real property instruments are in place.  DOE considers site cleanup to be complete when, among other things,  short-term cleanup activities have been completed and long-term cleanup  measures, such as groundwater treatment, are in place.

Most notably, LM\u2019s  total environmental liability increased by about $2 billion (about 41  percent) between fiscal years 2014 and 2015. LM officials attributed this  increase to adopting a more thorough approach for estimating future  costs associated with sites scheduled to be transferred from USACE  under FUSRAP. LM officials said that, before fiscal year 2015, LM had  used a standard cost estimate for all of USACE\u2019s sites, which resulted in  an underestimate of the associated liability. According to LM officials, in  fiscal year 2015 LM began estimating costs based on individual sites\u2019  specific conditions, which allowed LM to capture more potential costs.", "Similar to LM\u2019s overall environmental liability, the long-term surveillance  and maintenance portion of LM\u2019s environmental liability has generally  remained stable in recent years, though individual sites have seen some  notable changes. From fiscal year 2015 through 2018, LM\u2019s  environmental liability related to long-term surveillance and maintenance  remained between about $3 billion and $3.5 billion.

At the  site level, of LM\u2019s nine category 3 sites, the Fernald Preserve and Mound  sites in Ohio are examples of sites that have had mostly steady  decreases from fiscal year 2014 to 2019, which LM officials attributed in  part to adjustments to groundwater treatment strategies at Fernald  Preserve as well as transferring ownership of most of the Mound site to  another party. In contrast, several other sites (including Rocky Flats and  Grand Junction in Colorado and Weldon Spring in Missouri) saw overall  decreases from fiscal year 2014 to 2016 followed by steady increases  from fiscal year 2016 to 2019, which LM officials generally attributed to  costs of site maintenance at Rocky Flats, construction at Weldon Spring,  and planning activities for the potential closure of the disposal cell at  Grand Junction. LM officials provided additional details on specific factors  driving sites\u2019 changes in environmental liability. For example:", "At the Fernald Preserve site, the long-term surveillance and  maintenance liability has decreased overall from about $367 million in  fiscal year 2014 to about $308 million in fiscal year 2019 (about a 16  percent decrease). The site manager for Fernald attributed this  decrease to improvements in the site\u2019s groundwater treatment  strategy. In 2014, LM made changes to optimize the site\u2019s \u201cpump-and- treat\u201d system (which brings contaminated water above ground so that  it can be treated and contaminants removed) by increasing pumping  from the wells in the portion of the site with the most contamination,  according to the site manager. Further, the site manager said that this  change increased the amount of water coming from the more  contaminated areas, making the water treatment more efficient and  cost-effective in the long-term.", "At the Mound site, the long-term surveillance and maintenance liability  has decreased from about $124 million in fiscal year 2014 to about  $68 million in fiscal year 2019 (about a 45 percent decrease).  According to LM officials, this decrease is in part due to a transfer in  ownership. Specifically, LM transferred ownership of the majority of  the site to the Mound Development Corporation to sell or lease  parcels of the land to third parties for commercial use. Transferring  ownership meant that LM gave up some of its responsibilities and  their associated costs (such as maintenance and repairs at buildings  that are now privately owned), although it continues to fulfill ongoing  groundwater treatment and records management responsibilities.", "At the Rocky Flats site, the long-term surveillance and maintenance  liability has increased substantially since fiscal year 2016, from about  $269 million to about $452 million in fiscal year 2019 (about a 68  percent increase). According to the site manager for Rocky Flats, this  increase can be attributed to additional costs needed to repair aging  infrastructure. Specifically, a landfill on the site, which was  constructed in the 1950s, has been damaged by erosion in recent  years, and LM is currently undertaking a large-scale project to repair  and stabilize it after previous repairs failed to provide a long-term fix.  This project, which is due to be completed in the summer of 2020,  includes installing about 260 steel anchors of up to 95 feet in length  into the soil around the landfill.

Since LM does not account for the  environmental liability related to long-term surveillance and maintenance  for a portion of its sites until it acquires them, LM officials could not tell us  by how much its total environmental liability will increase as a result of  acquiring these sites. However, officials said that some sites  transitioning to LM in the future will be increasingly complex, which will  likely mean increased long-term surveillance and maintenance costs. In  particular, one official told us that the FUSRAP sites LM is set to acquire  from USACE will be larger and have more extensive residual  contamination than FUSRAP sites that LM had previously acquired.

We  found that LM has developed agreements and procedures for addressing  such challenges at sites cleaned up by USACE, but has not developed  such agreements and procedures for sites cleaned up by EM or by  private licensees under Title II of UMTRCA. Specifically, regarding sites  cleaned up by USACE under FUSRAP, under the 1999 memorandum of  understanding between DOE and USACE, USACE is responsible for  carrying out additional cleanup actions when it determines such actions  are necessary. In addition, LM guidance related to transition and transfer  of FUSRAP sites includes examples of situations in which LM would  return a site to USACE for additional cleanup, such as situations in which  routine monitoring identifies new areas of contamination. Conversely, for  sites where EM was responsible for active cleanup, a 2005 memorandum  co-signed by the leadership of LM and EM includes a brief statement  about the need for LM and EM to coordinate in instances of \u201csignificant  remedy failures.\u201d LM officials told us that structural or engineering  damage could signify evidence of a \u201csignificant remedy failure,\u201d but said  that such criteria have not been documented. They also said that LM has  not defined a process by which such failures would be addressed. Finally,  LM officials said that there is no mechanism in place under UMTRCA for  LM to return a site to NRC or to seek recovery of costs from a private  licensee for any additional cleanup that needs to be done.", "According to agency officials, LM has not developed agreements or  procedures for addressing challenges that require active cleanup work at  sites cleaned up by EM because LM has not yet encountered such  instances at any of its sites. They also noted that LM has been more  focused on long-term surveillance and maintenance and the process of  transitioning sites into its portfolio from EM and private licensees, rather  than a process for moving sites back to these entities if a cleanup remedy  fails. However, under federal internal control standards, management is  to design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks,  such as by clearly documenting internal control in management  directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals. By working  with EM and NRC to develop agreements and procedures for identifying  and addressing circumstances at LM sites that require new cleanup work  beyond the scope of LM\u2019s mission, capabilities, and resources, LM can  help ensure mitigation by the most appropriate entity of the risks to  human health and the environment that such instances would present."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenging Environmental Conditions May Become More Frequent or Intense", "paragraphs": ["LM faces challenges with environmental conditions at the sites\u2014some of  which may become more frequent or intense\u2014and, according to its  mission, LM must react to these challenges to ensure the sites remain  protective of human health and the environment. For example:", "At the Rocky Flats site in Colorado, officials told us that extreme  rainfall events over the past few years have caused soils covering an  on-site landfill to \u201cslump,\u201d or slip downhill. In particular, rainfall during  2015\u2014the site\u2019s wettest year on record, according to LM officials\u2014 caused a 20-foot slump in the landfill.", "The Boiling Nuclear Superheater site in Puerto Rico and the Pinellas  County site in Florida were both in the path of Hurricane Irma in 2017,  though neither site sustained substantial damage.", "At the Weldon Spring site in Missouri, the site manager said that  tornadoes pose a risk to the site\u2019s infrastructure, and that a strong  tornado in 2013 damaged the site\u2019s interpretive center.", "To address challenges related to environmental conditions, LM has been  repairing damages caused by extreme weather events. For example, at  the Rocky Flats site, LM is undertaking a major project to repair and  stabilize its aging landfill, as discussed earlier. At the Weldon Spring site,  LM installed a tornado shelter in 2014 and is currently building a new  interpretive center. In addition, according to the 2020 LM Site  Sustainability Plan, LM has taken a number of steps to implement  emergency and security measures, such as completing emergency drills  and tabletop exercises.", "The U.S. Global Change Research Program\u2014which coordinates and  integrates the activities of 13 federal agencies that research changes in  the global environment and their implications for society\u2014reported in its  November 2018 Fourth National Climate Assessment that climate change  is playing a role in the increasing frequency of some types of extreme  weather, such as extremely heavy rainfall and hurricanes; these are  environmental conditions that have presented challenges at LM sites.  The assessment reported that climate models are consistent with  temperature and precipitation extremes becoming more frequent, more  intense, or longer in duration, which may make certain natural disasters  more frequent or more intense. As a result of the significant risks posed  by climate change and the nation\u2019s fiscal condition, in February 2013, we  added Limiting the Federal Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by Better  Managing Climate Change Risks to our list of areas at high risk for fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or most in need of transformation.  In our March 2019 update to this high-risk area, we reported that the  federal government needs to improve the resilience of facilities it owns  and operates, and land it manages, against the effects of climate  change. In addition, in October 2019, we found that EPA needs to  improve management of risks from climate change at Superfund sites  where remedies may need to be operational indefinitely (see sidebar).", "We Found That EPA Should Take Additional  Actions to Manage Risks from Climate Change  Superfund is the federal government\u2019s principal  program to address sites with hazardous substances.  It was established by the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  Act of 1980 and is administered by the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). EPA lists some of the most  seriously contaminated sites on the National Priorities  List (NPL) and has recorded over 500 contaminants at  those sites. Some NPL sites are located at federal  facilities, where departments such as the Department  of Energy are responsible for cleanup. However, most  NPL sites are nonfederal, where EPA generally carries  out or oversees the cleanup conducted by one or more  potentially responsible parties.  In October 2019, we reported that available federal  data on flooding, storm surge, wildfires, and sea level  rise suggest that about 60 percent of all nonfederal  NPL sites are located in areas that may be impacted  by these potential climate change effects. According to  EPA officials, remedies at nonfederal NPL sites may  have to be operational indefinitely, during which time  the potential effects of climate change may become  more extreme. We found that EPA has taken some  actions to manage risks from the potential impacts of  climate change effects at nonfederal NPL sites, but  that its actions did not fully align with essential  elements of enterprise risk management. For example,  we found that EPA officials do not always have  direction to ensure that they consistently integrate  climate change information into site-level risk  assessments and risk response decisions, according  to EPA officials. Without providing such direction, EPA  cannot ensure that remedies at nonfederal NPL sites  will protect human health and the environment in the  long-term.  We made four recommendations to EPA, including that  it provide direction on how to integrate information on  the potential impacts of climate change effects into risk  assessments and risk response decisions at  nonfederal NPL sites. EPA agreed with one  recommendation and disagreed with the other three.  We continue to believe that all four are warranted.", "LM\u2019s 2016-2025 Strategic Plan acknowledges the challenges posed by  climate change. To support the objective of improving the long-term  sustainability of environmental remedies, the plan includes a strategy to  \u201cassess the effect of climate change on environmental remedies and  develop plans to mitigate significant impacts.\u201d However, LM provided  minimal information about ongoing or planned efforts to carry out this  strategy. Specifically, the 2020 LM Site Sustainability Plan, which  officials said provides information about LM\u2019s future plans to adapt to  changing climate conditions, includes the term \u201cclimate change\u201d one  time, in reference to sustainable buildings\u2014not to remedies. The plan  describes one pilot project conducted at the Monticello site to evaluate  the site\u2019s main climate stressors and capacity to adapt to those  stressors, but it does not describe whether or how LM intends to use the  results of the pilot project, such as any specific plans to roll out the  project to other sites. Aside from the 2020 LM Site Sustainability Plan,  LM officials said they have a goal to review sites\u2019 conceptual models,  which predict how remedies should perform under different conditions,  with the aim of updating the assumptions in the models to better account  for real-world conditions. However, LM did not provide details about how  it intends to meet this goal, such as a schedule for implementing this  review across its sites.", "According to LM officials, LM has not developed a plan or schedule for  reviewing sites\u2019 conceptual models because of competing priorities. In  addition, LM officials told us they have not assessed the effects of  climate change or developed plans to mitigate those effects because of  a lack of concern about the risks posed by climate change. Specifically,  site managers in charge of several of LM\u2019s category 3 sites\u2014including  Rocky Flats, which has the highest environmental liability of LM\u2019s 100  sites and is currently implementing the large-scale project described  above to address erosion caused by extreme precipitation\u2014told us that  they have not assessed the potential effects of climate change on their  sites because they do not believe climate change is a concern.", "Recognizing the federal government\u2019s significant role in managing  climate-related disaster impacts, GAO\u2019s Disaster Resilience Framework  provides three broad principles that those who oversee or manage federal  efforts can consider when analyzing opportunities to enhance their  contribution to national disaster resilience. For instance, under the  information principle, the framework states that accessing authoritative,  understandable information can help decision makers to identify current  and future risk and the impact of risk-reduction strategies. In addition, the  integration principle states that integrated analysis and planning can help  decision makers take coherent and coordinated resilience actions. By  developing plans to assess the effect of climate change on LM\u2019s sites and  to mitigate any significant impacts and, as part of these plans,  incorporating principles from GAO\u2019s Disaster Resilience Framework, as  appropriate, LM could better ensure that its remedies will protect human  health and the environment in the long term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Update or Adopt New Requirements, Making Remedies No Longer Compliant With Standards", "paragraphs": ["According to LM officials, LM faces challenges when regulators update or  adopt new requirements and regulations for contaminants, meaning that  remedies in place when LM received a site may no longer meet  standards.

EPA has  published information regarding potential impacts to human health  and the environment from these and other emerging contaminants.  Federal regulatory standards issued by EPA in the future could affect  LM sites.", "At the Bluewater site in New Mexico, LM officials said that the state  recently adopted an updated, more stringent uranium drinking water  standard. Under the new standard, the area of groundwater that is  considered contaminated is much larger than the area of groundwater  considered contaminated under the standard in place when NRC  approved transfer of the site to LM, according to officials.", "To address challenges related to new requirements and regulations, LM  is monitoring changes to federal and state standards. For example, LM  participates in interagency working groups, such as a PFAS working  group led by DOE\u2019s Office of Environment, Health, Safety, and Security.  Participation in the working groups helps LM monitor the evolution of a  federal PFAS regulatory standard, according to LM officials. In addition,  LM officials told us that they routinely review state and federal regulatory  changes, with the aim of providing sites time to prepare for any changes.  LM also evaluates its surveillance and maintenance practices against  current regulatory and best management requirements to identify any  gaps. For instance, in 2018, the contractor that provides support services  to LM reviewed site management practices listed in UMTRCA Title I and  II sites\u2019 site management plans against current regulatory requirements.  The review identified a number of discrepancies between practices and  requirements. For example, the review found that some site management  plans were developed many years ago and had not been updated to  reflect changes in remedy requirements. LM indicated it planned to take  steps to address the discrepancies identified by this review.
