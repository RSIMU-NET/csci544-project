Because the list is an important tool for combating terrorism, GAO examined (1) standards for including individuals on the list, (2) the outcomes of encounters with individuals on the list, (3) potential vulnerabilities and efforts to address them, and (4) actions taken to promote effective terrorism-related screening. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed documentation obtained from and interviewed officials at TSC, the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies that perform terrorism-related screening."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The FBI and the intelligence community use standards of reasonableness to evaluate individuals for nomination to the consolidated watch list. In general, individuals who are reasonably suspected of having possible links to terrorism--in addition to individuals with known links--are to be nominated. As such, being on the list does not automatically prohibit, for example, the issuance of a visa or entry into the United States. Rather, when an individual on the list is encountered, agency officials are to assess the threat the person poses to determine what action to take, if any. As of May 2007, the consolidated watch list contained approximately 755,000 records. From December 2003 through May 2007, screening and law enforcement agencies encountered individuals who were positively matched to watch list records approximately 53,000 times. Many individuals were matched multiple times. The outcomes of these encounters reflect an array of actions, such as arrests; denials of entry into the United States; and, most often, questioning and release. Within the federal community, there is general agreement that the watch list has helped to combat terrorism by (1) providing screening and law enforcement agencies with information to help them respond appropriately during encounters and (2) helping law enforcement and intelligence agencies track individuals on the watch list and collect information about them for use in conducting investigations and in assessing threats. Regarding potential vulnerabilities, TSC sends records daily from the watch list to screening agencies. However, some records are not sent, partly because screening against them may not be needed to support the respective agency's mission or may not be possible due to the requirements of computer programs used to check individuals against watch list records. Also, some subjects of watch list records have passed undetected through agency screening processes and were not identified, for example, until after they had boarded and flew on an aircraft or were processed at a port of entry and admitted into the United States. TSC and other federal agencies have ongoing initiatives to help reduce these potential vulnerabilities, including efforts to improve computerized name-matching programs and the quality of watch list data. Although the federal government has made progress in promoting effective terrorism-related screening, additional screening opportunities remain untapped--within the federal sector, as well as within critical infrastructure components of the private sector. This situation exists partly because the government lacks an up-to-date strategy and implementation plan for optimizing use of the terrorist watch list. Also lacking are clear lines of authority and responsibility. An up-to-date strategy and implementation plan, supported by a clearly defined leadership or governance structure, would provide a platform to establish governmentwide screening priorities, assess progress toward policy goals and intended outcomes, consider factors related to privacy and civil liberties, ensure that any needed changes are implemented, and respond to issues that hinder effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the events of September 11, 2001, agencies within the Departments  Since the events of September 11, 2001, agencies within the Departments  of Homeland Security, Justice, and State, as well as state and local law  of Homeland Security, Justice, and State, as well as state and local law  enforcement organizations and the intelligence community, have  enforcement organizations and the intelligence community, have  implemented enhanced procedures to collect and share information about  implemented enhanced procedures to collect and share information about  known or suspected terrorists who pose a threat to homeland security and  known or suspected terrorists who pose a threat to homeland security and  to track their movements. One important tool used by these agencies is the  to track their movements. One important tool used by these agencies is the  terrorist watch list, which contains records with identifying or  terrorist watch list, which contains records with identifying or  biographical information\u2014such as name and date of birth\u2014of foreign and  U.S. citizens with known or appropriately suspected links to terrorism.", "Pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6, the Terrorist  Screening Center\u2014an entity that has been operational since December  2003 under the administration of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI)\u2014was established to develop and maintain the U.S. government\u2019s  consolidated terrorist screening database (the watch list) and to provide  for the use of watch list records during security-related screening  processes. To build upon and provide additional guidance related to this  directive, in August 2004, the President signed Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 11. Among other things, this directive required the  Secretary of Homeland Security\u2014in coordination with the heads of  appropriate federal departments and agencies\u2014to outline a strategy to  enhance the effectiveness of terrorist-related screening activities and  develop a prioritized investment and implementation plan for detecting  and interdicting suspected terrorists and terrorist activities.", "The Terrorist Screening Center receives the vast majority of its  information about known or appropriately suspected terrorists from the  National Counterterrorism Center, which compiles information on  international terrorists from a wide range of executive branch  departments and agencies, such as the Department of State, the Central  Intelligence Agency, and the FBI. In general, international terrorists  engage in terrorist activities that occur primarily outside the territorial  jurisdiction of the United States or that transcend national boundaries and  include individuals in the United States with connections to terrorist  activities outside the United States. In addition to providing information  on international terrorists to the National Counterterrorism Center, the  FBI directly provides the Terrorist Screening Center with information  about known or suspected domestic terrorists, that is, individuals who  operate primarily within the United States, such as Ted Kaczynski (the  \u201cUnabomber\u201d). The center consolidates this information into a sensitive  but unclassified watch list and makes records available as appropriate for  a variety of screening purposes. For instance, the Transportation Security  Administration directs airlines to use portions of the Terrorist Screening  Center\u2019s watch list\u2014the No Fly and Selectee lists\u2014to screen the names of  passengers to identify those who may pose threats to aviation. Also, to  help ensure that known or appropriately suspected terrorists are tracked,  and denied entry into the United States, as appropriate, applicable watch  list records are to be checked by Department of State consular officers  before issuing U.S. visas and passports, and by U.S. Customs and Border  Protection officers before admitting persons\u2014including U.S. citizens\u2014at  air, land, and sea ports of entry. Further, screening against applicable  watch list records can occur anywhere in the nation when, for example,  state or local law enforcement officers stop individuals for traffic  violations or other offenses.", "When an individual on the terrorist watch list is identified or encountered  during screening, several entities\u2014the Terrorist Screening Center, the  screening agency, investigative agencies, and the intelligence  community\u2014can be involved in deciding what action to take. Regarding a  foreign citizen seeking to immigrate to the United States permanently or  temporarily for business or pleasure purposes, screening agencies rely on  immigration laws that specify criteria and rules for deciding whether or  not to admit the individual. In general, foreign citizens that have engaged  in or are likely to engage in terrorist-related activities are ineligible to  receive visas and ineligible to enter the United States. If a foreign citizen is  legally admitted into the United States\u2014either permanently or  temporarily\u2014and subsequently engages in or is likely to engage in a  terrorist activity, the individual may be removed to that person\u2019s country  of citizenship. U.S. citizens returning to the United States from abroad are  not subject to the admissibility requirements applicable to foreign citizens,  regardless of whether or not they are subjects of watch list records. These  individuals only need to establish their U.S. citizenship to the satisfaction  of the examining officer\u2014by, for example, presenting a U.S. passport\u2014to  obtain entry into the United States. These individuals, however, can be  subjected to additional screening by U.S. Customs and Border Protection  before being admitted to determine the potential threat they pose, with  related actions taken, if needed.", "This report is a public version of the restricted report that we also  provided to you on October 11, 2007. The various departments and  agencies we reviewed deemed some of the information in the restricted  report as Sensitive Security Information or Law Enforcement Sensitive  information, which must be protected from public disclosures. Therefore,  this report omits certain information associated with vulnerabilities we  identified in existing screening processes and measures that could be  taken to address those vulnerabilities. This report also omits key details  regarding (1) certain policies and procedures associated with the  development and use of the terrorist watch list and (2) specific outcomes  of encounters with individuals who were positively matched to the watch  list. In the context of agency efforts to screen for known or appropriately  suspected terrorists, the restricted report addressed the following  questions:  In general, what standards do the National Counterterrorism Center  and the FBI use in determining which individuals are appropriate for  inclusion on the Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s consolidated watch list?", "Since the Terrorist Screening Center became operational in December  2003, how many times have screening and law enforcement agencies  positively matched individuals to terrorist watch list records, and what  do the results or outcomes of these encounters indicate about the role  of the watch list as a counterterrorism tool?", "To what extent do the principal screening agencies whose missions  most frequently and directly involve interactions with travelers check  against all records in the Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s consolidated  watch list? If the entire watch list is not being checked, why not, what  potential vulnerabilities exist, and what actions are being planned to  address these vulnerabilities?", "To what extent are Department of Homeland Security component  agencies monitoring known incidents in which subjects of watch list  records pass undetected through screening processes, and what  corrective actions have been implemented or are being planned to  address these vulnerabilities?", "What actions has the U.S. government taken to ensure that the terrorist  watch list is used as effectively as possible, governmentwide and in  other appropriate venues?", "Although the information provided in this version of the report is more  limited in scope, it covers the same general questions as the restricted  report. Also, the overall methodology used for our restricted report is  relevant to this report because the information contained in this report  was derived from the restricted report. To address the questions in our  restricted report, we reviewed the Terrorist Screening Center\u2019s standard  operating procedures, statistics on encounters with individuals on the  terrorist watch list, and other relevant documentation; and we interviewed  Terrorist Screening Center officials, including the director and the  principal deputy director. To identify standards used to nominate  individuals for inclusion on the watch list, we reviewed documentation  and interviewed senior officials from the National Counterterrorism  Center and the FBI.", "Also, to assess the outcomes of encounters and the extent to which  screening agencies check against the entire watch list, we reviewed  documentation and interviewed senior officials from the FBI\u2019s  Counterterrorism Division and the principal screening agencies whose  missions most frequently and directly involve interactions with travelers.  Specifically, at the Transportation Security Administration, we examined  the prescreening of air passengers prior to their boarding a flight; at U.S.  Customs and Border Protection, we examined the screening of travelers  entering the United States through ports of entry; and, at the Department  of State, we examined the screening of nonimmigrant visa applicants. We  did not review the Department of State\u2019s use of the watch list to screen  passport applicants. We also visited a nonprobability sample of screening  agencies and investigative agencies in geographic areas of four states  (California, Michigan, New York, and Texas). We chose these locations on  the basis of geographic variation and other factors. Further, to determine  the extent to which agencies monitor known incidents in which subjects  of watch list records pass undetected through screening processes and  efforts to address these vulnerabilities, we reviewed documentation and  interviewed senior officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2014which screens individuals who  apply for immigration benefits or U.S. citizenship\u2014and the Transportation  Security Administration. Finally, to assess the actions the U.S. government  has taken to ensure that the terrorist watch list is used as effectively as  possible, we compared the status of watch list-related strategies, planning,  and initiatives with the expectations set forth in Homeland Security  Presidential Directives 6 and 11. We considered federal plans to identify  screening opportunities, the private sector\u2019s use of watch list records, and  the Department of State\u2019s progress in sharing watch list information with  foreign governments.", "Regarding statistical information we obtained from the Terrorist Screening  Center and screening agencies\u2014such as the number of positive matches  and actions taken\u2014we discussed the sources of the data with agency  officials and reviewed documentation regarding the compilation of the  statistics. We determined that the statistics were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this review. We did not review or assess the derogatory  information available on individuals nominated to the terrorist watch list,  partly because such information involved ongoing counterterrorism  investigations. Also, a primary agency that collects information on known  or suspected terrorists\u2014the Central Intelligence Agency\u2014declined to  meet with us or provide us documentation on its watch list-related  activities. The Homeland Security Council\u2014which is chaired by the  Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism\u2014 also denied our request for an interview. We performed our work on the  restricted version of this report from April 2005 through September 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Appendix I presents more details about our objectives, scope, and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In April 2003, we reported that watch lists were maintained by numerous  federal agencies and that the agencies did not have a consistent and  uniform approach to sharing information on individuals with possible links  to terrorism. Our report recommended that the Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in collaboration with the heads  of departments and agencies that have and use watch lists, lead an effort  to consolidate and standardize the federal government\u2019s watch list  structures and policies. Subsequently, pursuant to Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 6 (HSPD-6), dated September 16, 2003, the Attorney  General established the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) to consolidate  the government\u2019s approach to terrorism screening and provide for the  appropriate and lawful use of terrorist information in screening  processes. TSC\u2019s consolidated watch list is the U.S. government\u2019s master  repository for all known or appropriately suspected international and  domestic terrorist records used for watch list-related screening. TSC  records contain sensitive but unclassified information on terrorist  identities\u2014such as name and date of birth\u2014that can be shared with  screening agencies, whereas the classified derogatory information that  supports the watch list records is maintained in other law enforcement  and intelligence agency databases. Records for inclusion on the  consolidated watch list are nominated to TSC from the following two  sources:  Identifying information on individuals with ties to international  terrorism is provided to TSC through the National Counterterrorism  Center (NCTC), which is managed by the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence.", "Identifying information on individuals with ties to purely domestic  terrorism is provided to TSC by the FBI.", "HSPD-6 required the Attorney General\u2014in coordination with the Secretary  of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of Central  Intelligence\u2014to implement appropriate procedures and safeguards with  respect to all terrorist information related to U.S. persons (i.e., U.S.  citizens and lawful permanent residents) that is provided to NCTC  (formerly the Terrorist Threat Integration Center). According to TSC,  agencies within the intelligence community that collect and maintain  terrorist information and nominate individuals for inclusion on TSC\u2019s  consolidated watch list are to do so in accordance with Executive Order  12333. With respect to U.S. persons, this order addresses the nature or  type of information that may be collected and the allowable methods for  collecting such information. It provides that agencies within the  intelligence community are authorized to collect, retain, or disseminate  information concerning U.S. persons only in accordance with procedures  established by the head of the agency concerned and approved by the  Attorney General, consistent with the authorities set out earlier in the  order. The order further provides that agencies within the intelligence  community are to use the least intrusive collection techniques feasible  when such collection is conducted within the United States or when  directed against U.S. persons abroad. Also, according to TSC officials, the  center requires annual training for all personnel concerning the Privacy  Act of 1974 to ensure that information collected on U.S. persons is handled  in accordance with applicable law.", "To facilitate operational or mission-related screening, TSC sends  applicable records from its terrorist watch list to screening agency  systems for use in efforts to deter or detect the movements of known or  suspected terrorists. For instance, applicable TSC records are provided to  the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for use by airlines in  prescreening passengers; to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  system for use in screening travelers entering the United States; to a  Department of State system for use in screening visa applicants; and to  an FBI system for use by state and local law enforcement agencies  pursuant to arrests, detentions, and other criminal justice purposes.", "When an individual makes an airline reservation, arrives at a U.S. port of  entry, or applies for a U.S. visa, or is stopped by state or local police within  the United States, the frontline screening agency or airline conducts a  name-based search of the individual against applicable terrorist watch list  records. In general, when the computerized name-matching system of an  airline or screening agency generates a \u201chit\u201d (a potential name match)  against a watch list record, the airline or agency is to review each potential  match. Any obvious mismatches (negative matches) are to be resolved by  the airline or agency, if possible, as discussed in our September 2006  report. However, clearly positive or exact matches and matches that are  inconclusive (uncertain or difficult-to-verify) generally are to be referred  to the applicable screening agency\u2019s intelligence or operations center and  TSC for closer examination. Specifically, airlines are to contact TSA\u2019s  Office of Intelligence; CBP officers at U.S. ports of entry are to contact  CBP\u2019s National Targeting Center; and Department of State consular  officers who process visa applications are to submit a request for a  security advisory opinion to Department of State headquarters. The  intelligence or operations center is to refer exact matches and  inconclusive matches to TSC. State and local law enforcement officials  generally are to refer exact matches and inconclusive matches directly to  TSC. In turn, TSC is to check its databases and other sources\u2014including  classified databases maintained by NCTC and the FBI\u2014and confirm  whether the individual is a positive, negative, or inconclusive match to the  watch list record.", "TSC is to refer positive and inconclusive matches to the FBI\u2019s  Counterterrorism Division to provide an opportunity for a  counterterrorism response. Deciding what law enforcement or screening  agency action to take, if any, can involve collaboration among the frontline  screening agency, NCTC or other intelligence community members, and  the FBI or other investigative agencies. If the encounter arises in the  context of an application for a visa or admission into the United States, the  screening agency\u2019s adjudicating official determines whether the  circumstances trigger a statutory basis for inadmissibility. Generally,  NCTC and the FBI are involved because they maintain the underlying  derogatory information that supports terrorist watch list records, which is  needed to help determine the appropriate counterterrorism response. If  necessary, a member of an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force can respond in  person to interview and obtain additional information about the person  encountered. In other cases, the FBI will rely on the screening agency  and other law enforcement agencies\u2014such as U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement\u2014to respond and collect information. Figure 1  presents a general overview of the process used to resolve encounters  with individuals on the terrorist watch list.", "To build upon and provide additional guidance related to HSPD-6, in  August 2004, the President signed Homeland Security Presidential  Directive 11 (HSPD-11). Among other things, this directive required the  Secretary of Homeland Security\u2014in coordination with the heads of  appropriate federal departments and agencies\u2014to submit two reports to  the President (through the Assistant to the President for Homeland  Security) related to the government\u2019s approach to terrorist-related  screening. The first report was to outline a strategy to enhance the  effectiveness of terrorist-related screening activities by developing  comprehensive and coordinated procedures and capabilities. The second  report was to provide a prioritized investment and implementation plan  for detecting and interdicting suspected terrorists and terrorist activities.  Specifically, the plan was to describe the \u201cscope, governance, principles,  outcomes, milestones, training objectives, metrics, costs, and schedule of  activities\u201d to implement the U.S. government\u2019s terrorism-related screening  policies. According to DHS officials, the department submitted the  required strategy and the investment and implementation plan to the  President in November 2004.

Thus, as TSC adds nominated records to its  watch list, the list may include individuals with possible ties to terrorism,  establishing a broad spectrum of individuals that meet the \u201cknown or  appropriately suspected\u201d standard specified in HSPD-6. As such, inclusion  on the list does not automatically cause an alien to be, for example, denied  a visa or deemed inadmissible to enter the United States when the person  is identified by a screening agency. Rather, in these cases, screening  agency and law enforcement personnel may use the encounter with the  individual as an opportunity to collect information for assessing the  potential threat the person poses, tracking the person\u2019s movements or  activities, and determining what actions to take, if any."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The National Counterterrorism Center Uses a \u201cReasonable Suspicion\u201d Standard in Determining Which Individuals Are Appropriate for Inclusion on the Watch List", "paragraphs": ["NCTC receives international terrorist-related information from executive  branch departments and agencies\u2014such as the Department of State, the  Central Intelligence Agency, and the FBI\u2014and enters this information into  its terrorist database.

This congressionally mandated program is primarily administered through  a Visas Viper Committee at each overseas post. The committee is to meet  at least monthly to share information on known or suspected terrorists  and determine whether such information should be sent to NCTC for  inclusion in its terrorist database. NCTC\u2019s database, known as the  Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, contains highly classified  information and serves as the U.S. government\u2019s central classified  database with information on known or suspected international terrorists.  According to NCTC\u2019s fact sheet on the Terrorist Identities Datamart  Environment, examples of conduct that will warrant an entry into NCTC\u2019s  database includes persons who    commit international terrorist activity;    prepare or plan international terrorist activity;    gather information on potential targets for international terrorist    solicit funds or other things of value for international terrorist activity  or a terrorist organization;     solicit membership in an international terrorist organization;    provide material support, such as a safe house, transportation,  communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material financial  benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons, explosives, or  training; or     are members of or represent a foreign terrorist organization.", "If NCTC determines that an individual meets the \u201cknown or appropriately  suspected\u201d standard of HSPD-6, NCTC is to extract sensitive but  unclassified information on the individual\u2019s identity from its classified  database\u2014such as name and date of birth\u2014and send forward a record to  TSC for inclusion on the watch list. According to NCTC procedures, NCTC  analysts are to review all information involving international terrorists  using a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard to determine whether an  individual is appropriate for nomination to TSC for inclusion on the watch  list. NCTC defines reasonable suspicion as information\u2014both facts, as  well as rational inferences from those facts and the experience of the  reviewer\u2014that is sufficient to cause an ordinarily prudent person to  believe that the individual under review may be a known or appropriately  suspected terrorist. According to NCTC, this information can include past  conduct, current actions, and credible intelligence concerning future  conduct. In making this determination, NCTC generally relies upon the  originating agency\u2019s designation that there is reasonable suspicion to  believe a person is engaged in terrorist or terrorist-related activities as  being presumptively valid. For example, NCTC will rely on the FBI\u2019s  designation of an individual as a known or suspected international  terrorist unless NCTC has specific and credible information that such a  designation is not appropriate.", "Also, NCTC officials noted that an individual is to remain on the watch list  until the respective department or agency that provided the terrorist- related information that supports a nomination determines the individual  should be removed from the list. According to TSC, if the FBI conducts a  threat assessment on an individual that reveals no nexus to international  terrorism, then NCTC will initiate the process for deleting the record from  its database and the watch list.

The FBI noted, for example, that it is not  sufficient to open an investigation based solely on a neighbor\u2019s complaint  or an anonymous tip or phone call. In such cases, however, the FBI could  use techniques short of opening an investigation to assess the potential  threat the person poses, which would not result in adding the individual to  the watch list at that time.", "The FBI has established formal review and approval processes for  nominating individuals for inclusion on the watch list. In general, FBI case  agents are to send nominations to a unit at FBI headquarters for review  and approval.

The  FBI explained that while law enforcement encounters of individuals on the  watch list provide significant information, unnecessary detentions or  queries of misidentified persons would be counterproductive and  potentially damaging to the efforts of the FBI to investigate and combat  terrorism. Because of these operational concerns, the FBI noted that our  recommendation to assess the extent of vulnerabilities in current  screening processes that arise when the Violent Gang and Terrorist  Organization File cannot accept certain watch list records has been  completed and the vulnerability has been determined to be low or  nonexistent. In our view, however, recognizing operational concerns does  not constitute assessing vulnerabilities. Thus, while we understand the  FBI\u2019s operational concerns, we maintain it is still important that the FBI  assess to what extent vulnerabilities or security risks are raised by not  screening against certain watch list records and what actions, if any,  should be taken in response.", "With respect to private sector screening, the FBI commented that it has  assigned staff to assist the DHS Screening Coordination Office with  drafting related screening guidelines. Finally, the FBI commented that the  language of our recommendation related to governance of the watch- listing process may be interpreted to have some overlap with existing  mandates carried out by TSC under HSPD-6. Specifically, the FBI noted  that governance of the watch-listing process is better suited to be a  component of TSC, rather than DHS. The FBI explained that DHS has no  authority or provisions for establishing any watch-listing procedures for  anyone other than DHS component agencies, whereas TSC has established  a governance board composed of senior members from the nominating  and screening agencies, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,  and the Homeland Security Council to monitor and update the watch  listing process. The FBI further explained that these members meet  regularly and address terrorist watch-listing issues ranging from  nominations and encounters to dissemination of information and  intelligence collected, and that all decisions approved by the governance  board are presented at the Deputies Meeting chaired by the White House.

According to the Department of State,  there may be U.S. government interest in issuing a visa to someone who  has a record in the terrorist watch list and who may have already been  found ineligible for a visa or inadmissible to the United States.
