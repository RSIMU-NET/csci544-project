Weaknesses in the program's cost-estimating process call into question the credibility of NASA's plans to carry out its budget through fiscal year 2006. The cost growth has also severely affected the space station's ability to conduct scientific research. NASA has instituted several management and cost-estimating reforms, including a life-cycle cost estimate, a program management plan, and a reprioritized science program. However, significant challenges remain. Preparation of the life-cycle cost estimate may be difficult because NASA's financial management system is unable to adequately track space station costs. Many tasks and studies being undertaken will not be completed until September 2002, leaving NASA with little time to incorporate its results into its budget for fiscal year 2004.

Most recently, the agency revealed that  the estimated cost to complete assembly had increased by about $5  billion\u2014from about $25 billion to about $30 billion. This reported cost- growth estimate might not be reliable, however, because NASA does not  have good cost-accounting systems or practices.", "The estimated cost growth is having a profound effect on the utility of the  space station\u2014namely, through substantial cutbacks in construction, the  number of crewmembers, and scientific research.

The  program\u2019s highest-priority goals are to (1) maintain a permanent human  presence in space, (2) conduct world-class research in space, and (3)  enhance international cooperation and U.S. leadership through  international development and operations of the space station.", "The technical achievements of the station program have been exceptional.  Assembly of the space station began in November 1998 with the launch of  the U.S.-funded, Russian-built Zarya module, followed by the launch of the  U.S. Unity module in December 1998. The station\u2019s occupancy began in  October 2000 with the launch of the Expedition I crew. Since then, four  other three-person crews have occupied the station while assembly  continues. In addition, the crews have been conducting hands-on scientific  research. Figure 1 shows the International Space Station on-orbit.", "Since its inception in 1984, the space station has undergone a number of  redesigns and has been mired by cost growth and schedule slips. In January  2001, NASA announced that an additional $4 billion in funding over the  next 5 years would be required to complete the station\u2019s assembly and fund  its operation. By May 2001 the estimated cost growth had increased to $4.8  billion. In response to the announcement, the administration directed  NASA to take a number of actions, including terminating the propulsion  module, deferring the habitation module, deferring the crew return vehicle,  and reducing funding for scientific research to stay within the President\u2019s  budget projections.", "The President\u2019s fiscal year 2002 budget blueprint and budget request for the  space station lay out a strategy for containing cost growth that ensures the  completion of the U.S. core station and deploys the elements of the  program\u2019s international partners. To achieve this strategy, NASA was  required to construct a plan of action that addressed institutional and  program reforms to establish processes for executing the baseline  program.", "In July 2001, the NASA Administrator appointed the International Space  Station Management and Cost Evaluation Task Force to conduct an  independent external review and assessment of the station\u2019s cost, budget,  and management. The Administrator also asked the task force to provide  recommendations that could provide maximum benefit to the U.S.  taxpayers and the international partners within the President\u2019s budget  request. The task force reported its findings to the NASA Advisory Council  in November 2001.", "In response to the task force\u2019s recommendations, NASA is undertaking a  number of initiatives to restore credibility to the station program.

Activities that are to  take place during this period include establishing a technical baseline and a  life-cycle cost estimate for the remainder of the program, prioritizing the  core complete science program, and reaching an agreement with the  international partners on the station\u2019s final configuration and capabilities.  NASA is working toward completing these activities by September 2002 in  order to include results in its budget request for fiscal year 2004.", "Over the past 8 years, we have performed a body of work that highlighted  the space station program\u2019s cost growth and weaknesses in cost control. In  addition, we have pointed out weaknesses in the agency\u2019s financial  management system as well as inadequate contract management oversight.  Appendix II lists prior GAO reports and testimonies related to the space  station program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Cost Increases and Mechanisms That Should Have Alerted NASA Management", "paragraphs": ["According to NASA officials, as a consequence of the inadequate definition  of requirements, changes in program content, schedule delays, and  inadequate program oversight, the estimated development cost of the  space station has grown by about $13 billion since 1995 of which about $5  billion is attributable to growth since the fiscal year 2001 estimate.  However, the agency could not associate specific amounts of the estimated  growth with the reasons cited. The program did not utilize available cost  control tools to monitor and contain the growth and ignored NASA\u2019s  guidance in many cases. In addition, because of its focus on managing  annual budgets, NASA failed to heed indicators of future cost growth that  contributed to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate cost of the space  station."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reasons for Cost Growth", "paragraphs": ["One of the major reasons for the cost growth was NASA\u2019s inadequate  definition of requirements. For example, NASA originally estimated that  500,000 source-lines-of-code of space flight software would be required for  the station\u2019s operations. However, that estimate has now tripled to 1.5  million lines of code. In addition, NASA assumed that it could rely on  computer simulations as opposed to rigorous ground testing to integrate  the hardware and software of the various elements. However, program  schedule slips permitted additional ground testing, which discovered  significant integration problems that escaped notice during the computer  simulations. As a result, the program established a more rigorous  multielement integrated testing program.", "Changes in program content also contributed to the cost growth. A  significant item of cost was introduced to the program in 1997 through the  addition of the requirement for a crew return vehicle. NASA had planned to  use two Russian Soyuz vehicles, each with a maximum capacity of three  crewmembers, attached to the station for emergency crew return after  achieving permanent six-person crew capability. However, NASA later  determined that the Soyuz vehicle did not meet the requirements necessary  to return an ill or injured crewmember. Thus, the program was modified to  require a U.S.-built crew rescue capability for returning seven  crewmembers at an estimated total cost of about $1.5 billion. Also, because  of Russian funding problems that delayed the service module\u2019s launch,  NASA took on an additional development effort in fiscal year 1997 to guard  against Russian nonperformance. The actions became collectively known  as Russian Program Assurance and included an interim control module and  a U.S. propulsion module in the event the Russians could not supply the  service module and propellant logistics flights. By February 2001, Russian  Program Assurance had added $1.3 billion in total estimated cost through  fiscal year 2006.", "Schedule delays increased costs because, at a minimum, fixed costs such  as salaries, contractor overhead, and sustaining engineering continued for  a longer period than planned. When the space station was redesigned in  1993, NASA established May 1997 as the launch date for the first element  and June 2002 as the assembly\u2019s completion date. However, the first  element was not launched until November 1998. By August 2000, the  assembly complete date had slipped to April 2006\u2014a total slip of 46  months. On the basis of NASA\u2019s projected spending rate, the program  incurred an additional cost of about $100 million for every month of  schedule slippage.", "The magnitude of the cost growth began to surface in the spring of 2000  during program operating plan reviews in preparation of the fiscal year  2002 budget request. Following the program operating plan reviews, the  program manager ordered a detailed assessment of costs to more  specifically determine funding requirements through fiscal year 2006.", "Table 1 shows some of the major events leading up to the identification of  the space station\u2019s cost growth.

These include  guidance requiring cost management on a project, and cost and risk  modeling capabilities. However, the management and cost evaluation task  force and the supporting studies found that NASA did not utilize or ignored  many cost control mechanisms because of its focus on fiscal year budget  management rather than on total program cost management.", "NASA guidance requires that life-cycle cost be estimated, assessed, and  controlled throughout a program\u2019s life cycle. The estimates are to be  prepared to support major program reviews and the development of budget  submissions. A handbook instructs cost estimators in selecting a cost  model for use in the estimating process and on the proper documentation  of the results of the cost analysis.", "NASA has considerable cost-modeling capability, including several cost  models and information related to the type of costing situations for which  they would be appropriate. A study performed by the Rand Corporation for  the Office of Science and Technology Policy, which supported the  management and cost evaluation task force, noted that NASA has \u201cvery  good\u201d cost and risk modeling capabilities. However, the study found that  the in-house capabilities were not well integrated into the program\u2019s  planning and management. Because of its short-term budget focus, the  program had been reluctant to integrate cost estimation and control  practices sufficiently robust to yield confidence in its budget estimates.", "The management and cost evaluation task force found that the final space  station\u2019s cost estimate at completion had not been a management criterion  within NASA. According to the task force, because of NASA\u2019s focus on  executing the program within annual budgets, total cost and schedule  became variables. To stay within the annual budget limits, the program\u2019s  basic content slipped, and total program cost grew. In addition, the cost  analysis team that supported the task force cited NASA\u2019s culture of  managing the program to its annual budgets as perhaps the single greatest  factor in the program\u2019s cost growth.", "The management and cost evaluation task force made recommendations  aimed at restoring cost credibility to the program.

NASA proposed major changes in the  station\u2019s design for fiscal year 2001 that resulted in fewer on-orbit scientific  facilities, and less research, and limited the crew available for conducting  research.

Following the  announced cost growth, NASA\u2019s Office of Biological and Physical Research,  Office of Space Flight, and the space station\u2019s Payloads Office at the  Johnson Space Center initiated a program restructuring activity to align the  research program with the on-orbit capabilities and resources available.  This activity slowed down selected fiscal year 2001 expenditures to better  match the availability of resources for fiscal year 2002 and optimized the  scientific utilization of the reduced on-orbit capability. The reduction of  content to the revised baseline was not reconciled against standing  agreements with the program\u2019s international partners.", "The budget content for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 for the core-complete  station provides for the outfitting of 20 research facilities, known as  \u201cracks,\u201d leaving about one fourth of the previously planned racks and their  utilization unfunded. Some research disciplines were severely affected by  the fiscal year 2002 reduction. For example, significant experiments  planned to conduct research on materials such as metals, alloys, glasses,  and ceramics, and in biotechnology were canceled.", "In addition to less hardware for research, there are constraints to  utilization of the science facilities principally because the station\u2019s crew  size will be reduced from a planned seven to three. This will limit the  crewmember hours that can be devoted to research. For example,  astronauts will have limited time to be used as subjects in research on the  effects of space flight on humans. According to NASA officials, crew  research hours will be a major limiting factor on the number and  complexity of experiments after the arrival of the international partner  modules in 2004-2005, particularly constraining research that requires the  crew\u2019s interaction. NASA officials stated that some crew interaction is  required for nearly all space station investigations. These activities include  testing, monitoring, sampling, instrument readings, completing  questionnaires, and recording results. NASA currently estimates that a  minimum of 2.5 crewmembers will be required for maintaining the station,  exclusive of their science-related duties during assembly.", "NASA had planned that crew time for scientific research would be 100 +  hours per week, but the crewmember reduction would limit time to a  minimum of 20 hours per week.

In return for NASA\u2019s launch of the  Japanese Experiment Module, Japan is providing the centrifuge  accommodation module and centrifuge rotor, which are essential for  conducting controlled biological experiments.

In the fall of 2000, Congress  directed the National Research Council and the National Academy of  Public Administration to organize a joint study of the status of microgravity  research in the life and physical sciences as it relates to the station. In a  late 2001 report, the team concluded that the viability of the overall science  program in microgravity would be seriously jeopardized if the space  station\u2019s capabilities were reduced below fiscal year 2001 levels and there  were no annual microgravity research dedicated shuttle flights. The study  found that the U.S. scientific community is ready now to use the space  station but that this readiness cannot be sustained if (1) proposed  reductions in the scientific capabilities occur, (2) slippage continues in  both the development and science utilization schedules for the space  station, or (3) uncertainties continue in funding for science facilities and  flight experiments on the space station. The study observed that readiness  is beginning to deteriorate and that it will continue to erode with further  delays in the completion of the space station.

A December 2001 NASA  Independent Implementation Review found that budget reductions, crew  hour limitations, and the realization of other resource constraints have all  significantly reduced the anticipated space station research content in  terms of quality and quantity. For example, there are fewer flight  investigations and tests, and some science disciplines cannot achieve  planned program goals.
