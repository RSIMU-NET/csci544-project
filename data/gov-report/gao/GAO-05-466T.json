Before providing benefits, CBP reviews the self-reported information contained in applicants' membership agreements and security profiles. Also, CBP assesses the compliance history of importers before granting them benefits. However, CBP grants benefits before members undergo the validation process, which is CBP's method to verify that their security measures are reliable, accurate, and effective. Although CBP's goal was to validate members within 3 years, to date it has validated 11 percent of them. Further, the validation process is not rigorous, as the objectives, scope, and methodology of validations are jointly agreed upon with the member, and CBP has no written guidelines to indicate what scope of effort is adequate for the validation. Also, although CBP has recently moved to a risk-based approach to selecting members for validation, it has not determined the number and types of validations that are needed to manage security risks or the CBP staff required to complete them. Further, CBP has not developed a comprehensive set of performance measures for the program, and key program decisions are not always documented and programmatic information is not updated regularly or accurately. The CSI program is designed to target and inspect high-risk cargo containers at foreign ports before they leave for the United States. It has resulted in improved information sharing between U.S. and foreign customs operations and a heightened level of international awareness regarding securing the global shipping system. Yet, several factors limit CBP's ability to successfully target containers to determine if they are high-risk. One factor is staffing imbalances, caused by political and practical considerations, which impede CBP's targeting efforts at CSI ports. As a result, 35 percent of U.S.-bound shipments from CSI ports were not targeted and not subject to inspection overseas--the key goal of the CSI program. In addition, as of September 11, 2004, 28 percent of the containers referred to host governments for inspection were not inspected overseas for various reasons such as operational limitations. One percent of these referrals were denied by host government officials, generally because they believed the referrals were based on factors not related to security threats. For the 72 percent of referred containers that were inspected overseas, CBP officials told us that no WMD were discovered. However, the nonintrusive inspection equipment used at CSI ports varies in detection capability, and there are no minimum technical requirements for equipment used as part of CSI. As a result, CBP has limited assurance that inspections conducted under CSI are effective at detecting and identifying terrorist WMD in containers. Finally, CBP continues to make refinements to the strategic plan and performance measures needed to help manage the program and achieve program goals. Until these refinements are completed, it will be difficult to assess progress made in CSI operations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide a summary of our  recent reports for you on the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS)  programs to improve the security of the international supply chain, as well  as target oceangoing cargo containers for inspection at foreign seaports  before they arrive at destinations in the United States.", "In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there is  heightened concern that terrorists may try to smuggle weapons of mass  destruction (WMD) into the United States, specifically by using one of the  millions of cargo containers that arrive at our nation\u2019s seaports each year.  If terrorists did so and detonated such a weapon (e.g., a radiological  explosive device) at a seaport, the incident could cause widespread death  and damage to the immediate area, perhaps shut down seaports  nationwide, cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars, and seriously  hamper international trade.", "DHS and its U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are responsible  for addressing the threat posed by terrorists smuggling weapons into the  United States. To carry out this responsibility, CBP has in place programs  known as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) and  the Container Security Initiative (CSI). The C-TPAT program attempts to  improve the security of the international supply chain (flow of goods from  manufacturer to retailer). It is a cooperative program between CBP and  members of the international trade community in which private companies  agree to improve the security of their supply chains in return for a reduced  likelihood that their containers will be inspected. C-TPAT membership is  open to U.S.- and foreign-based companies whose goods are shipped to the  United States via air, rail, ocean, and truck carriers. The CSI program  specifically addresses the security of oceangoing cargo containers. Under  the program, CBP places staff at foreign seaports to work with foreign  counterparts to use risk assessment information to select, or target, those  containers at risk of containing WMD and inspect them before they are  shipped to the United States.", "This statement presents a summary of our latest efforts in a series of GAO  reports that evaluate CBP\u2019s response to the terrorist threat.

In the United States, almost half of  all incoming trade (by value) arrived by containers on board ships.  Additionally, containers arrive via truck and rail. Both admitting  dangerous cargo into the country and delaying the movement of cargo  containers through ports of entry could negatively affect the national  economy.

An extensive  body of work on this subject by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and  academic, think tank, and business organizations concluded that while the  likelihood of such use of containers is considered low, the movement of  oceangoing containerized cargo is vulnerable to some form of terrorist  action. Such action, including attempts to smuggle either fully assembled  WMD or their individual components, could lead to widespread death and  damage.", "The supply chain is particularly vulnerable to potential terrorists because  of the number of individual companies handling and moving cargo through  it. To move a container from production facilities overseas to distribution  points in the United States, an importer has multiple options regarding the  logistical process, such as routes and the selection of freight carriers. For  example, some importers might own and operate key aspects of the  overseas supply chain process, such as warehousing and trucking  operations. Alternatively, importers might contract with logistical service  providers, including freight consolidators and nonvessel-operating  common carriers. In addition, importers must choose among various  modes of transportation to use, such as rail, truck, or barge, to move  containers from the manufacturer\u2019s warehouse to the port of lading."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "C-TPAT Is Part of CBP\u2019s Layered Enforcement Strategy", "paragraphs": ["CBP has implemented a layered enforcement strategy to prevent terrorists  and WMD from entering the United States through the supply chain. One  key element of this strategy is the C-TPAT program. Initiated in November  2001, C-TPAT is a voluntary program designed to improve the security of  the international supply chain while maintaining an efficient flow of goods.  Under C-TPAT, CBP officials work in partnership with private companies  to review their supply chain security plans to improve members\u2019 overall  security. In return for committing to making improvements to the security  of their shipments by joining the program, C-TPAT members may receive  benefits that result in reduced scrutiny of their shipments (e.g., reduced  number of inspections or shorter border wait times for their shipments).  C-TPAT membership is open to U.S.-based companies in the trade  community, including (1) air/rail/sea carriers, (2) border highway carriers,  (3) importers, (4) licensed customs brokers, (5) air freight consolidators  and ocean transportation intermediaries and nonvessel-operating common  carriers, and (6) port authorities or terminal operators. Of these  companies, CBP grants importers key program benefits. According to  CBP, program membership has grown rapidly, and continued growth is  expected, especially as member importers are requiring their suppliers to  become C-TPAT members. For example, as of January 2003 approximately  1,700 companies had become C-TPAT members. By May 2003, the number  had nearly doubled to 3,355. According to CBP officials, as of April 2005,  the C-TPAT program had over 9,000 members. For fiscal year 2005, the C- TPAT budget request was about $38 million, with a requested budget for  fiscal year 2006 of about $54 million for program expansion efforts. As of  August 2004, CBP had hired 40 supply chain specialists, who are dedicated  to serve as the principal advisers and primary points of contact for C-TPAT  members. The specialists are located in Washington, D.C., Miami, Florida,  Los Angeles, California, and New York, New York.", "CBP has a multistep review process for the C-TPAT program. Applicants  first submit signed C-TPAT agreements affirming their desire to participate  in the voluntary program. Applicants must also submit security profiles\u2014 executive summaries of their company\u2019s existing supply chain security  procedures\u2014that follow guidelines jointly developed by CBP and the trade  community. These security profiles are to summarize the applicant\u2019s  current security procedures in areas such as physical security, personnel  security, and education and training awareness. Next, CBP established a  certification process in which it reviews the applications and profiles by  comparing their contents with the security guidelines jointly developed by  CBP and the industry, looking for any weaknesses or gaps in the  descriptions of security procedures. Once any issues are resolved to CBP\u2019s  satisfaction, CBP signs the agreement and the company is considered to be  certified C-TPAT member, eligible for program benefits. However,  members that are importers must first complete another review, as  described below, before benefits can begin. CBP encourages all members  to conduct self-assessments of their security profiles each year to  determine any significant changes and to notify CBP. For example,  members may be using new suppliers or new trucking companies and  would need to update their security profiles to reflect these changes.", "For certified importers, CBP has an additional review called the vetting  process in which CBP reviews information about an importer\u2019s  compliance with customs laws and regulations and violation history.  Conducted concurrently with the certification process, CBP requires the  vetting process for certified importers as a condition of granting them key  program benefits. As part of the vetting process, CBP obtains trade  compliance and intelligence information on certified importers from  several data sources. If CBP gives the importer a favorable review under  both the vetting process and the certification process, benefits are to begin  within a few weeks. If not, benefits are not to be granted until successful  completion of the validation process, as described below.", "The final step in the review process is validation. CBP\u2019s stated purpose for  validations is to ensure that the security measures outlined in certified  members\u2019 security profiles and periodic self-assessments are reliable,  accurate, and effective. In the validation process, CBP staff meet with  company representatives to verify the supply chain security measures  contained in the company\u2019s security profile. The validation process is  designed to include visits to the company\u2019s domestic and, potentially,  foreign sites. The member and CBP jointly determine which elements of  the member\u2019s supply chain measures will be validated, as well as which  locations will be visited. Upon completion of the validation process, CBP  prepares a final validation report it presents to the company that identifies  any areas that need improvement and suggested corrective actions, as well  as a determination if program benefits are still warranted for the member."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CSI Is Another Layer of CBP\u2019s Enforcement Strategy", "paragraphs": ["Announced in January 2002, the CSI program was implemented to allow  CBP officials to target containers at foreign seaports so that any high-risk  containers may be inspected prior to their departure for U.S. destinations.  Strategic objectives for the CSI program include (1) pushing the United  States\u2019 zone of security beyond its physical borders to deter and combat  the threat of terrorism; (2) targeting shipments for potential terrorists and  terrorist weapons, through advanced and enhanced information and  intelligence collection and analysis, and preventing those shipments from  entering the United States; (3) enhancing homeland and border security  while facilitating growth and economic development within the  international trade community; and (4) utilizing available technologies to  leverage resources and to conduct examinations of all containers posing a  high risk for terrorist-related activity.", "To participate in the CSI program, a host nation must utilize (1) a seaport  that has regular, direct, and substantial container traffic to ports in the  United States; (2) customs staff with the authority and capability to  inspect cargo originating in or transiting through its country; and (3)  nonintrusive inspection equipment. In addition, a host nation must meet  several operational criteria, including a commitment to establishing an  automated risk management system. To implement the CSI program, CBP  negotiates and enters into bilateral arrangements with foreign  governments, specifying the placement of CBP officials at foreign ports  and the exchange of information between CBP and foreign customs  administrations. CBP first solicited the participation of the 20 foreign ports  that shipped the highest volume of ocean containers to the United States.  These top 20 ports are located in 14 countries and regions and shipped a  total of 66 percent of all containers that arrived in U.S. seaports in 2001.  CBP has since expanded CSI to strategic ports, which may ship lesser  amounts of cargo to the United States but may also have terrorism or  geographical concerns. As shown in table 1, as of February 2005, CSI was  operational at 34 ports, located in 17 countries or regions. For fiscal year  2005, the CSI budget was about $126 million, with a budget of about $139  million requested in fiscal year 2006.", "CBP then deploys a CSI team, which generally consists of three types of  officials\u2014targeters, intelligence analysts, and special agents. These  officials come from either CBP or U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE). The team leader is a CBP officer or targeter who is  assigned to serve as the immediate supervisor for all CSI team members  and is responsible for coordinating with host government counterparts in  the day-to-day operations. The targeters are team members responsible for  targeting shipments and referring those shipments they determine are  high-risk to host government officials for inspection. The targeter may also  observe inspections of containers. The intelligence analyst is responsible  for gathering information to support targeters in their efforts to target  containers. In addition, the special agents are to coordinate all  investigative activity resulting from CSI-related actions, as well as act as  liaison with all appropriate U.S. embassy attach\u00e9s. Under the CSI program,  the targeting of cargo is largely dependent on CBP targeters\u2019 review of  information contained within CBP\u2019s Automated Targeting System (ATS) in  conjunction with other sources to determine the risk characterization of a  container.", "CSI teams refer any containers they characterize as high-risk to host  government officials for concurrence to inspect. If host government  officials, on the basis of their review, agree that the shipment is high-risk,  they will proceed with an inspection using nonintrusive inspection  equipment (that is, X-ray) and physical examinations, if warranted. If the  host government officials determine, on the basis of their review, that a  shipment is not high-risk, they will deny inspection of the shipment.

However, CBP has stated that a  company will not be rejected from participating in C-TPAT if there are  problems with its security profile. Instead, CBP says it will work with  companies to try to resolve and overcome any deficiencies with the profile  itself.

First,  we reported that CBP\u2019s validation process is not rigorous enough to  achieve its stated purpose, which is to ensure that the security procedures  outlined in members\u2019 security profiles are reliable, accurate, and effective.  CBP officials told us that validations are not considered independent  audits, and the objectives, scope, and methodology of validations are  jointly agreed upon with the member representatives. In addition, CBP has  indicated that it does not intend for the validation process to be an  exhaustive review of every security measure at each originating location;  rather, it selects specific facets of the members\u2019 security profiles to review  for their reliability, accuracy, and effectiveness. For example, the guidance  to ocean carriers for preparing a security profile directs the carriers to  address, at a minimum, three broad areas (security program, personnel  security, and service provider requirements), which contain several more  specific security measures, such as facilities security and pre-employment  screening. According to CBP officials, as well as our review of selected  case files, validations examine only a few facets of members\u2019 security  profiles. CBP supply chain specialists, who are responsible for conducting  most of the validations, are supposed to individually determine which  segments of a company\u2019s supply chain security will be suggested to the  member for validation. To assist in this decision, supply chain specialists  are supposed to compare a company\u2019s security profile, as well as any self- assessments or other company materials or information retrievable in  national databases, against the C-TPAT security guidelines to determine  which elements of the profile will be validated. Once the supply chain  specialist determines the level and focus of the validation, the specialist is  supposed to contact the member company with a potential agenda for the  validation. The two parties then jointly reach agreement on which security  elements will be reviewed and which locations will be visited.", "Moreover, as we reported, CBP has no written guidelines for its supply  chain specialist to indicate what scope of effort is adequate for the  validation to ensure that the member\u2019s security measures are reliable,  accurate, and effective, in part because it seeks to emphasize the  partnership nature of the program. Importantly, CBP has no baseline  standard for what minimally constitutes a validation. CBP discourages  supply chain specialists from developing a set checklist of items to  address during the validation, as CBP does not want to give the  appearance of conducting an audit. In addition, as discussed below, the  validation reports we reviewed did not consistently document how the  elements of members\u2019 security profiles were selected for validation.", "Second, we also reported that CBP has not determined the extent to which  it must conduct validations of members\u2019 security profiles to ensure that  the operation of C-TPAT is consistent with its overall approach to  managing risk. In 3 years of C-TPAT operation, CBP has validated about   11 percent of its certified members. CBP\u2019s original goal was to validate all  certified members within 3 years of certification. However, CBP officials  told us that because of rapid growth in program membership and its  staffing constraints, it would not be possible to meet this goal. In February  2004, CBP indicated that approximately 5,700 companies had submitted  signed agreements to participate in the program. As shown in figure 2, by  April 2005, the number of members had grown to over 9,000, about 4,800  of which had been certified and were thus eligible for validation.  According to CBP, as of April 2005, CBP staff had completed validations of  550 companies, including 174 importers.", "In our C-TPAT report we noted that CBP has made efforts to hire  additional supply chain specialists to handle validations for the growing  membership. As of August 2004, CBP had hired a total of 40 supply chain  specialists to conduct validations, with 24 field office managers also  available to conduct validations. CBP officials told us the bureau is  currently conducting as many validations as its resources allow. However,  CBP has not determined the number of supply chain specialists it needs or  the extent to which validations are needed to provide reasonable  assurance that the program is consistent with a sound risk management  approach to securing U.S.-bound goods.", "Finally, we reported that it would not be possible for CBP to meet its goal  of validating every member within 3 years of certification. Instead, CBP  told us it is using a risk-based approach, which considers a variety of  factors to prioritize which members should be validated as resources  allow. CBP has an internal selection process it is supposed to apply to all  certified members. Under this process CBP officials are supposed to  prioritize members for validation based on established criteria but may  also consider other factors. For example, recent seizures involving C- TPAT members can affect validation priorities. If a member is involved in  a seizure, CBP officials noted that the member is supposed to lose  program benefits and be given top priority for a validation. In addition,  CBP officials told us that an importer that failed CBP\u2019s vetting process  would also be given top priority for a validation. CBP officials have taken  this approach because any importer that fails the vetting process is not  supposed to receive program benefits until after successful completion of  the validation process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Progress Made in Addressing Management Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["As we reported, CBP continues to expand the C-TPAT program without  addressing management weaknesses that could hinder the bureau from  achieving the program\u2019s dual goals of securing the flow of goods bound for  the United States and facilitating the flow of trade. First, we reported that  CBP is still developing an implementation plan to address the strategies  for carrying out the program\u2019s goals and those elements required in a  human capital plan. For example, CBP said it has developed new  positions, training programs and materials, and a staffing plan. Further,  CBP said it will continue to refine all aspects of the C-TPAT human capital  plan to include headquarters personnel, additional training requirements,  budget, and future personnel profiles.", "Second, we reported that CBP continues developing a comprehensive set  of performance measures and indicators for C-TPAT. According to CBP,  developing these measures for C-TPAT, as well as other programs in the  bureau, has been difficult because CBP lacks data necessary to exhibit  whether a program has prevented or deterred terrorist activity. For  example, as noted in the C-TPAT strategic plan, it is difficult to measure  program effectiveness in terms of deterrence because generally the direct  impact on unlawful activity is unknown. The plan also notes that while  traditional workload measures are a valuable indicator, they do not  necessarily reflect the success or failure of the bureau\u2019s efforts. CBP is  working to collect more substantive information\u2014related to C-TPAT  activities (i.e., current workflow process)\u2014to develop its performance  measures. In commenting on a draft of our report, CBP indicated it has  developed initial measures for the program but will continue to develop  and refine these measures to ensure program success.", "Third, we reported that CBP\u2019s record keeping for the program is  incomplete, as key decisions are not always documented and  programmatic information is not updated regularly or accurately. Federal  regulations require that bureau record-keeping procedures provide  documentation to facilitate review by Congress and other authorized  agencies of government. Further, standards for internal control in the  federal government require that all transactions be clearly documented in  a manner that is complete, accurate, and useful to managers and others  involved in evaluating operations. During our review of six company files  for which validations had been completed, it was not always clear what  facet of the security profile was being validated and why a particular site  was selected at which to conduct the validation because there was not  always documentation of the decision-making process. The aspects of the  security profiles covered and sites visited did not always appear to be the  most relevant. For example, one validation report we reviewed for a major  retailer\u2014one that imports the vast majority of its goods from Asia\u2014 indicated that the validation team reviewed facilities in Central America.  CBP officials noted that it recently revised its validation report format to  better capture any justification for report recommendations and best  practices identified. After reviewing eight of the more recent validation  reports, we noted that there appeared to be a greater discussion related to  the rationale for validating specific aspects of the security profiles.  However, the related company files did not consistently contain other  documentation of members\u2019 application, certification, vetting, receipt of  benefits, or validation. While files contained some of these elements, they  were generally not complete. In fact, most files did not usually contain  anything other than copies of the member\u2019s C-TPAT agreement, security  profiles, and validation report.", "Further, we reported that CBP does not update programmatic information  regularly or accurately. In particular, the reliability of CBP\u2019s database to  track member status using key dates in the application through validation  processes is questionable. The database, which is primarily used for  documentation management and workflow tracking, is not updated on a  regular basis. In addition, C-TPAT management told us that earlier data  entered into the database may not be accurate, and CBP has taken no  systematic look at the reliability of the database. CBP officials also told us  that there are no written guidelines for who should enter information into  the database or how frequently the database should be updated. We made  several requests over a period of weeks to review the contents of the  database to analyze workload factors, including the amount of time that  each step in the C-TPAT application and review process was taking. The  database information that CBP ultimately provided to us was incomplete,  as many of the data fields were missing or inaccurate. For example, more  than 33 percent of the entries for validation date were incomplete.

Although we have not assessed the new criteria in detail,  the new criteria appear to better define the minimum security  expectations of importers participating in the C-TPAT program than the  prior security guidelines. For example, under the prior security guidelines,  all importers were to secure containers\u2019 internal and external  compartments and panels. Under the new security criteria, importers are  to explicitly require all containers bound for the United States to have  high-security seals affixed to them. In addition, the new criteria appear to  place a greater emphasis on security procedures throughout importers\u2019  supply chains than the prior guidelines. Specifically, the new criteria state  that importers must have written and verifiable processes for the selection  of business partners, as well as documentation of whether these business  partners are either C-TPAT certified or meet the C-TPAT security  criteria\u2014requirements not found in the prior security guidelines.  However, the new security criteria do not address our recommendations  for improving the program and may place an even greater emphasis on the  need to strengthen the validation process. According to the new criteria,  importers wishing to join the C-TPAT program must submit security  profiles that address the new criteria as part of the certification process.  But importers who are already C-TPAT members are not required to  provide any written certification that they meet the new security criteria  and will not have to resubmit their security profiles. Instead, CBP will use  validations to gauge whether or not these members have adopted the new  security criteria. This places a greater emphasis on the need for CBP to  establish guidelines for what constitutes a validation and the extent to  which it must conduct validations to ensure that the C-TPAT program is  consistent with its overall approach to managing risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Improvements Needed in CSI Targeting, Inspection and Management Efforts", "paragraphs": ["My statement will now focus on the results of our work on the CSI  program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limitations Exist in Ability to Target Containers Overseas", "paragraphs": ["In our CSI report, we noted that CBP officials told us the CSI program has  produced factors that contribute to CBP\u2019s ability to target shipments at  overseas seaports, including improved information sharing between the  CSI teams and host government officials regarding U.S.-bound shipments  and a heightened level of bilateral cooperation on and international  awareness of the need for securing the global shipping system. However,  we found factors that may limit the program\u2019s effectiveness at some ports,  including (1) staffing imbalances at CSI ports and (2) weaknesses in one  source of data CBP relies upon to target shipments.", "As we reported, one factor negatively affecting CBP\u2019s ability to target  containers is staffing imbalances across ports. Although CBP\u2019s goal is to  target all U.S.-bound containers at CSI ports before they depart for the  United States, it has not been able to place enough staff at some CSI ports  to do so. As a result of these imbalances, 35 percent of U.S.-bound  shipments from CSI ports were not targeted and were therefore not  subject to inspection overseas\u2014the key goal of the CSI program. CBP has  been unable to staff the CSI teams at the levels called for in the CSI  staffing model because of diplomatic and practical considerations.  However, CBP\u2019s staffing model for CSI does not consider whether some of  the targeting functions could be performed in the United States. For  example, the model does not consider what minimum number of targeters  need to be physically located at CSI ports to carry out duties that require  an overseas presence (such as coordinating with host government  officials) as opposed to other duties that could be performed in the United  States (such as reviewing manifests and databases). CBP has placed  targeters at its National Targeting Center to assist CSI teams in targeting  containers for inspection, which demonstrates that CBP does not have to  rely exclusively on overseas targeters as called for in its staffing model.", "Further, we reported the existence of limitations in one data source CSI  teams use for targeting high-risk containers. For CSI, CBP uses manifest  information as one data source to help characterize the risk level of U.S.- bound shipments, information that may be unreliable and incomplete.  Although CBP officials told us that the quality of the manifest data has  improved, there is no method to routinely verify whether the manifest data  accurately reflect the contents within the cargo container."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Containers Were Not Inspected for a Variety of Reasons", "paragraphs": ["As we reported, since the implementation of CSI through September 11,  2004, 28 percent (4,013) of containers referred to host government officials  for inspection were not inspected for a variety of reasons including  operational limitations that prevented the containers from being inspected  before they left the port. In 1 percent of these cases, host government  officials denied inspections, generally because inspection requests were  based on factors not related to security threats, such as drug smuggling.  Containers referred to host governments for inspection by CSI teams that  are not inspected overseas are supposed to be referred for inspection  upon arrival at the U.S. destination port. CBP officials noted that between  July 2004 and September 2004, about 93 percent of shipments referred for  domestic inspection were inspected at a U.S. port. CBP officials explained  that some of these shipments were not inspected domestically because  inspectors at U.S. ports received additional information or entry  information that lowered the risk characterization of the shipments or  because the shipments remained aboard the carrier and were never  offloaded at a U.S. port.", "Further, we reported that for the 72 percent (10,343) of containers that  were inspected overseas, CBP officials told us there were some anomalies  that led to law enforcement actions but that no WMD were discovered.  There are two types of radiation detection devices used at CSI ports to  inspect cargo containers\u2014radiation isotope identifier devices and  radiation portal monitors\u2014as well as various types of X-ray and gamma- ray imaging machines used at CSI ports to inspect cargo containers, each  with different detection and identification capabilities. However, the  inspection equipment used at CSI ports varies in detection capability, and  there are no minimum requirements for the detection capability of  equipment used for CSI. In addition, technologies to detect other WMD  have limitations. As a result, CBP has no absolute assurance that  inspections conducted under CSI are effective at detecting and identifying  WMD. According to CBP officials, the bureau has not established  minimum technical requirements for the nonintrusive inspection  equipment or radiation detection equipment that can be used as part of  CSI because of sovereignty issues, as well as restrictions that prevent CBP  from endorsing a particular brand of equipment. Although CBP cannot  endorse a particular brand of equipment, the bureau could still establish  general technical capability requirements for any equipment used under  CSI similar to other general requirements CBP has for the program, such  as the country committing to establishing an automated risk management  system. Because the CSI inspection could be the only inspection of a  container before it enters the interior of the United States, it is important  that the nonintrusive inspection and radiation detection equipment used as  part of CSI provides some level of assurance of the likelihood that the  equipment could detect the presence of WMD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Made Progress Developing a Strategic Plan and Performance Measures for CSI, but Further Refinements Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["As we reported, CBP has made some improvements in the management of  CSI, but further refinements to the bureau\u2019s management tools are needed  to help achieve program goals. Regarding a strategic plan for CSI, CBP  developed a strategic plan in February 2004 that contained three of the six  key elements the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)  required for executive agency strategic plans but lacked (1) a description  of how performance goals and measures are related to the general goals  and objectives of the program, (2) an identification of key factors external  to the agency and beyond its control that could affect the achievement of  general goals and objectives, and (3) a description of program evaluations.  We also reported that CBP told us it was revising the CSI strategic plan to  address the elements we raised in the report. We noted that it appeared  that the bureau\u2019s initial efforts in this area met the intent of our prior  recommendation to develop a strategic plan for CSI, but we could not  determine the effectiveness of further revisions to the plan without first  reviewing and evaluating them.", "Further, we recommended in our July 2003 report that CBP expand efforts  already initiated to develop performance measures for CSI that include  outcome-oriented indicators. Until recently, CBP based the performance  of CSI on program outputs such as (1) the number and percentage of bills  of lading reviewed, further researched, referred for inspection, and  actually inspected, and (2) the number of countries and ports participating  in CSI. CBP has developed 11 performance indicators for CSI, 2 of which it  identified as outcome-oriented: (1) the number of foreign mitigated  examinations and (2) the percentage of worldwide U.S.-destined  containers processed through CSI ports. However, CSI lacks performance  goals and measures for other program objectives. In commenting on a  draft of our April 2005 report, DHS noted that CBP is continuing to refine  existing performance measures and develop new performance measures  for its program goals.
