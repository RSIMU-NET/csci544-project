Policy initiatives include assessing global intellectual property challenges and identifying countries with the most significant problems--an annual interagency process known as the \"Special 301\" review--and negotiating agreements that address intellectual property. In addition, many agencies engage in training and assistance activities, such as providing training for foreign officials. Finally, a small number of agencies carry out law enforcement actions, such as criminal investigations involving foreign parties and seizures of counterfeit merchandise. Agencies use several mechanisms to coordinate their efforts, although the mechanisms' usefulness varies. Formal interagency meetings--part of the U.S. government's annual Special 301 review--allow agencies to discuss intellectual property policy concerns and are seen by government and industry sources as rigorous and effective. However, the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council, established to coordinate domestic and international intellectual property law enforcement, has struggled to find a clear mission, has undertaken few activities, and is generally viewed as having little impact. U.S. efforts have contributed to strengthened intellectual property legislation overseas, but enforcement in many countries remains weak, and further U.S. efforts face significant challenges. For example, competing U.S. policy objectives take precedence over protecting intellectual property in certain regions. Further, other countries' domestic policy objectives can affect their \"political will\" to address U.S. concerns.

USTR identifies these countries  with substantial assistance from industry and U.S. agencies and publishes  the results of its reviews in an annual report. Once a pool of such  countries has been determined, the USTR, in coordination with other  agencies, is required to decide which, if any, of these countries should be  designated as a Priority Foreign Country (PFC). If a trading partner is  identified as a PFC, USTR must decide within 30 days whether to initiate  an investigation of those acts, policies, and practices that were the basis  for identifying the country as a PFC.

For example, the Department of Justice has an  office that directly addresses international IPR problems. Justice has been  involved with international investigation and prosecution efforts and,  according to a Justice official, has become more aggressive in recent  years. For instance, Justice and the FBI recently coordinated an  undercover IPR investigation, with the involvement of several foreign law  enforcement agencies. The investigation focused on individuals and  organizations, known as \u201cwarez\u201d release groups, which specialize in the  Internet distribution of pirated materials.

Because  intellectual property protection is one of many U.S. government objectives  pursued overseas, it is viewed internally in the context of broader U.S.  foreign policy objectives that may receive higher priority at certain times  in certain countries. Industry officials with whom we met noted, for  example, their belief that policy priorities related to national security were  limiting the extent to which the United States undertook activities or  applied diplomatic pressure related to IPR issues in some countries.  Further, the impact of U.S. activities is affected by a country\u2019s own  domestic policy objectives and economic interests, which may  complement or conflict with U.S. objectives. U.S. efforts are more likely to  be effective in encouraging government action or achieving impact in a  foreign country where support for intellectual property protection exists.  It is difficult for the U.S. government to achieve impact in locations where  foreign governments lack the \u201cpolitical will\u201d to enact IPR protections.", "Many economic factors complicate and challenge U.S. and foreign  governments\u2019 efforts, even in countries with the political will to protect  intellectual property. These factors include low barriers to entering the  counterfeiting and piracy business and potentially high profits for  producers. In addition, the low prices of counterfeit products are  attractive to consumers. The economic incentives can be especially acute  in countries where people have limited income. Technological advances  allowing for high-quality inexpensive and accessible reproduction and  distribution in some industries have exacerbated the problem. Moreover,  many government and industry officials believe that the chances of getting  caught for counterfeiting and piracy, as well as the penalties when caught,  are too low. The increasing involvement of organized crime in the  production and distribution of pirated products further complicates  enforcement efforts. Federal and foreign law enforcement officials have  linked intellectual property crime to national and transnational organized  criminal operations. Further, like other criminals, terrorists can trade any  commodity in an illegal fashion, as evidenced by their reported  involvement in trading a variety of counterfeit and other goods.", "Many of these challenges are evident in the optical media industry, which  includes music, movies, software, and games. Even in countries where  interests exist to protect domestic industries, such as the domestic music  industry in Brazil or the domestic movie industry in China, economic and  law enforcement challenges can be difficult to overcome. For example, the  cost of reproduction technology and copying digital media is low, making  piracy an attractive employment opportunity, especially in a country  where formal employment is hard to obtain. The huge price differentials  between pirated CDs and legitimate copies also create incentives on the  consumer side. For example, when we visited a market in Brazil, we  observed that the price for a legitimate DVD was approximately ten times  the price for a pirated DVD. Even if consumers are willing to pay extra to  purchase the legitimate product, they may not do so if the price  differences are too great for similar products. Further, the potentially high  profit makes optical media piracy an attractive venture for organized  criminal groups. Industry and government officials have noted criminal  involvement in optical media piracy and the resulting law enforcement  challenges. Recent technological advances have also exacerbated optical  media piracy. The mobility of the equipment makes it easy to transport it  to another location, further complicating enforcement efforts. Likewise,  the Internet provides a means to transmit and sell illegal software or music  on a global scale. According to an industry representative, the ability of  Internet pirates to hide their identities or operate from remote  jurisdictions often makes it difficult for IPR holders to find them and hold  them accountable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Despite improvements such as strengthened foreign IPR legislation,  international IPR protection may be worsening overall for some  intellectual property sectors. For example, according to copyright industry  estimates, losses due to piracy grew markedly in recent years.

Conversely, the mechanism for  coordinating intellectual property law enforcement, NIPLECC, has  accomplished little that is concrete. Currently, there is a lack of  compelling information to demonstrate a unique role for this group,  bringing into question its effectiveness. In addition, it does not include the  FBI, a primary law enforcement agency. Members, including NIPLECC  leadership, have repeatedly acknowledged that the group continues to  struggle to find an appropriate mission.", "The effects of U.S. actions are most evident in strengthened foreign IPR  legislation. U.S. efforts are now focused on enforcement, since effective  enforcement is often the weak link in intellectual property protection  overseas and the situation may be deteriorating for some industries. As  agencies continue to pursue IPR improvements overseas, they will face  daunting challenges. These challenges include the need to create political  will overseas, recent technological advancements that facilitate the  production and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods, and powerful  economic incentives for both producers and consumers, particularly in  developing countries. Further, as the U.S. government focuses increasingly  on enforcement, it will face different and complex factors, such as  organized crime, that may prove quite difficult to address.", "With a broad mandate under its authorizing legislation, NIPLECC has  struggled to establish its purpose and unique role.
