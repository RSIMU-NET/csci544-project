Rather, GAO found that criteria were scattered throughout various sections of the announcement, had multiple labels, and were not presented in an orderly manner. As a result, applications that did not address the criteria from all sections were likely to receive lower evaluation scores, decreasing their chances of receiving a grant. HHS provides technical assistance to potential applicants for runaway and homeless youth grants, as required by statute. Of the 20 applicants GAO interviewed who sought technical assistance, 17 were satisfied with the help they received. Grant award decisions are primarily based on the results of the peer review process, and internal controls in place to ensure that applications are evaluated consistently were not always adequate. GAO found weaknesses in four out of the six procedures the agency relies on to ensure consistent evaluation of applications. For example, although HHS policy requires peer reviewers to be experts in the field of runaway and homeless youth programs, about one- quarter of the reviewers who evaluated applications for 2009 Street Outreach grants had little or no experience in this area. With regard to notification of grant award decisions, GAO found that they have not always been communicated to applicants in a timely manner, which can delay the start of new programs and present planning challenges for existing ones. GAO also found that the information in notification letters to applicants who were not awarded grants was not always clear or complete."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  thousands of U.S. youth run away from home, are asked to leave their  homes, or become homeless each year. Without shelter and guidance,  these youth are vulnerable to exploitation and involvement in illicit  activities, such as selling drugs and prostitution. In 2008 and 2009, HHS  awarded more than $100 million each year in discretionary grants to  providers of shelter and services for this vulnerable population through  three programs for runaway and homeless youth. The Basic Center and  Transitional Living Programs fund short-term and longer-term shelter for  youth, respectively, and the Street Outreach Program funds services to  prevent sexual abuse and exploitation of these youth.", "Because only about one out of three homeless and runaway youth grant  applications is approved, it is particularly important that the agency have  systems in place to help ensure consistent and transparent grant award  decisions. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 mandated a  GAO review of HHS\u2019s process for awarding certain Runaway and  Homeless Youth Act grants. This report responds to that mandate by  addressing the following questions: (1) How clear are grant  announcements and application documents and requirements? (2) How  useful do applicants find the technical assistance they receive to assist  them with applying for grants? (3) How are grant award decisions made  and to what extent does this process comply with federal requirements?  (4) To what extent are grant award decisions communicated to applicants  in a timely and clear manner in accordance with federal requirements?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, grant  announcements, applications and other agency documents, and we  interviewed key agency officials and contractors. To determine applicants\u2019  views on the usefulness of technical assistance, we randomly selected and  interviewed 24 out of the 590 applicants that competed for fiscal year 2008  grants. This sample included applicants who were awarded grants and  applicants who were not. We also randomly selected and interviewed 6  peer reviewers out of approximately 170 who evaluated applications for at  least one of the three grant programs for fiscal year 2008. Additionally, we  interviewed representatives from the National Network for Youth, an  organization that represents providers of services to youth and families.  To determine how grant award decisions are made, we analyzed agency  data and documents related to peer review evaluations and final award  decisions for the three programs for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. We also  observed the peer review process for the Street Outreach Program in June  2009. To determine the extent to which the grant award process complies  with federal requirements, we compared the grant award process to  relevant requirements in the law, HHS regulations and written guidance,  and internal control standards for the federal government. To determine  the extent to which grant award decisions are communicated in a timely  and clear manner in accordance with federal requirements, we reviewed a  random sample of 69 notifications that were sent to applicants for at least  one of the three programs for fiscal year 2008 grants. Additionally, we  established a timeline for each grant program\u2019s award process for fiscal  years 2007 and 2008.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2009 through April 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Announcements  provide the information potential applicants need to determine if they are  eligible to apply and the instructions on how to complete and submit their  application. In addition, they include the criteria used to evaluate  applications.", "Technical Assistance: Each announcement lists the technical service  providers responsible for providing technical assistance to potential  applicants to help them understand the announcement requirements.

Applicants may also hand deliver their application to the agency\u2019s  contractor responsible for receiving the applications. The deadline for  submitting applications is usually 45 to 60 days after an announcement is  published.", "Application Pre-Screening: Applications are prescreened to determine  whether they meet two requirements. Applications are eliminated from  review if they are received after the deadline or if they request more  funding than the maximum amount specified in the announcement.", "Peer Review of Applications: Applications remaining after pre- screening are submitted to peer review panels. A panel generally consists  of three peer reviewers, who apply the evaluation criteria contained in the  announcement to applications and score the applications, and a panel  chair responsible for facilitating consensus of the peer review panel.", "Peer reviewers assign points to each application, based upon specific  criteria that are outlined in the announcement. The points are added up  and the applicant\u2019s average score is derived. This score, ranging from 0 to  100, becomes the basis for the ranked listing of applicants which the  agency uses in its award decisions. Because applicants whose score places  them below the total available funding limit may be denied a grant, a single  point can make a difference between awarding a grant and denying a  grant.", "Final Grant Award Decisions: Taking into account peer review panel  scores and comments for each application and, in some cases, other  factors, the Program Office and the Grants Management Office make the  final award decisions.

Rather, we found that criteria were scattered throughout  various sections of the announcement, had multiple labels, and were not  presented in an orderly manner in a single location. For example, for the  2009 Street Outreach Program grant competition, grant applications were  evaluated and scored based on how well they addressed criteria contained  in three different sections of the announcement. First, applicants must  address the \u201cProgram Requirements,\u201d found in Section 1 of the  announcement. Second, applicants must address the \u201cProject  Description,\u201d found in Section 4. Third, applicants must address the  \u201cEvaluation Criteria\u201d found in Section 5. However, only the \u201cEvaluation  Criteria\u201d section of the announcement explicitly described how their  responses would be evaluated and scored. Because the applicant must  address criteria contained in different sections of the announcement, if  applicants focused primarily on responding to the \u201cEvaluation Criteria\u201d  they may not have adequately addressed information in the other sections.

This guidance,  which was not available to applicants, consolidated information from  various sections of the announcement.

Because applicants did not have this detailed guidance,  which combined information from various parts of the announcement,  applicants may not have had full knowledge of what information was  critical to receiving a high score.

At that time, the agency  entered into cooperative agreements with the University of Oklahoma to  provide technical assistance nationwide.", "Through its providers, the agency coordinates technical assistance, which  generally consists of a pre-application conference (webinar) covering the  application requirements such as the project description, eligibility, and  the evaluation criteria, among other things.

According to GAO standards, internal controls should  provide reasonable assurance that the agency\u2019s objectives, such as  providing grants to the most qualified providers, are being achieved.  Ideally, internal controls should be continuous, built-in components of the  agency\u2019s processes, and should provide reasonable assurance that the  grant award process works as it is designed to work. Our review of ACF\u2019s  grant award process found that, while the agency has a number of internal  controls in place to help ensure consistent application of evaluation  criteria across reviewers and across panels, some of these controls are  limited in their effectiveness. For example, we found weaknesses in four  out of six internal controls related to the grant award process, as shown in  table 4.", "First, ACF does not always select peer reviewers whose qualifications  comply with the standards outlined in HHS policy. The policy states that  each application for runaway and homeless youth grants must receive an  objective, advisory review by a minimum of three unbiased reviewers with  expertise in the programmatic area for which applications are submitted.  Furthermore, the announcements we reviewed stated that grant  application reviewers should be experts in the field of runaway and  homeless youth programs. However, we found that HHS considered  students, school teachers, business consultants, and television and media  workers as qualified peer reviewers. Our review of resumes of all the peer  reviewers and chairs for 2009 Street Outreach Program grants found that  many had professional and volunteer experiences that were not always  directly related to runaway and homeless youth programs. Based on the  resumes of 76 peer reviewers, we found that 26 peer reviewers had direct  experience with runaway and homeless youth programs listed on their  resume, and another 31 had indirect experience, such as social work,  teaching, or grant reviewing. However, 19 did not appear to have any of  the relevant knowledge and expertise in runaway and homeless youth  programs required by HHS policy. Three of these 19 reviewers were  identified as \u201cyouth reviewers\u201d in their resumes. One agency official  responsible for the grant review process during 2009 explained that HHS  interprets its policies governing peer reviewer qualifications broadly and  accepts all related experience. He also noted that HHS encourages the use  of \u201cyouth reviewers\u201d for its peer review panels.", "Second, during our observation of the 2009 Street Outreach Program grant  competition, we found that the meetings for peer reviewers and chairs  were not mandatory. These meetings included an orientation session,  panel chair meetings, and new reviewer meetings. Meetings for panel  chairs are particularly important for helping to ensure consistent  evaluations across panels because in these meetings, all panel chairs agree  on how to apply the evaluation criteria. However, we observed that some  panel chairs did not attend these meetings, and, therefore, their panels  may not have applied the evaluation criteria in the same manner as panels  whose chairs had attended the meetings. Similarly, new reviewers were  permitted to miss the new reviewers\u2019 meetings and still participate in the  reviews, which could also increase the risk of inconsistent application of  evaluation criteria.", "Third, we observed that the agency provided detailed guidance to peer  reviewers to aid them in evaluating applications. The detailed guidance  provided to reviewers explaining the evaluation criteria has led to  variation in application of criteria by review panels. For example, when we  observed peer review panel deliberations for the 2009 Street Outreach  grants, we found that peer review panels varied in the way they applied  the criterion for evaluation of emergency evacuation plans. The  announcement\u2019s \u201cEvaluation Criteria\u201d section contained the following  evaluation criterion related to emergency plans:  The application \u201cdescribes the emergency preparedness and management  plan by addressing steps to be taken in case of a local or national situation  that poses risk to the health and safety of program staff and youth.\u201d", "At the panel session, agency officials told panels that they should also  apply all of the information in the detailed guidance they were given,  which included information in the \u201cProgram Requirements\u201d section of the  announcement. Federal officials advised peer reviewers that they should  score the application on the following information:  \u201cGrantees must immediately provide notification to FYSB when  evacuation plans are executed.\u201d", "As a result, peer review panels that followed the guidance gave lower  scores to applicants that did not specifically indicate that they would  notify the agency when an evacuation occurred. One peer review panel we  observed, however, did not give lower scores when this was not specified  in an application. These peer reviewers said that they did not think it was  fair to assign lower scores in these cases because the more detailed  information about evacuation requirements was not listed in the  \u201cEvaluation Criteria\u201d section of the announcement.", "Additionally, we interviewed peer reviewers who participated in panels for  2008 runaway and homeless youth grants. Three of the six peer reviewers  we interviewed told us they observed variations in the way panels applied  the criteria. Reviewers said that the 2008 Transitional Living Program  announcements contained evaluation criteria requiring applicants to  provide background checks for all staff members who would be working  with youth. However, the peer reviewers told us that the guidance  provided to peer reviewers by the agency during that review process  further specified that these background checks must be conducted in  accordance with local, state, and national requirements. According to the  peer reviewers we interviewed, this could have led to variation in how this  aspect of the application was evaluated by different panels. Given that the  peer review score is the key factor in determining grant awards,  inconsistent evaluation criteria across panels can have a significant impact  on whether an applicant is awarded a grant or not.", "The fourth control weakness we observed during our review of the 2009  Street Outreach Program grant competition was that agency officials did  not keep a permanent record of their comments and feedback to peer  review panels during their oversight of the peer review process, which  introduced further potential for inconsistent application of evaluation  criteria. Agency officials review the panel\u2019s scores and narrative comments  for each application during the peer review process before they are  finalized. The officials visit panels as peer reviewers deliberate and  respond to their questions, and provide feedback to chairpersons on their  panel\u2019s evaluations. Agency officials told us their review and feedback is  meant to ensure that all panels apply the evaluation criteria in the same  way. However, the federal officials we observed did not record this  information in a permanent record. Instead, the officials provided their  feedback to the chair via comments written on post-it notes. This lack of  permanent documentation of federal official feedback to peer review  panels makes it difficult for the agency to ensure that it is providing  consistent guidance to panels and responding to problems across panels in  the same way during the peer review process.", "No weaknesses were apparent in two of the six internal controls--(1) the  provision of standard training materials to peer reviewers prior to panel  sessions, and (2) the presence of federal officials on site during panel  sessions to respond to questions from, and communicate on a daily basis  with panels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Basis for Denying Grants Is Not Always Documented", "paragraphs": ["Final funding decision memos used to internally document grant award  decisions for 2007 and 2008 did not contain supporting information  regarding why applications with high scores were not funded.

According to  one ACF official, successful applicants are generally notified at the end of  the federal fiscal year. Based on our review of grant documents for fiscal  years 2007 and 2008, we found that for all but the 2008 Transitional Living  Program grants, this was true, regardless of when the announcement  closed or when the funding decisions were made. For example,  applications for the 2008 Basic Center Program were due in February 2008  and were evaluated and scored in March; however, applicants were not  notified of their award status until September, 6 months later. HHS policy  does not indicate when notification letters should be distributed to  applicants, but according to an ACF official, awards to successful  applicants are made by September 30 because most new programs are  expected to start on or before October 1. Given the proximity of the  notification date to program start date, some successful applicants with  new programs we spoke with told us that the September notification  timeframe did not allow enough preparation time to hire staff and secure  the resources needed to provide services. See figure 5 for the timeline of  dates for key events for the fiscal year 2007 and 2008 grant award process.", "Notification delays also create planning issues for ongoing programs that  are not awarded new grants and, as a result, need to develop contingency  plans for continuing or discontinuing services. Since unsuccessful  applicants are notified of their grant award status after successful  applicants have been notified, an applicant whose previous grant is about  to expire may experience planning problems if notifications are delayed.  Delays in notifying unsuccessful applicants may not give applicants  adequate time to react to not being awarded a new grant. In the event that  funding is denied or discontinued, earlier notification of award decisions  could help providers properly plan.", "According to an ACF official, there is nothing in policy that prohibits  notifying an applicant as soon as award decisions have been made. The  official told us that delays in sending out notification letters are linked to  the timeliness of writing and issuing the announcement. According to this  official, announcements must be reviewed by many departments within  the agency, and, therefore, the turnaround time is not as timely as it could  be. However we found that even after the announcements were published  and closed, applicants were still not notified of their award status for  several months. For example, for the 2008 Transitional Living grant,  regardless of when the announcement was published, applicants were not  notified of their award, until close to 4 months after the panels had  completed evaluating the applications. Similarly, notifications of decisions  related to 2008 Basic Center grants were not sent out until about 7 months  after the panels.", "In addition to the challenges applicants experienced due to notification  delays, the agency created additional planning challenges for applicants  when it unexpectedly changed the timing of the funding cycle for the  Transitional Living Program in fiscal year 2008 without notifying  applicants of this change in a timely manner. The announcement stated  that ACF anticipated making grant awards in the first quarter of fiscal year  2008, which would have been from October through December of 2007.  However, the grant award start date was changed to March 2008 after this  announcement was published. According to an agency official, the original  start date was moved in an effort to spread out the timing of peer review  panels for each of the three runaway and homeless youth programs and  other activities that were scheduled to occur around the same time during  the summer months. As a result of moving the cycle start date\u2014from  October to March\u2014some successful applicants were without federal  funding for several months between the end of the previous grant cycle  and the new grant award start date.", "Runaway and homeless youth service providers have also raised concerns  to their congressional representatives about the timeliness of notifications.  Specifically, we reviewed nine complaint letters that were sent to  congressional representatives regarding runaway and homeless youth  grants applications in 2007 and 2008.

ACF  responded to the complaint by noting that it offers funding for successful  applicants to recoup some of the costs that programs incurred due to the  delay.", "In addition, the National Network for Youth, an organization that  represents providers of services to youth and families also noted that the  timeliness of notifications has been an issue of concern for its  membership.

The  agency does not keep a record to document detailed information that  would support or justify a denial for geographic reasons, such as the  number or names of programs that exist in the same locale, the services  these programs provide, or the numbers of youth they serve. As a result, it  is not possible to verify that denying a grant based on \u201cgeographic  distribution\u201d was justified.", "Applicants who want further explanation of their award decisions may  request additional information along with their scores from ACF through a  Freedom of Information Act request.

Additionally, unless all peer  reviewers attend meetings at panel review sessions; these meetings cannot  help ensure consistent evaluation of applications. Without documentation  of ACF comments to peer review panels during the review process there is  also a risk that the evaluation process will not be consistent. Moreover,  without fully documenting the rationale for denying grants to highly  scored applicants, agency grant award decisions are not transparent.", "Once the grant award decisions are made, it is incumbent on ACF to notify  applicants of decisions in a timely manner and provide them with clear  and specific information about, in particular, decision not to grant awards.  Without such notification, applicants may experience planning challenges  and not fully understand the reasons they were denied grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To enhance transparency and fairness in the grant award process, and  improve grantees ability to plan for services, we recommend that the  Secretary of Health and Human Services direct the Assistant Secretary for  the Administration for Children and Families to take the following seven  actions:    Clearly identify in grant announcements all the criteria that peer reviewers  will use to evaluate and score applications, and ensure that peer reviewers  use only those criteria during the peer review process.", "Select peer reviewers with expertise in the programmatic area for which  they are evaluating grant applications.", "Make all meetings for peer reviewers, including those for new reviewers  and chairs, mandatory.", "Document and maintain records of ACF comments to peer review panels  during the review process.", "Document the specific reasons for denying grants to high-scoring  applicants in favor of other applicants for the agency record.", "Provide clear information to applicants about the specific reasons their  applications were not approved.", "Notify applicants about the outcome of their applications as soon as grant  award decisions are made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human  Services for review and comment; these appear in appendix II. In its  comments, HHS disagreed with our recommendation to review and revise  announcements to ensure that all evaluation criteria listed be clearly  labeled as evaluation criteria and be contained in a single section of the  announcement.  HHS maintains that all of the criteria used to evaluate and  score applications are contained in section 5 of the announcement.   However during the peer review process we observed, in addition to  evaluating and scoring applications based on criteria specified in the  \u201cEvaluation Criteria\u201d section of the announcement (section 5), some of the  panels evaluated and scored applications based on criteria from two other  sections of the announcement. Given the difference between the agency\u2019s  response to our recommendation and what we observed, we are revising  our recommendation to highlight the need to ensure that the all criteria  used to evaluate and score applications are clearly identified to applicants  and peer reviewers, and that peer reviewers use only those criteria when  evaluating and scoring applications.", "With regard to our recommendation to select peer reviewers with  expertise in the program for which they are evaluating grant applications,   HHS commented that the agency has elected to accept reviewers who are  knowledgeable of the risk factors faced by runaway and homeless youth,  and that many professional disciplines often intersect with runaway and  homeless youth. However, we found that in the past the agency has used  individuals that would not be expected to have relevant expertise, such as  television and media workers.  Noting our concern in this area, the agency  indicated that they plan to take steps to ensure that all reviewers possess  the knowledge and expertise in the particular program for which they are  reviewing grant applications.  In the event of a shortage of reviewers, the  agency intends to staff panels with at least one peer reviewer with  extensive relevant knowledge, which would continue to differ from the  current policy that grants must receive an objective, advisory review by a  minimum of \u201cthree\u201d unbiased reviewers with expertise in the  programmatic area for which applications are submitted. We agree that  professionals in varied disciplines could have sufficient expertise to serve  as reviewers and recognize that it may be difficult for the agency to find  enough reviewers with expertise in a particular program.  As a result, we  are clarifying our recommendation to include those that have expertise in  the programmatic area for which they are evaluating grant applications,  and not a specific program.", "Regarding our recommendations to make peer review meetings  mandatory, HHS indicated that all meetings for peer reviewers and chairs  are already mandatory but due to unforeseen factors, it is not always  possible for all reviewers to attend.  Indeed, during our observation of a  peer review session, not all reviewers and chairs attended the meetings.   Moreover, at the time, agency officials told us that attendance at these  meetings was not explicitly mandatory, but highly encouraged.  They also  indicated that attendance was not enforced and attendance records were  not maintained.  In response to this recommendation, the agency indicated  that they plan to officially notify all reviewers and chairpersons  participating in future reviews that all training is mandatory. In the event  some reviewers and chairpersons are not able to attend the mandatory  training sessions due to unforeseen circumstances, the agency intends to  offer \u201cmake up\u201d sessions.", "HHS did not provide comments on our recommendation to maintain  records of ACF comments to peer reviewer panels during the review  process. However they agreed with our recommendation to document the  specific reasons for denying grants to high-scoring applicants in favor of  other applicants.  HHS commented that the agency plans to include more  details concerning geographic distribution in the letters to applicants who  are denied grants for this reason.  While these efforts would be in line with  our recommendation; the details supporting such decisions must be  consistently documented in the agency\u2019s records to support the  information provided to applicants in their letters.", "In response to our recommendation to provide clear information to  applicants about specific reasons their applications were not approved,  HHS stated that in accordance with ACF policy and procedures, every  unsuccessful applicant is entitled to an explanation of why their  application was not funded.  In addition, the agency noted that, upon  request, the Program Office will provide a debriefing to applicants.  However, letters sent to unsuccessful applicants should clearly note that  applicants may request a debriefing by the Program Office regarding  specific reasons why their application was not funded. Currently, letters to  unsuccessful applicants do not include this information.  In addition, it is  important to revise the language in letters to applicants that are screened  out of the grant competition that implies their application was evaluated  and scored.", "Finally, HHS agrees with our recommendation to notify applicants about  the outcome of their application as soon as grant award decisions are  made.  As part of the grant application process, the agency plans to  explain to applicants that final grant decisions depend on the results of the  grant award negotiations between ACF and the prospective grantees. We  recognize that these grants are discretionary and that final award  decisions involve negotiations that may take time.  However, every effort  should be made to complete negotiations and notify both successful and  unsuccessful applicants as quickly as possible.  To enable applicants to  efficiently and effectively manage their programs, it is important for  applicants to receive their notices in a timely manner.", "HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the  report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of HHS, relevant  congressional committees, and other interested parties.
