In addition, spousal caregivers were less likely to have completed college or to be employed, and they had lower earnings than parental caregivers and the general population. Most parental and spousal caregivers provided care for several years, and certain groups were more likely to provide daily care, including women and minorities.", "Some caregivers experienced adverse effects on their jobs and had less in retirement assets and income.", "According to data from a 2015 caregiving-specific study, an estimated 68 percent of working parental and spousal caregivers experienced job impacts, such as going to work late, leaving early, or taking time off during the day to provide care. Spousal caregivers were more likely to experience job impacts than parental caregivers (81 percent compared to 65 percent, respectively).", "According to 2002 to 2014 data from the Health and Retirement Study, spousal caregivers ages 59 to 66 had lower levels of retirement assets and less income than married non-caregivers of the same ages. Specifically, spousal caregivers had an estimated 50 percent less in individual retirement account (IRA) assets, 39 percent less in non-IRA assets, and 11 percent less in Social Security income. However, caregiving may not be the cause of these results as there are challenges to isolating the effect of caregiving from other factors that could affect retirement assets and income.", "Expert interviews and a review of relevant literature identified a number of actions that could improve caregivers' retirement security, which GAO grouped into four policy categories. Experts identified various benefits to caregivers and others from the policy categories\u2014as well as pointing out possible significant costs, such as fiscal concerns and employer challenges\u2014and in general said that taking actions across categories would help address caregivers' needs over both the short-term and long-term (see figure). Several experts also said public awareness initiatives are critical to helping people understand the implications of caregiving on their retirement security.

As Americans age, family caregivers, such as  adult children and spouses, will play a critical role in supporting the needs  of this population. However, those who provide eldercare may face risks  to their own long-term financial security. For example, caregivers may  take time out of the workforce or reduce their work hours to provide care,  or they may stop saving for their own retirement or tap into their  retirement savings to pay for out-of-pocket caregiving expenses, such as  travel or medical expenses. These caregivers may ultimately receive less  in Social Security benefits if they reduce their workforce participation.  While men caregivers may face some of these risks, the effects of  caregiving for women are compounded by lower average lifetime  earnings and a longer life expectancy than men. As a result, women  caregivers are at an increased risk of outliving their savings.", "You asked that we provide information about parental and spousal  caregivers and to identify options that could improve their retirement  security.

The ATUS eldercare module measures the amount of  time people spend doing various activities related to eldercare.

The survey asks respondents  whether they provided unpaid care to a relative or friend 18 years or older  to help them take care of themselves, and asks whether working  caregivers experienced specific job impacts due to caregiving.", "To estimate the effect of caregiving on retirement security, we analyzed  nationally representative survey data from the Health and Retirement  Study (HRS) from 2002 through 2014. HRS is a longitudinal survey of  individuals over 50 that is conducted every 2 years. The initial cohort of  respondents was ages 51 to 61 in 1992, and these respondents have  been interviewed every 2 years since 1992. HRS has replenished the  sample of younger cohorts every 6 years since 1992; however, there are  some years of data that do not include younger respondents. Unlike the  surveys above, which use a single definition for all types of caregivers,  the definitions for parental and spousal caregivers in the HRS were  different. To identify parental caregivers, the HRS survey asks  respondents whether they spent 100 hours or more since their last  interview or in the last 2 years helping a parent or parent-in-law with basic  personal activities such as dressing, eating, or bathing, or with household  chores, errands, or transportation, among other tasks. To identify spousal  caregivers, we used the questions that ask respondents whether they  received help with activities of daily living (ADLs) or with instrumental  activities of daily living (IADLs). We determined whether parental or  spousal caregivers provided care in the 6 years leading up to ages 65 or  66 to capture the possible effect of caregiving on retirement income and  assets. To obtain information on caregivers in this time period, we started  with individuals initially interviewed at age 61 who would have provided  care starting at 59, given the biennial nature of the survey. Each cohort of  data includes individuals initially interviewed at age 61, which allowed us  to maximize the number of individuals we could include in the HRS  sample. However, as a result of this decision, our analysis did not cover  caregiving that took place prior to age 59. Specifically, using HRS data,  we examined differences between caregivers\u2019 and non-caregivers\u2019  individual retirement account (IRA) assets, non-IRA assets, defined  contribution account (e.g., 401(k)) balances, and Social Security income.

First, because caregiving is not random but is a function of an individual\u2019s  circumstances, it is difficult to isolate its effect. For example, individuals  who provide care may do so because they have jobs that are more  flexible, or because they have better family support. Second, there may  be other ways of providing care beyond an individual giving their time that  were not captured in the HRS data and therefore could not be included in  our analysis. For example, a child may provide financial assistance to a  parent rather than providing time. However, the HRS does not capture  whether financial help to parents was specifically used for caregiving  expenses. Third, common to analyses of this type, alternate measures of  certain variables may produce different estimates. For example, we  controlled for a caregiver\u2019s level of education based on data included in  the HRS; however, a measure of education that included the type of  education, such as whether the person was a trained caregiver, might  have changed our estimates.

Caregivers  may face immediate out-of-pocket expenses that could make it  difficult to set aside money for retirement or that could require them to  prematurely withdraw funds from existing retirement accounts. These  financial burdens can include, for example, travel and medical  expenses for a care recipient. AARP\u2019s study, Family Caregiving and  Out-of-Pocket Costs, estimated that family caregivers spent an  average of nearly $7,000 on caregiving costs in 2016. Caregiving  costs amounted to about 14 percent of income for white family  caregivers and 44 percent and 34 percent for Hispanic and black  caregivers, respectively.", "Caregivers may reduce their workforce participation. In addition to  foregone earnings, caregivers who reduce their workforce  participation may also lose access to employer-provided retirement  benefits, such as participating in an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan  or receiving an employer\u2019s matching contributions. About 68 percent  of working parental and spousal caregivers reported job impacts due  to caregiving responsibilities, which included reducing their workforce  participation. For those who leave the workforce, re-entry can be  challenging, and wages and retirement savings can be negatively  affected long-term.", "Caregivers may not contribute to retirement accounts. Caregivers  may face challenges contributing to retirement accounts due to  caregiving, and some working caregivers may not be eligible for  employer-sponsored retirement benefits. For example, some part-time  employees may not be eligible to participate in employer-sponsored  retirement plans, or some employees may lose access if they reduce  their workforce participation. Individual and employer-sponsored  retirement accounts serve as important supplements to Social  Security as income replacements in retirement.", "Caregivers may have lower Social Security benefits. Caregivers  may have less in Social Security benefits if they reduce their  workforce participation. Social Security benefits are calculated using  the highest 35 years of earnings. If a caregiver retires after working for  33 years, he or she would have 2 years of zero income in their benefit  calculation, which would result in lower benefits throughout retirement  compared to what their benefit would have been if they had a full 35- year earnings history. Social Security makes up a large portion of  retirement income from many older Americans, so a lower Social  Security benefit could have significant consequences for financial  security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Policy Categories Encompass Actions That Could Improve Caregivers\u2019 Retirement Security", "paragraphs": ["We identified four policy categories that could potentially address  retirement security challenges faced by caregivers.

As discussed  previously, women were more likely to provide parental and spousal care,  to work part-time, and to have lower earnings than men caregivers. In  addition, over one-third of parental caregivers and almost two-thirds of  spousal caregivers were in the bottom two income quartiles, and  caregivers in the bottom earnings quartile were more likely to provide  care daily.", "Experts also said all four categories have potential costs and challenges  (see table 3).", "Experts identified three implementation issues that would need to be  addressed regardless of the policy category.", "Determining responsibility for implementation. It is unclear who  would be responsible for implementing and funding certain actions  under each approach, according to experts. Some may require  legislative changes, steps by employers, or public-private partnerships  that integrate both sectors. The RAISE Family Caregivers Act enacted  in January 2018 requires the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) to develop a strategy, including recommendations  related to financial security and workforce issues, to support family  caregivers and to convene an advisory council to help develop the  strategy. The advisory council will include representatives from  federal agencies, employers, state and local officials, and other  groups. Between October 12, 2018 and December 3, 2018, HHS  sought nominations for individuals to serve on the advisory council.", "Defining caregiving for benefit eligibility. Experts said some  actions may require a definition of caregiving to use in determining  eligibility for benefits. Current definitions related to federal caregiving  policy vary. For example, FMLA defines a caregiver by specific  familial relationships. In contrast, the RAISE Family Caregivers Act  defines a family caregiver more broadly as an \u201cadult family member or  other individual who has a significant relationship with, and who  provides a broad range of assistance to, an individual with a chronic  or other health condition, disability, or functional limitation.\u201d", "Identifying and verifying caregivers. Experts said some actions  may require a mechanism for identifying and verifying a caregiver\u2019s  status. Experts noted that many caregivers do not identify themselves  as such, particularly those caring for a spouse, and therefore do not  claim existing benefits. In addition, certain actions may require a  decision about whether benefits extend to the primary caregiver or to  all caregivers, for example, siblings who may jointly provide care to a  parent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Said Implementing Actions across Policy Categories and Enhancing Public Awareness Would Help Address Caregivers\u2019 Needs", "paragraphs": ["Several experts we interviewed said caregivers could benefit more from a  retirement system that incorporates actions across the policy categories  so that actions can work in tandem to address caregivers\u2019 needs. For  example, if caregivers have lower out-of-pocket caregiving costs, they  might be able to contribute more to their retirement savings. If caregivers  can contribute more to their retirement savings because they have better  access to accounts, they might have to rely less on Social Security in  retirement. Some experts pointed to Hawaii\u2019s Kupuna Caregivers  Program as an example of a program with complementary goals\u2014to  alleviate out-of-pocket expenses and reduce barriers to staying fully  employed while providing care for a family member. Specifically,  according to experts, the program provides a financial benefit of $70 per  day for up to 365 days to caregivers who work at least 30 hours a week to  spend on respite care, home health care workers, meal preparation, and  transportation costs for a care recipient age 60 or older. Although the  program is in the early stages of implementation, experts said several  states already see it as a model for meeting these two goals.", "Experts also said it would be helpful to implement actions that address  the needs of caregivers in the long- and short-term and across their  lifespans. In general, experts said each of the policy categories could help  longer-term caregivers more than short-term caregivers. However, they  said certain actions to decrease caregivers\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses or to  increase workforce attachment could also help in addressing immediate  needs. For example, experts said actions such as paid time off and  flexible work schedules could help those caring for individuals with acute  conditions to attend doctor\u2019s appointments. Experts also said policies  should address the needs of caregivers with different levels of workforce  attachment. For example, one expert said there are disparate policy  impacts to consider depending on whether someone is a salaried worker,  an hourly worker, or a caregiver who does not work. Similarly, someone  who depends on other types of government assistance, such as Social  Security Disability Insurance, may also have different needs. Another  expert said the age at which caregiving takes place may impact  retirement security; people may be caring for older parents or a spouse at  a point in their careers when they are supposed to be catching up on  retirement contributions or have peak earnings, so they may not be able  to make up for lost time in terms of retirement savings.", "Finally, several experts mentioned public awareness as critical to helping  people understand the implications of caregiving on retirement security.  They stressed the importance of financial literacy and making caregivers  aware of existing and new benefits. Experts said people are not well  informed about their Social Security benefits or their options for private  retirement savings. In addition, it can be difficult to understand the long- term impacts of becoming a caregiver, and experts pointed to the need  for education about how the decision, along with those to leave the  workforce or reduce workforce participation, could affect caregivers\u2019 long- term financial security. One expert noted that education and services that  help families proactively think about their financial security and plan for  caregiving needs could be useful.

First, we identified individuals at age 65 or 66 who  had living parents or parents-in law.

Therefore,  we did not want to compare caregivers to those who did not provide care  because their parents were deceased. We then identified the  respondents that provided parental care in the current wave or in the prior  two waves of data. To determine who is a parental caregiver, the HRS  asks respondents two separate questions. The first asks whether a  respondent spent a total of 100 hours or more since their last interview or  in the last 2 years helping a parent or parent-in-law with basic personal  activities like dressing, eating, or bathing. The second question asks  whether a respondent spent a total of 100 hours or more since their last  interview or in the last 2 years helping a parent or parent-in-law with other  things, such as household chores, errands, or transportation.
