In order to gain access to such information, state and local law enforcement officials generally need federal security clearances. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) grants security clearances and shares classified information with state and local law enforcement officials. Immediately following September 11, 2001, some state and local law enforcement officials expressed frustration with the complexity of the process for obtaining security clearances.

These frustrations exacerbated the general concern among law enforcement stakeholders that the lack of security clearances could impede the flow of critical information from the FBI to the state and local level, from the state and local level to the FBI, and laterally from one state or local agency to another. In turn, this potential lack of access to critical terrorism-related information might place local law enforcement officials at a disadvantage in their efforts to respond to or combat a terrorist threat. The Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary asked us to examine several issues regarding the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state and local law enforcement officials. This report provides information on: (1) the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state and local law enforcement officials, (2) the extent to which the FBI has met its time frame goals for processing security clearance applications for state and local law enforcement officials and factors that could affect the timely processing of security clearance applications, and (3) efforts undertaken by the FBI to enhance its security clearance and information-sharing processes with state and local law enforcement officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The FBI's process for granting access to classified information requires state and local law enforcement officials to undergo the same background investigation and adjudication procedures as do individuals who have an employment relationship with the federal government and require access to classified national security information. The FBI's goal is to complete the processing for secret security clearances within 45 to 60 days and top secret security clearances within 6 to 9 months, beginning with the FBI headquarters' receipt of the application from the FBI field office. Since September 11, about 92 percent of applications for top secret security clearances were processed within the FBI's time frame goals. During this same period, about 26 percent of secret security clearance applications were processed within the FBI's time frame goals, although substantial improvements have been made in the most recent quarters for which we have data. The FBI was more successful with processing top secret security clearances within its stated time frame goals than secret security clearances, in part because the FBI often assigns greater priority to processing applications for state and local Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) members, who are required to have top secret clearances. For either secret or top secret security clearance applications, processing timeframes can vary depending on the complexity of individual cases. The FBI has taken a number of steps to enhance its process for granting security clearances to, and sharing information with, state and local law enforcement officials. One of the impediments highlighted was the state and local officials' and the FBI field office staff's lack of a clear understanding of the FBI's security clearance granting process. In response to this impediment, the FBI headquarters widely distributed step-by- step guidance to state and local law enforcement officials and reeducated the FBI field staff on the FBI security clearance process and goals. In addition, the FBI added staff to its headquarters unit responsible for adjudicating state and local security clearance applications and created databases to track state and local security clearance applications. Efforts undertaken by the FBI to enhance information sharing with state and local officials include increasing the number of JTTFs from 35 to 84 and increasing state and local law enforcement officials' participation on these forces. Serving on JTTFs provides state and local law enforcement officials the opportunity to interact with the FBI on a daily basis. The FBI also circulates declassified intelligence through a weekly bulletin and provides threat information to state and local law enforcement officials via various database networks."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The free flow of information among federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies could prove vital to fighting the war on terrorism.

If a  security clearance is needed, it is generally needed at the secret level. A  secret security clearance may be granted to those persons who have a  \u201cneed to know\u201d national security information classified at the confidential  or secret level. Top secret security clearances are granted to those  persons who have a need to know national security information classified  up to the top secret level, and who need unescorted access to FBI  facilities. The Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) and the State and Local  Law Enforcement Executives and Elected Officials Security Clearance  (LEO) Initiative are two mechanisms the FBI uses to partner with state  and local law enforcement officials. State and local law enforcement  officials assigned to JTTFs generally work full-time with FBI investigators  in FBI facilities. They require top secret security clearances because of  their daily, ongoing need to gain access to information classified at the top  secret level, FBI workspaces, and other resources that may contain  classified information. The LEO initiative was created to brief officials  with an established need to know classified information that would or  could affect their areas of jurisdiction.

This increase in  JTTFs created more opportunities for information sharing and  participation by state and local officials, thus increasing the number of  security clearance applications submitted to the FBI by state and local  officials. After September 11, an increasing number of state and local  officials who were not assigned to JTTFs began requesting security  clearances to obtain terrorism-related information that might affect their  jurisdictions. In some cases, state and local officials assigned to JTTFs  were not able to share classified information with their state and local  superiors because the superiors lacked security clearances. In addition to  forming the JTTFs, the FBI launched the LEO initiative to focus on  granting security clearances to officials in an executive, decision-making  role who were not posted to a JTTF. According to the FBI, the launch of  this initiative also increased the number of state and local security  clearance applications.", "Presidential Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information,  dated August 1995, established federal executive branch criteria for  granting access to classified information.

Though  guidance to FBI field offices requires that these tasks be performed and  the application forwarded to headquarters within 10 days of receipt of the  security clearance application, the FBI was not able to estimate the actual  processing time for these preliminary tasks. According to the FBI, the time  required to perform the initial steps of the process varies by field office  and is dependent on the unique circumstance of each candidate. For  example, state and local officials who are located in a law enforcement  agency that is distant from the FBI field office may require additional time  to schedule tasks that take place at the field office.

In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11,  and with additional congressional support, the FBI expanded this number  to 66 by the end of fiscal year 2002, and to 84 JTTFs by the end of   2003. According to an FBI report on the JTTF program, the FBI anticipates  that the number of JTTFs will increase in coming years, depending on the  availability of funding. According to one FBI official, the FBI received   30 requests for additional JTTF annexes in fiscal year 2003 and was able to  grant 18 of these.", "As of fiscal year 2003, more than 800 state and local officials served full- time on these forces, along with FBI and other federal government  officials.

FBI field office  executives work with their state and local law enforcement counterparts  to make JTTF assignments according to staff and other resource  availability.", "In addition, the FBI also established the National Joint Terrorism Task  Force (National JTTF) in July 2002, to coordinate the FBI\u2019s local JTTFs.

On a  weekly basis, the FBI distributes Intelligence Bulletins, which are tailored  specifically for state and local officials. According to a DOJ inspector  general\u2019s report, the intent of sending these bulletins is to raise general  awareness of terrorism-related issues, though some information may help  state and local officials detect or uncover criminal activity related to  international terrorism. The FBI also distributes Quarterly Terrorist Threat  Assessments to state and local officials. These reports provide a general  overview of the terrorist threat and provide summaries of events in  different regions in the world that might have an impact on this threat.", "In addition to distributing these bulletins, the FBI grants state and local  officials access to various unclassified networks and databases. State and  local officials generally make use of the Law Enforcement Online database  and network, as well as the National Law Enforcement  Telecommunications System, over which the FBI sends e-mail messages.  The FBI also posts names from its Terrorist Watch List on the National  Crime Information Center database and state and local law enforcement  personnel can access the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System.
