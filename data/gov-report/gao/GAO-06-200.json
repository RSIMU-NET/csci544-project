To this end, the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security provide ships and aircraft to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs, primarily cocaine, shipped from South America through the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean--an area known as the transit zone. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) oversees the U.S. anti-drug strategy. The Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-South) directs most transit zone operations. We examined U.S. efforts to interdict maritime movements of cocaine. We analyzed the (1) changes in cocaine seizures and disruptions since calendar year 2000, (2) trends in interdiction assets provided since fiscal year 2000, (3) challenges to maintaining transit zone interdiction operations, and (4) performance measures the agencies use to assess their progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Cocaine seizures and disruptions in the transit zone have increased about 68 percent since calendar year 2000--from 117 metric tons in 2000 to 196 metric tons in 2004. About two-thirds of the disruptions were in the western Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean where the United States has most of its interdiction assets. JIATF-South and other cognizant officials attribute the increase to improved interagency cooperation and intelligence, the introduction of armed helicopters to stop go-fast boats, and increased cooperation from nations in the region. Since fiscal year 2000, the availability of assets--ships and aircraft--to disrupt drug trafficking in the transit zone have varied. On-station ship days peaked in fiscal year 2001 and flight hours peaked in 2002, but both have generally declined since then, primarily because the Department of Defense has provided fewer assets. Declines in Defense assets have been largely offset by the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and certain allied nations. Nevertheless, in recent years, JIATF-South has detected less than one-third of the \"known and actionable\" maritime illicit drug movements in the western Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. Yet, once detected, over 80 percent of the drug movements were disrupted. Various factors pose challenges to maintaining the current level of transit zone interdiction operations. The reduced availability of the U.S. Navy's P-3 maritime patrol aircraft due to structural problems will degrade the U.S. capability to detect suspect maritime movements, readiness rates of older Coast Guard ships have declined since fiscal year 2000, and the surface radar system on the Coast Guard's long-range surveillance aircraft is often inoperable. Coast Guard and CBP officials also noted that they may not be able to sustain their level of assets in light of budget constraints and other homeland security priorities that may arise. These officials expressed concern that the long-term implications of likely declines in transit zone assets have not been addressed. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to develop performance measures to assess progress in achieving their goals. The Coast Guard's measures relate to reducing cocaine flow through the transit zone, CBP's planned measures are not specific to the transit zone, and Defense's planned measures focus on the number of disruptions of cocaine movements. But data that would help in assessing transit zone interdiction operations are problematic. For instance, in its assessment for 2004, ONDCP reported that between 325 metric tons and 675 metric tons of cocaine may be moving towards the United States. Such a wide range is not useful for assessing transit zone interdiction operations. In addition, data on U.S. drug usage are difficult to obtain and often cannot be generalized to the United States. In a 2001 report for ONDCP, the National Research Council made similar observations and recommended ways to improve the collection and analysis of illicit drug data, but ONDCP has not fully addressed them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 2002 U.S. National Drug Control Strategy set two goals: (1) to lower the  rate of illicit drug use by 10 percent over 2 years among both youth and  adults and (2) to lower the rate by 25 percent over 5 years in the United  States. One of the strategy\u2019s three priorities for achieving these goals is to  disrupt the illicit drug market in order to reduce the profitability of the drug  trade. To this end, during fiscal years 2000-2005, the United States has  provided more than $6 billion to Colombia and other countries in the  region for counternarcotics, alternative development, and judicial reform  efforts.

Further, a 2004 survey on  drug use estimated that the number of cocaine users in the United States  had remained roughly constant at about 2 million users from 2002 to 2004.

Furthermore, we focused on maritime movements of cocaine  through the western Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean because  the United States has positioned most of its interdiction assets in these  areas. We reviewed relevant planning and resource documents and related  reports.

Through comparisons with similar data compiled by  the Coast Guard, CBP, and Defense, and discussions with JIATF-South and  JIATF-West officials primarily responsible for compiling the data, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report.

One part of the  strategy to disrupt the market focuses U.S. interdiction efforts on seizing  cocaine and other illicit drugs bound for the United States from South  America in the transit zone. The transit zone is a six million square mile  area that encompasses Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, the  Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean (see fig. 1). Typically, drug  traffickers use go-fast boats and fishing vessels to smuggle cocaine from  Colombia to Central America and Mexico en route to the United States. Go- fast boats are capable of traveling over 40 knots and are difficult to detect  in open water. Moreover, the go-fast boats often travel at night. When they  travel in daylight, the boats are often painted blue, or the crew can cover  the boat with a blue tarpaulin, thereby becoming virtually impossible to  see. Even when detected, go-fast boats can often outrun conventional ships  deployed in the transit zone.", "The primary departments supporting interdiction operations in the transit  zone are Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security.
