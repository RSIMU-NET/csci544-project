To do this work, GAO reviewed data and documents related to OSI efforts and goals and interviewed VHA officials. In addition, GAO reviewed a random, nongeneralizable selection of medical records for 103 veterans who were prescribed opioids at five selected VHA medical facilities from March 2016 through March 2017. GAO selected the facilities to obtain diversity in geography and rates of opioid prescribing. At the selected facilities, GAO reviewed facility data and documents related to opioid safety and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has made progress improving opioid safety through its Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI). Launched in 2013, the OSI aims to help ensure that veterans are prescribed opioids in a safe and effective manner. Since the OSI began, VHA has seen reductions in opioid prescribing rates. For example, from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the percentage of patients dispensed an opioid decreased from about 17 percent to about 10 percent, or by about 267,000 veterans. Also, available evidence suggests VHA has accomplished six of nine OSI goals established in 2014; however, it is unclear whether the remaining three goals have been fully met. For example, in the case of OSI goal four (establishing safe and effective regional tapering programs for patients on opioids and benzodiazepines), GAO found that VHA lacked documentation that its regional networks established these programs. VHA also did not establish measures of safety or effectiveness under this goal. These limitations prevent VHA from fully evaluating progress and accurately determining the extent to which its efforts to help ensure safe and effective prescribing of opioids have been successful.", "In a review of a nongeneralizable sample of 103 veterans' medical records at five selected VHA medical facilities, GAO found that VHA providers did not always adhere to key opioid risk mitigation strategies, which are required by VHA policy or relevant to OSI goals. For example, among 53 veterans who were prescribed long-term opioid therapy (defined as a 90-day supply in the last 6 months), GAO found that", "40 veterans did not have their names queried in a state-run prescription drug monitoring program database. The databases are used to identify patients who are receiving multiple prescriptions that may place them at greater risk for misusing opioids or overdosing;", "21 veterans did not have a urine drug screening within the year prior to having their prescription filled. The screenings are used to determine whether veterans are taking their opioid medications as prescribed; and", "12 veterans did not provide written informed consent. Informed consent is a formal acknowledgement that the veteran has been educated on the risks and benefits of opioid use prior to initiating long-term opioid therapy.", "GAO found several factors that may have contributed to inconsistent adherence to key opioid risk mitigation strategies at the selected VHA facilities. For example, four of the five selected facilities did not have a pain champion (a primary care position required by VHA that can help providers adhere to opioid risk mitigation strategies), and not all facilities had access to academic detailing, a program in which trained clinical pharmacists work one-on-one with providers to better inform them about evidence-based care related to the appropriate treatment of relevant medical conditions. In addition, three of the five facilities did not consistently review veterans' medical records to ensure provider adherence to these strategies. To the extent that these factors affect all VHA facilities, VHA will continue to face challenges ensuring that its providers prescribe opioids in a safe and effective manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to VHA, including that it document actions and develop measurable outcomes related to its OSI goals, ensure that providers are adhering to opioid risk mitigation strategies, and ensure that all its regional networks have implemented academic detailing programs and that all VHA medical facilities have a designated primary care pain champion, as required.

According to the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019  (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA), veterans are twice as likely to  die from an accidental overdose when compared to the non-veteran  population.", "VHA has found that in its primary care settings, more than 50 percent of  male veterans report having chronic pain, and the incidence among  female veterans may be higher. To help ensure that veterans are  prescribed and use opioid pain medications in a safe and effective  manner, VHA launched its national Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) in 2013.  In 2014, VHA established a number of goals and requirements under the  OSI aimed at improving the safety and care of veterans who are  prescribed opioids for pain. In addition, in 2017, VA, along with the  Department of Defense (DOD), updated its clinical practice guidelines  related to opioid therapy for chronic pain to increase providers\u2019  awareness of evidence-based pain management practices.", "The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016  requires VA to implement a number of efforts aimed at improving opioid  safety for veterans. CARA also includes a provision for GAO to assess  VHA\u2019s recent efforts under the OSI as well as the opioid prescribing  practices of VHA health care providers. In addition, a Senate Report  accompanying H.R. 2029, enacted as the 2016 Consolidated  Appropriations Act, included a provision for GAO to review the  effectiveness of the OSI and overall opioid prescribing patterns  throughout VHA. In this report, we  1.  describe key efforts VHA has undertaken since 2013 as a part of the  2.  examine the extent to which VHA has met its OSI goals established in  2014 and implemented certain provisions of CARA related to  monitoring veterans who are prescribed opioids; and  3.  examine the extent to which VHA providers adhere to selected opioid  risk mitigation strategies and clinical practice guideline  recommendations related to prescribing opioids.", "To describe key efforts VHA has undertaken since 2013 as a part of the  OSI, we reviewed VHA documents and interviewed VHA Central Office  officials regarding OSI efforts, including VHA efforts to monitor and  address opioid prescribing patterns. We also analyzed data VHA collects  under the OSI on four metrics related to rates of opioid prescribing and  urine drug screening among certain veterans from the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 2013 (roughly when the national OSI began at VHA) to the first  quarter of fiscal year 2018, the most current quarter of data available at  the time of our review. We also analyzed VHA data from its academic  detailing programs on the frequency with which program representatives  consulted with VHA providers on issues related to opioid safety. We  assessed the reliability of the data sources by reviewing relevant  documentation, interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and  reviewing the data for missing values and outliers. Through these steps,  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this reporting objective.", "To examine VHA\u2019s progress on its 2014 OSI goals, we reviewed VHA  documents and data relevant to OSI goals, including VHA opioid safety  training data and OSI metric data. We also interviewed VHA Central  Office officials, selected Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN)  officials, and VHA medical facility officials from 5 of 170 VHA medical  facilities that we selected for our review. We selected the 5 VHA medical  facilities based on variation in geography and to reflect the full range of  variation in the rate of change over time in the percentage of veterans  who have been prescribed an opioid. Our findings from the selected  facilities are not generalizable to all VHA medical facilities. We examined  VHA\u2019s progress on its OSI goals in the context of federal internal control  standards for documentation requirements and the establishment and  review of performance measures and indicators. We assessed the  reliability of the data sources by reviewing relevant documentation,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and reviewing the data for  missing values and outliers. Through these steps, for the purposes of this  reporting objective, we determined that the VISN-level opioid safety  training assignment data were not reliable; however, all other data  sources we analyzed were sufficiently reliable. To assess whether VHA is  meeting certain provisions of CARA related to monitoring veterans who are prescribed opioids, we interviewed VHA Central Office officials and  reviewed documents related to these provisions.", "To examine the extent to which VHA providers adhere to selected opioid  risk mitigation strategies and clinical practice guideline recommendations  related to prescription opioid therapy, we focused on three key VHA  opioid risk mitigation strategies and three VA/DOD clinical practice  guideline recommendations\u2014all of which, generally speaking, are strong  evidence-based strategies for reducing the potential health risks  associated with opioid use. The three opioid risk mitigation strategies  are the following: an annual urine drug screening for patients on long-term opioid  therapy (defined by VHA as having had a 90-day supply in the last 6  months; increasing these screenings is an explicit goal of the OSI; a VHA-required annual query of a prescription database maintained  by a state prescription drug monitoring program when prescribing  controlled substances, including opioids, to check for whether patients  are receiving multiple prescriptions; and obtaining written informed consent from patients on the use of opioids  so that they have an informed understanding of the medications\u2019 risks  and benefits, as required by VHA policy.", "The three clinical practice guideline recommendations are the following:  the use of non-pharmacological treatments (such as cognitive  behavioral therapy and yoga) in addition to or in lieu of opioid therapy;  the prescribing of naloxone to help reverse opioid overdoses; and appropriate follow-up visits with a provider after an opioid is  prescribed and after an opioid prescription is changed.", "To assess adherence to these opioid risk mitigation strategies and  guideline recommendations, we reviewed a random, nongeneralizable  sample of medical records for 103 veterans who had received long-term  opioid therapy between March 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017. The 103  records we reviewed included a minimum of 20 records each from our  five selected facilities. The sample of records also included records for 50  veterans at a greater risk of adverse events due to opioid use, including  25 veterans who received benzodiazepines concurrently with an opioid  and another 25 veterans who were categorized as \u201cvery high\u201d risk in  VHA\u2019s opioid safety monitoring tool, the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk  Mitigation (STORM), during the summer and fall of 2017 when the  medical record review was conducted.

VHA established nine OSI goals in a December 2014  memorandum. For each of the goals, VHA directed its VISNs and their  associated VHA medical facilities to take specified actions to meet the  goals. (See table 1.)", "VHA has also developed opioid risk mitigation strategies for its providers  to follow when prescribing opioid pain medications to veterans. These key  strategies include one whose increased use is an explicit goal for the OSI  and two that are requirements in VHA policy.  1.  Annual urine drug screening for veterans on long-term opioid therapy.", "Providers should generally ensure that a urine drug screening has  been conducted for veterans who are on long-term opioid therapy at  least once in the 365 days prior to initiating or renewing an opioid  prescription. Urine drug screening allows providers to monitor the  types of drugs that are in a veteran\u2019s system, including controlled and  illicit substances. Increasing the use of urine drug screening is OSI  goal two.  2.  Annual prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) query. PDMPs  are state-run electronic databases used to track the prescribing and  dispensing of prescriptions for controlled substances, identify  suspected misuse or diversion (i.e., channeling drugs into illegal use),  and identify trends in drug utilization. In 2016, VHA began requiring in  policy that providers query state PDMPs at least once annually when  prescribing opioids to determine whether their patients have received  prescriptions for opioid medications or other controlled substances  from non-VA providers.  3.  Informed consent for long-term opioid therapy. In 2014, VHA began  requiring in policy that providers educate their patients on the risks  associated with the use of prescription opioids and to obtain veterans\u2019  formal acknowledgment of these risks in writing prior to initiating long- term opioid therapy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Chronic Pain", "paragraphs": ["In 2010, in coordination with DOD, VA developed clinical practice  guidelines for its providers to use when prescribing opioids for chronic  pain. These guidelines were updated in 2017. While clinical practice  guidelines contain evidence-based recommendations, they are not  required to be followed in all clinical situations; therefore, variations in  practice may occur based on individual patient needs subject to the  discretion of the provider.", "The 2017 VA/DOD clinical practice guidelines related to opioid therapy for  chronic pain generally complement VHA\u2019s OSI goals. For example, the  guidelines recommend a conservative use of opioids for chronic pain and  emphasize strategies to mitigate the risk of using opioids. The evidence- based clinical practice guideline recommendations include the following:  1.  Use of non-pharmacological treatments. The guidelines advise not  initiating opioid therapy for chronic pain. They also recommend  alternatives to opioid therapy, such as non-opioid medications and  non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological treatments for  chronic pain include, for example, cognitive behavioral therapy and  yoga.  2.  Naloxone prescribing. Naloxone is a highly effective, potentially life- saving intervention for reversing opioid overdoses, and it can be  prescribed to veterans as a preventive measure. Veterans who are  prescribed naloxone can use it when experiencing an overdose or a  family member can administer it on their behalf. According to the  clinical practice guidelines, naloxone should be offered as an antidote  to all patients at risk for an opioid overdose, including those who are  in the process of tapering from opioids. The guidelines describe  several significant risk factors which can indicate the prescribing of  naloxone, including the duration and dose of opioids, current or  history of depression or substance use disorder, and suicidality.  3.  Appropriate follow-up visits with a provider. According to the  guidelines, follow-up pain management visits should be scheduled at  least every 1-4 weeks after any change in medication regimen and at  least once every 1-3 months for the duration of the therapy to help  ensure that the treatment plan is optimized."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Under Its OSI, VHA Tracks Opioid Prescribing Patterns, Identifies Prescribing Outliers, and Educates Prescribers", "paragraphs": ["VHA officials told us that the main focus of the OSI is changing the  prescribing patterns of providers to better align with evidence-based  practices. We found that this has been carried out by VHA through three  key efforts: tracking opioid prescribing rates and other trends, identifying  irregular prescribing patterns, and educating providers on best practices  through academic detailing.", "Tracking Opioid Prescribing Patterns. Under the OSI, VHA uses quarterly  data derived from VHA\u2019s electronic medical record system to monitor  prescription opioid use among veterans, the related prescribing patterns  of VHA providers, and the rates of urine drug screening for veterans  receiving long-term opioid therapy. Specifically, VHA tracks the  following four clinical indicators, known as the OSI metrics, for each of its  medical facilities:  1.  the percentage of patients dispensed an opioid,  2.  the percentage of patients dispensed an opioid and a benzodiazepine,  3.  the percentage of patients on long-term opioid therapy who received a  urine drug screen within the previous year of having their prescription  filled, and  4.  the percentage of patients dispensed greater than or equal to 100  morphine milligram equivalents per day.", "Our analysis of quarterly OSI metric data shows that since the beginning  of the OSI in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 to the first quarter of  fiscal year 2018 (the most recent data available at the time of our review),  the percentage of veterans dispensed an opioid has decreased by 7  percentage points, or roughly 267,000 veterans, while the rate of urine  drug screening for veterans on long-term opioid therapy increased  significantly\u2014by over 47 percentage points. The increase in the  percentage of patients receiving a urine drug screening was driven more  by a reduction in the total number of patients on long-term opioid therapy  (about 197,000 veterans) than an increase in the number of patients  receiving the screening (about 27,000 veterans). (See table 2.)", "Identifying Irregular Prescribing Patterns. As part of its monitoring of the  OSI metrics, VHA Central Office has periodically identified VHA medical  facilities and VHA providers who deviate from average prescribing rates  across VHA. For example:", "Facilities. In 2014, VHA Central Office identified 39 of 140 medical  facilities across 12 VISNs with relatively higher rates of opioid  dispensing as outliers based on the OSI metric percentage of  veterans dispensed an opioid. VHA Central Office notified the VISNs  of these facilities and required each facility to submit a corrective  action plan to VHA Central Office outlining the actions they would take  to reduce opioid prescribing. Based on our analysis of VHA  documents, we found that the identified facilities in the five VISNs  selected for our review submitted information in response to VHA  Central Office\u2019s request.", "Providers. In February 2017, VHA Central Office identified 320  outliers out of 8,351 providers at 94 VHA medical facilities based on  the relatively high proportion of their patients who were prescribed  opioids. VHA Central Office directed the VHA medical facilities  associated with these outlier providers to review their prescribing  rates in the context of their clinical practice, and to report back with  any feedback given or actions taken. According to officials from the  five facilities in our review, outlier providers tended to be surgeons,  pain management specialists, or physical rehabilitation providers who  might be expected to prescribe opioids at a higher-than-average rate  due to the nature of their specialty and the types of patients they treat.  According to a VHA Central Office progress report, the facilities  provided feedback and follow-up actions for 319 out of 320 outlier  providers. In May 2017, VHA identified a second round of 303  outliers out of 8,505 providers; 187 of these providers were previously  identified as outliers in February 2017. According to one VHA  Central Office official, as of September 2017, VHA was reviewing  these outlier data and will evaluate whether VHA facilities will be  asked to conduct further reviews of these prescribers.", "Educating Providers through Academic Detailing. To help change the  prescribing patterns of providers, VHA has also implemented a system- wide academic detailing program to educate providers and improve the  delivery of evidence-based health care at facilities. In 2015, VHA required  each VISN to establish such a program to improve performance on all  OSI metrics. According to VHA Central Office officials, academic  detailers are responsible for reviewing facility-level data on the  prescribing patterns of providers and identifying potential areas of  improvement. Detailers can educate providers with higher-than-average  prescribing rates\u2014such as those outliers identified in February and May  2017 by VHA Central Office\u2014to help ensure providers are delivering safe  and effective care for pain.", "According to VHA, as of January 2018, academic detailers have  conducted over 20,000 opioid-related visits to VHA providers. According  to VHA officials, their data also show that academic detailing results in  greater patient safety for veterans taking opioids. For example, compared with those who did not receive academic detailing visits, providers who  did receive such visits experienced (1) greater reductions in the  proportion of their patients on high-dose opioids, (2) reductions in their  patients\u2019 average morphine milligram equivalent daily dosage, and (3)  increases in their naloxone prescribing rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Made Progress on OSI Goals, but Performance Measurement Limitations Exist for Some Goals and Certain CARA Provisions Have Not Been Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VHA Has Made Progress on Many 2014 OSI Goals, but for Some Goals, Performance Measurement Limitations Prevent an Accurate Determination of their Completion", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis of VHA information, we found evidence suggesting  that the agency has accomplished six of the nine 2014 OSI goals.

For several goals, although VHA did not implement the  actions required in all those instances, the agency provided us with  information or data demonstrating that the goals had effectively been met.  However, for three OSI goals, it is unclear if the goal has been fully met  because VHA lacks documentation showing that it has implemented the  required action under the goal or the required action is still in progress.

This lack of documentation is inconsistent with  federal internal control standards. Specifically, according to federal  internal control standards, management should evaluate and document  the results of monitoring. By not documenting the actions it is taking  under each of its OSI goals, VHA lacks assurance that these actions have  been implemented by the VISNs or VHA medical facilities. As a result,  VHA does not know whether it has fully met these OSI goals.", "Moreover, for the OSI goal related to establishing safe and effective VISN  tapering programs for veterans using opioids and benzodiazepines (goal  four), VHA officials told us that they addressed this goal by issuing  national tapering guidance, including a provider reference guide in 2014,  an opioid taper decision tool in 2016, and the VA/DOD clinical practice  guidelines in 2017. However, these actions do not appear to be sufficient  for meeting the goal as it is currently written, because issuing national  guidance alone does not ensure that safe and effective tapering programs  are established. Furthermore, VHA did not specify how safety and  effectiveness within a tapering program would be measured, nor did the  agency specify a deadline for the required action as described in  December 2014. According to federal internal control standards relating  to the establishment and review of performance measures and indicators,  government agencies should use appropriate information to adequately  assess performance, including establishing milestones or numerical  targets, as appropriate.

First, CARA requires that  VHA\u2019s Opioid Therapy Risk Report (OTRR) have the ability to determine  whether a provider has prescribed opioids to a veteran without checking  that veteran\u2019s information in the OTRR. Available to providers through  VHA\u2019s electronic medical record system, OTRR is a clinical tool that  provides information on any opioid and concurrent benzodiazepine  prescriptions a veteran is receiving, the veteran\u2019s current and prior health  conditions, recent and upcoming appointments, and whether any opioid  risk mitigation strategies have been employed (such as urine drug  screening or PDMP query). However, we found that VHA Central Office  cannot track the extent to which VHA providers use OTRR because this  tool does not have this tracking capability. VHA officials said that adding  tracking capabilities to OTRR is not a high priority for the agency due to  limited resources and competing priorities. Instead, according to a draft  memorandum, VHA Central Office is planning to address this CARA  provision by requiring VHA providers to document the use of OTRR in a  standardized way that VHA can monitor. However, as of March 2018,  VHA has not established this requirement or outlined the process for  monitoring providers\u2019 use of OTRR. Without the ability to track the use of  OTRR, VHA cannot sufficiently monitor whether providers are using the  tool to help reduce the likelihood of opioid-related adverse events  occurring among veterans receiving care through VHA.", "CARA also requires that VHA modify its electronic medical record system  so that any provider who accesses the record of a veteran will be notified  whether that veteran is receiving opioid therapy and has a history of  substance abuse disorder or prior instances of overdose; has a history of  opioid abuse; or is at risk of developing an opioid use disorder. However,  we found that VHA does not plan to modify its electronic medical record  system to implement this capability. When asked about this provision in  CARA, VHA officials said that VHA\u2019s medical record currently has real- time alerts to inform providers about veterans\u2019 existing opioid  prescriptions and that any patient exposed to an opioid could be at risk of  developing an opioid use disorder.

Officials at four of the five selected medical  facilities faced PDMP access issues. Officials at two facilities told us that  not all facility staff can access state PDMPs due to state laws and  regulations that do not allow access to all types of providers, such as  nurses and pharmacists. Officials at one of these selected facilities  explained that nurse practitioners in that state cannot access the state\u2019s  PDMP, so they must rely on other providers to obtain information from the  PDMP about their patients. In addition, in some states, only providers  licensed in the state may access the state\u2019s PDMP. Because providers at  VHA facilities may not be licensed in the state where the VHA facility is  located but licensed in another state, these providers may be unable to  access the state\u2019s PDMP. Officials at two selected facilities also  described difficulties accessing PDMPs in neighboring states that are part  of the catchment area for the facility and where the veteran may reside.  The low rates of adherence we identified may also be attributed to the  fact that VHA did not require providers to query the PDMP until October  2016, 7 months into our review of patients from March 2016 to March  2017.", "CARA directed VA to ensure access by VHA providers to information on  controlled substances prescribing through state PDMPs, including by  seeking to enter into memoranda of understanding with states to allow  shared access of such information between states and the VA. According  to VHA officials, VHA Central Office has not taken steps to develop  memoranda of understanding with states, nor has it developed any  related guidance.

Another factor that may limit  adherence to the opioid risk mitigation strategies is the fact that none of  the selected facilities employ electronic reminders to help remind primary  care nurses of strategies that have not been completed. Primary care  nurses are typically responsible for ensuring adherence to these  strategies, and VHA facilities often employ electronic alerts to notify  providers when certain tasks need to be completed, such as regular  screenings for depression and traumatic brain injury. Although VHA  facilities are not required to develop these alerts, according to some  primary care nurses we interviewed, it would be helpful to receive a  reminder when a veteran is due for a PDMP query, urine drug screening,  or has not given long-term opioid use informed consent. According to the  nurses, such an alert could be issued through the electronic medical  record system.", "Limited facility monitoring. We found that facilities\u2019 monitoring of provider  adherence to the opioid risk mitigation strategies was limited across the  five selected facilities in our review, which could hinder identification of  non-adherence to these strategies. Specifically, while we found that all  five medical facilities and VISNs in our review have an active pain  management committee, facility officials told us that three of five facility  committees do not conduct regular medical record reviews, which VHA  encourages under its pain management directive to improve pain  management. The directive states that facility pain management  committees should monitor the pain management practices at their  facility. For example, the pain management committee could monitor  providers\u2019 care plans for individual veterans, which are to be documented  in the veterans\u2019 medical records.
