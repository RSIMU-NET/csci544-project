Further, according to officials, draft measures for the COE  functions have also been developed; however, they have not yet been  documented and officials did not have any time frames for doing so.  Without fully defining and documenting measures of success, it is unlikely  that the department will be able to determine if it has successfully and  efficiently established its new IT governance framework.", "DHS officials stated that they are using lessons learned from their piloting  activities to improve their governance process; however, they have not  established a mechanism for capturing lessons learned.

To the department\u2019s credit, the vision is  generally consistent with guidance and with best practices for managing  projects and portfolios. However, we identified two practices which were  only partially addressed in policies and procedures\u2014ensuring that the  IRB maintains visibility into the activities of the ESCs, and defining project  selection and prioritization criteria\u2014which could limit the extent to which  these practices are institutionalized. In addition, the policies and  procedures have not yet been finalized. To its credit, DHS has efforts  underway to address this. However, until DHS finalizes these policies and  procedures and ensures that they fully address practices for managing  programs and portfolios of investments, the department will have less  assurance that its new approach will address identified weaknesses and  facilitate effective governance.", "DHS has implemented aspects of its new approach, such as establishing  governance entities associated with the execution phase of its approach  and conducting portfolio and program reviews. However, because the  agency has not developed an implementation plan, fully documented  performance measures, or established a mechanism for capturing  lessons learned, there is a risk that the approach may be less effective  than intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To implement an effective IT governance strategy, we recommend that  the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the appropriate officials to  finish defining the new IT governance process by  finalizing the IT governance policies and procedures and ensuring  they fully address or reference existing documents that address the  following: how the IRB is to maintain responsibility for lower-level board  activities; and investment selection and prioritization criteria.", "In addition, to assist in implementing the new IT governance strategy, we  recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the  appropriate officials to develop an implementation plan that draws together ongoing and  additional efforts needed to implement the new IT governance  process. The plan should: 1.  build on existing strengths and weaknesses;  2.  specify measurable goals, objectives, and milestones;  3.  specify needed resources;  4.  assign clear responsibility and accountability for accomplishing  5.  be approved by senior-level management.  fully define and document key measures to monitor the  implementation process; and establish mechanisms for capturing lessons learned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s Director for the Departmental GAO-OIG Liaison Office provided  written comments on a draft of this report (reprinted in appendix II).

This documentation  included the Under Secretary for Management\u2019s Program Management &  Execution Playbook, the December 2011 biannual update to the  Implementation and Transformation section of DHS\u2019s Integrated Strategy  for High Risk Management, the Office of the Chief Information Officer\u2019s  Concept of Operations documents for Program and Portfolio Governance,  and Chief Information Officer quarterly update briefings presented to  GAO. We also reviewed various memorandums from the Under Secretary  for Management, which covered such issues as the chartering of  Executive Steering Committees and the implementation of the  department\u2019s Decision Support Tool. We also interviewed officials from  DHS\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer\u2019s Enterprise Business  Management Office (EBMO), and from the Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management (PARM). To assess DHS\u2019s vision of  its planned governance process against GAO\u2019s Information Technology  Investment Management (ITIM) guide, we identified the ITIM stage 2 and  stage 3 critical process areas that were most relevant to DHS\u2019s efforts,  and compared the evidence collected from our document reviews and  interviews to the practices associated with these areas.", "To address our second objective, we obtained and evaluated  documentation showing the department\u2019s efforts in implementing the  governance process. This included documentation defining the roles of  various governance entities, such as the Executive Steering Committees  and Portfolio Governance Boards, to be involved in the process. We  reviewed available charters and meeting minutes for several of these  entities to determine if they were functioning. We also reviewed  documentation on the Centers of Excellence established by DHS to  provide subject matter expertise to support program management. In  addition, we interviewed officials from EBMO and PARM to determine the  status of the department\u2019s effort\u2019s in implementing the governance  process. We also requested information from the five programs for which  Executive Steering Committees were first established on the various  reviews they had undergone since January 2010\u2014including type of  review, time frames for each review, and information requested\u2014to  determine the extent of duplication or overlap among the reviews. In order  to assess DHS\u2019s implementation of the IT governance approach against  accepted best practices, we first used content-analysis software to  identify best practices shared by industry and the federal government. We  identified these practices from prior our reports, Office of Management  and Budget guidance, and guidance from recognized experts in IT  governance. We grouped the practices into three categories\u2014(1)  organizational buy-in, (2) development of an implementation team and  implementation plan, and (3) evaluation\u2014 and determined from the  evidence collected from our document reviews and interviews the extent  to which DHS was following these best practices.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2011 to July 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
