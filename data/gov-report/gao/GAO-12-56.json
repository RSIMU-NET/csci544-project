While all involved had a clear informal understanding of who is responsible for managing the Departmental WCF, Commerce's guidance does not discuss its CFO Council--an entity with an important role related to WCF increases and changes. Census lacks a process to coordinate and consolidate information managed by disparate divisions and ensure appropriate tracking of funds. There are also opportunities for the agencies to achieve greater management efficiencies by consolidating certain WCF services. Commerce has a transparent process to ensure recovery of actual costs. However, Census' process could be more transparent. The Commerce Departmental WCF's rate setting and review processes are clearly described, coordinated, and designed to recover actual annual costs. Entities such as the Commerce CFO Council and algorithm review group help to facilitate shared understanding among fund managers, customers, and service providers. Census has a fragmented and limited description of its processes and lacks a formal process to communicate with customers. Census customers GAO spoke with had a mixed understanding about how certain WCF costs are determined, limiting their ability to make appeals and suggest improvements. Both WCFs could benefit from performance measures that assess operational effectiveness. Commerce and Census have identified performance measures related to organizational strategic goals. However, neither has established WCF operational performance measures such as responsiveness to customer inquiries and billing error rates. Moreover, both WCFs support similar management and administrative services that could potentially be consolidated. Both WCFs obtain customer input and have flexibility to adjust to customer needs, but challenges exist. In general, customers GAO interviewed said they had regular and ongoing discussions with fund managers or service providers. At Commerce, its CFO Council and WCF managers periodically assess and shift resources to address changes in customer needs and prioritize requests for services. However, the statutory cap on one bureau's payments into the WCF limits the level of services that can be provided to all Commerce bureaus. To provide services beyond the capacity of the WCF, Commerce enters into a memorandum of understanding with specific customers. The Census WCF's ability to build and maintain an operating reserve helps to provide price stability for customers throughout the decennial census cycle when the costs of management and administrative services supported through the WCF fluctuate dramatically. Similar to Commerce, Census has the flexibility to provide additional services by billing customers directly."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to improve the management of the two WCFs, including updating and consolidating WCF guidance, establishing a process to measure WCF performance, and examining opportunities to consolidate certain WCF services.

First, the Commerce Office of Executive Budgeting  (OEB) is responsible for overall management of the Commerce  Departmental WCF. Second, the algorithm review group, which includes  representatives from the fund\u2019s customer bureaus and OEB, convenes  every other year to review rate-setting formulas. At this meeting, service  providers present their billing methods and implement any changes to the  rate-setting formulas that are agreed upon within the group. Finally, the  Commerce Chief Financial Officer Council (Commerce CFO Council) is  comprised of the CFOs from each of Commerce\u2019s bureaus, giving each  customer bureau a \u201cseat at the table.\u201d This Commerce CFO Council has  an important role related to WCF increases and changes to the  algorithms used to determine charges.

As previously discussed, to identify key  principles, we reviewed governmentwide guidance on business operating  principles, internal controls, managerial cost accounting, and performance  management. In addition, we met with staff from the two WCFs and OMB  to obtain their views on the use of these principles to assess WCFs.  Commerce Departmental, Census, and OMB staff generally found the  principles to be reasonable. Moreover, we considered our past work. The  significance of these four principles is described below.  1.  Clearly Delineate Roles and Responsibilities: Appropriate delineation  of roles and responsibilities promotes a clear understanding of who  will be held accountable for specific tasks or duties such as  authorizing and reviewing transactions, implementing controls over  WCF management, and helping ensure that related responsibilities  are coordinated. In addition, this reduces the risk of mismanaged  funds and tasks or functions \u201cfalling through the cracks.\u201d Moreover, it  helps customers know who to contact in the event they have  questions. 2.  Ensure Self-Sufficiency by Recovering the Agency\u2019s Actual Costs:  Transparent and equitable pricing methodologies allow agencies to  ensure that rates charged recover agencies\u2019 actual costs and reflect  customers\u2019 service usage. If customers understand how rates are  determined or changed including the assumptions used, customers  can better anticipate potential changes to those assumptions, identify  their effect on costs, and incorporate that information into budget  plans. A management review process can help to ensure the  methodology is applied consistently over time and provides a forum to  inform customers of decisions and discuss as needed. 3.  Measure Performance: Performance goals and measures are  important management tools applicable to all levels of an agency,  including the program, project, or activity level. Performance  measures and goals could include targets that assess fund managers\u2019  responsiveness to customer inquiries, the consistency in the  application of the funds\u2019 rate-setting methodology, the reliability of  cost information, and the billing error rates. Performance measures  that are aligned with strategic goals can be used to evaluate whether,  and if so how, WCF activities are contributing to the achievement of  agency goals. A management review process comparing expected to  actual performance allows agencies to review progress towards goals  and potentially identify ways to improve performance. 4.  Build in Flexibility to Obtain Customer Input and Meet Customer  Needs: Opportunities for customers to provide input about WCF  services, or voice concerns about needs, in a timely manner enable  agencies to regularly assess whether customer needs are being met  or have changed. This also enables agencies to prioritize customer  demands and use resources most effectively, enabling them to adjust WCF capacity up or down as business rises or falls.", "By incorporating these principles in written guidance, agencies promote  consistent application of management processes and provide a baseline  for agency officials to assess and improve management processes.  Moreover, agencies can use the guidance as a training tool for new staff  and as an information tool for customers, program managers,  stakeholders, and reviewers.", "Figure 3 summarizes the four principles and their underlying components."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principle 1: Clearly Delineate Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Guidance Does Not Identify Roles and Responsibilities of All Key Personnel", "paragraphs": ["The responsibility for managing and overseeing aspects of the Commerce  Departmental and Census WCFs is segregated across a number of  offices and entities, thus minimizing the risk of error in fund management.

This has resulted in a clear  understanding among Commerce Departmental WCF managers, service  providers, and customers about the roles and responsibilities of key  personnel who manage the Commerce Departmental WCF. Customers  and service providers we interviewed said that OEB is where they go to  get answers or raise concerns. In addition, customers and service  providers said they communicate directly with each other or through OEB  about services they receive and rates charged. Service providers  expressed appreciation for OEB\u2019s role in facilitating and coordinating  regular communication between the service providers and customers. For  example:  two of the four service providers said they interact with OEB on a daily  basis, and all four service providers said that communication occurs on at least a  monthly or quarterly basis through meetings or status reports.", "However, while the Commerce Departmental WCF handbook includes  the roles and responsibilities of many key personnel and review groups  involved with fund management, it leaves out information on the cross- departmental role of the Commerce CFO Council, which is comprised of  the CFOs from each of Commerce\u2019s bureaus and has an important role  regarding increases or changes to the WCF.

Although decentralization provides  segregation of duties, Census does not have a formal process to  coordinate and consolidate information managed by these disparate  divisions to provide a corporate view of the WCF. In addition, information  about the roles and responsibilities of Census management is incomplete,  spread across three documents, and contains varying levels of detail and  clarity. For example, the Census WCF Manual lists key personnel  responsible for management of the WCF but does not describe their  duties and responsibilities or provide specific contact information. This  limits the usefulness of the guidance for bureau staff, customers, and  other stakeholders. For example, one of the Census WCF\u2019s larger  customers we interviewed was unsure who to speak with about questions  relating to service needs (e.g., the level of service to expect and the wait  times before receiving services) and suggested that the Census WCF  develop guidelines about service needs and expectations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commerce Business System Does Not Facilitate Appropriate Tracking and Use of Funds", "paragraphs": ["The Commerce Business System (CBS), which is the financial system  used throughout most of Commerce, does not provide a mechanism to  record the period of availability of appropriations advanced from  customer agencies.

If the customer does not have such funds available, they could be  exposed to possible Anti-Deficiency Act violations. Thus, to  appropriately manage the use of funds, agencies need a way to track  whether funds remain available for purposes of the interagency  agreement when it bills against the advance.", "Similar to what we found in our prior work at NIST, Census tracks  customer funds by the period of performance, which may not always  coincide with the availability of the funds. Although customer agencies  bear ultimate responsibility for proper use of their funds, we have  previously reported that the performing agency shares responsibility with  its customer agencies to ensure the proper use of federal funds when  entering into interagency agreements. Census officials can verify the  availability of advanced funds through the Treasury Account Symbol  (TAS); however, TAS is not electronically captured in CBS. Unless CBS  is updated to include a mechanism for tracking the availability of funds,  the performing agency cannot ensure that funds are legally available  when it bills against the advances.

These  rates are based on algorithms that include variables such as prior year  actual costs associated with customers\u2019 service usage. For example,  when determining rates for building maintenance, one important variable  is the square footage of the customer office space. Similarly, when  determining rates for human resource management services, the number  of full-time equivalents is an important variable. This rate-setting process,  including the method for setting and distributing charges among users, is  clearly explained in the Commerce Departmental WCF handbook.

Additionally, Census does not have a process  to facilitate coordination among key WCF personnel to ensure appropriate  tracking of funds.", "To appropriately manage the use of funds advanced from customers for  projects spanning multiple fiscal years, performing agencies need a way  to track whether funds advanced remain available to bill against. Both  Commerce and Census use the Commerce Business System (CBS) to  manage funds, but the system does not track a key element to confirm  that funds advanced in support of an interagency agreement are available  to cover the costs of performance. Modifying CBS would help ensure that  customer funds are legally available and avoid potential Anti-Deficiency  Act violations for the customer agencies. A transparent rate-setting  process helps assure that customers are being charged accurately and  fairly for services supported through the WCF. Commerce clearly explains  its rate-setting process and customers feel they have sufficient input on  the process. Census\u2019 rate-setting process is less transparent, which limits  the ability of fund managers to confirm that the WCF is self-sufficient and  makes it difficult for customers to make appeals.", "WCF managers can better foster a results-oriented environment focused  on continuous improvement by establishing performance measures and  goals for WCF operations, ensuring those performance measures and  goals align with the agency\u2019s strategic goals, and by establishing a  management review process to track WCF performance. The purpose of  the WCFs is to achieve economies of scale through shared services.  However, the lack of performance measures makes it difficult to know  whether these economies are being achieved. Moreover, WCF-specific  performance information and a corresponding management review  process could be used to hold fund managers accountable for achieving  the efficiencies that WCFs were designed to produce. Furthermore, the  two WCFs may provide services in overlapping areas, which warrants  further examination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We make seven recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce.", "To improve the management of the Commerce Departmental Working  Capital Fund, we recommend that the Secretary of Commerce take the  following actions:  1.

Establish performance measures to assess performance of WCF  operations, such as billing error rates, and determine what additional  measures would be helpful to improve WCF management. 4.

In addition, this reduces the risk  of mismanaged funds and tasks or functions  \u201cfalling through the cracks.\u201d Moreover, it helps  customers know who to contact in the event  they have questions.", "Written roles and responsibilities specify how key  duties and responsibilities are divided across multiple  individuals/offices and are subject to a process of  checks and balances.

Performance  measures and goals could include targets that  assess fund managers\u2019 responsiveness to  customer inquiries, the consistency in the  application of the funds\u2019 rate-setting  methodology, the reliability of cost information,  and the billing error rates. Performance  measures that are aligned with strategic goals  can be used to evaluate whether, and if so  how, WCF activities are contributing to the  achievement of agency goals.
