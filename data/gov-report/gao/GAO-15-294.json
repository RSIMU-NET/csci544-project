CBP officials (targeters) are generally required to hold high-risk shipments for examination unless evidence shows that an examination can be waived per CBP policy. In particular, targeters at Advance Targeting Units (targeting units)\u2014responsible for reviewing shipments arriving at ports within their respective regions\u2014can waive an examination if they determine through research that (1) the shipment falls within a predetermined category (standard exception), or (2) they can articulate why the shipment should not be considered high risk (articulable reason), such as an error in the shipment's data. GAO found that CBP examined the vast majority of high-risk shipments, but CBP's disposition data are not accurate because of various factors\u2014such as the inclusion of shipments that were never sent to the United States\u2014and that the data overstate the number of high-risk shipments.

CBP policy lacks definitions for standard exception waivers. As a result, targeters are inconsistently applying and recording standard exception waivers. Because of these inconsistencies, some targeting units may be unnecessarily holding shipments for examination, while others may be waiving shipments that should be examined. Developing definitions for standard exceptions could help ensure that CBP examines shipments as intended. Further, some targeters at targeting units GAO visited were unaware of the guidance on articulable reason waivers and were incorrectly documenting these waivers. As a result, CBP cannot accurately determine the extent to which articulable waivers are being issued and used judiciously per CBP policy. Updating and disseminating guidance in policy could help ensure targeters correctly document such waivers.", "CBP has efforts in place, such as self-inspections, to provide oversight of its policies on the disposition (whether examined or waived) of high-risk shipments; however, these efforts are not sufficient. For example, the limited sample size of shipments used in self-inspections does not provide CBP with the best estimate of compliance at the national level. In addition, CBP's method for calculating the compliance rate does not accurately reflect compliance because it is not based on the number of shipments sampled. Developing an enhanced methodology for selecting sample shipments, and changing the method for calculating compliance, could improve CBP's estimate of compliance and its ability to identify and correct deficiencies.", "This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in November 2014.

CBP issued a memorandum  in February 2007 that provides guidance on how targeters are to record  waivers in ATS based on articulable reasons. According to that guidance,  targeters are to select a specific drop-down menu option in CERTS as the  reason for every articulable reason waiver they issue and then targeters  are to provide comments in CERTS to support the justification for the  waiver. However, during our visits to the targeting units, and on the basis  of conversations we had with CBP targeters, we found that targeters\u2019  understanding of how to record waivers in CERTS within ATS varied. Our  analysis of selected waived shipments (as previously discussed in this  report) and discussions with CBP targeters indicate that some targeters  are incorrectly recording some waiver reasons in ATS because they are  not familiar with the February 2007 CBP memorandum that specifies how  articulable reason waivers are to be recorded. According to a senior CBP  official, the National Maritime Targeting Policy, which was last  disseminated prior to the implementation of CERTS, has not been  updated to address the process for recording articulable waivers in  CERTS.", "Neither we nor CBP could easily determine the full extent to which  articulable waiver reasons were recorded properly because waivers  based on articulable reasons cannot be segregated from waivers issued  for standard exceptions. The inconsistent recording of articulable reason  waivers in ATS limits CBP\u2019s ability to determine whether targeting units  are following policy, since CBP\u2019s National Maritime Targeting Policy  states that waivers based on articulable reasons are to be used  \u201cjudiciously.\u201d In order to evaluate whether targeting units are judiciously  making waiver decisions based on articulable reasons, CBP would need  accurate records in ATS regarding the basis for why shipments were  waived in order to be able to easily distinguish the two types of waivers.", "In particular, CBP is reliant on targeters\u2019 selecting the appropriate waiver  reasons from the drop-down menu selections in CERTS in order to be  able to accurately analyze waiver data. Although the comments in the  remarks section of CERTS justifying the waiver may provide further  details regarding the reasons for waivers, it would be difficult for CBP to  accurately determine waiver reasons on the basis of large-scale data  queries of comments in the remarks section alone. Therefore, it is  important for targeters to select the proper drop-down menu options when  documenting waiver reasons. According to Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government, management must continually assess and  evaluate its internal controls to ensure that the control activities being  used are effective and updated when necessary.

The Self-Inspection Program requires port directors or their  designees to analyze selected shipments and complete a worksheet  composed of three questions to check compliance with policies on  examining high-risk shipments and recording examinations. The three  worksheet questions are as follows:  1.  Were cargo examination findings input within CERTS and, when  appropriate, within other systems?  2.  Were all shipments that received an ATS score at or above the  national security threshold score placed on hold?  3.  Did all shipments that received an ATS score at or above the national  security threshold undergo a mandatory examination utilizing, at a  minimum, an NII imaging system and screening with radiation  detection technology?", "The guidance provided on how to select shipments to answer the three  questions, depending on the question, states that 10 percent of all  shipments are to be randomly selected, with a minimum of 10 shipments  and no more than 20 shipments, or 20 shipments are to be randomly  selected among high-risk shipments. After port directors or their  designees submit their completed worksheets, CBP OFO calculates the  national compliance rate by dividing the number of worksheets that have  at least 1 shipment that did not conform to policy by the total number of  self-inspection worksheets submitted to OFO.", "Given that the sample size is generally the same for all port directors  regardless of the number of shipments their ports receive, on the basis of  our analysis, the sample does not provide CBP with an efficient estimate  of compliance at the national level. For example, by allocating additional  samples to ports with more arriving shipments, the national compliance  estimate could have a reduced sampling error. Through its Self- Inspection Program, CBP has identified a minimal number of  noncompliant shipments requiring corrective action. For example, five  corrective actions were taken nationwide based on the 2011 self- inspection reporting cycle, and two corrective actions based on the 2012  cycle. CBP\u2019s compliance rate was over 93 percent for both cycles,  leading CBP to reduce the frequency of the self-inspections for maritime  cargo targeting from every year to every other year, according to CBP  OFO officials. However, as discussed previously, we determined that 3 of  40 shipments identified as waived were actually examined, but the  examinations were not properly recorded and 6 of 40 shipments identified  as not examined/not waived were examined or waived, but not properly  recorded. Thus, CBP\u2019s compliance estimates may be overstated. CBP  could improve its ability to estimate national compliance rates for maritime  cargo targeting practices through different methods. For example, CBP  could increase the number of shipments sampled by ports with the  greatest number of arriving shipments or consider a stratified sample with  strata defined in terms of size of ports and other factors that might be  related to compliance or risk, such as whether shipments appear in its  data as not examined/not waived. By enhancing its methodology for  selecting shipment samples, CBP could better identify any deficiencies  and take appropriate corrective actions. According to a Director in OFO,  CBP is considering changing the shipment sample size to a percentage of  high-risk shipments, which would result in port directors of larger ports  analyzing a greater number of shipments than the 20 shipments per  question they currently sample. However, CBP has not finalized its plans  for making this change.", "Further, CBP\u2019s method for calculating the compliance rate does not  accurately reflect compliance nationwide because it does not calculate  the rate based on the number of shipments sampled. Rather, CBP  calculates the rate based on the number of worksheets that contained  shipments for which policy was not followed regardless of whether it was  1 shipment or all shipments included in the worksheet. According to  guidance on design evaluations, the data should be analyzed in a way  that allows valid conclusions to be drawn from the evaluation. CBP  could improve its ability to estimate national compliance with maritime  cargo targeting practices by changing its compliance rate calculation to  divide the number of shipments (the unit of measure) that did not conform  to policy by the total number of shipments sampled, rather than  calculating the rate based on the number of worksheets.", "In addition to the limited nature of the self-inspections, we also found that  CBP does not fully assess the reliability of the data it analyzes on the  disposition of high-risk shipments for the quarterly reports it produces in  support of GPRA.
