At least three states restrict nontransferable tickets\u2014that is, tickets whose terms do not allow resale. Nontransferable tickets allow more consumers to access tickets at a face-value price. However, they also limit consumers' ability to sell tickets they cannot use, can create inconvenience by requiring identification at the venue, and according to economists, prevent efficient allocation of tickets.", "Price caps. Several states cap the price at which tickets can be resold. But according to some state government studies, the caps generally are not effective because they are difficult to enforce.", "Disclosure requirements. Stakeholders and government research GAO consulted generally supported measures to ensure clearer and earlier disclosure of ticket fees, although views varied on the best approach (for example, to include fees in an \u201call-in\u201d price or disclose them separately).", "Some market-based approaches are being used or explored that seek to address concerns about secondary market activity. These approaches include technological tools and ticket-buyer verification to better combat bots.

In an attempt to mitigate these potential effects, the Department  of Justice final judgment on the merger prohibited certain forms of  retaliation against venues that contract with other ticketing companies.

A 2013 study in the Journal of Competition Law and  Economics compared two events using nontransferable tickets to  comparable events using transferable tickets at the same venues. It found  that nontransferable tickets significantly reduced resale and that prices  were significantly higher for the relatively small portion of nontransferable  tickets that were resold.", "In addition, there is anecdotal evidence that nontransferable tickets  reduce the rate of resale and allow more consumers to access tickets at  face-value prices. Many stakeholders told us that making tickets  nontransferable reduces secondary market activity, with some  stakeholders citing specific examples. For instance, the manager of a  large concert venue that primarily uses nontransferable tickets told us that  resale is much less common for the venue\u2019s events than for comparable  events at similar venues. Similarly, the manager of a major musical artist  told us that using nontransferable tickets for a subset of seats on a recent  arena tour resulted in minimal listings for those seats on the secondary  market. The New York State Attorney General\u2019s report stated that  nontransferable paperless tickets \u201cappear to be one of the few measures  to have any clear effect in reducing the excessive prices charged on the  secondary markets and increasing the odds of fans buying tickets at face  value.\u201d But, while we identified evidence that nontransferable tickets  limit resale, they may not eliminate resale because sellers may not follow  the restriction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disadvantages of Nontransferable Tickets", "paragraphs": ["However, other parties\u2014including primary and secondary market  participants, consumer advocacy groups, academics, and government  agencies\u2014have noted that nontransferable tickets can have the following  disadvantages to consumers and adverse effects on markets:  Financial loss. With nontransferable tickets, ticket buyers who cannot  attend an event can lose the ability to recoup their money through resale.", "Inconvenience. Nontransferable tickets can be inconvenient because the  buyer may need to present identification, a debit or credit card, or both, to  gain entry to the venue, which can create delays. Nontransferable tickets  also can create challenges for consumers buying tickets for others  (including as a gift) because the ticket terms may require the buyer and  original purchase card be present to gain entry. However, a primary ticket  seller and a promoter told us these obstacles can be overcome\u2014for  example, through mechanisms allowing buyers to transfer tickets upon  request, and by using processes to speed venue entry (such as  automated kiosks).", "Economic inefficiency. When nontransferable tickets are priced below  the prevailing market price in the primary market, this creates excess  demand, and tickets are sold without regard to consumers\u2019 willingness to  pay. Traditional economics maintains that an efficient market would  result in tickets going to those willing to pay the highest price, which  nontransferability inhibits by restricting a secondary market. In addition,  some academics have noted that consumers may be less willing to buy  nontransferable tickets because they do not offer the \u201cinsurance\u201d that  comes with the ability to resell them.", "Potential impingement on property rights. Some consumer groups  and secondary market participants have argued that nontransferable  ticket policies impinge on consumers\u2019 property rights. These parties argue  that once consumers buy a ticket, they should be able to do whatever  they like with it.", "Effect on competition. The New York State Attorney General\u2019s office  and some economics literature have cautioned that use of  nontransferable tickets by primary ticketing companies can impede  competition in the secondary market by making these companies\u2019 own  resale exchanges the only way to transfer tickets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Caps on Resale Prices Can Have Advantages and Disadvantages", "paragraphs": ["Several states have caps on the price at which tickets can be resold,  while others have repealed caps and some studies have questioned their  enforceability. For example, Kentucky generally prohibits the resale of  event tickets for more than either face value or the amount charged by  the venue, and Massachusetts prohibits resale by brokers of most tickets  for more than $2 above face value, with the exception of relevant service  charges. New Jersey allows a maximum markup of 20 percent or $3  (whichever is greater) for nonbrokers and a maximum markup of 50  percent for registered brokers, but does not limit resale prices for  nonbrokers for sales over the Internet. A number of other states\u2014 including Minnesota, Missouri, New York, and Connecticut\u2014repealed  their price cap laws in the 2000s. However, the New York State Attorney  General\u2019s 2016 report recommended bringing back a price cap, through a  \u201creasonable limit\u201d on resale markups.", "Price caps are generally intended to protect consumers from high  markups and increase the fairness of ticket distribution so that the  wealthiest consumers do not have disproportionate access to tickets. In  theory, price caps offer consumers the advantages of nontransferable  tickets without the disadvantages: they limit high secondary-market prices  but still allow consumers to transfer tickets to others or resell tickets they  cannot use.", "However, three government studies we reviewed stated that price caps  are difficult to enforce and are rarely complied with. A 1999 report by the  New York Attorney General noted that ticket resellers \u201calmost universally  disregarded\u201d a cap in place at the time. Representatives from the office told us enforcement of such a cap might be easier now because the  secondary market is largely on the Internet, which offers greater price  transparency. A 2016 study of the United Kingdom\u2019s ticket market noted  that enforcement of a price cap was complicated by the fact that ticket  resellers were not a well-defined group and sales could occur on various  platforms and across jurisdictions. Similarly, the New York State  Department of State noted in 2010 that enforcement of price caps can be  challenging.", "In addition, critics of price caps have said that caps might force resale  activity underground, which would reduce transparency and protections  (such as refund guarantees) that legitimate secondary market exchanges  provide. Both the largest ticket exchange and the largest primary market  ticket company have opposed price caps, with the ticket exchange  arguing that they would result in street-corner transactions, where the risk  of counterfeit and fraud would be significant. On formal exchanges,  transactions can be monitored and regulated. As with nontransferable  tickets, price caps also can create economic inefficiencies because  tickets are not necessarily allocated to those willing to pay the highest  price.", "A 2010 study by the New York State Department of State compared  publicly available secondary market listings for high-demand concerts in  New York to the same artists\u2019 concerts in nearby states with price caps. It  found no definitive evidence that price caps resulted in greater or lesser  availability on the secondary market or in lower resale prices. The study  noted that online resale prices routinely exceeded the price caps.  However, the authors of the study acknowledged that their findings were  limited by their inability to obtain data on ticket sales and availability from  secondary sellers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholder Views Vary on Effects of Additional Disclosure Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Legislative or regulatory actions to improve disclosure and transparency  of ticket fees, resale markups, and ticket availability have advantages and  disadvantages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Up-front Fee Disclosure", "paragraphs": ["Some government stakeholders have suggested improving fee  transparency through a legal requirement to disclose ticket fees earlier in  the purchase process. As discussed earlier, ticketing companies in the  primary and secondary markets vary on when and how they disclose their  fees, and some disclose fees only upon checkout. No federal law  expressly addresses fee disclosure in event ticketing. However, at least  one state requires disclosure of fees at the beginning of the purchase  process.", "On the primary market, up-front fee disclosure helps decision making by  informing consumers of the total ticket price early in the process. It also  helps consumers decide whether to buy from the ticketer\u2019s website or at  the box office, where there typically are no fees. On the secondary  market, up-front fee disclosure aids comparison shopping by helping  consumers identify the resale exchange with the best total price. Sellers  that do not provide enough or full information on prices through hidden  fees could have competitive advantage because they would be perceived  as offering lower prices over their competitors who do provide full  information showing the price. For products and services in general, FTC  staff guidance advocates that fees be disclosed up front, particularly  before the point at which the consumer has decided to make a  purchase.", "Figure 2 provides examples of different approaches to displaying prices  and fees.", "Currently, FTC relies on the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2014which  prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices\u2014to address problems  related to fee disclosures. But FTC staff said it is challenging and  resource-intensive to use the act to address inadequate fee disclosures  industry-wide because it requires proving violations on a case-by-case  basis. FTC staff told us that, depending on the circumstances, a  legislative disclosure requirement that specified requirements for fees  could facilitate enforcement activity and create a more level playing field  for consumers and sellers. Eleven industry stakeholders and three  consumer advocacy groups with whom we spoke similarly expressed  support for a requirement that ticketing fees be disclosed up front. Many  noted that fees should be fully transparent to consumers.", "However, a primary ticket seller, two venue managers, and a secondary  ticket seller we interviewed questioned the need for an up-front fee  disclosure requirement. For example, a primary ticket seller stated that  knowing fees up front would not affect a consumer\u2019s decision of whether  or not to buy a ticket. The two venue managers believed that the timing of  the fee disclosure was not important, as long as fees are disclosed before  consumers complete the purchase. Representatives of one secondary  ticket exchange said that up-front disclosure of fees could be challenging  because a ticket\u2019s fee is not stable\u2014for example, the fee can change  based on price fluctuations, different delivery methods, and the use of  promotion codes.", "The National Economic Council has stated that \u201call-in pricing,\u201d a form of  up-front pricing, may be preferable to other methods of fee disclosure.  All-in pricing incorporates the ticket\u2019s face value and all mandatory fees  and taxes, as illustrated in figure 2 above. According to the National  Economic Council, all-in pricing eases comparison across vendors. The  FTC staff report analyzing hotel resort fees supported all-in pricing for that  industry because it said that breaking out fees, instead of providing a  single total price, hindered consumer decision making and often resulted  in consumers underestimating the total price. Officials from two state  attorney general offices told us that all-in pricing could be advantageous,  noting that fee disclosures represent their most significant enforcement  issue related to the ticketing industry.", "Three secondary ticket sellers told us they might support a requirement to  provide all-in pricing, but only if it was required of all ticket sellers. In  2014, the largest secondary market ticketing company began using all-in  pricing, with its listings displaying a single total price that incorporated  fees. However, the company soon discontinued all-in pricing as the  default because, it told us, it put the company at a competitive  disadvantage with other secondary market providers whose fees were not  included in the initial ticket price displayed to consumers. A requirement  that all ticket sellers provide up-front fee disclosure would mitigate or  resolve that issue.", "One argument against a requirement for all-in pricing is that such  regulation would restrict ticket companies\u2019 flexibility in choosing how to  disclose fees. In addition, a manager, a promoter, and two artist advocacy  groups said all-in pricing could give fans the incorrect impression that the  artist was charging the full ticket price and receiving its revenues,  because the portion of the price going toward ticketing fees would not be  transparent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disclosing Face Value on Resale Sites", "paragraphs": ["Some federal and state policymakers have proposed requirements for  resellers to disclose a ticket\u2019s face value on secondary ticket websites.  Georgia and New York State have enacted similar requirements, with  statutes requiring resellers to disclose both the face value of tickets and  their list price.", "Requiring that ticket resellers disclose the ticket\u2019s face value can have  several advantages. First, it makes the reseller\u2019s markup transparent.  Second, it can help consumers assess the quality of the seat location and  compare similar seats across resale listings. Third, it might reduce the  possibility that consumers mistake a reseller\u2019s website for a venue  website, as described earlier. This, in turn, could encourage consumers to  recognize they are viewing a secondary market exchange and  comparison shop for a better price elsewhere.", "However, a requirement that resellers disclose a ticket\u2019s face value can  present challenges because the definition of \u201cface value\u201d may not always  be clear, according to three ticket resellers and FTC Bureau of Consumer  Protection staff. If the face value does not incorporate fees and taxes  charged on the primary market, it would not reflect the full amount paid by  the original buyer. Similarly, some tickets are sold through VIP packages  that do not itemize the price of the ticket and other components, such as  backstage access or parking. In addition, with dynamic pricing, a ticket\u2019s  face value can change frequently. Furthermore, season tickets may  display a higher face value than the season ticket holder paid because  teams usually sell the packages at a discount.", "A requirement to disclose a ticket\u2019s face value also could create  compliance costs for secondary ticket exchanges, and could be difficult to  enforce, according to some stakeholders. Three secondary ticket  exchanges told us they do not currently collect information on a ticket\u2019s  face value and would have difficulty verifying the value provided by the  listing broker\u2014in part because of the challenges in defining face value, as  described above. The New York State Office of the Attorney General  stated in its 2016 report that most resellers cannot comply with the state\u2019s  disclosure requirement because most secondary ticket exchanges do not  offer the option to show the ticket\u2019s face value alongside its list price,  despite having the capability to add such functionality.

A 2017 law in Ontario, Canada, requires primary  ticket sellers to provide certain information about venue capacity and  presales, according to testimony by the Ontario Attorney General.", "Such a disclosure would provide consumers a clearer picture of ticket  availability and help them manage expectations and make informed  decisions, according to three consumer advocacy groups and two  academics with whom we spoke. In addition, the National Association of  Ticket Brokers and a secondary ticket exchange stated that disclosing  ticket availability would shed light on what some consider excessive holds  and presales by the primary market. They said that brokers often are  blamed when events quickly sell out on the primary market, whereas  there may have been relatively few tickets available for sale in the first  place.

First, some  of them noted that ticket inventory can change as event production details  evolve and holds are released, making it difficult to provide an accurate  number of tickets available at any one time. Second, some said this  disclosure would be confusing or meaningless for consumers, with one  promoter noting that for high-demand events, a consumer\u2019s odds of  getting a ticket are low regardless of whether he or she knows the  number of available tickets. Another promoter noted that the seat maps  used to select seats when purchasing tickets already provide information  on ticket availability. Many stakeholders also told us such a disclosure  would only help brokers by giving them information useful in buying  tickets and setting resale prices.

To determine  which states had laws related to ticket resale or disclosure, we reviewed  compilations of state ticketing laws from the National Association of Ticket  Brokers, a secondary ticket seller\u2019s website, and a law firm publication,  and we conducted independent research and verification. We reviewed  ticketing-related legislation\u2014selected for its relevance to the approaches  covered in our review\u2014in Connecticut, New York, and Georgia. We  reviewed state government reports and interviewed state officials to get  information on the states\u2019 experiences with these laws. We also consulted  foreign government reports to obtain information on relevant laws or  regulations in Canada and the United Kingdom, which have reported  similar consumer protection issues as we reviewed in our report.", "To address all of our objectives, we conducted searches of various  databases, such as ProQuest, Academic OneFile, Nexis, Scopus, and the  National Bureau of Economic Research, to identify sources such as peer- reviewed academic studies; law review articles; news and trade journal  articles; government reports; and hearings and transcripts related to  ticketing issues. We examined summary-level information about each  piece of literature, and from this review, identified articles that were  germane to our report. We generally focused on articles from 2009 and  later. We identified additional articles and reports through citations in  literature we reviewed and from expert recommendations.", "For the articles we used to cite empirical findings or to support arguments  on advantages and disadvantages of selected resale restrictions or  disclosure requirements, we conducted a methodology and soundness  review. We eliminated one study on pricing and one study on price caps  because we believed the methods were not sufficiently rigorous.", "In addition, we identified and reviewed relevant congressional testimony  on proposed ticketing legislation. We reviewed the Department of  Justice\u2019s competitive impact statement and testimonies with regard to the  2010 merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation. We interviewed staff from  the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection and Bureau of Economics, the  Department of Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division, and the New York State Office  of the Attorney General, and we conducted a group interview, coordinated  by the National Association of Attorneys General, with staff from the  offices of the attorney general of Pennsylvania and Texas. We also  interviewed representatives of three consumer organizations: Consumer  Action, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and the  National Consumers League; four trade associations: the Broadway  League, Future of Music Coalition, National Association of Ticket Brokers,  and the Recording Academy; as well as four primary ticket sellers, five  secondary ticket exchanges and aggregators, one broker, five venue  operators, three event promoters (who also operate venues), five artists\u2019  managers and booking agents, three major sports leagues, and three  academics who have studied the ticket marketplace. These organizations  and individuals were selected based on their experience and prominence  in the marketplace and to provide a range of perspectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2016 to April 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.
