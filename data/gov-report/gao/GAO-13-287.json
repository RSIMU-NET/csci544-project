Most individuals with ESRD are eligible for Medicare. As required by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), CMS implemented the LVPA to compensate dialysis facilities that provided a low volume of dialysis treatments for the higher costs they incurred. MIPPA required GAO to study the LVPA; GAO examined (1) the extent to which the LVPA targeted low-volume, high-cost facilities that appeared necessary for ensuring access to care and (2) CMS's implementation of the LVPA, including the extent to which CMS paid the 2011 LVPA to facilities eligible to receive it. To do this work, GAO reviewed Medicare claims, facilities' annual reports of their costs, and data on dialysis facilities' location to identify and compare facilities that were eligible for the LVPA with those that received it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The low-volume payment adjustment (LVPA) did not effectively target low-volume facilities that had high costs and appeared necessary for ensuring access to care. Nearly 30 percent of LVPA-eligible facilities were located within 1 mile of another facility in 2011, and about 54 percent were within 5 miles, indicating these facilities might not have been necessary for ensuring access to care. Furthermore, in many cases, LVPA-eligible facilities were located near high-volume facilities. Among the freestanding facilities in GAO's analysis, LVPA-eligible facilities had substantially higher costs per dialysis treatment than the average facility ($272 compared with $235); however, so did other facilities that provided a relatively low volume of treatments (and were isolated) but were ineligible for the LVPA. The design of the LVPA gives facilities an adverse incentive to restrict service provision because facilities could lose a substantial amount of Medicare revenue over 3 years if they reach the treatment threshold. In another payment system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a tiered adjustment that decreases as facility volume increases. Such an adjustment could diminish the incentive for dialysis facilities to limit service provision and also more closely align the LVPA with the decline in costs per treatment that occurs as volume increases.", "Medicare overpaid an estimated $5.3 million in 2011 to dialysis facilities that were ineligible for the LVPA and did not pay an estimated $6.7 million that same year to facilities that were eligible. The payment problems occurred primarily because the guidance issued by CMS on facility eligibility was sometimes not clear or timely and CMS's monitoring of the LVPA was limited. For example, the majority of the ineligible facilities that received the LVPA were hospital-affiliated facilities that failed the volume requirement. Although CMS gave the Medicare contractors guidance for determining how to count treatments when facilities are affiliated with hospitals, the agency did not issue that guidance until July 2012. CMS has conducted limited monitoring of the LVPA, which has left CMS with incomplete information about LVPA administration and payments. For example, CMS was unaware as of January 2013 whether its contractors had recouped erroneous 2011 LVPA payments. In addition, CMS had requested information from its contractors about the implementation of the 2011 LVPA, such as which facilities were eligible for or had received the LVPA, but had not yet verified whether the information it received was complete or in a usable form. Without complete information about the administration of this payment adjustment, CMS is not in a position to ensure that the LVPA is reaching low-volume facilities as intended or that erroneous payments to ineligible facilities are recouped."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To more effectively target the LVPA and ensure LVPA payment accuracy, GAO recommends that the Administrator of CMS consider restricting payments to low-volume facilities that are isolated; consider changing the LVPA to a tiered adjustment; recoup 2011 LVPA payments that the Medicare contractors made in error; improve monitoring of those contractors; and improve the clarity and timeliness of guidance.

Eventually, CMS specified that Medicare contractors  should combine the treatments of a hospital\u2019s affiliated dialysis facilities in  determining whether the LVPA requirement for fewer than 4,000  treatments had been met. While this method of applying the regulatory  requirement is logical because hospital-affiliated facilities do not file  individual cost reports, CMS did not issue explicit guidance on this topic  until July 2012.", "CMS guidance to Medicare contractors for determining whether a facility  had met the LVPA requirement of not having opened, closed, or changed  ownership during the 3 years preceding the payment year was neither  clear nor timely. According to our interviews with CMS officials, the  agency\u2019s intention was for contractors to verify that each of the facility\u2019s  cost reports for the previous 3 years covered exactly 12 months; however  the connection between the regulatory requirement and the duration of  the cost-reporting periods has not been explicitly made in CMS guidance.  (For example, an October 2010 internal technical direction letter stated  that, in order to meet the LVPA eligibility verification requirements,  Medicare contractors needed to confirm that fewer than 4,000 total  treatments were provided for each of the 12-month cost-reporting  periods\u2014however, it was not clear which regulatory verification  requirement(s) the sentence was implementing.) CMS officials  explained that three cost-reporting periods of exactly 12 months (which  need to be consecutive) are a time frame that would exhibit business  practice patterns that demonstrate a facility is consistently low-volume  and that, because cost reports correspond with the facility\u2019s fiscal year,  using them provides a snapshot of a facility\u2019s financial ability to incur  costs for furnishing renal dialysis. Furthermore, CMS officials noted that  having three cost-reporting periods of exactly 12 months each was a  reasonable method of assessing the regulatory requirement because,  generally, if a facility opened, closed, or had a change in ownership (in  which case the facility may receive a new provider number), this would  cause a break in the cost-reporting period and thus lead a facility to have  one or more cost reports that spanned fewer than 12 months. In July  2011, CMS issued public guidance clarifying that the relevant periods  during which a facility had not opened, closed, or had a change in  ownership were the three cost-reporting periods before the payment year  and not the 3 calendar years before the payment year.helped clarify that the 12-month rule was sufficient for assessing that a  facility had not opened, closed, or had a change in ownership, as of  January 2013, no CMS guidance has been explicit on this topic, and no  guidance has stated that each cost-reporting period must be exactly   12 months.", "Unclear and late guidance for determining whether a facility had opened,  closed, or changed ownership led to misunderstanding about which  facilities were eligible, and at least some of the misunderstanding  persisted as of September 2012. For example, when we questioned a  representative of a large dialysis organization in September 2012 about  some of the organization\u2019s facilities that we found to have not received  the 2011 LVPA despite being eligible, the representative still believed  those facilities were ineligible because they had a change in ownership  during the previous 3 calendar years. In fact, these facilities were still  eligible for the 2011 LVPA because the change in ownership occurred  after the end of the facilities\u2019 2010 cost-reporting period and they  therefore had 2008, 2009, and 2010 cost reports that each covered  exactly 12 months. In addition, when we questioned the representative  about some of the organization\u2019s facilities that we found to have  incorrectly received the 2011 LVPA, the representative still believed those  facilities met all the regulatory requirements and therefore had been  eligible. However, because these facilities opened in December 2007 and  complied with CMS\u2019s general requirement that cost reports not span less  than a month, they had a 2008 cost report that spanned slightly more  than 12 months. This made these facilities ineligible for the 2011 LVPA.  When we shared this example with CMS, a CMS official stated that the  agency had not considered the possibility that a facility could have a cost  report spanning more than 12 months. Additionally, when we questioned  a representative from a different large dialysis organization in September  2012 about some of that organization\u2019s facilities that we found to have  incorrectly received the 2011 LVPA, the representative still believed that  those facilities had been eligible because the changes in ownership for  those facilities did not result in new provider numbers. However, these  facilities were ineligible because the changes in ownership caused a  break in the cost-reporting period and thus the facilities had at least one  cost report that spanned fewer than 12 months.", "While CMS has continued to issue clarifying guidance and provide  Medicare contractors and facilities with opportunities to ask clarifying  questions, evidence shows that CMS\u2019s guidance for determining LVPA  eligibility was not fully and correctly implemented. In particular, none of  the estimated $5.3 million in 2011 overpayments had been recouped by  June 2012, based on an analysis of claims, and CMS was not aware of  any overpayments that had been recouped by January 2013. This  suggests that many Medicare contractors either had not yet discovered  the payments made in error or were not aware of their obligation to  reassess facilities\u2019 eligibility once the cost report for the previous year  became available and to recoup overpayments within 6 months of  discovery. Another possible reason for overpayment or nonpayment of  the LVPA is that some of the guidance was sent only to Medicare  contractors and was not publicly available. Medicare contractors are  responsible for ensuring that facilities receive any required information  based on this guidance, and that function is particularly important for the  LVPA because in order to receive the LVPA a facility must first attest to  its eligibility, which it will do only if it believes it is eligible. We do not know  the extent to which continued misunderstanding of LVPA eligibility stems  from Medicare contractors\u2019 failure to share the relevant portions of this  nonpublic guidance or from facilities\u2019 not understanding the guidance that  they received.", "Much of the misunderstanding and resulting payment problems related to  eligibility were exacerbated by CMS\u2019s limited monitoring of the Medicare  contractors and its consequent limited knowledge about implementation  of the LVPA. While CMS requested information about the 2011 LVPA  from Medicare contractors in October 2011 and again in July 2012, as of  January 2013, it had not yet verified whether the information it received  was complete or in a usable form. In particular, CMS still did not know  which facilities were eligible for the 2011 LVPA, which facilities had  attested to being eligible for the adjustment, nor which facilities received  the 2011 LVPA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CMS intended the LVPA to encourage small ESRD facilities to continue  operating in areas where beneficiary access might be jeopardized if such  facilities closed. However, as designed, the LVPA does not effectively  achieve this goal because it does not target all relatively low-volume,  high-cost facilities that are in areas where beneficiaries may lack other  dialysis care options, and it targets some facilities that appeared  unnecessary for ensuring access to dialysis, such as dialysis facilities  located in close proximity to other facilities. In addition, facilities currently  face a large loss in potential revenue if they reach the LVPA treatment  threshold. This creates an adverse incentive for facilities to restrict their  service provision to avoid reaching the treatment threshold.", "In addition to these concerns about more appropriately targeting the  LVPA, we also found significant issues associated with its  implementation, including frequent LVPA overpayments. These  overpayments primarily stemmed from unclear and untimely CMS  guidance and persisted because of CMS\u2019s insufficient monitoring of  Medicare contractors. Without clear, timely guidance and stronger  monitoring of Medicare contractors\u2019 implementation of the guidance,  Medicare may continue to pay facilities that are not eligible for the LVPA  and to not pay many facilities that are eligible. Although the amount of  money involved was small\u2014overpayments and nonpayments totaling  about $12 million in 2011 for the $10.1 billion ESRD program\u2014payment  problems with the adjustment undermined its purpose, which is to  encourage small ESRD facilities to continue operating in areas where  beneficiary access might be jeopardized without them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To more effectively target facilities necessary for ensuring access to care,  we recommend that the Administrator of CMS consider restricting the  LVPA to low-volume facilities that are isolated.", "To reduce the incentive for facilities to restrict their service provision to  avoid reaching the LVPA treatment threshold, we recommend that the  Administrator of CMS consider revisions such as changing the LVPA to a  tiered adjustment.", "To ensure that future LVPA payments are made only to eligible facilities  and to rectify past overpayments, we recommend that the Administrator  of CMS take the following four actions:  require Medicare contractors to promptly recoup 2011 LVPA  payments that were made in error;  investigate any errors that contributed to eligible facilities not  consistently receiving the 2011 LVPA and ensure that such errors are  corrected;  take steps to ensure that CMS regulations and guidance regarding the  LVPA are clear, timely, and effectively disseminated to both dialysis  facilities and Medicare contractors; and  improve the timeliness and efficacy of CMS\u2019s monitoring regarding the  extent to which Medicare contractors are determining LVPA eligibility  correctly and promptly redetermining eligibility when all necessary  data become available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Industry Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from HHS, which  are reprinted in appendix I. HHS agreed with our recommendations and  stated it would explore refinements to the design of the LVPA and take  actions to improve its implementation. HHS also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "With regard to our recommendation that CMS consider restricting the  LVPA to low-volume facilities that are isolated, HHS stated that CMS will  explore potential refinements. HHS stated that other factors, in addition to  geographic isolation, may contribute to an ESRD facility being low-volume  and that the department had studied the costs of both rural and nonrural  facilities and decided not to implement an adjustment on the basis of rural  location. We did not analyze all the reasons facilities were low-volume,  nor did we recommend a payment adjustment for rural facilities. However,  we believe that providing increased payments to facilities in close  proximity to one another may not be warranted. We also note that, while  facilities certified on or after January 1, 2011, that apply for the LVPA  must combine all of the treatments provided by facilities under common  ownership within 25 miles to determine eligibility, this restriction does not  ensure that only isolated facilities receive the LVPA. For example, two  facilities not under common ownership could be located in close proximity  and still receive the LVPA.", "In response to our recommendation to consider revisions such as  changing the LVPA to a tiered adjustment, HHS stated that it would  explore whether refinements to the LVPA are necessary. HHS stated that  the incentive for facilities to limit dialysis services would exist regardless  of where the decrease in payment occurred. We agree that such a  change would not eliminate the incentive to limit dialysis services, but we  believe it would reduce the incentive.", "HHS concurred with our recommendation about ensuring proper  payments and rectifying past overpayments. HHS also listed specific  actions it plans to take to implement the recommendation, including using  multiple methods to communicate with Medicare contractors and ESRD  facilities to deliver clear and timely guidance.", "We invited two organizations to provide oral comments on our draft  report: the Kidney Care Council (KCC), which represents dialysis facility  companies, and the National Renal Administrators Association (NRAA),  which represents independent dialysis facilities. Representatives from  these organizations expressed their appreciation for the opportunity to  review the draft.", "Both KCC and NRAA noted that facilities within close proximity to another  facility may still be necessary for ensuring access to dialysis care (for  example, if the other facility is operating at capacity) or access to choice  of dialysis modality (for example, if the other facility does not offer the  same dialysis options). While these situations may occur, if CMS  determines a single larger facility could provide appropriate services  where two or more smaller facilities exist now, paying the LVPA to the  existing smaller facilities may not be warranted.", "NRAA agreed with our finding that CMS guidance on LVPA eligibility was  unclear and not transparent to facilities. Additionally, NRAA noted that  CMS\u2019s guidance requiring that hospitals\u2014but not large dialysis  organizations\u2014sum the treatments across all of their affiliated facilities  when determining eligibility for the LVPA was inconsistent. We agree  there is some inconsistency; however, it will be somewhat reduced  starting in 2014 as CMS requires that facilities certified after January 1,  2011, sum their treatments across all facilities that are under common  ownership and within 25 miles. NRAA also disagreed with the statement  that hospital cost reports are the only source of information on total  treatments provided by hospital-affiliated facilities. As we note in the  report, CMS officials told us that cost reports are the only source of total  treatments.", "Both KCC and NRAA requested more details on GAO\u2019s  recommendations related to improving the design of the LVPA. Our  recommendations\u2014that CMS should (1) more effectively target facilities  necessary for ensuring access to care by considering restricting the LVPA  to low-volume facilities that are isolated and (2) reduce the incentive for  facilities to restrict their service provision by considering revisions such as  changing the LVPA to a tiered adjustment\u2014outlined the factors CMS  should consider in improving the LVPA. We did not specify details of the  design because we believe CMS should have flexibility in how to more  effectively target facilities necessary for ensuring access to care and  reduce their incentive to restrict service provision.", "KCC urged GAO to recommend that CMS pay out LVPA payments that  CMS failed to make. We believe facilities are best positioned to determine  and pursue their own rights to appeal Medicare claims determinations.", "Technical comments from KCC and NRAA were incorporated in the draft  as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services.
