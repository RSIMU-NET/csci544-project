Government and nongovernment activities are looking to the Office of Homeland Security for further guidance on how to better integrate their missions and more effectively contribute to the overarching homeland security effort. Having a common definition can help avoid duplication of effort and gaps in coverage by identifying agency roles and responsibilities. Although the agencies are looking for guidance, they also want to ensure that their unique missions are factored in as guidance is developed. At the same time, some agencies are unsure what they should be doing beyond their traditional missions.

Protecting  the United States and its citizens from terrorism is a national effort  involving both the government and nongovernment sectors. Such broad- based efforts are inherently difficult to lead and manage. More than 40  federal entities alone are involved in combating terrorism. Enhancing  homeland security becomes even more complex because it involves all 50  states, the District of Columbia, and the territories; thousands of  municipalities; and countless private entities, many of which own the  infrastructure that can be attacked. These organizations have multiple,  specialized missions, distinct organizational cultures, and millions of  employees. Some have both international and domestic components and  operations. Trying to effectively involve them in a single, coordinated  effort makes a monumental undertaking.", "Since September 11, our nation has taken many actions to combat  terrorism and enhance homeland security. Today, it is well known that our  servicemembers are conducting operations in Afghanistan in Operation  Enduring Freedom. This operation covers offensive actions in the  Afghanistan theater and the North Arabian Sea, and includes ground, air,  and naval forces, and follow-on operations for certain support activities.  Less well-known perhaps is the Department of Defense\u2019s other primary  ongoing operation, Noble Eagle, which concerns the direct defense of the  U.S. homeland. This operation protects civilian population centers, critical  infrastructure, and special events such as the recently completed Winter  Olympics held in Salt Lake City. To help provide operational forces, the  department has alerted for activation just over 97,000 reserve component  servicemembers and completed the call-up of more than 78,000 Reserve  and National Guard augmentees.", "As requested, my testimony will cover three areas.

The Congress passed the Aviation and  Transportation Security Act in November 2001, which created the  Transportation Security Administration with broad new responsibilities  for aviation security. The administration faces the daunting challenge of  creating this new organizational structure, which must implement more  than two dozen specific actions by the end of 2002. All actions due to date  have been completed, but formidable tasks remain. For example, the  administration is required to have sufficient explosive detection systems in  place to screen all checked baggage at more than 400 airports nationwide  by December 31, 2002. As of January 2002, fewer than 170 of these  machines had been installed. The administration estimates that about  2,000 additional machines will need to be produced and installed by the  end of the year. Concerns have been raised that the vendors will not be  able to produce sufficient number of machines to meet the deadline. The  administration continues to work to identify ways to fill the gap between  the requirement and the production capability, including considering the  use of noncertified equipment as an interim measure. Also, the  administration needs to hire about 40,000 employees, including more than  30,000 screeners, federal air marshals, and other officials. Achieving this  goal presents a big challenge because a significant number of the current  screening workforce may not qualify for screening positions. Airport  screeners must now be U.S. citizens and be able to speak and read  English. For example, currently up to 80 percent of the personnel in these  positions at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., do not  qualify for employment.", "While not currently as high-profile as airport security, the vulnerability of  major commercial seaports to criminal and terrorist activity has caused  concern for many years, and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,  elevated those concerns again. Even prior to the attacks, this  subcommittee expressed concerns about seaport security and the  potential consequences of a terrorist attack on the successful deployment  of our military forces. Because of these concerns, you asked us to examine  the effectiveness of Department of Defense force protection measures at  critical seaports located within the United States and at overseas  locations, and we will issue our report to you later this year. As part of our  work, some of which I can highlight today, we have observed efforts by  the Coast Guard to improve seaport security since the attacks.", "In order to establish a clear indication of how Coast Guard units and  personnel should respond to various threat levels at seaports, the Coast  Guard is developing three new maritime security levels. The first level,  \u201cnew normal,\u201d will encompass a greater level of security effort in the ports,  including increased emphasis on security patrols, improved awareness of  all activity in and around seaports, and better information about inbound  vessels and their cargo. The other two security levels will contain  increasingly heightened security measures to be taken if threat conditions  escalate. The Coast Guard has also initiated the \u201csea marshal\u201d program,  whereby armed Coast Guard teams are placed aboard select commercial  vessels navigating the waters of some of our major ports. A third Coast  Guard initiative underway is the development of a vulnerability  assessment methodology that the Coast Guard plans to use at more than  50 major U.S. seaports to identify vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure  at each port.", "Congress is considering legislation to enhance seaport security. The port  and maritime security legislation, which passed the Senate in December,  contains a number of provisions aimed at further improving the state of  seaport security. Among these provisions are establishing local port  security committees, comprised of a broad range of federal, state, and  local governments as well as commercial representatives; requiring  vulnerability assessments at major U.S. seaports; developing  comprehensive security plans for all waterfront facilities; improving  collection and coordination of intelligence; improving training for  maritime security professionals; making federal grants for security  infrastructure improvements; and preparing a national maritime  transportation security plan.

In  interviews with officials at more than a dozen federal agencies, we found  that a broadly accepted definition of homeland security did not exist.  Some of these officials believed that it was essential that the concept and  related terms be defined, particularly because homeland security  initiatives are crosscutting, and a clear definition promotes a common  understanding of operational plans and requirements, and can help avoid  duplication of effort and gaps in coverage. Common definitions promote  more effective agency and intergovernmental operations and permit more  accurate monitoring of homeland security expenditures at all levels of  government. The Office of Homeland Security may establish such a  definition. The Office of Management and Budget believes a single  definition of homeland security can be used to enforce budget discipline.  Although some agencies are looking to the Office of Homeland Security  for guidance on how their agencies should be integrated into the overall  security effort and to explain what else they should be doing beyond their  traditional missions, they also want their viewpoints incorporated as this  guidance evolves. For example, an official at the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention saw the Office of Homeland Security as both  providing leadership and getting \u201ceveryone to the table\u201d to facilitate a  common understanding of roles and responsibilities.", "State officials told us that they also seek additional clarity on how they can  best participate in the planned national strategy for homeland security.  The planned national strategy should identify additional roles for state and  local governments, but the National Governor\u2019s Association made clear to  us that governments oppose mandated participation and prefer broad  guidelines or benchmarks.", "State officials were also concerned about the cost of assuming additional  responsibilities, and they plan to rely on the federal government for  funding assistance. The National Governors Association estimates fiscal  year 2002 state budget shortfalls of between $40 billion and $50 billion,  making it increasingly difficult for the states to take on expensive, new  homeland security initiatives without federal assistance. As we address the  state fiscal issues through grants and other tools, we must (1) consider  targeting the funds to states and localities with the greatest need, (2)  discourage the replacement of state and local funds with federal funds,  and (3) strike a balance between accountability and flexibility.", "State and local governments believe that to function as partners in  homeland security they need better access to threat information. Officials  at the National Emergency Management Association, which represents  state and local emergency management personnel, stated that such  personnel experienced problems receiving critical intelligence information  and that this hampered their ability to help pre-empt terrorists before they  strike. According to these officials, certain state or local emergency  management personnel, emergency management directors, and certain fire  and police chiefs hold security clearances granted by the Federal  Emergency Management Agency; however, other federal agencies, such as  the Federal Bureau of Investigation, do not recognize these clearances.  Moreover, the National Governor\u2019s Association said that intelligence  sharing is a problem between the federal government and the states. The  association explained that most governors do not have a security  clearance and, therefore, do not receive classified threat information,  potentially impacting their ability to effectively use the National Guard and  hampering their emergency preparedness capability. On the other hand,  we were told that local Federal Bureau of Investigation offices in most  states have a good relationship with the emergency management  community and at times shared sensitive information under certain  circumstances.", "The private sector is also concerned about costs, but in the context of new  regulations to promote security. In our discussions with officials from  associations representing the banking, electrical energy, and  transportation sectors, they expressed the conviction that their member  companies desire to fully participate as partners in homeland security  programs. These associations represent major companies that own  infrastructure critical to the functioning of our nation\u2019s economy. For  example, the North American Electric Reliability Council is the primary  point of contact with the federal government on issues relating to the  security of the nation\u2019s electrical infrastructure. It has partnered with the  Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy to establish  threat levels that they in turn share with utility companies within their  organization. Such partnerships are essential, but the private sector may  be reluctant to embrace them because of concern over new and excessive  regulation, although their assets might be better protected. According to  National Industrial Transportation League officials, for example, transport  companies express a willingness to adopt prudent security measures such  as increased security checks in loading areas and security checks for  carrier drivers. However, the league is concerned that the cost of  additional layers of security could cripple their ability to conduct business  and felt that a line has to be drawn between security and the openness  needed to conduct business.", "If it is to be comprehensive, a national strategy should address many of  these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Y2K Style Partnerships Can Be Useful in Promoting Public-Private Participation for Homeland Security", "paragraphs": ["Once the homeland security strategy is developed, participating public and  private sector organizations will need to understand and prepare for their  defined roles under the strategy.

A massive mobilization with federal government leadership was  undertaken in connection with Y2K, which included partnerships with  state, local, and international governments and the private sector and  effective communication to address critical issues.
