A growth in public awareness of the capabilities of people with disabilities, a new emphasis on their inclusion in society, and a movement toward strategies promoting their economic self-sufficiency reflect this changed view. These changes in attitudes have influenced several recent major legislative initiatives: the Supported Employment program in 1986, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, and the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act. Although these initiatives are designed to help promote the employment of people with disabilities, they have not represented a substantial overhaul of U.S. disability policy. Instead, as experts have noted, they have added to or expanded an already existing program structure, parts of which have been in place for many decades.", "Because these legislative initiatives have raised concerns about the ability of federal programs that target people with disabilities to work together, you asked us to examine and describe these programs, emphasizing those that relate to employment. Specifically, we focused on the following questions: 1. Which federal programs target people with disabilities, and how many of these programs provide employment-related services? 2. To what extent are information, eligibility, and services coordinated under these programs? 3. What does available evidence suggest about the effectiveness of federal programs in promoting employment among people with disabilities?", "To accomplish these objectives, we integrated evidence from the literature, from analyses of the most current available databases, and from interviews with consumers and public and private organizations. We identified the range of federal programs, their funding levels, and the services they provide through a review of federal statutes and regulations, consultations with agency officials, and information from a variety of sources\u2014agency reports, budget documents, the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, the most current expenditure data (fiscal year 1994) available from the Consolidated Federal Funds Report, and our previous reports. Using the economics and social science literature, combined with evidence from available databases, including the 1990 census and the 1993 National Health Interview Survey, for example, we identified characteristics of the population of people with disabilities and gathered information on employment barriers posed by their special needs. However, we did not independently verify data that we received from public or private databases. We also interviewed disability experts, consumers, service providers, and public officials at the federal, state, and local levels to help determine how federal programs address these barriers to employment. Our work was completed between April 1995 and July 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. For more detailed information on our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the last 10 years, the Congress has expanded federal efforts to promote employment for people with more severe disabilities by creating new programs, expanding existing programs, and providing employment protections. In the past, social attitudes toward people with mental retardation or psychiatric conditions often labeled them as unemployable outside of institutions or sheltered workshops and thus unable to benefit from job training or vocational rehabilitation. However, recent advances in assistive technology, particularly in computers, have made many personal limitations less prohibitive barriers to work. Voice recognition software, for example, allows those who do not have use of their hands to produce documents on a computer. In addition, the development of supported employment, in which ongoing on-the-job support is provided to people with disabilities through a job coach, has demonstrated that many people previously considered unemployable could work alongside people without disabilities. In response to these developments, the Congress has created new programs to promote the increased use of assistive technology and to provide states with funding specifically designated for supported employment. In addition, the Congress has amended the Rehabilitation Act to strengthen the requirement that states serve individuals with severe disabilities.", "In 1990, the Congress provided educational and employment protections to people with disabilities. For example, ADA prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of disability by state and local governments and many private-sector employers, as long as the person was qualified and able to perform the essential job functions \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d Similarly, in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Congress mandated that all children with disabilities be provided a \u201cfree, appropriate public education,\u201d and courts interpreting the law have required that this education be provided in \u201cthe least restrictive environment.\u201d This provision emphasized a clear presumption that children with disabilities should be mainstreamed\u2014that is, taught in regular classrooms when possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "130 Federal Programs Target People With Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["Over many years, public concern and congressional action have produced a broad continuum of services and policies designed to help people with disabilities. We identified 19 different federal departments or agencies that administered 130 programs targeting people with disabilities in 1994.These programs ranged from those for toddlers with disabilities, for example, Early Intervention State Grants for Infants and Toddlers With Disabilities\u2014to those for the elderly with disabilities, for example, Independent Living Services for Older Blind Individuals. These many programs provided education, health care, and books and assisted with employment. (For a list of these programs, as well as targeting and funding information, see app. II.)", "Of the 130 programs, 69 were wholly targeted (targeted exclusively) to people with disabilities; the others were partially targeted\u2014that is, they provided services to a wider clientele but nonetheless gave some priority or preference to people with disabilities. In 1994, the federal government spent over $60 billion through these 69 wholly targeted programs, including efforts such as the Disabled Veterans\u2019 Outreach program, which helps disabled veterans. In addition, people with disabilities benefited from between $81 billion and $184 billion in federal spending through 61 partially targeted programs in areas such as income support, housing, and transportation.", "The federal commitment to helping people with disabilities has also attempted to facilitate their employment both directly and indirectly. Of the 130 programs available in 1994, 26 provided direct employment services such as skills training and job search assistance. For example, the Supported Employment program established by the Rehabilitation Act is employment focused because it provided training and placement services to people with severe disabilities. (Apps. II and III provide details about these programs.) Employment-focused programs in 1994 provided between $2.5 billion and $6.1 billion in services targeted to people with disabilities.", "In addition, we identified 57 of 130 programs as related to employment\u2014that is, although not directed specifically at employment, these programs may have indirectly affected employment outcomes. These include federal programs that help finance purchases of assistive technology, such as specially designed wheelchairs or computer software, which are employment related because they can enable an individual with a disability to enter the workplace. In 1994, employment-related programs provided between $62 billion and $156 billion in services targeted to people with disabilities.", "The remaining 47 of the 130 federal programs were unrelated to employment. Federal efforts to promote early intervention services for toddlers with disabilities are an example of these types of programs. (See fig. 1.)", "Employment-related programs indirectly facilitate work through services such as assistive technology, transportation, health insurances, and the like.", "Many of these employment-focused and -related programs provided a specific service rather than a broad range of services to people with disabilities. For example, the Department of Transportation (DOT) funds capital improvements for local transit systems and also provides funds for paratransit services. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program, although only partially targeted to people with disabilities, emphasizes shorter term skill training and provides only a limited range and amount of support services. Important exceptions to this are the vocational rehabilitation programs; both the federal-state Vocational Rehabilitation program and the Veterans\u2019 Vocational Rehabilitation program can provide a wide variety of services designed to promote employment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Degree of Federal Financing and Responsibility Varies Among Disability Programs and States", "paragraphs": ["Although the federal government provides funds for all 130 programs, the extent of the federal role in their administration varies considerably. Federal programs provide assistance directly to the individual or indirectly through other public or private service providers at the state and local levels. Programs that provide assistance indirectly often involve limited responsibilities for the federal government in administering services.", "For some programs, assistance or services flow directly from the federal government to the individual with a disability. For example, income support payments under the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program flow directly to beneficiaries, and phone calls requesting information from the Education Department\u2019s Information Clearinghouse are a direct service from the federal government. The largest federal programs in terms of spending\u2014the income maintenance and health care programs\u2014generally deliver assistance directly to individuals; however, if these programs are excluded, states receive a substantial amount of the funds provided through disability programs.", "For many programs, assistance or services flow indirectly from the federal government through state governments, which are responsible for delivering services to individuals with disabilities. For example, under the federal-state Vocational Rehabilitation program, the federal government allocates program funds to the states, which have authority to deliver services. For some programs, the states may provide funds to other entities, such as local governments or nonprofit or private agencies, to administer services. In the states we visited, funds from federal disability programs were further distributed to a wide range of state agencies\u2014 departments of rehabilitation services, employment and training, developmental disabilities, mental health, education, and those for the deaf and hard of hearing, or the blind, for example.", "For many other programs, assistance or services flow indirectly from the federal government to other organizations such as state or local agencies or nonprofit or private organizations. For example, the Projects With Industry (PWI) program may be administered through other public, private, or nonprofit agencies. Under these programs, federal agencies allocate grants on the basis of the application or proposal submitted by an organization or agency, which is then responsible for providing services. Federal funds allocated through these programs provide support for special projects in delivering disability services; others support research or train state or local professionals to work more effectively with people with disabilities.

The variation in these funding mechanisms affects the distribution of federal funds to states. States may receive more or less money depending on the size and characteristics of their targeted population as well as their success in pursuing grants and other awarded monies. In our analysis of statewide 1990 funding data for the eight wholly targeted employment- focused programs and statewide 1990 census data, we found that the disabled working-age population as a percentage of the total working-age population varied between 7 and 15 percent. Federal programs distributed to states between $200 and $1,100 per working-age person with a disability. Some states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina received between $200 and $350 per working-age person with a disability; sparsely populated states like Wyoming and Alaska received between $800 and $1,100 per working-age person with a disability.

People with disabilities constitute an underutilized workforce and a potential resource to the U.S. economy. Surveys have estimated that 18 to 40 percent of people with disabilities have jobs\u2014far below the 73 percent of people without impairments. Yet in these surveys, most individuals with disabilities indicated that their disability did not prevent them from working. For example, although 8.2 percent of individuals were identified as having a work disability in the 1990 census, only a little over half of those said that they could not work.", "Increased employment would alleviate the poor economic condition of people with disabilities, many of whom struggle to get by on marginal resources. According to 1990 census estimates, 22 percent of working-age people with disabilities live on or below the poverty line, and an additional 12 percent can be classified as \u201cnear poor\u201d (with incomes between 101 and 150 percent of the poverty line). Not surprisingly, many people with disabilities turn to public assistance. In 1992, approximately 3.5 million disabled workers participated in the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) DI program, and approximately 4 million people with disabilities participated in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Aside from Social Security income, census figures indicate that people with disabilities were also more likely to receive other forms of public assistance. Only 2 percent of working-age people without disabilities\u2014 those aged 16 to 64\u2014reported receiving public assistance income, compared with 15 percent of working-age people with disabilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Government Finances a Wide Range of Services to Address Major Employment Barriers", "paragraphs": ["Our discussions with disability experts, consumers, and officials from public and private agencies identified multiple barriers that contribute to the relatively low employment rates for people with disabilities. Some of the major employment barriers they identified are listed in table 1, which also includes examples of federal efforts addressing each barrier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employment Barriers Can Limit Job Opportunities for People With Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["For many individuals with disabilities, employment barriers can restrict the range of employment opportunities available. For example, the 40 percent of people with disabilities who have less than a high school education may find the job market particularly difficult, especially with the general decline in the number of lower skill jobs available in many industries. According to 1990 census figures, people with disabilities were nearly twice as likely to have less than a high school education (40 to 21 percent); similarly, individuals without impairments were more than twice as likely to have a college degree or more (21 to 9 percent).", "In contrast, although a lack of skill training can limit employment opportunities, access to appropriate technology can expand the range of possibilities. In a National Council on Disability (NCD) report, users of assistive technology reported that such equipment enabled them to work more productively for more hours, increase their earnings, and either keep their jobs or obtain employment. Obtaining access to supportive technologies, however, is often difficult for many people with disabilities. The Council reported that a person with severe disabilities may be considered eligible for, and benefit from, more than 20 federal programs in the area of assistive technology. Yet the report cites that the many inconsistencies between and within these programs lead to an extraordinary amount of confusion and frustration for individuals with disabilities and their families. Moreover, even if a person is clearly eligible for all services, he or she must negotiate multiple eligibility requirements\u2014 perhaps including medical examinations, additional documentation, and interviews with officials from multiple agencies\u2014to get access to services under several narrowly focused programs.", "People with disabilities also face problems with accessing nongovernment-supported health care due to preexisting conditions. For example, while ADA does not allow employers to discriminate on the basis of health care costs, the President\u2019s Committee on Employment of Persons With Disabilities cited employer discrimination in accessing nongovernment-supported health insurance as a major employment barrier. For example, employers, especially small businesses, may find that sometimes the premiums for employee group health insurance will increase significantly if an employee with a disability is included in the policy. Although measuring the extent of discrimination is difficult, several research studies have found that wages and hiring rates are lower for individuals with disabilities than for those without impairments, even after differences in education, experience, and other factors are accounted for.", "In addition to these barriers, people with disabilities face other obstacles in taking advantage of available employment opportunities. For example, many of the federal and state officials we spoke with, along with other experts, identified the lack of accessible transportation as especially problematic. The U.S. transportation system is heavily automobile based, but people with disabilities are less able to rely on cars than individuals without impairments. According to census data, 14 percent of people with disabilities did not have an automobile in the household, compared with 6 percent of people without disabilities. Some disabilities (such as blindness) make driving impractical; others require costly adjustments, such as hand controls or a lift, to a standard automobile. In addition, financial considerations may limit access to automobiles for many people with disabilities, especially for the over 10 million people with disabilities who reported incomes of less than $10,000 in 1990. The need to rely on public transportation may especially restrict employment options for people with disabilities who live in rural areas.", "People with disabilities who rely on income support programs such as Social Security DI or SSI may also be discouraged from attempting to work by the prospect of losing their benefits, particularly their health insurance coverage. Disability advocates and rehabilitation counselors believe that the fear of losing medical coverage is one of the most significant barriers to the participation of SSI and DI beneficiaries in the Vocational Rehabilitation program, their return to work, or both. In recent years, other initiatives have adopted additional procedures to mitigate these work disincentives, but relatively few beneficiaries have taken advantage of these provisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Despite Its Importance, Coordination Has Been Difficult to Achieve", "paragraphs": ["Because people with disabilities may need a variety of services to seek or retain employment, and with federal assistance dispersed among many programs and agencies, coordination of these activities is especially important. Programs and agencies may coordinate in different ways, from sharing basic program information to establishing compatible eligibility criteria to cooperating in service provision. (See table 2.)", "Our review raised questions about the extent to which federal disability programs achieve coordination in any of these areas. Many of the agencies responsible for federal disability programs did not engage, or engaged very little, in basic informational coordination either with each other, state and local agencies, the private sector, or the disability community. Eligibility coordination was also lacking; similarly, service coordination appeared to be uncommon.", "Coordination in any of these areas appeared to be a formidable task for several reasons. First, many of the recent initiatives targeted to people with disabilities added to or expanded an already existing program structure organized to address the needs of nondisabled people. As a result, administrators, particularly those who manage partially targeted programs, often do not fully understand the needs of people with disabilities and do not place a high priority on coordinating with organizations serving their special needs. Second, many federal programs rely on service providers at the state and local levels for direct service delivery. In addition to the 130 federal programs overseen by 19 agencies in 1994, states distributed program administration and authority to a variety of agencies: state departments of employment and training; state rehabilitation departments; state education departments; state departments for the blind, deaf, or developmentally disabled; state health departments; and others. Many of these different agencies also apply their own eligibility criteria, creating even greater variation. One disability researcher reported that when he surveyed states and asked which departments provided disability-related services, he received almost as many different responses as there were respondents. Finally, federal and state officials also identified turf battles, different orientations and approaches, and competing program objectives as other impediments to coordination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limited Communication Exists Among Agencies Serving People With Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["Although federal assistance to people with disabilities is dispersed among many programs and service delivery agencies at the state and local level, limited informational coordination exists among agencies about these programs and how they fit together. Federal officials did not systematically share program information and ongoing developments with their counterparts at other federal, state, local, and nonprofit agencies or with the private sector or the disability community. Some federal officials we interviewed did not know of the existence of other federal programs helping people with disabilities. Although others knew of these programs, they seldom or never talked with agency officials from other programs nor did they keep up with ongoing program developments.", "Limited informational coordination by federal administrators was common, particularly among those who manage partially targeted programs. For example, one Labor official, commenting on the department\u2019s lack of outreach to the disability community, said that the Department \u201cdoes not even talk to its  customers.\u201d Similarly, we consistently heard from disability advocates, state and local officials, service providers, and private employers that JTPA does not effectively serve the needs of people with disabilities. State officials told us that, in fact, some JTPA offices were situated in locations that were inaccessible to people with mobility limitations.", "One consequence of this limited informational coordination was the difficulty people with disabilities experienced in getting reliable information about federal services. In particular, although the majority of SSI field offices and their staff reported that they spent time providing program information, according to our 1991 study, state and local officials told us that consumers often received inconsistent answers to commonly asked questions about SSI, work, and rehabilitation. The lack of consistent, accurate information about SSI, work, and rehabilitation could magnify some of the work disincentives created by provisions of income support programs. One consumer we interviewed stated that getting answers to questions about work and rehabilitation was difficult because SSI/DI administrators did not understand the needs that were specific to her disability. She also told us that getting incomplete information made employment a risky proposition because she could lose her health benefits and not have the earning power to replace them.", "Lack of informational coordination also has negative consequences for employers and service providers, both public and private. For example, in some states, counselors from vocational rehabilitation programs do not have access to job listings from agencies that administer employment and training programs. The absence of such linkages for sharing information can present undue burdens on employers. For example, without such information sharing, counselors from separate agencies may independently contact the same employer to develop employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Having different service providers\u2014a vocational rehabilitation counselor, an employment training specialist, a supported employment job developer, or a representative from PWI\u2014contact one employer can undermine the relationship between service providers, employers, and the disability community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Agencies Apply a Wide Range of Eligibility Criteria", "paragraphs": ["Eligibility coordination is similarly limited among federal programs and agencies. Each federal program has congressionally authorized eligibility and scope-of-service requirements. Differences in eligibility criteria can make access to services a complex process, however, and could confuse people with disabilities as well as those who serve them. We identified at least 14 different definitions of disability used by federal programs alone, and many of these definitions provided considerable agency and state discretion in eligibility determination. For example, in assessing eligibility for services, one program permitted each of its 300 field offices considerable discretion in defining disability. State officials who serve people with disabilities told us that the requirements for participating in this program are very strenuous and a paper chase is required to apply.", "Even when programs may have well-defined criteria within their own departments, these criteria may differ from those used by other agencies. For example, programs administered through the Department of Education, such as Vocational Education and Vocational Rehabilitation, defined eligibility in terms of physical or mental impairments, whereas the programs administered through Social Security (DI and SSI) defined disability in terms of the inability to work. (See app. V.)", "In addition to the federal eligibility definitions, many states have the flexibility to develop and apply additional eligibility criteria and standards. For example, according to federal officials, theoretically, each state can have its own definition of developmental disabilities. State agencies may use the federal definition of developmental disabilities or the state\u2019s definition. For someone to be eligible for services in one state, mental retardation has to be the primary disability. Other states define developmental disability in terms of intelligence quotient with differing thresholds. A 1988 report from the Training and Research Institute for People With Disabilities cited that among state agencies serving the mentally retarded or developmentally disabled population, only 40 percent evaluated their consumers using the relevant federal definitions and standards and none of the state vocational rehabilitation agencies evaluated their consumers according to federal criteria. We also found in a recent study that state vocational rehabilitation agencies used criteria that were more restrictive than federal standards in screening SSI/DI participants. Restrictive standards allowed state rehabilitation agencies to limit the referrals they receive from the Social Security offices to those they considered to be the best rehabilitation candidates.", "The wide variation in eligibility standards limits the possibilities for linkages among programs, such as reciprocal referrals or eligibility agreements, in which agencies or programs can establish that eligibility for one program would expedite service provision from another. Such linkages could reduce confusion and service delays to consumers, despite the variation in eligibility, yet we found few examples of such reciprocal agreements. For example, few linkages exist between state vocational rehabilitation programs and federal or state employment and training agencies. In our 1992 study of support services under JTPA, only 24 percent (131 of 557) of local organizations surveyed said that they had coordination agreements with the state rehabilitation agencies.", "Although in many cases variation in eligibility requirements may be appropriate or necessary, collectively these differences make federal programs difficult for consumers to use. For example, in the area of assistive technology, consumers testified at public forums convened by NCD that one device or piece of equipment has to be defined in different ways to meet eligibility requirements under different programs, each with its own funding limitations. Different rules are further complicated by differences in interpretating guidelines in an agency within a state and across states. Even if a person is clearly eligible for all services, he or she must negotiate multiple eligibility requirements\u2014perhaps including medical examinations, documentation, and interviews with officials from multiple programs\u2014to access services under several narrowly focused programs. Routinely, people with disabilities must go to several different offices to get services.", "Similarly, different standards and criteria also increase costs for service providers and can limit their participation. For example, an international nonprofit organization that provides a variety of employment and rehabilitation services for the disabled told us that some local chapters of the organization choose not to participate in some programs that have a federal and state component. These local chapters would prefer to spend their resources on delivering services instead of negotiating different processes in a variety of agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Agencies Have Not Coordinated Services for People With Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["Established, well-maintained service coordination among programs also appears uncommon, resulting in inefficiencies and limiting private-sector participation and support. For example, many experts believe that increased access to regular fixed-route transportation facilitates the employment of people with disabilities. Transportation continues to be problematic, however, particularly in rural areas. Although different federal and state programs provided separate transportation funding for the elderly and the disabled, these services were not required to be coordinated at the local level. Thus, federal and state officials told us that, for example, in one county a half-empty van providing transportation for the elderly and another half-empty van providing transportation for the disabled may be traveling the same routes at the same time.", "Poor service coordination can also discourage employer efforts to work with programs and help people with disabilities. Private-sector partners involved with government programs told us that service coordination is essential for them. Officials from one corporate partner told us that having a single point of contact\u2014rather than having to deal with multiple programs and administrators\u2014is crucial to the company\u2019s ability to participate in a program employing individuals with psychiatric disabilities. Another corporate official explained that lack of responsiveness and service coordination among multiple employment programs\u2014along with reductions in financial incentives\u2014contributed to her company\u2019s decision to discontinue its efforts to participate in job training programs for the disadvantaged and for people with disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Broad-Based Efforts to Reduce Fragmentation in Federal Programs Have Fallen Short", "paragraphs": ["The diffusion of federal assistance to people with disabilities is not unique to these programs, and efforts to address the resulting problems are not new.

Nevertheless, their periodic attempts to reorganize and reshape the way human services are delivered have met with only marginal success.", "Public and private officials from all levels of government and service delivery have tried different approaches to change the way human services are planned, funded, and administered. As we identified in a previous study, however, broad-based efforts to eliminate fragmentation by creating a new service delivery system have faced many obstacles and met with limited success. Mandates alone are unlikely to secure the significant time and resource commitments needed from officials to initiate and sustain systemwide reform. In contrast, less ambitious efforts to improve coordination among service providers have succeeded somewhat in enhancing services. These efforts did not try to reorganize agencies\u2019 administrative structures; they improved services by taking a more modest, practical approach, focusing on the point of delivery and adapting to local conditions. Specifically, they linked individuals, services, and programs by (1) convincing service providers and officials of the need to cooperate and developing incentives for them to participate in the effort, (2) getting key participants to agree to the goals of the initiative and the role of each party in implementing changes, and (3) establishing a forum to institutionalize changes and continue ongoing communication."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some State and Local Initiatives Show Promise in Improving Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Some states have developed strategies that use the practical and modest approach that we had previously identified as improving coordination. For example, in California, one rural county we visited appeared to be improving services and reducing program costs.

Officials reported that their coordination efforts had reduced time and expense for administrators and consumers by 40 to 50 percent.", "In this case, state and local officials created a collaborative forum\u2014the School-to-Work Interagency Transition Partnership (SWITP)\u2014that uses interagency linkages at the local level to help students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. Officials formed a transition team composed of the student, parents, school counselors, representatives from the local JTPA program, and the state vocational rehabilitation agency. The team meets to identify a student\u2019s employment goals and devises a plan to tailor available services to the student\u2019s aspirations for achieving independent living. Representatives from almost all of the necessary services usually attend the meeting, and they work with the student and his family to identify priorities and overcome barriers. For example, one student could not take needed computer classes because of a lack of access to public transportation, but buying a car would have jeopardized the student\u2019s income maintenance and health care benefits. Because the agencies were working together in a team format to coordinate services, they quickly identified and implemented a solution.", "Transition team members said that students liked being part of the team because it gave them greater personal independence. One of the students who participated in the transition team told us it had been indispensable in guiding him from high school to independent living. The student had only work experience as a janitor, but the team helped him to identify his skill strengths and weaknesses as well as his own aspirations for other vocations. School counselors provided insights about the student\u2019s disability, and the JTPA staff identified relevant training the student needed. The end product of the meeting was a strategic plan, which gave the employment specialist a basis on which to approach employers, emphasizing the student\u2019s skills and their benefits to employers. Despite initial employer reluctance, the team placed the student temporarily for on-the-job training and continued to support both the employer and the student after the placement. The student\u2019s enthusiasm and willingness to learn impressed the employer, and, 4 years later, the student was still employed there as a custom upholsterer\u2014at well above the minimum wage.", "Although SWITP\u2019s comprehensive team assessment and planning process is targeted to youth with disabilities, it mirrors the challenges and strategies that have faced other programmatic efforts to improve services. Like administrators of adolescent drug prevention programs, SWITP service providers faced tasks of coordinating diverse external agency procedures, documentation, and personalities. SWITP service providers noted that they often need conflict management skills, a strong focus on the student\u2019s needs, and patience to overcome the turf concerns of specialized professionals and their agencies to provide the full range of services necessary for their participants. SWITP providers also found that coordination was enhanced by using a master document containing the information necessary for each agency to meet each program\u2019s data requirements. Although the master document does not replace all other documentation, it condenses the multiple intake documents previously required from students. In addition, service providers regularly consult each other about changes in their programs and consumers, which has enhanced their ability to follow up with their students long after they have left the program.

Most of the 26 employment- focused programs we examined have not been formally evaluated. For many of the employment-focused programs, no statutory or agency data collection requirements exist. Federal officials explained that few formal evaluations have been conducted because of the lack of data collection, limited resources, and in many instances the data collection problems posed by federal and state program flexibility.", "The absence of legislative and agency data collection requirements, coupled with limited available resources, precludes effectiveness studies for many of the programs we visited. Many of the agencies administering these 26 employment-focused programs did not require or collect data on program outcomes\u2014specifically, data on whether participants got jobs and kept them, what wages they received, and whether they received employee benefits such as health insurance. For example, JTPA has no statutory requirement for service delivery areas to report the characteristics of the services delivered to people with disabilities or how they are delivered. Program officials told us that, with the limited resources of most agencies, they lack the capabilities to initiate data collection efforts.", "For some of the programs that did collect outcome data, the information collected was not sufficient to adequately link outcomes to the services provided. For example, although service providers for the Supported Employment program provided detailed information on program participant performance and initial placement, they were not required to track consumers after an 18-month period, making any long-term assessment of the linkage between training and employment difficult.", "Without a concurrent effort to improve coordination at all service levels, however, imposing reporting or assessment requirements may not improve the basis for evaluation. Given the flexibility each state has in choosing its own standards and definitions, outcome tracking can be a formidable task. In many instances, service providers, both public and private, use different intake data, eligibility criteria, paperwork requirements, software, and confidentiality rules. Consequently, \u201cpeople aren\u2019t talking the same language,\u201d as one state official summarized, and considerable investments would be required to develop more uniform documentation and data to accommodate the many definitions and standards used. For example, different agencies and organizations at the state level provide funds for supported employment services. Federal officials told us, however, that mental health agencies have a different definition of services that constitute supported employment than do the vocational rehabilitation agencies. Without better coordination, data collection and tracking will remain a costly endeavor, and program administrators will lack confidence that their programs are effective, either individually or in combination with other services.", "The Congress has in the past directed agencies involved in research and evaluation of programs serving people with disabilities to improve their coordination. For example, according to a report from the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), Education\u2019s Rehabilitation Services Administration signed a memorandum of understanding in 1993 with other agencies involved in similar research and evaluation. The memorandum was intended to initiate collaboration of service delivery, staff training, and evaluation activities for the rehabilitation and employment of people with psychiatric disabilities. Similarly, the National Task Force on Rehabilitation and Employment of Psychiatric Disabilities tried to promote collaboration in the research and evaluation of federal rehabilitation and employment efforts. The task force met quarterly for 3 years, but attendance declined significantly, with many members complaining about its voluntary nature and limited impact on policies. The OTA report stated that experts and advocates commented to them that such efforts had achieved only mixed success, leading to OTA\u2019s conclusion that \u201cwhile mechanisms for communicating across agencies have or do exist, they lie moribund at the present time.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Our review raises questions about the efficiency of federal efforts to help people with disabilities. In 1994, the federal government provided a broad range of services to people with disabilities through 130 different programs, 19 federal agencies, and a multitude of public and private agencies at the state and local levels. Although research groups and independent panels have stressed the need to simplify and streamline programs serving people with disabilities, suggestions for creating a new system to deliver services may be difficult to implement. In 1992, we urged caution when the Congress considered initiatives for federal, state, and local organizations to make fundamental changes in human service delivery systems, and we also urge caution for programs serving people with disabilities. Although the potential benefits of creating a new system to deliver services more comprehensively to people with disabilities may be great, so are the barriers and the risks of failure. Obstacles preventing officials from reorganizing service agencies, creating new funding and service agreements, and divesting authority from their own agencies are difficult to overcome. Mandates alone are unlikely to secure the significant time and resource commitments needed from officials\u2014whether they are charged with directing reforms or have responsibility for administering services.", "In the current fiscal environment, a renewed focus by federal agencies on improving coordination would be a useful step toward improving services and enhancing the customer orientation of their programs. Given the multifaceted federal effort, better coordination is crucial to any strategy to eliminate duplication and service gaps and to enhance the efficiency of programs administered by the many public agencies at all levels of government. Without such an effort, assessing the impact of the federal commitment to people with disabilities and the relevance of improvement measures, such as program consolidation, becomes virtually impossible. We have identified several state and local initiatives that have shown promise in meeting the challenges of coordination; other initiatives most likely exist throughout the nation. These efforts appear to have succeeded somewhat in reducing duplication and service gaps, while saving agencies money.

(3) What does available evidence suggest about the efficiency or effectiveness of federal programs in promoting employment among people with disabilities?", "To accomplish these objectives, we integrated evidence from the literature, from analyses of available databases, and from interviews with consumers and public and private organizations. We interviewed officials of federal agencies that administer programs targeted to people with disabilities. We also interviewed disability advocates; officials of nonprofit groups; and state and local officials in Massachusetts, California, Virginia, and Nevada. We chose these states on the basis of expert opinions and agency officials to obtain a variety of geographic locations, program sizes, and administrative structures.

We defined the scope of our review to include those programs meeting one or more of the following criteria: (1) people with disabilities are specifically mentioned in the legislation as a targeted group; (2) people are eligible for the program wholly or partially because of a disability; (3) people with disabilities are given special consideration in eligibility assessments; or (4) program officials are directed to give priority to serving people with disabilities.

Many partially targeted programs, however, do not track expenditures by targeted group. For example, the Transportation Department\u2019s Federal Transit Administration finances public transit systems, along with capital improvement funds to make mass transit more accessible to people with disabilities. Agency officials have found it impractical to track disability-related expenditures under this program, particularly since it is impossible to know riders\u2019 disability status and whether or not they are using public transportation for work or some other activity.

For example, a relatively broad definition of disability would encompass a wide array of people with disabilities; however, some broader definitions can be quite subjective.

Activities can also be specified widely or narrowly. For example, some survey questions leave the term \u201cactivities\u201d to be defined by the respondent. Other instruments confine the definition of activities to a specific list, like the activities of daily living (ADL) or the independent activities of daily living (IADL).

This makes implementing the definition problematic, especially in recent years because improvements in information technology, an increased emphasis on accommodation in the workplace, and new models of working with individuals with disabilities (such as supported employment) have complicated assessments of the ability to work. Medical and legal determination of the ability to work is thus labor intensive. The emphasis on ability to work has also been criticized by analysts who believe that this definition creates a strong disincentive to employment. Because applicants must prove that they cannot work to receive benefits and may risk losing these benefits if they become employed, they may be reluctant to look for a job.

An individually defined concept of disability could capture some people who would not be included under more restrictive definitions, but this definition is likely to be inconsistent and thus unreliable to distinguish among individual cases.
