In response, in 2017 the  President revived the National Space Council to provide a coordinated  process for developing and monitoring the implementation of national  space policy and strategy. Separately, in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Congress made changes to  certain DOD space leadership positions and required the department to  conduct a review and identify a recommended organizational and  management structure for its national security space components, and  submit related reports. The act also required DOD to contract with a  federally funded research and development center not closely affiliated  with the Air Force to develop a plan to establish a separate military  department responsible for DOD national security space activities.
