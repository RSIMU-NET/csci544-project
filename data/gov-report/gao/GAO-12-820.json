Additionally, state MFCUs investigate health care fraud in their state's Medicaid and CHIP programs.", "GAO was asked to provide information on the types of providers that are the subjects of fraud cases. This report identifies provider types who were the subjects of fraud cases in (1) Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP that were handled by federal agencies, and changes in the types of providers in 2005 and 2010; and (2) Medicaid and CHIP fraud cases that were handled by MFCUs. To identify subjects of fraud cases handled by federal agencies, GAO combined data from three agency databases--HHS-OIG, USAOs, and DOJ's Civil Division--and removed duplicate subject data. GAO also reviewed public court records, such as indictments, to identify subjects' provider types because the USAOs and DOJ Civil Division data did not consistently include provider type. To describe providers involved in fraud cases handled by the MFCUs, GAO collected aggregate data from 10 state MFCUs, which represented the majority of fraud investigations, indictments, and convictions nationwide."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to 2010 data from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), 10,187 subjects--individuals and entities involved in fraud cases--were investigated for health care fraud, including fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). These subjects included different types of providers and suppliers--such as physicians, hospitals, durable medical equipment suppliers, home health agencies, and pharmacies--that serve Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP beneficiaries. For criminal cases in 2010, medical facilities--including medical centers, clinics, or practices--and durable medical equipment suppliers were the most-frequent subjects investigated. Hospitals and medical facilities were the most-frequent subjects investigated in civil fraud cases, including cases that resulted in judgments or settlements.", "Subjects of criminal cases: Many of the 7,848 criminal subjects in 2010 were medical facilities or durable medical equipment suppliers, representing about 40 percent of subjects of criminal cases. Similarly, in 2005, medical facilities and durable medical equipment suppliers accounted for 41 percent of criminal case subjects. Data from 2010 show that most of the subjects were in cases that were not referred by HHS-OIG to DOJ for prosecution (85 percent). Of the subjects whose cases were pursued, most were found guilty or pled guilty or no contest.", "Subjects of civil cases: Over one-third of the 2,339 subjects of civil cases in 2010 were hospitals and medical facilities. In 2010, about 35 percent more subjects were investigated in civil fraud cases than in 2005. Nearly half of the subjects of 2010 cases were pursued. Among the subjects whose cases were pursued, 55 percent resulted in judgments or settlements.", "Additionally, data from HHS-OIG show that nearly 2,200 individuals and entities were excluded from program participation for health care fraud convictions and other reasons, including license revocation and program-related convictions. About 60 percent of those individuals and entities excluded were in the nursing profession. Pharmacies or individuals affiliated with pharmacies were the next-largest provider type excluded, representing about 7 percent of those excluded.", "According to data GAO collected from 10 state Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCU), over 40 percent of the 2,742 subjects investigated for health care fraud in Medicaid and CHIP in 2010 were home health care providers and health care practitioners. Of the criminal cases pursued by these MFCUs, home health care providers comprised nearly 40 percent of criminal convictions and 45 percent of subjects sentenced in 2010. Civil health care fraud cases pursued by these MFCUs in 2010 resulted in judgments and settlements totaling nearly $829 million. Pharmaceutical manufacturers were to pay more than 60 percent ($509 million) of the total amount of civil judgments and settlements.", "GAO provided a draft of the report to DOJ and HHS.

Together, these programs accounted for approximately  $849.2 billion in federal expenditures. The federal government allocated  at least $608 million in funding to investigate and prosecute cases of  alleged health care fraud in health care programs that year.different types of providers and suppliers who serve Medicare, Medicaid,   Many  and CHIP beneficiaries are subjects of fraud cases, including physicians,  hospitals, durable medical equipment suppliers, home health agencies,  and pharmacies. Because their size and complexity make them  vulnerable to fraud, we have designated Medicare and Medicaid as high- risk programs. According to the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), common health care  fraud schemes include providers or suppliers billing for services or  supplies not provided or not medically necessary, purposely billing for a  higher level of service than that provided, misreporting data to increase  payments, paying kickbacks to providers for referring beneficiaries for  specific services or to certain entities, and stealing providers\u2019 or  beneficiaries\u2019 identities.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014an agency within  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that oversees  Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP\u2014along with HHS-OIG, and the  Department of Justice (DOJ)\u2014including the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI)\u2014work together to investigate and prosecute alleged  fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. For example, CMS, HHS-OIG,  and DOJ officials comprise Medicare Strike Force teams, which are  designed to use data analysis techniques to identify and stop Medicare  fraud. Additionally, these agencies coordinate with state Medicaid Fraud  Control Units (MFCU), which are primarily responsible for investigating  and prosecuting fraud within their state Medicaid programs.", "HHS-OIG, FBI, and MFCUs receive referrals of alleged fraud from a  variety of sources, including program beneficiaries, state agencies, law  enforcement, and whistleblowers. CMS and its contractors report alleged  fraud cases to HHS-OIG for investigation. HHS-OIG typically refers  investigations of the alleged fraud cases that it believes have merit to  DOJ for civil litigation or criminal prosecution because it does not have  the authority to prosecute health care fraud cases. MFCUs\u2014which are  generally located in the state offices of the Attorney General\u2014investigate  and typically prosecute health care fraud cases under state laws.  Additionally, MFCUs coordinate with HHS-OIG and DOJ on certain fraud  cases. DOJ and its divisions may also receive referrals of alleged fraud  through civil cases filed by individuals under the False Claims Act (FCA).  The outcomes of health care fraud cases can include civil and criminal  penalties. Civil penalties include monetary settlements, and criminal  penalties include incarceration sentences, fines, and restitution. HHS-OIG  also can impose administrative penalties on providers\u2014including  imposing a civil monetary penalty, or excluding a provider from  participating in federal health care programs. In fiscal year 2011, the  federal government won or negotiated approximately $2.4 billion in  judgments and settlements related to health care fraud.", "Concerns have been raised about the need to better detect and combat  fraud in federal health care programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and  CHIP. Some of these concerns have specifically focused on determining  whether resources to fight fraud are being targeted toward the types of  health care providers committing the most fraud. This report provides  information on individuals or entities involved in health care fraud cases in  Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. These individuals and entities are  generally referred to as \u201csubjects\u201d of health care fraud cases. In this  report, we identify: (1) subjects of health care fraud cases by provider  type involving Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP that were handled by federal  agencies, and changes in the types of providers in 2005 and 2010; and  (2) subjects of health care fraud cases by provider type for those cases  involving Medicaid or CHIP that were handled by MFCUs, and changes in  the types of providers investigated in fraud cases in 2005 and 2010.", "To identify subjects of health care fraud cases\u2014including referrals,  investigations, prosecutions, and outcomes\u2014by provider type for cases  involving Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP that were handled by federal  agencies, and to examine changes in the types of provider in 2005 and  2010, we obtained data on closed health care fraud cases from HHS- OIG, DOJ\u2019s Civil Division, and the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys  (EOUSA), which provides administrative support for the 94 U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Offices (USAO). We obtained data on fraud cases involving  Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP\u2014including any cases that were closed in  calendar years 2005 and 2010. However, due to limitations with some of  the 2005 data, our analysis of the changes in the types of providers in  2005 and 2010 is limited. Each fraud case can have more than one  subject, and our analysis focuses on the subjects of the fraud cases  rather than the cases themselves. Additionally, a fraud subject can be  either an entity itself or an individual affiliated with an entity. The data  we received from HHS-OIG pertained only to health care fraud in  Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP; however, data we received from the  USAOs and DOJ\u2019s Civil Division may also include other federal health  care program fraud as well as fraud in the private sector as the databases  used to track fraud cases do not capture fraud exclusively in Medicare,  Medicaid, and CHIP. Since many fraud cases are handled jointly by HHS- OIG, USAOs, and DOJ\u2019s Civil Division (and entered into each agency\u2019s  own database), we identified fraud case subjects that were in more than  one data set we received by comparing subject information to the extent  possible. However, it is possible that our analysis still includes some  duplication in fraud case subjects. With the exception of one analysis at  the agency level, we excluded duplicate data so that each subject was  only included once. The data we received from HHS-OIG contained  information on the provider type of the subject; provider type is not a  required field in the USAOs database, consequently, the USAOs do not  consistently have provider type information, and DOJ\u2019s Civil Division does  not collect data by provider type. In order to identify the provider type of  subjects in the USAO and DOJ Civil Division data that were missing  information, it was necessary for us to conduct an extensive search of  publicly available court records to identify the provider type for 2,470  subjects. We searched for the subjects in the Public Access to Court  Electronic Records (PACER) database and reviewed indictments, plea  agreements, and other court documents to obtain information on the  subject\u2019s provider type. After we identified the provider types for data we  received from USAOs and DOJ\u2019s Civil Division and after reviewing the  data on provider types in the HHS-OIG data, we aggregated the various  provider types into broad categories, which are described in appendix I.  We also reviewed agency documents and conducted interviews with  officials from HHS-OIG and DOJ\u2014including the Civil and Criminal  Divisions, FBI, and EOUSA\u2014to obtain information about health care  fraud cases and the databases used to track these cases. To assess the  reliability of the data, we interviewed officials from these agencies to  discuss the quality of the data we obtained, reviewed relevant  documentation, and examined the data for reasonableness and internal  consistency. We found these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report (see app. I for additional information about our  methodology).", "To identify subjects of health care fraud cases by provider type for those  cases involving Medicaid or CHIP that were handled by state MFCUs,  and to examine changes in the types of providers investigated and  prosecuted for fraud in 2005 and 2010, we collected aggregate data on  closed fraud cases from 10 state MFCUs for 2005 and 2010. These  MFCUs were selected because, collectively, they accounted for the  majority of open fraud investigations, fraud indictments or charges, fraud  convictions, amounts recovered from civil settlements and judgments,  MFCU grant expenditures, and number of MFCU staff in fiscal year  2010. The 10 selected MFCUs were in California, Florida, Illinois,  Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Texas, and  Virginia. We developed a standardized data-collection instrument based  on the HHS-OIG\u2019s Quarterly Statistical MFCU Report Template and  accompanying definitions. We received feedback on a draft of the data- collection instrument from officials from two MFCUs before finalizing it.  Although the data we received from the 10 MFCUs represent a majority of  fraud cases handled by all MFCUs nationwide, the data are not  generalizable to other states. The data we received represented actions  related to fraud cases that occurred only in the years we requested.  Each instance of fraud in the data submitted by the 10 MFCUs represents  one individual, facility, or organization that we refer to as the subject of  the fraud case. Fraud case subjects may be an individual, such as a  dentist or a nurse; an organization, such as a pharmaceutical  manufacturer; or a facility, such as a hospital. Several subjects may be  investigated in one fraud case; however, each subject in a fraud case is  counted separately. Additionally, for our analysis, we aggregated various  provider types into broad categories, which are described in appendix II.  Because the state MFCUs may work together on certain cases that cross  state lines, it is possible that duplicate data are included in our analysis.  We also conducted interviews with officials from CMS, the HHS-OIG\u2019s  Office of Evaluations and Inspections, and the National Association of  MFCUs to obtain information on fraud cases handled by the MFCUs. We  relied on the data as reported by the 10 MFCUs and did not  independently verify these data. However, we reviewed the data for  reasonableness and followed up with state officials for clarification when  necessary. On the basis of these activities, we determined these data  were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our report (see app. II for  additional information).", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2011 to September 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Additionally, HHS-OIG, the FBI, a USAO, and DOJ\u2019s  Criminal Division work jointly on health care fraud cases handled by  Medicare Strike Force teams. Health care fraud cases are opened by the  agencies either when they receive information about suspected fraudulent  activity from a source\u2014which can include program beneficiaries and CMS  and its contractors\u2014or if they proactively identify possible fraudulent  behavior through data analysis.

These qui tam  cases are handled by a USAO or DOJ\u2019s Civil Division, though they may  receive assistance in the investigation from HHS-OIG or the FBI. In other  fraud cases, if a fraud case is opened by HHS-OIG, the agency typically  conducts its investigation, determines whether the case has merit, and  refers the case to DOJ for criminal prosecution or civil litigation.
