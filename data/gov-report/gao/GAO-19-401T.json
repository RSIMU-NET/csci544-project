Confucius Institutes are partnerships between Chinese entities and schools in other countries, arranged and funded in part by Hanban, which seek to promote Chinese language and culture. There were 96 institutes located at colleges and universities in the United States as of January 2019. U.S. universities have also partnered with Chinese universities to establish degree-granting institutions in China approved by the Chinese government.", "School officials have noted these types of partnerships provide valuable educational, cultural, and other benefits. Some researchers, government officials, and others, however, have raised concerns about them, including about the contents of written agreements and the role of the Chinese government, which, according to the Department of State, has made efforts to restrict academic freedom and impose censorship at Chinese universities and other institutions. Some have expressed concern that U.S. universities partnering with the Chinese government may face similar restrictions.", "This testimony discusses funding, agreements, and operations of (1) Confucius Institutes in the United States and (2) U.S. universities in China.

Agreements between Hanban\u2014an affiliate of the Chinese Ministry of Education\u2014and U.S. colleges and universities generally describe similar activities, funding, and management, though institute operations vary in practice. Confucius Institutes receive funding from Hanban and U.S. schools, and do not receive direct federal funding. While 42 of 90 agreements contained language about the document being confidential, some were available online or upon request, and one-third of the 90 agreements explicitly addressed how U.S. school policies apply to the institutes. Officials GAO interviewed at 10 case study schools noted U.S. school policies apply to institutes at their schools. GAO also interviewed some researchers and others who expressed concern that the presence of Confucius Institutes could constrain campus activities and classroom content. For example, several suggested schools with institutes might avoid hosting events on topics that could include criticism of China, such as Taiwan or Tibet, so as to not offend Chinese partners. School officials offered examples to illustrate that these concerns did not apply to their institute, noting institutes had sponsored events on such topics. Nonetheless, school officials and others suggested ways schools could improve institute management, such as renegotiating agreements to clarify U.S. schools' authority and making agreements publicly available.", "In August 2016, GAO reported that U.S. universities that have partnered with Chinese universities to establish degree-granting institutions in China emphasize academic freedom, but face internet censorship and other challenges. The 12 U.S. universities GAO reviewed generally reported receiving support for their institutions in China from Chinese government entities and universities, and 5 reported receiving U.S. government funding, mostly federal financial aid to U.S. students. Universities' agreements with Chinese partners or other policies GAO reviewed generally included language protecting academic freedom or indicating their institution in China would adhere to U.S. standards. University members generally indicated that they experienced academic freedom, but also stated that internet censorship, self-censorship, and other factors presented constraints. At several universities that lacked uncensored internet access, faculty and students noted that, as a result, they faced challenges teaching, conducting research, and completing coursework at that time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s work on U.S-Chinese  higher education partnerships, including Confucius Institutes at U.S.  colleges and universities and U.S. universities that have partnered with  Chinese universities to establish degree-granting institutions in China.  These types of U.S.-Chinese higher education partnerships have been  the subject of public debate and discussion in recent years. Some have  noted that these partnerships can provide valuable educational and  cultural resources, such as Chinese language training that may otherwise  not be available, while also enhancing research opportunities. Others  have raised various concerns, such as about the contents and  confidentiality of written agreements between U.S. universities and  Chinese partners, and about the role or influence of Hanban, an affiliate  of the Chinese Government\u2019s Ministry of Education, in these partnerships.  As the Department of State has reported, the Chinese government has  engaged in activities within China to restrict academic freedom and  impose censorship at Chinese universities. China has increased efforts to  monitor internet usage and control internet content, and has taken  measures to restrict freedoms of speech, religion, and assembly,  according to the Department of State. Some have expressed concern that  U.S. universities partnering with the Chinese government may face such  restrictions.", "My testimony summarizes the findings from our February 2019 report on  Confucius Institutes in the United States, and our August 2016 report on  U.S. universities in China. Accordingly, this testimony discusses (1)  funding, agreements, and operations of Confucius Institutes in the United  States and (2) funding, agreements, and experiences of students and  faculty at U.S. universities in China.", "To conduct the work for our review of Confucius Institutes in the United  States, we reviewed 90 agreements signed between U.S. schools and  Hanban to identify how these documents address issues such as funding,  activities, and management. We also interviewed stakeholders, including  school officials, researchers, and others to gather perspectives on the  institutes. Stakeholders interviewed included school administrators,  Confucius Institute directors, and faculty from a non-generalizable sample  of 10 case study schools; researchers and representatives from various  organizations involved in higher education issues; officials at several  schools that closed or ultimately declined to establish a Confucius  Institute; and officials from the Departments of Defense, Education, and  State. For our 2016 review of U.S. universities in China, we reviewed 12  U.S. universities that, at the time of our review, we identified as having  partnered with Chinese universities to establish degree-granting  institutions in China. We developed and administered a questionnaire  asking for information on funding and other topics, and obtained and  reviewed nine agreements between U.S. universities and their Chinese  partners, as well as student and faculty handbooks and other university  policies. In addition, we interviewed administrators from all 12  universities, and visited five universities in China, where we interviewed  administrators and faculty; conducted discussion groups with U.S. and  Chinese students; and reviewed facilities, services, and other aspects of  these institutions. We also interviewed officials from the Department of  Education.

The first Confucius Institute in the United States was established in 2004,  and there were approximately 525 institutes worldwide as of September  2018, according to Hanban\u2019s website. Most Confucius Institutes in the  United States are based at colleges and universities. We identified 96  Confucius Institutes in operation at U.S. colleges and universities in 44  states and the District of Columbia as of January 2019. See our February  2019 report on Confucius Institutes for a full list of the schools and their  locations.

The Chinese government requires  that U.S. universities seeking to establish such an education arrangement  in China partner with a Chinese university, and establish written  agreements with the Chinese university defining the academics,  governance, operations, finances, and other aspects of the arrangement.  At the time of our review in August 2016, the 12 institutions we reviewed  ranged from fewer than 40 to more than 3,000 students.

Management of the institutes varies by school. Some  Confucius Institutes at U.S. schools are part of an academic department  or an administrative office, while others report directly to the school  president or other school leadership. Confucius Institute personnel  generally consist of a Confucius Institute director or directors, Confucius  Institute teachers, and a board of directors. At the 10 case study schools  that were part of our review, the Confucius Institute director was a U.S.  school employee\u2014either a school administrator, faculty member, or  professional hired to manage the Confucius Institute.

These officials  noted that because Hanban pays the salaries of Confucius Institute  teachers who teach language and assist with Chinese programs at  schools, sparing the schools these costs, these schools could offer  Chinese language courses even when enrollment was low.

They also expressed views  on Confucius Institute teacher hiring, and quality of those teachers.", "Several school officials, researchers, and others we interviewed  expressed concerns that hosting a Confucius Institute could limit events  or activities critical of China\u2014including events at the institute and  elsewhere on campus. Two officials who expressed these concerns were  faculty members at one case study school who have not applied for  Confucius Institute funding for a research project because they believed  Hanban would not approve of the topic. In contrast, officials at multiple  case study schools noted that U.S. school faculty members make all  decisions regarding conference themes, guest speakers, and topics for  events at their institute. Officials at some schools offered examples of  events and activities their Confucius Institute had sponsored that  addressed topics that could be considered critical of China. Specifically,  they reported hosting a conference discussing intellectual property in  relation to China and events on Tibet, territorial disputes in the South  China Sea, and religion in China.", "In addition, multiple researchers and others we spoke with expressed  concerns with the Confucius Institute teacher selection process whereby  Hanban or the Chinese partner school accepts initial applications from  potential Confucius Institute teachers and proposes candidates to the  U.S. school. These individuals noted that the Chinese entities could use  such a process to effectively screen out candidates based on  inappropriate criteria, such as political or religious affiliation. Officials we  interviewed at multiple case study schools that had Confucius Institute  teachers, however, expressed no concerns about the process for hiring  teachers. School officials stated that they believed their school generally  controlled the hiring process and were thus satisfied with it. Most officials  emphasized that while institute teachers often come from the Chinese  partner university, and are referred by the partner or Hanban, the U.S.  school makes the final hiring selection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Suggestions for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Case study school officials, researchers, and others also suggested ways  to improve the institutes, including changing the language in agreements  governing Confucius Institutes and policies for sharing these agreements.  These parties stated that schools should remove the confidentiality  section of their agreements and make the agreements publicly available  online. Several researchers and others also emphasized that making the  agreements publicly available would dispel questions and concerns over  their contents. Several representatives of higher education institutions  told us that they believed the confidentiality language in agreements was  unnecessary and schools should consider removing it from their  agreements. A few case study school officials, researchers, and others  we interviewed stated that schools should include stronger language in  the agreements to make it clearer that the U.S. school has executive  decision-making authority.", "School officials and others we interviewed suggested other steps that  schools could take to ensure they protect against undue Chinese  influence. Several school officials stated that the schools should clearly  delineate between the Confucius Institutes\u2019 programs and their own  Chinese language programs, such as by locating the institute apart from  these departments within the school\u2019s organizational structure. A few  school officials and others noted that Confucius Institute teachers should  not teach credit-bearing courses, even if those courses use curriculum  developed by the school\u2019s language department. One school  administrator, who stated that his school\u2019s Confucius Institute would  never have a Chinese assistant director because the position suggests an  excessive degree of Chinese influence, recommended that other schools  remove the Chinese assistant director position from their institutes.  Officials from two case study schools and others we interviewed stated  that schools should organize events through the institute specifically  intended to address what some might perceive as a topic sensitive to  Chinese interests to demonstrate the school and institute were not  subject to undue Chinese influence."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Universities in China Emphasized Academic Freedom but Faced Internet Censorship and Other Constraints", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Universities Reported Receiving Support from Chinese Entities, with Limited U.S. Support", "paragraphs": ["In August 2016, we reported that the 12 U.S. universities we reviewed  generally reported receiving support for their institutions in China from  their Chinese partner universities and from Chinese government entities,  with limited funding from U.S. government agencies and private donors.

For example, several faculty members asserted that neither they nor their  colleagues would tolerate any academic restrictions, and one faculty  member told us he and his colleagues intentionally introduced class  discussions on politically sensitive topics to test whether this would trigger  any complaints or attempted censorship. Students also generally  indicated that they experienced academic freedom and could study or  discuss any topic. Some students who had also studied or knew others  who studied at Chinese universities contrasted their experiences at a U.S.  institution in China, noting that they could have interactive dialogue with  faculty, discuss sensitive topics, and freely access information at the U.S.  institution but not at a Chinese university.

At several universities  that lacked uncensored internet access, students and faculty told us that,  as a result, they sometimes faced challenges teaching, conducting  research, and completing coursework. For example, one faculty member  told us that she sometimes asked others outside of mainland China to  conduct internet research for her because they can access information  she could not. Several students at another university told us their ability to  conduct academic research was constrained by the internet limitations.", "We also reported in August 2016 that additional factors that could create  obstacles to learning at U.S. universities in China, including self- censorship and constraints specific to Chinese students.", "Administrators, faculty, and students representing more than half of  the universities we reviewed gave examples of self-censorship,  including some cases where individuals were advised by teachers or  others in positions of authority to avoid certain topics. For example, an  administrator at one university noted that he believed it was advisable,  as a guest of China, to refrain from insulting China, while an  administrator at another university noted that the university advised  teachers to avoid discussing sensitive subjects in class.", "In addition, we found that some conditions specific to Chinese  students may constrain their academic experience. For example,  some noted that Chinese students may know or suspect that their  Chinese classmates are government or Communist Party monitors  and will report on whatever the students say. An administrator at one  university told us that he assumed there were Chinese students and  faculty in the institution who reported to the government or the  Communist Party about the activities of other Chinese students.  Faculty members at several universities told us that they understood  there were Chinese students in class who intended to report on the  speech of faculty or Chinese students.", "Finally, we also observed that three of the 12 universities we reviewed  that were approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education as having  independent legal status shared characteristics that may be correlated  with greater academic and other freedoms on campus.
