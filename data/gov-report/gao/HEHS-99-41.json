Program officials, contracting experts, and others\u2014prompted in part by a rise in the volume of contracting in services not previously privatized\u2014have raised concerns about states\u2019 efforts to privatize social services. In addition, some Members of Congress have expressed concern that the movement of state program managers and other employees to take similar jobs with contractors, a process often called the \u201crevolving door,\u201d may affect the capacity of state governments to manage public services and may give an unfair advantage to contractors employing former public officials. Members of Congress also have questioned the extent to which states have adopted strategies to hold contractors accountable for program results. Recent changes in social service privatization have prompted a growing need to assess the strength of ethics policies intended to protect open and fair contracting and examine states\u2019 capacity to ensure program accountability.", "To follow up on our previous report and testimony, you raised several issues about the revolving door and its relationship to competitive social service contracting as well as the capacity of the states to hold contractors accountable for program results. Therefore, you asked us to (1) identify the extent to which government employees have moved to positions at social service contractors and the impact such movement has had on the management of publicly provided social services; (2) determine the relative success in winning contracts by contractors who hired state employees and contractors who did not; (3) examine state ethics laws, policies, and enforcement approaches that address the employment of former state employees and other related issues; and (4) examine state practices for holding contractors accountable for achieving program results through contracted services.", "As agreed with your offices, we focused on state-administered child support enforcement and TANF given the significant level of federal funds that support these services, the states\u2019 use of new and different types of contracting, and the states\u2019 reliance on a mix of for-profit and not-for-profit contractors. To address these issues, among other steps, we performed detailed work in four states with diverse policies and program practices\u2014Arkansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Texas. In these states, we examined employee movement into positions with social service contractors, contract awards, ethics laws and enforcement, and practices intended to hold contractors accountable for program results.

Federally funded social service programs generally support the financial, employment, and other public assistance needs of children and families. In recent years, the amount of contracting for state-administered social services has increased and the nature of privatization has changed significantly. State governments have increased their spending on privatized services, and strong support from state political leaders and high-level program managers has helped prompt new privatization initiatives. Recent changes in social service privatization have also been spurred by changes in federal legislation. As a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193), for example, states are now permitted under TANF to privatize eligibility determinations, a function traditionally performed by state governments. To help ensure program accountability in federally funded social service programs, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has responsibility for overseeing state performance. With the fundamental changes in the magnitude and nature of social service privatization, states continue to face new challenges\u2014utilizing competitive markets, developing performance-based contracts, and enhancing program accountability\u2014that program officials, contracting experts, and others believe warrant continued focus.", "When contracting for social services, states often seek to achieve fair and open competition among those who submit contract proposals. To protect opportunities for all qualified contractors to compete openly and fairly for government business, states may, among other things, limit certain activities of former government employees seeking employment with private organizations and prohibit financial, programmatic, and other conflicts of interest. Studies have specified that state ethics policies should apply to a broad range of public employees, including legislators, political appointees, program managers, and others involved in the contracting process, while minimizing to the extent possible the limits placed on the discretion of state employees to choose public or private employment.", "State governments and social service contractors often work in tandem to provide diverse program services. In response to state RFPs, contractors submit proposals they believe address state needs. Contractors recruit and hire qualified specialists to maximize their competitive positions, while at the same time government employees exercise their prerogatives in an open labor market to pursue private sector careers where they can apply their talents in return for pay and benefits commensurate with their experience and expertise. In this way, social service contractors make use of a flexible labor pool in their attempts to meet state service needs. While these practices may benefit states and social service contractors, from another perspective, the movement of government employees to work for contractors may also reduce the capacity of states to manage public services and may confer unfair advantages to certain offerors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Able to Replace Departing Program Managers, but Loss of Information Technology Staff Was More Troublesome", "paragraphs": ["Although many child support enforcement and TANF senior program managers left their positions from 1993 to 1998, about a quarter of them left to take positions with social service contractors.

The loss of these employees resulted in longer-term program impacts than did the loss of senior program managers in other states. In those instances when Texas could not replace the IT personnel it had lost, state officials said they had to contract for IT services at a cost higher than would have been incurred if such services had been performed by government employees.

This is not true, however, with respect to Medicaid. The Congress incorporated conflict-of-interest provisions into state Medicaid plan requirements in 1979, when legislation was enacted authorizing greater use of health maintenance organizations. As a condition of state participation in Medicaid, states must have or enact provisions that require anyone involved in Medicaid-related contracting to be subject to conflict-of-interest requirements similar to, or at least as stringent as, those applicable to federal employees.
