Historically, the  military services and other DOD components, such as the Missile  Defense Agency, have developed space capabilities separately, and in  some cases collaboratively, to meet different warfighter needs, and each  has their own acquisition workforce to support these efforts.", "Space programs and the acquisition functions necessary to develop them  have faced challenges over the years. We have previously found that  fragmentation and overlap in DOD space acquisition management and  oversight contributed to long-standing problems of cost overruns and  schedule delays. For example, we reported that the Global Positioning  System lacked a single authority responsible for synchronizing the  various functions that must occur for the system to operate effectively.  This diffused leadership contributed to a decade-long gap in the military\u2019s  ability to use the updated Global Positioning System signal after its  satellites were launched. In December 2017, we found that the new  ground system\u2014the Next Generation Operational Control System\u2014 remained at risk for further delays and cost growth, and that the Air Force  has begun a second new program to deliver an interim, limited capability.", "DOD\u2019s oversight of its space activities is evolving.

We obtained available data, as of  December 31, 2017, from organizations that perform space acquisition  activities since DOD-wide comprehensive data were not available. We  interviewed the Directors of Acquisition Career Management from the  military services to identify space organizations, and then met with  officials from each organization to identify the current space acquisition  programs and obtain workforce data. Military and civilian personnel data  in the report reflect those personnel that spent 50 percent or more of their  work time on space acquisitions. Contractor and FFRDC personnel data  are presented in terms of the number of full-time equivalents and staff- years of technical effort equivalents, respectively. To assess the reliability  of these data, we discussed the data and sources used to compile the  data with DOD officials, reviewed the data for logical inconsistencies, and  compared the data when possible to other sources, such as DOD briefing  documents. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable to provide  estimates of the general size and mix of the space acquisition workforce.", "To assess any challenges DOD faces in hiring, staffing, and retaining its  space acquisition workforce, we interviewed space acquisition officials  from multiple levels within DOD, the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy.  We also met with officials from a non-generalizable sample of 10 DOD  space acquisition programs.

However, as we found in July 2016, space  systems are different from other acquisitions in some ways. For  example, space has more programs of joint interest than other areas, and  includes varied stakeholders, such as civil agencies and multiple  services. According to officials, in developing space systems once a  satellite is launched, if there are problems it is essentially impossible to  change the hardware, and software changes may not be an option. In  addition, space programs typically use cutting-edge technologies that  have to withstand the harsh space environment. Such technologies are  rarely available as off-the-shelf systems from the commercial market and  must be developed following a specific process overseen by specially- trained DOD acquisition personnel.", "Data from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and  Sustainment\u2019s Office of Human Capital Initiatives show that, as of June  2018, DOD employed about 170,000 military and civilian personnel who  are designated as acquisition personnel and are responsible for acquiring  weapon systems, such as aircraft, ships, tanks, and space systems. DOD  tracks the characteristics, education, training, and experience of these  acquisition personnel in DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce data system\u2014Data  Mart\u2014where they are tracked as belonging to 1 of 15 acquisition career  fields. Table 1 shows a list of these acquisition career fields.", "Contractor and FFRDC personnel often support DOD acquisition efforts.  For the purpose of this report, \u201ccontractor\u201d refers to support service  contractors who provide technical and administrative support rather than  prime contractors who develop and produce weapon systems or  products. FFRDCs are not-for-profit entities sponsored and funded  primarily by DOD to fulfill research and development, engineering, and  analytic needs that cannot be met as effectively by existing government  or contractor personnel. Nonprofit, university-affiliated, or private industry  organizations operate the FFRDCs through contracts or other  agreements with federal agencies. DOD procures FFRDC services by  staff years of technical effort. The total amount of FFRDC services time  that DOD is permitted to obtain is set annually by Congress. For fiscal  year 2018, DOD was authorized to use available funds for FFRDCs for  not more than 6,030 staff years of technical effort. Authorized staff years  of technical effort are allocated among the military services\u2019 organizations  that act as the primary sponsors for each FFRDC, which then prioritize  what work the FFRDC will perform according to the allocation level  received. In general, managers in the contractor and FFRDC  organizations direct the daily activities of their respective personnel, while  DOD military and civilian personnel oversee their work.", "Over the years, GAO has highlighted the importance of workforce  management. Since 2001, GAO has included strategic human capital  management as a government-wide high-risk area. More recently, we  found that having the right workforce mix with the right skill sets is critical  to achieving DOD\u2019s mission, and that it is important for DOD, as part of its  strategic workforce planning, to conduct gap analyses of its critical skills  and competencies. Strategic workforce planning\u2014an integral part of  human capital management\u2014is an iterative, systematic process that  helps organizations determine if they have staff with the necessary skills  and competencies to accomplish their strategic goals.

According to the military services\u2019 Directors of  Acquisition Career Management, DOD manages its acquisition workforce  by career field, such as program management and engineering, and not  by the type of product being acquired, such as space systems. They told  us that, in their view, the acquisition skills needed for an acquisition  program\u2014such as those for program management, engineering, and  contracting\u2014are largely the same regardless of the product type.  However, officials acknowledged that it takes some time for personnel to  learn the nuances of acquiring a specific type of product.", "We identified three factors that hinder DOD\u2019s ability to collect  comprehensive data on its space acquisition workforce. Together, they  impede DOD from maintaining a complete and accurate understanding of  the size, mix, and location of its space acquisition workforce.", "DOD does not maintain a complete list of its space acquisition  programs. Officials from the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air  Force for Acquisition and the service-level acquisition career managers  told us that DOD does not maintain a list of the universe of space  acquisition programs. In addition, the budget document that DOD submits  to Congress specific to space programs, which could possibly serve as  an alternative source of such information, identifies programs that have  large amounts of funding by name, but aggregates information for smaller  programs without identifying them individually.", "While DOD does not maintain a complete list of space acquisition  programs, during the course of our review we found that the military  services were generally able to identify space acquisition programs. DOD  does have a definition of space systems. Specifically, according to a DOD  Directive, space systems include all systems related to making a space  capability operational\u2014that is programs acquiring satellites, satellite  ground systems (including satellite control and data processing),  receivers/user segments (including terminals and radios), and launch  systems\u2014but specifies that terminals that are embedded as part of a  platform (i.e. aircraft, ship, or tank) are excluded. However, DOD  officials had difficulty identifying some programs, particularly those in the  user segment. For example, the Air Force\u2019s Space Fence program, which  is developing ground radar as a part of the space surveillance network  that detects and tracks space objects, is included as a space program in  DOD\u2019s budget documents. Officials from the Program Executive Office  that staffs personnel to the program initially told us they did not consider it  a space program since it is a series of ground-based radars. They  subsequently determined that it is a space program since the radar will  track space objects and provide data for space situational awareness.", "DOD data systems are not currently configured to identify space  acquisition personnel. We examined three data sources that have  information on the different personnel groups in the acquisition workforce,  and found that none of them can identify space acquisition personnel.", "The Office of Human Capital Initiatives within the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment uses  the Data Mart system to track the education, experience, and  training of military and civilian acquisition-coded personnel  working in the 15 acquisition functional career fields shown in  table 1. DOD has taken periodic steps to enhance the data  captured in this system. For example, in 2009 DOD began  tracking whether acquisition personnel in the business career field  were working on financial management or cost estimating. In  2014, DOD started to track personnel with expertise in contracting  with small businesses, and expanded its efforts to track personnel  with expertise in international acquisitions. However, this system  does not currently identify personnel staffed to or supporting  space acquisitions or any other type of product acquisition.", "The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness tracks contractor data using the Enterprise-wide  Contractor Manpower Reporting Application system to provide  DOD management information on contracted services obtained by  each military service and defense agency. The system includes  data on the number of hours of service each contractor provides  to the government, which could be used to approximate the  number of contractor personnel used to perform the work.  However, the system does not track the type of acquisition  programs being supported, such as space acquisition programs.  In addition, the data are self-reported by service contractors and  concerns exist regarding potential underreporting. For example,  we reported in March 2018 that the military services estimated  that the Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting  Application included fiscal year 2016 contractor data for 80  percent of Army contracts and 75 percent of Navy contracts; the  percentage of Air Force contracts was unknown.", "The Director of Laboratories and Personnel within the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering tracks  information on FFRDCs, such as the staff years of technical effort  provided each year, to ensure that DOD stays within its  congressionally mandated limit.

However, DOD officials told  us that sponsoring organizations do not identify what type of  acquisition program their respective FFRDC personnel support,  such as space acquisition programs.", "Personnel supporting space acquisitions are dispersed across a  variety of organizations and may also support non-space programs.  Each of the military services we reviewed has program executive offices,  research labs, or other organizations that support both space and non- space acquisitions. DOD officials told us that functional career field  leaders in each of the organizations, such as the engineering or the  contracting directorates, assign personnel to space or non-space  programs on an as-needed basis, which could make it difficult for DOD to  determine which and how many personnel should be included in the  space acquisition workforce. Five of the 10 space acquisition programs  we reviewed\u20141 Air Force, 1 Navy, and 3 Army\u2014were managed by  organizations that were primarily responsible for developing and  acquiring non-space programs.", "Air Force\u2014The Space Fence program is staffed by the Air Force  Life Cycle Management Center\u2019s Program Executive Office for  Battle Management.

This office primarily manages a  variety of information systems to provide tactical communication  for the service, which may or may not be space programs.  Officials told us that the three Army programs we reviewed were  also supported by other, separate Army organizations, such as the  Army Contracting Command for contracting support; the Army\u2019s  Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering  Center for engineering support; and the Army Materiel Command  for logistics support. These organizations provide support to space  and non-space programs on an as-needed basis.", "The Administration, Congress, and DOD are discussing a variety of  approaches for strengthening the government\u2019s space operations,  including the establishment of one or more new organizations. In June  2018 the President directed DOD to begin the process of establishing a  new military branch focused on space that is separate from and equal to  the other military departments, Army, Navy, and Air Force. In an August  2018 report to the Congress on the organizational and management  structure needed for the national space components, DOD described the  immediate steps that it plans to take to implement the President\u2019s  direction while waiting for Congressional authorization to create the new  military branch. These steps include establishing a new United States  Space Command to further its space warfighting capabilities, as well as  developing plans to establish a consolidated Space Development Agency  to rapidly develop and field next generation space capabilities. DOD has  described the general areas of focus planned for these new  organizations; however, many specifics are still to be determined. DOD  has announced that a committee of senior DOD leaders is expected to  identify which of the current space activities will be consolidated into  these new space organizations. In addition, the President\u2019s February  2019 Space Policy Directive now requires DOD to submit a legislative  proposal to establish a United States Space Force as a new armed  service within the Air Force. DOD announced it delivered a legislative  proposal to Congress on March 1, 2019.", "The lack of comprehensive information about DOD\u2019s space programs and  the acquisition personnel supporting those programs affects DOD\u2019s ability  to assess gaps in the overall capabilities of its space acquisition  workforce and determine whether it has sufficient internal capability and  critical knowledge or skills for its space acquisitions. Moreover, it hampers  DOD\u2019s ability to make decisions related to establishing the United States  Space Command, a new Space Development Agency, or potentially the  United States Space Force. This includes determining the appropriate  number and mix of acquisition personnel that are needed for the new  organizations, as well as which military and civilian personnel should be  assigned to them. According to federal internal control standards, an  agency, such as DOD, should have relevant, reliable, and timely  information in order to run and control operations, including managing the  workforce. Air Force Director of Acquisition Career Management  officials stated that having a process for identifying space acquisitions  personnel would be beneficial.

For example, the National Reconnaissance Office, which DOD officials  told us has a significant number of personnel working on space  acquisitions, is not included in our analysis. In addition, our count only  includes personnel that spent 50 percent or more of their time working on  space acquisitions; therefore any personnel who spent less than 50  percent of their time on space acquisitions was not included.  Furthermore, it is important to note that our data provide a snapshot of  the workforce as of December 31, 2017.

As DOD takes  steps toward establishing the United States Space Command, its Space  Development Agency, and potentially the United States Space Force, it  will be essential to understand the size, mix, and location of the space  acquisition workforce. However, DOD does not collect and maintain this  type of comprehensive data on its space acquisition workforce. Although  we were able to pull together information on the space acquisition  workforce, the data represent a snapshot of the workforce at one point in  time, and are not complete since acquisition personnel working on  National Reconnaissance Office space programs and those who spent  less than 50 percent of their time working on space acquisitions were not  included.", "Taking steps to identify and routinely track accurate information on space  acquisition programs and the organizations and personnel that support  those programs would provide several benefits to DOD. In particular, it  would better position DOD to assess whether it has the appropriate  number and mix of military, civilian, contractor, and FFRDC personnel  working on space acquisitions and to make adjustments if necessary.  Further, it would better position DOD to make decisions on which  acquisition personnel will support or transition into the United States  Space Command or the new Space Development Agency, since DOD  has not clearly defined what acquisition functions may or may not be  handled by these new organizations. Finally, comprehensive data on the  space acquisition workforce would also be beneficial to support DOD\u2019s  development of its legislative proposal regarding the establishment of the  United States Space Force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to DOD:  The Secretary of Defense should direct the military services and other  DOD components to identify the universe of space acquisition programs,  as well as the various organizations that support these programs, and  report this information to Congress. In doing so, DOD should implement  procedures to maintain and periodically update the list. (Recommendation  1)", "The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in  conjunction with the Under Secretaries of Defense for Research and  Development and for Personnel and Readiness, should collect and  maintain data on acquisition-coded military and civilian personnel that  support space acquisition programs and related activities\u2014including  those that may do so less than full time\u2014as well as track the contractor  and FFRDC workforce general levels of effort supporting space  acquisition programs and related activities and the total resources  annually committed to perform that work. (Recommendation 2)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. DOD  provided written comments (reproduced in appendix II) on our draft  report. In those comments, DOD concurred with our first recommendation  to identify the universe of space acquisition programs, as well as the  various organizations that support these programs, and report this  information to Congress. DOD did not concur with our draft second  recommendation to collect and maintain data on the space acquisition  workforce. DOD stated that the manner in which personnel data are  captured in its human resource and development systems makes it  difficult to identify, collect, and maintain data on the military and civilian  personnel working on space acquisition programs. Further, DOD raised  concerns over contractual limitations on collecting and maintaining data  on contractor and FFRDC personnel supporting space acquisitions. In  light of these concerns, we made changes to the draft recommendation.  We believe the language of our final recommendation will better facilitate  implementation by DOD.", "With regard to our second recommendation, we continue to believe that  taking steps to identify military and civilian personnel supporting space  acquisition programs would support DOD\u2019s strategic workforce planning,  particularly considering DOD\u2019s recent legislative proposal for establishing  the United States Space Force. For example, we acknowledge that the  current personnel data system used to track military and civilian  acquisition personnel has limitations, but we believe taking steps to make  minor modifications to the system to facilitate identifying and routinely  tracking accurate information on these two segments of the space  acquisition workforce would provide several benefits to DOD. Most  importantly, it would help DOD make decisions on how many and which  military and civilian acquisition personnel should be assigned to the new  space organizations\u2014namely the Space Development Agency, the  United States Space Command, and the United States Space Force. With  regard to DOD\u2019s comment that our recommendations do not recognize  that DOD personnel have been shifted into and out of space acquisition  programs, we recognize that acquisition personnel have been moved  across programs and support space and non-space acquisitions.  However, we continue to believe that DOD should have better information  on military and civilian acquisition personnel. In particular, knowing which  personnel have space acquisition backgrounds could enhance the  productivity and effectiveness of DOD\u2019s space acquisition efforts. As a  result, we did not make a change to our second recommendation as it  relates to military and civilian space acquisition personnel.", "However, in consideration of the concerns raised by DOD about tracking  data on contractor and FFRDC personnel who are supporting space  acquisition activities, we modified our second recommendation. It was not  our intention to have DOD undertake significant modifications to the  relevant contracts to obtain data on these segments of the space  acquisition workforce.  However, understanding the extent to which space  acquisition programs rely on contractor and FFRDC personnel for support  could be useful in helping DOD determine the right number and mix of  military and civilian personnel needed in the new space organizations. As  a result, we modified the language of our second recommendation to  focus on tracking the contractor and FFRDC workforce general levels of  effort supporting space acquisition activities and the resources spent to  obtain this assistance, rather than\u2014as we stated in our draft  recommendation\u2014tracking the individuals who perform such work.  However, we continue to believe that collecting and maintaining more  robust data on that workforce will support DOD\u2019s planning efforts and  better inform Congress.", "DOD also expressed concern that our report may be equating statements  of officials at the staff- and operational-level to military service- and DOD- level officials.

This report examines (1) what DOD knows about the size,  mix, and location of its space acquisition workforce, and (2) the  challenges, if any, DOD faces in hiring, staffing, and retaining space  acquisition workforce personnel. For the purpose of this report, we  defined the space acquisition workforce broadly to include military,  civilian, contractor, and Federally Funded Research and Development  Center (FFRDC) personnel working on space acquisition programs and  related efforts.", "To determine what DOD knows about the size, mix, and location of the  space acquisition workforce, we met with officials from DOD\u2019s Office of  Human Capital Initiatives, the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, and 4th  Estate\u2019s Director of Acquisition Career Management to obtain information  that is collected on the space acquisition workforce. We were told by each  of these officials that DOD does not have a group of personnel officially  designated as the space acquisition workforce. They stated that DOD has  separate mechanisms for collecting military, civilian, contractor, and  FFRDC workforce data and that none of these systems contained the  level of granularity we would need to identify all personnel working on  space acquisitions. Specifically, the sources we discussed were DOD\u2019s  Data Mart system, a central repository for military and civilian acquisition  workforce data, as well as workforce data systems maintained by DOD  components that feed into the Data Mart system; the Enterprise-wide  Contractor Manpower Reporting Application system for contractor  services data; and FFRDC data maintained by military components.", "We collected data on the size, mix, and location of the space acquisition  workforce from the space organizations performing space acquisition  activities. The Directors of Acquisition Career Management for the military  services and the 4th Estate defense agencies provided a list of  organizations that could be working on space acquisitions based on  DOD\u2019s 2017 space system definition, which states that a space system  includes all areas related to making a space capability operational\u2014that  is programs acquiring satellites, satellite ground systems (including  satellite control and data processing), receivers/user segments (including terminals and radios), and launch systems. It also specifies that terminals  are included unless they are embedded as part of a platform (i.e., aircraft,  ship, or tank).", "We contacted each of the identified space organizations to verify that they  had personnel working on space acquisitions based on this definition.  Three of the organizations we originally contacted stated their  organizations did not work on any space acquisition programs based on  the definition. We did not include these organizations in our data  gathering efforts. We also identified other organizations that worked on  space acquisitions through discussions with acquisition management  officials from the Army and included these organizations in our data  gathering efforts. We asked each space organization to identify the  number of military and civilian personnel working on space acquisition  activities for 50 percent or more of their work time as of December 31,  2017. We used the threshold of 50 percent or more of the time to be  consistent with the DOD definition of the acquisition workforce, which  requires personnel to work 50 percent or more of their work time on  acquisition activities to be counted as part of that workforce. DOD officials  could not identify the number of contractor and FFRDC personnel working  on space acquisitions. Therefore, for contractor and FFRDC personnel,  we asked for the number of full-time equivalencies and staff-years of  technical effort equivalencies, respectively, provided as support to space  acquisitions. We requested that the personnel data be categorized by  acquisition career field.", "We collected data from each DOD component as follows:  The Air Force Director of Acquisition Career Management provided  military and civilian workforce data from the Air Force\u2019s Acquisition Career  Management System that feeds into Data Mart for all Air Force  organizations where the entire organization works on space acquisitions.
