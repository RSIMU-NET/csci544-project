IAEA is using its safeguards authorities and conducting additional activities agreed to by Iran under the JCPOA to do so. Iran's commitments include limits on uranium enrichment levels and on enriched uranium inventories. IAEA is verifying and monitoring Iran's implementation of these commitments through a range of activities conducted by its Safeguards Department, such as inspecting Iran's nuclear facilities, analyzing environmental samples, and monitoring Iran's uranium mines and mills. Under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to provisionally apply the Additional Protocol, an agreement that will give IAEA's inspectors access to an expanded range of locations, including where the agency seeks assurance regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. The JCPOA also includes a mechanism in which participants to the agreement commit to resolve an access request from the agency within 24 days after the request is made.", "IAEA has identified the financial, human, and technical resources necessary to verify and monitor Iran's nuclear-related commitments in the JCPOA. IAEA has estimated that it needs approximately $10 million per year for 15 years in additional funding above its current safeguards budget for JCPOA verification. According to IAEA documents, this $10 million will be entirely funded through extra-budgetary contributions through 2016. IAEA officials said that the agency intends to propose that of the $10 million approximately $5.7 million for all Additional Protocol activities and inspector costs attributable to the JCPOA be funded through IAEA's regular budget after 2016; approximately $4.4 million will be supported through extra-budgetary contributions from member states, such as the United States. IAEA also plans to transfer 18 experienced inspectors to its Office of Safeguards Verification in Iran from other safeguards divisions and to hire and train additional inspectors. According to IAEA officials, existing safeguards technical resources are sufficient to implement the JCPOA.", "IAEA may face potential challenges in verifying and monitoring Iran's implementation of certain nuclear-related commitments in the JCPOA. According to current and former IAEA and U.S. officials and expert organizations, these potential challenges include (1) integrating JCPOA-related funding into IAEA's regular budget and managing human resources in the safeguards program, (2) access challenges depending on Iran's cooperation and the untested JCPOA mechanism to resolve access issues, and (3) the inherent challenge of detecting undeclared nuclear materials and activities. IAEA has identified mitigating actions, such as utilizing remote monitoring and cost-free experts to address potential understaffing of IAEA safeguards activities in other countries as additional experienced inspectors are transferred to work on Iran-related safeguards. In addition, according to IAEA and U.S. officials as well as a former IAEA official GAO interviewed, IAEA has improved its capabilities in detecting undeclared activity.

Most countries with a CSA have also  brought into force an Additional Protocol to their CSAs, which requires  that country to provide IAEA with a broader range of information on the  country\u2019s nuclear and nuclear-related activities. IAEA developed the  Additional Protocol to obtain additional information about and access to  countries\u2019 nuclear and nuclear-related activities as part of its response to  the discovery in 1991 of a clandestine nuclear weapons program in Iraq.  The Additional Protocol gives the agency\u2019s inspectors access to an  expanded range of locations, including those where the agency seeks to  assure the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities.  Undeclared nuclear material and activities are those a state has not  declared and placed under safeguards but is required to do so pursuant  to its CSA or Additional Protocol. Iran\u2019s CSA entered into force in May  1974. According to IAEA officials, Iran applied the Additional Protocol  beginning in December 2003, ceased to do so in February 2006, and has  been provisionally applying it since January 16, 2016. IAEA regards Iran\u2019s  provisional application as if the Additional Protocol were in force.", "IAEA implements safeguards through a range of activities and techniques  to help ensure that all nuclear material is where it was declared to be and  to verify that there was no misuse of the facility, no diversion of declared  nuclear material, and no undeclared nuclear material or activities.  Safeguards activities include on-site inspections, environmental sampling,  and remote monitoring. For example, to verify nondiversion of nuclear  material, IAEA inspectors count items (e.g., containers of uranium or  plutonium), measure attributes of these items (e.g., isotopic composition),  and compare their findings with records and declared amounts.  Inspectors typically verify the nuclear material inventory by reviewing a  facility\u2019s nuclear material accounting documentation (e.g., reports and  records) and through, for example, visual observation, radiation detection  and measurement, and application of seals and other identifying and  tamper-indicating devices, according to IAEA documents. Visual  observation allows inspectors to observe the processes within a location  and the equipment it contains, and to check the consistency of  observations with declarations. Inspection activities are supported by off- site safeguards activities, such as analysis of the environmental samples  collected during inspections, remote monitoring through the equipment  installed, analysis of commercial satellite imagery, and analysis of open  source documents, such as technical journals.", "IAEA may conduct three types of inspections pursuant to comprehensive  safeguards agreements: ad hoc, routine, and special inspections. For  example, IAEA may conduct ad hoc inspections to verify a state\u2019s initial  declaration under the CSA and any changes to these declarations.  Routine inspections give IAEA access to strategic points at a location to  verify, among other things, the location, identity, quantity, and  composition of all nuclear material subject to safeguards under the CSA.  Notification of inspections can be transmitted from 1 week to 24 hours in  advance or less. Routine inspections may also be unannounced. IAEA  may also conduct special inspections in certain circumstances, either in  addition to the routine or ad hoc inspection effort or involving access to  locations or information beyond those subject to a routine or ad hoc  inspection.", "The Additional Protocol also authorizes \u201ccomplementary access\u201d for  IAEA, which is access to nuclear sites and other locations related to a  state\u2019s nuclear fuel cycle\u2014beyond declared nuclear facilities that are  routinely subject to inspections under the CSA\u2014 including locations at  which nuclear fuel-cycle research and development not involving nuclear  material is carried out; manufacturing and import locations; and all  buildings on a nuclear site, including undeclared locations.", "IAEA may also negotiate \u201cmanaged access\u201d with a state to prevent the  dissemination of proliferation-sensitive information, meet safety or  physical protection requirements, or protect proprietary or commercially  sensitive information. According to an IAEA document, an example of  managed access is the designation by the operator, based on  arrangements made with IAEA, of the routes to be followed on a site to  prevent the exposure of inspectors to high levels of radiation or to protect  proprietary sensitive information associated with certain equipment.  Furthermore, managed access should not hinder IAEA inspectors or  prevent them from fulfilling the purposes of the complementary access\u2014 that is, the arrangements shall not preclude the agency from conducting  activities necessary to provide credible assurance of the absence of  undeclared nuclear material and activities at the location in question.", "IAEA plans inspections according to its reporting requirements and its  goals for timely detection.

A former U.S. official also said that Iran could clean up traces of nuclear  materials within 24 days and, even if it were unable to hide all evidence, it  could create enough ambiguity to preclude further investigation or action.  However, other officials and expert organizations said that the potential  for a 24-day access delay in the mechanism was generally not a concern.  Specifically, several former IAEA officials, some former U.S. officials, and  officials from some expert organizations noted that nuclear material, even  in trace amounts, cannot be cleaned up within that time.

If there is no agreement between Iran and IAEA, the Joint  Commission would, by consensus or a vote of 5 or more of its 8  members, advise on the necessary means to resolve the IAEA\u2019s  concerns. This process would not exceed 7 days. Iran would then  have 3 days to carry implement the necessary means.", "According to IAEA, these procedures are for the purpose of JCPOA  implementation and are without prejudice to the Comprehensive  Safeguards Agreement (CSA) and Additional Protocol. Generally, IAEA  notifies the state of a request for access (e.g., inspections and  complementary access), specifying the location, date and time, purpose,  and activities to be carried out as required in the CSA and Additional  Protocol. The state is to confirm the receipt of the notification and  facilitate IAEA\u2019s access. If there were issues related to the  implementation by the member state of its obligations under the CSA or  the Additional Protocol, the Director General would inform the Board of  Governors. In the case of Iran, if there were issues affecting the fulfilment   of JCPOA commitments, the Director General would inform the Board  and in parallel the Security Council, as appropriate. Should IAEA\u2019s  concerns regarding undeclared nuclear materials or activities, or activities  inconsistent with the JCPOA continue to be unresolved after engaging  with Iran, the access procedures set out above, from Section Q of Annex I  of the JCPOA, may be used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, William Hoehn (Assistant  Director), Alisa Beyninson, Antoinette Capaccio, R.
