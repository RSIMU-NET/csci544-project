For example, USTR's narrative reports make it difficult to understand the relative level of progress China made in each trade area in a given year. USTR reported issues that spanned nine trade areas and ranged from very specific issues to broader concerns; however, USTR's narrative reports make it difficult to ascertain specific changes or trends. GAO's systematic content analysis quantified the number, type, and disposition of trade issues and identified 180 individual compliance issues from 2002 to 2007. GAO analysis showed that China resolved a quarter of these issues, but made no progress on one-third of them. Also, GAO's analysis revealed that China's progress in resolving compliance issues varied by trade area and has been slowing over time, especially since 2004, when most progress was made. GAO could only partially determine the status of U.S. agencies' implementation of USTR's 2006 top-to-bottom report, which outlines broad objectives and priority goals for U.S.-China trade relations as well as specific action items. GAO found that key trade agencies made considerable progress implementing planned action items. They increased bilateral engagement with the Chinese and monitoring and enforcement capacity by increasing staffing levels and training opportunities, but staffing gaps and limited Chinese language capacity are challenges at some agencies. However, GAO could not determine agencies' progress toward achieving some U.S. objectives and goals identified in the report. USTR does not formally assess its progress or measure program results. The lack of linkages between U.S. objectives and planned action items and undefined terms make it difficult to assess whether the steps agencies described taking were effective.

China\u2019s WTO commitments are broad and  complex. Some require a specific action from China, such as to reduce or  eliminate certain tariffs. Others are less specific, such as those that require  China to adhere to WTO principles of nondiscrimination treatment of  foreign and domestic enterprises. Compliance issues also ranged in scope  from specific, relatively straightforward issues, such as the late issuance of  regulations, to broader and more crosscutting concerns, such as  questionable judicial independence, which are more difficult to resolve  and assess. The compliance issues can be the result of a range of factors,  from political resistance, to lack of technical capacity, to issues of  resources and coordination among Chinese ministries.", "It is important to note that not all compliance issues mentioned in USTR\u2019s  reports equally affect U.S. exports to China and that some issues are more  easily resolved than others. Thus, while USTR\u2019s reports identify key areas  of concern, the economic importance of many individual issues cannot be  easily quantified.

Our analysis shows that almost one-quarter of all compliance  issues mentioned between 2002 and 2007 were ultimately resolved (see fig.  1). See table 3 for examples of compliance issues that have been resolved.  In addition, none of the issues that were reportedly resolved resurfaced in  later reports.", "Furthermore, according to our analysis, USTR indicated that China made  progress, but did not resolve, about 40 percent of the compliance issues  reported. An issue was considered to be one in which China made some  progress if in any year USTR reported some type of improvement in the  situation, or if action taken by the Chinese improved but did not  completely resolve the issue. For example, if USTR reported that China  announced a commitment to take a certain action, such as revise a law,  which would eventually resolve the issue, then this was counted as  progress made in the year in which this commitment was made. Progress  can range in magnitude from small to substantial on a particular issue, as  well as in frequency of occurrence, with some issues making progress in  only 1 year and others in many years. For example, China made progress  in improving its inconsistent application and duplication in certification  requirements related to standards and technical regulations in only 1 of  the 6 years the issue was reported. In contrast, USTR reported that China  made progress toward improving transparency related to the  administration of its tariff rate quota system for bulk agricultural  commodities in 4 of the 6 years the issue was reported.", "Additionally, our analysis of USTR\u2019s reports showed that 37 percent of all  compliance issues mentioned from 2002 to 2007 achieved no resolution or  any progress over the entire period.

See table 4 for  examples of issues that made no progress over the period 2003 to 2007.", "In addition, our analysis showed that most compliance issues reported  over this period have persisted for many years. For instance, over 30  percent of all issues were mentioned in USTR\u2019s annual reports for at least  5 of the 6 years. In addition, less than 40 percent of all issues were present  in USTR\u2019s reports for 1 or 2 years; the remainder of issues, over 60  percent, was mentioned in the reports for at least 3 years or more   (see fig. 2).", "In addition to the issues that were resolved over the period 2002 to 2007,  we discovered that a number of the issues mentioned in the reports were  not explicitly resolved but were nevertheless dropped from the report. An  issue is considered dropped from the report if the issue was mentioned in  1 or more years of USTR\u2019s report, and not mentioned in a later year,  without any discussion about resolution of the issue. In total, 15 percent,  or 27 issues, were not explicitly resolved according to USTR\u2019s reports but  were dropped from subsequent years, with the ultimate status of such  issues remaining unknown. Some of these issues might remain outstanding  but USTR chose not to include them in the report for a particular reason,  or the issues no longer present concerns for U.S. industry and, therefore,  were excluded from the report.

For instance, the  number of issues resolved in each year has declined since 2004.

According to the testimony submitted to  USTR by one major trade association, the current concerns lie with more  complicated issues such as a deviation from the WTO\u2019s national treatment  principle, inadequate protection of intellectual property rights,  nontransparent legal and regulatory processes, and the development of  technical and product standards that may favor local companies.

Overall, while most trade areas have a  significant proportion of outstanding issues, the proportion of issues  where China is making progress or reaching resolution varies. For  instance, in the area of agriculture, the total number of compliance issues  mentioned each year is declining slightly, with a large number of issues,  about 85 percent, having either reached resolution or achieved some  progress from 2003 to 2007. Also, similar to the overall compliance  situation, the number of issues making progress or being resolved in the  area of agriculture seems to be declining. In fact, USTR mentioned some  specific sticking points such as transparency and selective intervention in  the market by China\u2019s regulatory authorities.

In addition, there are  an increasing number of compliance issues mentioned in this area, with a  peak in 2006. USTR noted in its 2007 annual report that while China has  put in place a relatively good set of laws and regulations aimed at  protecting intellectual property rights, some critical measures still need to  be revised, and China\u2019s overall enforcement of these laws has been  ineffective.

(See app. II, table 10, which identifies the 10  action items and the accompanying 25 implementing steps, along with  agency responsibilities and status.)", "We confirmed that key U.S. trade agencies took steps to increase bilateral  engagement with the Chinese and expanded the U.S. government\u2019s  capacity to enforce and negotiate by increasing staff levels in headquarters  and overseas and by improving training opportunities. While assessing  these agencies\u2019 implementation of the top-to-bottom report action items,  we also followed up on progress made addressing management challenges  identified in our 2004 report on U.S. monitoring and enforcement activities  related to China. We recommended that the key agencies take various  steps to improve performance management pertinent to China WTO  compliance efforts and that they undertake actions to mitigate the effects  of staff turnover in the agencies China WTO compliance units.

The U.S. government has utilized two formal consultative  mechanisms to address commerce, trade, and financial issues, both of  which demonstrated an emphasis on high-level, bilateral engagement.  First, the United States uses the JCCT, a forum for dialogue on bilateral  trade issues and a mechanism to promote commercial relations. This  forum had been elevated to a higher level after a 2003 meeting and  refocused to give greater attention to outstanding trade disputes. Second,  the United States and China created the SED in September 2006, as  another bilateral high-level forum to address the most important, long- term, strategic issues in the United States-China economic relationship.  The meeting of the SED, which is convened every six months, is led by a  U.S. Cabinet Official and a Chinese Vice Premier, and each dialogue  session comprises U.S. cabinet officials and Chinese ministers.", "The SED allows both governments to communicate at the highest levels  and with one voice on issues of long-term and strategic importance,  including issues that extend across multiple departments and agencies.  The United States has three core objectives for the SED: (1) to advance the  U.S.-China economic relationship by establishing new habits of  cooperation; (2) to accelerate China\u2019s next wave of economic transition;  and (3) to encourage China to act as a responsible global economic power.  According to Department of the Treasury officials, there are no formal  working groups associated with the SED. Rather, U.S. cabinet officials and  Chinese ministers determine strategic areas of focus for the intervening  six months between meetings of the SED. For example, at the first SED in  December 2006, civil aviation was selected. At second SED, product safety  was identified and in December 2007 at the third SED, energy and  environment was a strategic area of focus.", "According to some U.S. agency officials, there was confusion over the  purpose of the SED when, at the May 2007 SED meeting, the United States  used the meeting to discuss trade compliance issues. Officials told us that  they have since clarified the issue. Department of the Treasury officials  told us the JCCT focuses mostly on short-term trade issues, while the SED  focuses on solutions to long-term, strategic, economic issues (see table 7  below for list of JCCT work areas).", "USTR planned to strengthen and expand bilateral dialogues on numerous  current and potential problem areas, another key action item in the top-to- bottom report. The U.S. government held a number of bilateral dialogues  covering 8 different subject areas to address trade issues with China,  which demonstrated a continuing emphasis on bilateral engagement (see  app. II; table 10, which lists these dialogues). Many U.S. government  agencies engaged their Chinese counterparts on a multitude of topics such  as agricultural, environmental, labor, subsidies and standards, and  telecommunications issues. While some of these dialogues are very active  and have resulted in accomplishments such as China\u2019s acceding and  ratifying the World Intellectual Property Organization Internet Treaties in  2007, others dialogues have not yet been implemented. For instance, both  the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Labor  indicate they have not established formal dialogues with their Chinese  counterparts as planned.", "There are other means of bilateral engagement. For example, USDA  officials told us they prefer to handle issues with their Chinese  counterparts using science-based rationale. This often requires USDA  Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) to engage Chinese officials in technical  forums and through capacity building initiatives, even though USDA  participates in high-level JCCT working groups on agricultural and  sanitary and phytosanitary issues.", "The number of high-level meetings between senior U.S. and Chinese  officials has increased. For instance, the key economic and trade agencies  sent more cabinet and sub cabinet delegations to China to engage their  Chinese counterparts on trade issues; senior-level delegations to China  from various U.S. government agencies increased from 31 in 2006 to 63 in  2007, a level equal to about one a week. Furthermore, this represents a  substantial increase from 2002 and 2003, where there were 13 and 23 such  meetings, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Expanded Capacity to Enforce China\u2019s Trade Compliance and Improved Training, but Staffing Issues Persist", "paragraphs": ["Since the top-to-bottom report, the key trade agencies have increased staff  in headquarters and overseas to expand the U.S. government\u2019s capacity to  enforce China\u2019s trade compliance and to negotiate with China on trade  issues. They also increased staff training opportunities. GAO\u2019s prior work  recommended that the key trade agencies better manage their human  capital to enhance the U.S. government\u2019s China WTO compliance efforts  and mitigate the effects of staff turnover. Nevertheless, agency officials  told us they still experienced staffing gaps and turnover in key overseas  offices and shortfalls in language skills.", "Key trade agencies have continued to increase staff positions to meet the  demands of the U.S.-China trade relationship (see table 8). Staff resources  more than doubled at headquarters and in Beijing since 2004. The  estimated number of full-time equivalent staff in units most directly  involved with China trade compliance efforts increased from 60 in fiscal  year 2003 to 135 in fiscal year 2007. USTR doubled its staff positions in  headquarters from 5 to 10 positions and established an internal China  Enforcement Task Force that includes staff from USTR\u2019s Office of General  Counsel and the China Affairs Office to prepare and handle potential WTO  cases. USTR also added personnel in its China office to coordinate  collection and integration of information on current and potential China  trade issues. In response to increased responsibilities arising from the new  U.S.-China trade relationship, USTR, Treasury, and Commerce\u2019s U.S.  Patent and Trademark Office added four new positions at the embassy in  Beijing. Department of Commerce\u2019s and USDA\u2019s Foreign Services in China  are the largest overseas office for each department. For example, 10  percent of Commerce\u2019s Foreign Commercial Service is in China. In  addition, as a result of an increased focus on China, the FAS has increased  the number of staff that work in China, which now accounts for 10 percent  of its overseas staff, according to USDA.", "Staffing Gaps and Turnover Remain  Furthermore, agencies have experienced staffing gaps and shortages. In  headquarters, USTR experienced staff turnover from fiscal year 2006 to  2007. USTR\u2019s China Affairs Office had four staff depart and hired five  additional staff. As of November 2007, the office is authorized to have nine  staff but only have eight. The International Trade Administration officials  in the Department of Commerce said that there is still a relatively high  amount of staff turnover because employees in the Market Access and  Compliance acquire a skill set that is highly desirable and attractive to the  private sector. Department of Commerce officials noted that one official in  the Market Access and Compliance\u2019s Office of Chinese Economic Area had  moved from headquarters to Beijing since January 2007. Overseas, both  the Departments of State and Commerce have experienced staffing  challenges. For instance, a senior Department of State official told us there  has been a high level of turnover in the economic section at the embassy,  which has included curtailed Foreign Service rotations. These changes  have resulted in significant gaps in filling positions and reorganizations to  compensate for lost expertise. To maintain current staffing levels, the  department has sometimes pulled staff from Chinese language training.  Although State added seven positions in China as part of its Global  Repositioning Initiative, only five were at the embassy in Beijing, and two  staff still had not arrived at post as of the end of 2007. One of the five  economic section positions at the Beijing embassy tasked to work on  China trade compliance at the embassy has been seconded to work with  the senior Department of the Treasury official at post.", "Similarly, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Trade Facilitation Office has  been understaffed and has experienced high turnover in two staff  positions according to department officials. One Market Access and  Compliance position was vacant for a year, and the office had waited over  6 months for a Director. We were told that the individual has been hired  and assumed duty in late February 2008. A senior Department of  Commerce official stated that one contributing factor to the high turnover  for the Trade Facilitation Office is that department hires experienced  people with China business backgrounds, in a highly competitive job  market. These individuals are on a limited 2-year noncareer appointment  (with the possibility of the appointment being extended to a maximum of 5  years) with no opportunities for promotion.", "In 2004, GAO reported that the four key trade agencies lacked specific  training relevant to executing China-WTO compliance responsibilities, but  since then the Departments of Commerce and State, and USDA have  offered staff opportunities for training on trade monitoring and  compliance. Training opportunities for staff have increased, but most  training is still ad hoc and does not apply specifically to China trade  compliance. Department of State staff overseas stated they had sufficient  funds for training. In addition, both departments offer courses online for  staff. Department of State offers about nine training courses related to  WTO compliance issues to its employees, as well as employees from other  agencies. In fiscal year 2007, approximately 172 individuals took these  courses. Since 2005, Department of Commerce has offered several training  courses related to compliance and market access. Commerce employees  in International Trade Administration participated in training on  compliance and market access database. In addition, to ensure data  accuracy in the Department of Commerce\u2019s case database, about 195  employees have been trained on case procedures and received guidance  on how to document their work in the database. USDA officials stated the  agency increased training opportunities for its China staff since 2005.", "Senior management from the Departments of Commerce and State  expressed concerns about the language skills of China unit staff. For  instance, newer staff often have insufficient language skills, according to a  senior Commerce official. As of September 2007, the Department of  Commerce\u2019s Office of Chinese Economic Area offers Mandarin language  training and has five staff taking the course; however, Beijing staff  confirmed that they were not fluent in Chinese and said they rely on the  Chinese Foreign Service Nationals to translate and conduct research to  enhance the officers\u2019 abilities to perform their duties. Some Department of  State staff told us that officers come to the embassy before they have  finished their language training. According to a senior Department of State  official, this limits them in their official capacities. Although senior  department management and staff said they had funds to take language  training, the heavy visitor schedule and workload have made it difficult to  consistently take advantage of the language instruction available at the  post."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Progress Toward Broad U.S.-China Trade Objectives Is Difficult to Determine", "paragraphs": ["We could not determine agencies\u2019 progress toward achieving the plan\u2019s  broader U.S.-China trade objectives for several reasons.

However, USTR did not provide GAO any of its informal internal  assessments.

Nevertheless,  USTR officials told us they do not formally assess the progress they have  made in implementing it. Rather, they said that in their regular discussions  on China, they are inevitably touching on the issues in the top-to-bottom  report. In Washington, D.C., and overseas, managers and staff we  interviewed at other agencies said they were aware of the report, but that  it was not used as a guide for planning their China trade compliance  priorities.", "The top-to-bottom report indicated that the Trade Policy Review Group  (TPRG) and Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) were to conduct  monthly reviews of the progress made in achieving the key objectives  identified in the report to help ensure coordination of China trade policy  formulation and implementation and appropriate focus among agencies on  key U.S. trade objectives with China. However, USTR said that although  these groups discuss key objectives and priority goals, they do not track  progress made on achieving the action items. The TPSC Subcommittee on  China met 5 times in 2007 between January and August to discuss various  issues such as WTO disputes, SED and JCCT dialogues, and coordination  with U.S. trading partners. The TPRG met 10 times between March 2006  and June 2007 to discuss a variety of issues related to its strategy in WTO  dispute settlement. In addition, no minutes are kept on either the TPRG or  the TPSC so we could not determine to what extent these objectives were  informally discussed in these meetings.", "Furthermore, as discussed in the previous section of our report, USTR still  does not attempt to measure the results of its efforts to resolve trade  compliance problems with China, even though they are an integral part of  many U.S.-China trade objectives. USTR\u2019s top-to-bottom review drew upon  GAO past reviews of monitoring and enforcement efforts. In GAO\u2019s 2004  report, for example, we found that the specific units within the agencies  most directly involved with China compliance activities lacked specific  strategies for ensuring that they supported their agency\u2019s goals, and they  also did not assess their unit\u2019s results. We noted that planning and  measuring results were important components to ensuring that  government resources were used effectively to achieve the agencies\u2019 goals.  In addition, we stated that good planning and management links overall  agency goals to individual unit activities and priorities. We recommended  that these agencies take steps to improve performance management  pertinent to the agencies\u2019 China-WTO compliance efforts. Specifically, we  said that USTR should set annual measurable targets related to its China  compliance performance measures and asses the results in its annual  performance plan.", "Other Key Agencies Have Some Related Plans  We asked the other agencies to provide us with their China unit plans.  However, the Department of State provided their information too late for  us to assess.

As a  result, it is difficult to ascertain how the agency\u2019s action items and  implementing steps contribute to progress and achieve the larger U.S.  trade objectives with China. Therefore, we asked USTR to identify which  objective each action item and implementing step is supposed to help  achieve. There was a wide range in the level of planned activity to achieve  different objectives. Based on the information USTR provided, we found  that 11 implementing steps focused on one objective concerning  implementation and compliance, while other objectives concerning  proactive identification and resolution of trade issues and export  promotion each only had 1 implementing step associated with them.  Furthermore, the scope and specificity of some objectives and their  related priority goals, did not match the actions meant to implement them.  Therefore, it is not clear that the planned priority goal actions, if  implemented, would fully address all of USTR\u2019s objectives. For example,  as part of planned export promotion efforts, they intended to give special  attention to noncoastal parts of China, from small/medium enterprises,  from high-tech firms, and in sectors where the United States is  competitive; in contrast, the planned action related to export promotion is  very general in nature, is discussed in the context of strengthening  interagency coordination, and does not mention any of these specifics.", "It was also difficult to assess progress because terms in the plan do not  provide a means to understand how USTR or other government agencies  might determine when an action item had been achieved. Several action  items state that particular initiatives will be expanded, strengthened, or  increased; however, no strategy or baseline information is provided to  allow one to determine how this would be done or whether actions on the  part of agencies have actually expanded, increased, or strengthened the  program. For example, one action item is to \u201cincrease effectiveness of  high-level meetings with China\u2019s leaders,\u201d but the implementing steps do  not state how greater effectiveness will be accomplished; instead, the step  is limited to \u201ccontinue to hold high-level meetings.\u201d Similarly, with regard  to strengthening interagency coordination, the report says that export  promotion activities will be increased, but without any details or  measurement information we could not determine if there had been an  increase in activity or how this might lead to strengthened coordination.", "Plans Have Not Been Updated  Finally, it is difficult to assess the status of U.S.-China trade objectives  because the report does not reflect some important developments. USTR  has not updated its plans.

The United States has filed five  dispute settlement cases at the WTO against China since February 2006  (see table 5). Also, U.S. industries have filed numerous trade remedy  petitions against Chinese imports under U.S. trade laws, including requests  for safeguard actions and antidumping and countervailing duty  investigations.

USTR believed that we undervalued the  systematic analysis of China\u2019s WTO compliance in USTR\u2019s annual reports.  In addition, USTR believed that the quantitative analysis of progress made  reveals inherent limitations and difficulties in developing meaningful  quantitative compliance measurements.

USTR\u2019s report has many of the characteristics of a good  plan and addresses our 2004 recommendation for a China unit plan in that  the report establishes goals and priorities for the various China Affairs  Office activities.

We identified each  unique compliance issue that was reported by USTR in the narrative of  each of their annual reports. Our identification was based on USTR\u2019s  description and definition of problems in the narrative of the report.  USTR\u2019s categorization of issues in the report and the manner in which  issues were grouped and presented, also guided the identification of  individual issues. We did not include areas where China initially complied  fully with its commitments and, therefore, no issues were raised, these  were considered successes as reported in table 2. In all, we identified 180  issues in the six annual reports.", "To analyze the disposition of the compliance issues, we reviewed the  narrative descriptions provided in the reports and made determinations  according to three broad categories: No Progress Noted, Some Progress  Noted, and Resolved. We categorized an issue as \u201cNo Progress Noted\u201d if  the report text either explicitly stated that no progress had been made or  did not indicate that China had undertaken any actions to address the  issue. We categorized an issue as \u201cSome Progress Noted\u201d if the report text  indicated that China had undertaken any action to address the issue but  had not completely resolved it. We categorized issues as \u201cResolved\u201d if the  report language clearly indicated that the compliance issue was resolved  and the U.S. government was no longer pursuing a resolution of that  particular issue (see table 9 for additional details). Two of our staff  independently identified each compliance issue and made initial  determinations of the dispositions. After those staff had reconciled  differences in their initial identification and disposition of issues,  additional staff reviewed issues and dispositions to ensure consistency  and accuracy in the dispositions.", "We did not attempt to identify the relative importance of the compliance  issues as the report text does not provide clear indications that would  allow us to make that determination. However, we based our analysis on  the premise that all these compliance issues had been considered serious  enough by USTR to include in its annual reports. Indeed, USTR reported  that it focused the report on trade concerns raised by U.S. stakeholders  that merit attention within the WTO context. In some instances, we noted  that after a compliance issue in a particular area had been resolved, other  issues arose in the same area. For example, in some areas, after a  particular commitment was implemented, other restrictions were imposed  that made it difficult for U.S. companies to realize the full benefits of the  commitment. In those instances, we identified two separate issues and  noted their dispositions according to the evidence. As a result, our total  count of issues includes several that are related, but that were identified as  separate problems in USTR\u2019s reports.", "In addition, for the 2004 through 2007 annual reports, we quantified the  number of issues where USTR mentioned taking various types of actions  in order to resolve the issue in the narrative of the report. These actions  include raising the issue at multiple forums and dialogues with the  Chinese, including the JCCT, the Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED), the  Transitional Review Mechanism (TRM), or other forums at the WTO, or  raising the issue bilaterally with the Chinese through another mechanism.  For example, regarding the concerns from the U.S. telecommunications  industry about interference from Chinese regulators regarding standards  and contract negotiations, USTR reported that they raised this issue during  a 2004 JCCT meeting. Therefore, we noted that USTR took action toward  resolving this issue at the JCCT.", "To assess USTR\u2019s progress in implementing the objectives and action  items presented in its February 2006 top-to-bottom report, U.S.-China  Trade Relations: Entering a New Phase of Greater Accountability and  Enforcement, we analyzed the document by identifying the six objectives  and each of the associated priority goals. After that, we delineated the 10  action items and each of their associated implementing steps. We created  a chart and divided the implementing steps under each associated action  item. Next, we asked USTR to (1) identify the agency responsible for  implementing each action item, (2) complete the chart, (3) indicate  whether the action item was implemented and if so how was it  implemented, and (4) provide supporting documentation for each  response. Since we had observed that the action items were not clearly  linked to the report\u2019s objectives, we asked USTR to identify which  objective the action item addressed. We also asked the Departments of  Commerce and Agriculture to complete a chart for their individual  agencies; identify which action item they were responsible for  implementing, indicate the status of this action item, and provide  supporting documentation for their responses. We asked the Department  of State to provide documentation for the one step that USTR said this  department was solely responsible for implementing.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2007 to April 2008, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Status of Top-to-Bottom Review", "paragraphs": ["Table 10 identifies the 11 action items and the accompanying 25  implementing steps, along with agency responsibilities and status in the  top-to-bottom review.", "Table 11 is a list of the six objectives and 31 related priority goals in the  top-to-bottom review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the United States Trade Representative", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the United States Trade  Representative\u2019s letter dated March 26, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We disagree that report undervalues the systematic analysis of China\u2019s  WTO compliance contained in USTR\u2019s annual reports.  In our report,  we acknowledge the detailed narrative information presented by USTR  and the consistent format used to present this information in its annual  reports on China\u2019s WTO compliance.  Nevertheless, we believe that the  lack of systematic analysis in these reports make it difficult for  Congress and the public to understand the overall compliance  situation in China.  USTR\u2019s annual reports lack not only quantitative  measurement and analysis, but qualitative summary analysis as well.   While there is a significant amount of detailed information contained  in USTR\u2019s reports, it is difficult to determine the overall progress being  made in each of the nine areas.  In addition, without systematic  analysis of the lengthy narrative descriptions it is difficult to assess the  level of progress being made in each year, or the trends over time.  While there are other ways to conduct such analysis, our work  demonstrates that it is possible to provide both systematic qualitative  and quantitative analysis to make the information in the report more  meaningful and accessible.  2.  We disagree with USTR\u2019s statement that the variety and nuances of  individual compliance issues make summary analysis meaningless. In  fact, we believe the opposite is true. As we noted in our report, we  identified each unique compliance issue based on the description and  definition of problems in the narrative of the report.  The  categorization of issues in USTR\u2019s reports and the manner in which  issues were grouped and presented guided our identification of  individual issues. We recognize that it is possible to group the issues  differently, and if USTR finds another method of grouping and  identifying issues, we encourage USTR to use such methods in  providing summary analysis in future reports.  In addition, we believe  that this type of analysis is important to help Congress and the public  better understand the overall compliance situation regarding China.   Should USTR choose to define issues differently, we are confident that  this will not change the overall results and patterns found through our  analysis.", "Our report discusses the fact that the compliance issues mentioned in  USTR\u2019s reports may not all equally affect U.S. exports to China. In  addition, we acknowledge that the level of progress made on one  particular compliance issue might not be equal to the progress made  on other issues.  We agree with USTR that the relative importance of  such issues and the relative progress made should guide decisions  about how and when to devote resources to pursue particular  compliance issues.  That is precisely why we believe that more  systematic information included in USTR\u2019s annual compliance reports  will provide further understanding to Congress and other stakeholders  (and therefore help improve decision making regarding China\u2019s trade  compliance).  To the extent that USTR believes it is important to give  more weight to certain issues or explain other nuances that surround  individual issues and the progress made on such issues, we encourage  USTR to incorporate these variables when conducting any summary  analysis for future reports.    3.  We disagree with USTR that it will be ill-advised to provide a detailed  quantitative analysis in USTR\u2019s annual reports. We believe that more  transparency and clarity in USTR\u2019s reports enhances understanding  about China\u2019s compliance situation and provides important  information for Congress to conduct oversight and for senior  policymakers to assess the success of their activities. Such information  would promote a more informed discussion about U.S.-trade policy  toward China among all stakeholders. While USTR could decide to  more clearly prioritize the almost 180 issues it reports, we did not  advocate ranking these issues.   In addition, U.S. trade negotiators  could use summary information on China\u2019s progress (or lack thereof)  on resolving compliance issues to better argue that more needs to be  done in certain areas and that the United States expects greater  progress overall.  Nevertheless, USTR would have many options for  how to conduct and present such summary information, giving it the  flexibility to mitigate any concerns that negotiators might have.    4.  USTR states our categorization of compliance issues according to  \u201caction taken\u201d and \u201cno action taken\u201d is unclear.  Our report states  clearly that our analysis of actions taken is based solely on the  information provided in USTR\u2019s annual reports.  In addition, USTR  stated that it was unclear how we categorized issues when they had  brought a WTO case after bilateral negotiations. We considered any  actions mentioned in USTR\u2019s annual compliance reports at any WTO  forum as \u201craised at the WTO\u201d including dispute settlement cases.  Furthermore, we added information to our report to clearly identify  the cases filed by the United States against China.    5.  USTR states the \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d report is not a \u201cplan\u201d in the narrow  and specific sense used in our report. However, this was not our  understanding based on interviews with USTR staff during our review  and our reading of the document. USTR\u2019s report on the results of its  \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d report addresses our 2004 recommendation for a  China unit plan in that the report establishes goals and priorities for  the various China Affairs Office activities. GAO advocates agency  strategic planning and using such plans on an ongoing basis as a  management tool. USTR\u2019s report has many of the characteristics of a  good plan: it clearly defines objectives, goals, and action items;  provides a detailed discussion of the problems; delineates agency  responsibilities; provides specific activities and programs; and  identifies human resources needed to achieve action items. In a  February 2006 news conference announcing the report on the top-to- bottom report, the then U.S. Trade Representative was asked, among  other things, how he would measure USTR\u2019s progress on U.S.-China  trade issues.  He replied that \u201c\u2026 the way to measure our performance  is to go point by point through the report looking at the issues that I\u2019ve  talked about at the outset\u2026.\u201d  We believe that USTR should reconsider  its treatment of this report only as a one-time policy statement.  6.  USTR states that the top-to-bottom\u201d report did not promise or  anticipate the drafting of update. Based on our analysis of the report, it  is implied that updates were going to be provided; however, we agree  that the report includes no requirement or explicit promise to present  revised objectives and goals, subsequent action items, and the degree  of progress in a new version of the report. So we removed language  indicating that there was an explicit requirement or promise. However,  we suggest that USTR reconsider its treatment of this report as a one- time policy statement. Regular briefings are important, but USTR  should have a written record that specifies revised objectives and  goals, subsequent action items, and the degree of progress toward  achieving them.", "USTR states that through annual reports like its annual reports to  Congress on China\u2019s WTO compliance, USTR already provides the  written updates on the \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d report. While USTR provides  numerous reports to Congress on its activities, USTR still has not  updated the six objectives and 31 priority goals specified in the top-to- bottom report to reflect subsequent developments nor formally  assessed progress. We still advocate that USTR update and improve  this report, commensurate with its promised actions to help ensure  that it is best positioned to meet its key China trade objectives and to  ensure meaningful progress toward achieving them.", "USTR states that we misunderstood the relationship between action  items, on the one hand, and objectives and priority goals, on the other.", "We found the relationship between action items and the objectives in  the top-to-bottom report were unclear. Therefore, we went through an  exercise with USTR staff to identify how and whether short-term  action items link to specific long-term objectives and priority goals and  report on the outcome. In the future, USTR should formally identify  these linkages in an updated plan that includes subsequent action  items to ensure they are taking all the steps necessary to achieve their  stated objectives.", "Our recommendations would enhance USTR\u2019s accountability and  inform all stakeholders, including Congress and the public, about the  status of the U.S. objectives and priority goals for trade relations with  China."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Adam Cowles, Assistant  Director; Diana Blumenfeld; Martin de Alteriis; Rhonda Horried; and Paul  Revesz made key contributions to this report.
