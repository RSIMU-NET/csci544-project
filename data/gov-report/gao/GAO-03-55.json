At the same time, agencies are dealing with reductions in the civilian acquisition workforce. GAO was asked to determine what efforts federal civilian agencies are making to address their future acquisition workforce needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO looked at the efforts six civilian agencies are undertaking to address their future acquisition workforce needs. Together, these agencies account for about 72 percent of civilian agency contracting dollars. All of these agencies are taking steps to address their future acquisition workforce needs. Three--the Departments of Energy and Veterans Affairs (VA) and the General Services Administration--are developing specific plans to strengthen their acquisition workforces, and three others--the Departments of Treasury and Health and Human Services and the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA)--are including their acquisition workforces in their overall plans to strengthen human capital. All are implementing new or strengthening existing career development and training programs. NASA and VA are also developing new information management systems. The agencies, however, are facing considerable challenges to making their human capital strategic plans and training programs a success. Principally: most acquisition professionals will need to acquire a new set of skills focusing on business management. Because of a more sophisticated acquisition environment, they can no longer be merely purchasers or process managers. Instead, they will also need to be adept at analyzing business problems and assisting with developing strategies in the early stages of the acquisition. Beyond this immediate transformation, it is difficult for agencies to forecast what will be needed in terms of numbers of workers, skills, and expertise in the years to come. Rules, regulations, and agency missions are always changing, and budgets are constantly shifting. Many agencies simply lack good data on their workforces, including information on workforce size and location, knowledge and skills, attrition rates, and retirement rates. This data is critical to mapping out the current condition of the workforce and deciding what needs to be done to ensure that the agency has the right mix of skills and talent for the future. In overcoming these challenges, agencies can learn from the Department of Defense (DOD), which has made progress in acquisition workforce strategic planning and has addressed some of the same issues. DOD officials learned that the strategic planning effort was going to take a long time and that effective leadership and guidance, along with technology and sound methodology, were required to accurately forecast workforce needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is dramatically changing the manner in which it purchases goods and services. It is also striving to maximize the value of the $200 billion it spends annually by taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the commercial marketplace. As a result, rigid procurement rules have given way to rules that allow the use of more judgment and initiative on the part of the individuals who make up the acquisition workforce. At the same time, some agencies are contending with the fact that the acquisition workforce has decreased by 22 percent in the last decade.", "Industry and government experts alike recognize that a key to making a successful transformation toward a more sophisticated acquisition environment is having the right people with the right skills. Leading public organizations here in the United States and abroad have found that strategic human capital management must be the centerpiece of any serious change management initiative and efforts to transform the cultures of government agencies. Workforce planning provides managers with a strategic basis for making human resource decisions and allows organizations to address systematically the issues that are driving workforce change.", "You requested that we (1) determine the efforts civilian federal agencies are making to address their future acquisition workforce needs and identify the challenges, if any, they have encountered and (2) identify any \u201clessons learned\u201d from the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) efforts to develop strategic plans for its acquisition workforce. We included the following six civilian agencies in our review: the General Services Administration (GSA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Treasury, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

DOD\u2019s contracting workload, for example, has increased by about 12 percent in recent years, but the workforce available to perform that workload has been reduced by about half over the same period. Meanwhile, the federal government is implementing various ways of contracting, such as performance-based contracting methods, commercial-based pricing approaches, and the use of purchase cards.", "High-performing public organizations have found that strategic planning and management can address human capital shortfalls. Strategic human capital planning begins with establishing a clear set of organizational intents, including a clearly defined mission, core values, goals and objectives, and strategies, and then integrating a human capital approach to support these strategic and programmatic goals. It requires systematic assessments of current and future human capital needs and strategies\u2014 which encompass a broad array of initiatives to attract, retain, develop, and motivate a top quality workforce\u2014to fill the gaps. To ensure lasting success, the top leaders of an organization need a sustained commitment to embracing human capital management. They need to see people as vital assets to organizational success and must invest in this valuable asset.", "While many organizations have developed models for workforce planning,putting aside variations in terminology, the models share the following common elements. They identify organizational objectives; identify the workforce competencies needed to achieve the objectives; analyze the present workforce to determine its competencies; compare present workforce competencies to those needed in the future (sometimes referred to as a \u201cgap analysis\u201d);  develop plans to transition from the present workforce to the future  periodically evaluate the workforce plans, review the mission and objectives to assure they remain valid, and make adjustments as required by changes in mission, objectives, and workforce competencies.", "This process is simple in concept, but it can be difficult to carry out. First, it requires a shift in the human resource function from a support role to a role that is integral to accomplishing an agency\u2019s mission. Second, it requires developing accurate information on the numbers and locations of employees and their competencies and skills, data on the profile of the workforce, and performance goals and measures for human capital approaches. We have previously reported that agencies may find that they lack some of the basic tools and information to develop strategic plans, such as accurate and complete information on workforce characteristics and strategic planning expertise.", "Four organizations\u2014the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), the Procurement Executives Council (PEC), and the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI)\u2014 have roles to play in dealing with workforce and acquisition workforce issues.

There are clear reasons for this. About 90 percent of NASA\u2019s funds, for example, is spent on contracts for projects such as the international space station and the space shuttle. DOE contracts out about 94 percent of its budget. VA purchases goods and services, such as medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and information technology. And GSA\u2019s primary function is to assist federal agencies in procuring goods and services.", "Recognizing the importance of acquisition to their missions, VA, GSA, and DOE are all developing or have developed strategic plans specifically targeted at strengthening their acquisition workforce. NASA is developing an overall workforce plan that will include the acquisition workforce. VA and GSA have defined the objectives for their future acquisition workforces. GSA has also established the competencies that workforce will need and has begun its gap analysis. DOE has studied its acquisition workforce, identified competencies and gaps, and is now implementing actions it believes are needed to strengthen the acquisition workforce. NASA is in the process of identifying the competencies its workforce possesses. All four of these agencies have also developed training and career development programs that are aimed at ensuring their acquisition workforces have the skills to accomplish the agencies\u2019 missions.", "Treasury and HHS view acquisition as critical to mission success. However, unlike GSA, for example, acquisition is not a primary function of these agencies. Each agency spends less than 25 percent of its budget on acquisitions. Nevertheless, Treasury and HHS have undertaken initiatives such as training, career development, and intern programs to ensure that their acquisition workforces have the necessary skills and training to accomplish their missions.", "Tables 2 and 3 highlight progress being made by the agencies we studied.

Also, acquisition rules and regulations are changing, making it difficult for agencies to predict what will be required of their acquisition workforce in years to come. Officials at DOE said that given the dynamic nature of the agency\u2019s mission focus and budget direction, forecasting the future represented a formidable challenge. Officials at HHS also noted that improving the focus on the agency\u2019s mission and the skills sets needed to accomplish the mission was their biggest challenge. Officials at VA told us that they are still trying to determine how the department would be conducting its acquisitions in the future, and therefore they could not yet predict the kind of acquisition workforce VA would need.", "Compounding the uncertainty of the future environment is the changing role of the acquisition professional from merely a purchaser or process manager to a business manager. Uncertainty is also caused by an increased focus on performance and outcomes, which requires greater integration of functions such as acquisition, financial management, and program management. In order to make this transition, acquisition workers will need to acquire an entirely new set of skills and knowledge, according to the agency officials with whom we spoke. For example, in addition to having a firm understanding of contracting rules and processes, acquisition workers will need to be adept at consulting and communicating with line managers, and they will need to be able to analyze business problems, identify different alternatives in purchasing goods or services, and assist in developing strategies in the early stages of the acquisition. Finally, a deeper understanding of market conditions, industry trends, and the technical details of the commodities and services being procured will be required.", "Another challenge for agencies is the lack of data on the characteristics of the current workforce (e.g., size of workforce; deployment across the organization; knowledge, skills and abilities; attrition rates; retirement rates; etc.). NASA and VA are developing their own management information systems to capture this data. In addition, the FAI is developing a management information system, called the Acquisition Career Management Information System, to help agencies and departments collect and maintain standardized data on their acquisition workforces. The director of the FAI stated that the system is expected to be operational by January 2003.", "An additional challenge cited by some agency procurement officials is the lack of a means to share information among agencies about best practices or lessons learned in dealing with acquisition workforce issues. One potential mechanism for providing such leadership is the PEC, which was created to provide a senior-level forum for monitoring and improving the federal acquisition system. The OFPP Administrator currently serves as the chair of the council.", "The council established an Acquisition Workforce Committee in 1999 to focus on the changing role of the acquisition workforce and to identify methods and strategies to equip this workforce with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to successfully meet the challenges of change. According to the committee chair, the council has only recently recognized that it needs to take a leadership role in coordinating agencies\u2019 efforts to strengthen the acquisition workforce. However, assuming this leadership role will present its own challenges. For example, the PEC has yet to reach a consensus on how best to fulfill this role, in part because of the difficulty in finding common ground among several federal agencies with different agendas and missions. In addition, agencies currently lack formal mechanisms for sharing information about best practices or lessons learned on dealing with acquisition workforce issues.", "The Acquisition Workforce Committee had chartered working groups to research acquisition workforce needs, establish a governmentwide Acquisition Management Intern Program, develop retention strategies and incentives, and determine the ideal skills and characteristics of the future acquisition professional. According to the chair of the committee, although some of these initiatives, such as the intern program, have been successful, the effort to develop a broader governmentwide approach to building and implementing a model for the future acquisition workforce has been slow because the PEC has been realigning itself and redefining its strategic initiatives to support the President\u2019s Management Agenda and to respond to issues related to homeland security.", "The following information provides details of the civilian agencies\u2019 efforts to address acquisition workforce issues.

In the near future, GSA will expand this definition to include program managers. Condition of Acquisition Workforce GSA sees its acquisition workforce as integral to accomplishing its mission.  To keep up the trend toward purchasing highly complex and technical goods and services, GSA will need its acquisition workforce to build knowledge on market conditions, industry trends, and the technical details of the commodities and services being acquired.  GSA also envisions broadening the knowledge base of acquisition professional beyond the procurement field into areas such as budget, finance, and program management.

GSA has identified acquisition as one of its mission-critical occupations, and has established the competencies needed by the acquisition workforce.  However, GSA currently does not know whether its acquisition workforce has the requisite competencies. Therefore, it has established the Applied Learning Center to measure whether the acquisition workforce has the competencies to carry out its duties successfully. The pilot project will begin in 2003 and will be completed that calendar year.  The results of the pilot will provide an indication of the skills gaps in GSA\u2019s acquisition workforce.  As a part of its ongoing strategy to address the skills gaps identified, GSA has also established an Education and Training Center to provide the needed training.

NASA contracts out about 90 percent of its budget; it spent about $12.7 billion in fiscal year 2001.  The acquisition function is essential because NASA is a research and development (R&D) agency, and the ability to achieve its mission is dependent on the acquisition function of awarding R&D contracts.  NASA\u2019s missions are: to advance and communicate scientific knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the solar system and the universe; to advance human exploration, use, and development of space; and to research, develop, verify, and transfer advanced aeronautics and space technologies.", "NASA includes contract specialists (GS 1102), purchasing specialists (GS 1105), contracting officers, and procurement clerks in its acquisition workforce.

To address this issue, it is developing an agencywide workforce planning system that will allow better management of the existing workforce and enable better strategic decisions about future workforce needs.  The system will track the distribution of workforce across programs, personnel critical skills, and personnel management experience, and will permit NASA to identify gaps between skills required and skills available.

Condition of Acquisition Workforce In fiscal year 1995, DOE began a 5-year period of downsizing.  During this period, it essentially stopped hiring.  As a result, the average age of the DOE workforce increased.  In 1998, the DOE procurement executive conducted a demographic study of the acquisition workforce because of concerns that 4 years of downsizing had created potential short- and long-term problems regarding the ability of the workforce to meet future needs.  The study found that DOE was likely to lose its acquisition leadership because of retirements and therefore needed to develop leadership skills in the remaining workforce.  In addition, DOE\u2019s assessment of the acquisition environment identified education and developmental needs in project/program management, property management, financial assistance, and contractor human resource management.  A survey conducted in 2001 showed that the department would continue to face the same issues as revealed by the 1998 study.", "In response to the 1998 study, DOE initiated its Acquisition Career Development Program to address the gaps identified.

The components attributed this problem to deficiencies in the first attempt at the planning process. Specifically, due to the time constraints and the timing of the process, the components lacked sufficient planning guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, such as the Defense Planning Guidance and the Quadrennial Defense Review, which had not yet been issued. In addition, inadequate modeling capability made the process less than optimum. Furthermore, the output was hampered somewhat by inconsistent accuracy of personnel data.", "DOD still found that the first cycle provided a valuable experience because it highlighted the key planning barriers that needed to be overcome. In addition to a lack of specific guidance, data, and modeling tools, other barriers included ad hoc policy decisions, cultural resistance to workforce planning, limited strategic workforce planning expertise, and the lack of an institutional structure to support strategic workforce planning. DOD also recognized that overcoming these barriers would not be easy because they require DOD to acquire new systems and tools and to make a cultural shift from viewing human capital as a support function to a mission function. As figure 1 illustrates, DOD now estimates that it will take as long as 5 years to mature the human capital strategic planning process.", "Several specific lessons learned from DOD\u2019s experience are highlighted below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leadership", "paragraphs": ["An overriding lesson learned from DOD has been that making the cultural shift from viewing human capital as a support function to a mission function requires strong and sustained leadership involvement. GAO\u2019s guidance on human capital strategic planning also emphasizes the shift in the role of the human capital function from a support function to one that is integral to achieving the agency\u2019s mission. In addition, leadership is needed to foster an agency\u2019s vision, align organizational components, and build commitment to the vision at all levels of the organization.", "For DOD, leadership involvement from leaders at lower levels of the organization was particularly critical since it became apparent in the first cycle of planning that attempting to develop a workforce plan at an agencywide level for a disparate organization such as DOD was almost impossible. This is because the various business units within an agency have very different missions, workforce characteristics, and needs. At the same time, DOD recognized that additional authority needed to be provided to managers within business units for making any needed changes as they developed their plans. For example, these managers might not have had additional hiring authority to address the gaps they identified. DOD officials noted that providing such authority may require policy, regulatory, or statutory changes.", "Another leadership challenge facing DOD was that some DOD components lacked buy-in on the importance of acquisition workforce planning. A consultant hired to assist DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce planning efforts said that one reason managers view workforce planning skeptically is because the results of such efforts are difficult to measure, and the costs can be significant. DOD officials acknowledged, however, that although the costs may be significant, the costs of making decisions without the necessary information would be equally significant and could lead to worse problems. Our guidance reflects this view as well.", "Another deficiency identified by DOD in its first planning effort was the lack of guidance that identified what DOD\u2019s goals were for human capital and how planning efforts should be carried out. Without a clearly articulated statement of intent, DOD components lacked a strong rationale for developing a view of what the future workforce should look like. Moreover, without guidance on how the planning should be done, components took differing approaches to their analyses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planning Tools", "paragraphs": ["In assessing the results of its first planning cycle, DOD found that it lacked essential strategic planning tools, including systems that could accumulate and report all data needed for its forecasting efforts, models for projections, and planning guidance. Our own guidance recognizes such tools as essential to successful strategic planning. For example, our guidance points out that valid and reliable data are critical not only to assess an agency\u2019s workforce requirements, but also to heighten an agency\u2019s ability to manage risk by allowing managers to spotlight areas for attention before crises develop and identify opportunities for enhancing agency results.", "Another factor complicating the components\u2019 workforce planning efforts was the difficulty in obtaining data needed to develop plans. Officials at one DOD component, for example, told us that they had to use three different data systems in an attempt to identify the characteristics of the current workforce, and even then they were not sure that the data was accurate. One system was used to obtain data on such things as pay grade, job series, and location; another system was used to extract retirement data; and a \u201chome-grown\u201d attrition model was used to project how many people would leave, die, and retire based on historical trends. A consultant in the first planning effort also told us that most of the models used to make projections were rudimentary, at best, and that forecasting data important to making projections was incomplete, missing, and/or inaccurate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Steps to Address Challenges", "paragraphs": ["DOD is working to overcome the problems experienced during the first planning cycle. It held working group meetings with the components to gather lessons learned and develop recommendations to improve the quality of the data for the second planning cycle, which began in January 2002.

The intent is to identify new data requirements and information needs for strategic planning. In addition, DOD is working to develop more sophisticated modeling tools. As part of the second strategic planning cycle, DOD hosted a workshop for its components to discuss tools that would support the workforce planning effort. These tools included a workforce model that provides a current view of the workforce, an aging projection model that predicts what the current acquisition workforce inventory would look like within a certain period of time, and a future requirements determination model that ties workload to resource allocation and projects how changes in workload will affect resource use in the future.

Acquisition workers are now expected to have a much greater knowledge of market conditions, industry trends, and the technical details of the commodities and services they procure. For this reason, any agency that relies heavily on acquisition to accomplish its mission stands to benefit greatly by developing strategic human capital plans that define the capabilities that will be needed by the workforce in the future, as well as strategies that can help the workforce meet these capabilities.", "While the civilian agencies we reviewed are generally in the early stages of this process, DOD\u2019s experience highlights the need to provide the right foundation for planning. This includes obtaining appropriate data collection and modeling tools, planning expertise, and management buy-in. More important, DOD\u2019s experience has shown that strategic workforce planning is not an easy task and can take several years to accomplish. This makes it especially important for agencies to sustain strong leadership and support for the planning effort and to be able to learn from each other\u2019s experiences, with assistance from procurement executives and organizations such as the OFPP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["In order to leverage the experiences of federal agencies\u2019 efforts, including those of DOD, to address future acquisition workforce needs, we recommend that the OFPP Administrator work with procurement executives to ensure that the lessons learned from these efforts are shared with all federal agencies as they continue with their initiatives to improve the acquisition workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD, NASA, HHS, and DOE provided written comments on a draft of this report.

First, DOE made the distinction between its acquisition workforce and its contracting workforce. We added language to reflect this distinction. Second, DOE noted that our report does not appear to recognize its ongoing efforts to evaluate and adjust its overall workforce and acquisition workforce strategic plans, nor does our report note that DOE continually evaluates the effectiveness of its programs. We asked DOE to provide more information on the evaluation process, and a DOE official stated that while evaluation does occur, there is no formal process for doing so, nor is there any documentation of such evaluation. Third, DOE asked us to provide more detail about its formal succession plan program. We believe our report already captures this information, but in a summarized manner. The information on pages 10 to 15 is meant to display the highlights of agencies\u2019 efforts to address acquisition workforce issues. Finally, DOE believed that the lack of management support did not pose a challenge to its efforts to improve the acquisition workforce, but that a lack of resources to implement developmental programs has been a challenge. While we agree that DOE\u2019s top management has been supportive of workforce planning, our allusion to the lack of management support for workforce planning efforts refers to a lack of support at lower levels of management.
