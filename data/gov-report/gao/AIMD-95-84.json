At December 31, 1988, FSLIC reported a deficit of $75 billion.", "The Financing Corporation (FICO) was established in 1987 to recapitalize FSLIC.

The net proceeds of FICO\u2019s debt offerings were used to purchase capital stock and capital certificates issued by FSLIC\u2014in effect, providing capital to FSLIC. FICO was authorized to assess FSLIC-insured institutions for the annual interest expense on the obligations issued, as well as for bond issuance and custodial costs. The industry\u2019s problems, however, required far more funding than that provided through FICO.", "In response to the thrift crisis, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) was enacted. FIRREA abolished FSLIC and created the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) to manage and resolve all troubled savings institutions that were previously insured by FSLIC and for which a conservator or receiver was appointed during the period January 1, 1989, through August 8, 1992.", "FIRREA also provided RTC with an initial $50 billion for the cost of resolving these institutions.

FIRREA provided that the amount of FICO\u2019s assessment was not to exceed the amount authorized to be assessed SAIF members by FDIC for insurance premiums, and that FICO\u2019s assessment was to be deducted from the amount FDIC was authorized to assess SAIF members.", "FIRREA and subsequent legislation also amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), particularly with respect to insurance assessments. Under the FDI Act, as amended, the FDIC Board of Directors is to set semiannual insurance premium rates for SAIF and BIF independently. Further, the Board is to set such rates for SAIF to increase SAIF\u2019s reserve ratio to the designated reserve ratio and, once SAIF attains the designated reserve ratio, to maintain SAIF\u2019s reserve ratio at the designated reserve ratio. In setting insurance premium rates, the Board of Directors is required to consider the Fund\u2019s expected operating expenses, case resolution expenditures and income, the effect of assessments on members\u2019 earnings and capital, and any other factors that the Board of Directors may deem appropriate.", "The FDI Act, as amended, establishes a designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent for both BIF and SAIF so that both funds build reserves sufficient to withstand the pressures of any substantial financial institution failures in the future. FDIC\u2019s Board of Directors must set insurance premium rates at a level that will enable each fund to build its reserves to reach this ratio. The fund capitalization provisions added to the FDI Act by the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) required FDIC to establish a recapitalization schedule for BIF to achieve the designated reserve ratio not later than 15 years after implementation and to set insurance assessments in accordance with this schedule.", "Until January 1, 1998, FDIC must set SAIF\u2019s insurance premium rates at a level that will enable SAIF to achieve the designated reserve ratio within a reasonable period of time.

As of the same date, SAIF had unaudited reserves of $1.9 billion, representing approximately 0.27 percent of insured deposits. Currently, BIF-insured institutions are assessed insurance premiums at a rate averaging 23 cents for every $100 in deposits subject to assessments (23 basis points), while SAIF-insured institutions are assessed at premium rates averaging 24 cents for every $100 of assessable deposits (24 basis points)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Original Authorized Funding for SAIF Was Not Appropriated", "paragraphs": ["SAIF was created without any initial capital, and from SAIF\u2019s inception through December 31, 1992, FICO, the Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP), and the FSLIC Resolution Fund (FRF) had prior claim on a substantial portion of SAIF members\u2019 insurance premiums. During the period 1989 through 1993, approximately $6.4 billion, or 84 percent of SAIF\u2019s insurance premiums, were used to fund the priority claims of FICO, REFCORP, and FRF. Beginning in 1993, only FICO continued to have prior claim on SAIF members\u2019 insurance premiums, with SAIF receiving the remaining amount.

This would have assured SAIF of at least $16 billion in either premium income or Treasury payments. In addition, Treasury was authorized to make annual payments necessary to ensure that SAIF had a specific net worth, ranging from zero during fiscal year 1992 to $8.8 billion during fiscal year 2000.
