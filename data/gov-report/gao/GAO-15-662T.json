A policy change in 2011 sought to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of DOE oversight programs by leveraging the contractor-generated information from CAS to reduce hands-on oversight, when appropriate. Also, in 2011, NNSA developed a framework for overseeing its M&O contractors, including a three-pronged evaluation for determining how and when to use information from CAS by evaluating the risk of contractors' activities, contractor's past performance, and the maturity of their CAS. Recent security and safety incidents at DOE and NNSA sites, including a 2014 nuclear waste accident, have caused some to question the extent to which information from CAS can be relied on for overseeing M&O contractors.", "This testimony discusses NNSA's policy and procedures for implementing the framework, including its use of information from CAS and its process for evaluating oversight effectiveness.

NNSA did not provide comprehensive guidance to agency officials on how to conduct assessments required by its oversight framework. In particular, NNSA did not provide guidance for assessing the maturity of contractors' CAS to determine whether information from these systems is sufficiently reliable for oversight purposes. As a result, NNSA cannot ensure that it is appropriately relying on information from CAS in overseeing these contractors. NNSA agreed with GAO's recommendation to establish a comprehensive oversight policy, including for assessments to determine how to use information from CAS for oversight.", "In the absence of headquarters level policy or guidance, GAO found in May 2015 that NNSA field offices established their own procedures for determining appropriate oversight approaches, but these procedures were not always complete, and they differed. For example, five of NNSA's seven field offices reported having complete procedures for assessing CAS maturity, but these procedures described different processes and rating scales for conducting such assessments, which could affect the consistency of how field offices determine oversight approaches. NNSA agreed with GAO's recommendation for field offices to develop new or modify existing procedures consistent with new headquarters policy.", "NNSA's 2011 policy included a process for validating the effectiveness of field offices' oversight approaches, including the extent to which their approaches appropriately used information from CAS, but GAO found in May 2015 that NNSA discontinued this process after determining that it had not been effective. Discontinuing this process without replacing it eliminated NNSA's internal control for ensuring the effectiveness and consistency of oversight approaches. NNSA agreed with GAO's recommendation to reestablish such a process.", "Preliminary observations from GAO's ongoing work to evaluate the 2014 nuclear waste accident at DOE's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico parallel GAO's findings on NNSA's framework for contractor oversight. For example, DOE's accident investigation board reported that the NNSA field office responsible for overseeing waste packaging and processing overrelied on contractor-generated information from CAS instead of directly conducting assessments and that the decision to do so was inconsistent with a 2011 NNSA review, which concluded the contractor's CAS was still maturing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made several recommendations in its May 2015 report with which NNSA concurred and for which it plans to take action."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on the policy framework  the Department of Energy (DOE) and its National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA) have put in place to oversee management and  operating (M&O) contractors. M&O contracts, as recognized in the  Federal Acquisition Regulation, are characterized by, among other things,  the close relationship between the government and the contractor for  conducting work of a long-term and continuing nature and requiring high  levels of expertise and continuity of operations and personnel. These  contractors apply their scientific, technical, and management expertise to  manage and operate government-owned sites. Eight such laboratory,  production plant, and testing sites are overseen by NNSA\u2014collectively  known as the nuclear security enterprise\u2014to achieve its missions,  including maintaining the safety, security, and reliability of the nation\u2019s  nuclear weapons stockpile and modernizing its supporting infrastructure.  NNSA maintains seven field offices that are responsible for providing day- to-day oversight of the activities at each site. DOE offices other than  NNSA also oversee M&O contractors that manage and operate  government-owned sites and similarly have colocated federal field offices.  One such site is the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New  Mexico\u2014the nation\u2019s only deep geologic repository for the permanent  disposal of certain defense-related nuclear waste\u2014which is overseen by  DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management (EM). DOE established EM  in 1989 in part to address management challenges in DOE\u2019s stewardship  of its nuclear cleanup mission, and NNSA was established by Congress  in 2000, in part to correct long-standing management challenges and  security breakdowns in DOE\u2019s stewardship of its nuclear security mission.", "Since the early 1990s when we first designated DOE\u2019s program and  contract management as an area at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement, we have reported on DOE\u2019s management and  oversight challenges, particularly with respect to how DOE strikes a  balance between relying on its contractors to identify and address  performance deficiencies versus conducting hands-on oversight activities,  such as through inspections or performance testing. For example, in  1993, we reported that DOE\u2019s approach was to give contractors that  managed and operated federal facilities wide leeway in their activities  under a philosophy of \u201cleast interference\u201d but that DOE had been  criticized by Congress and others for allowing contractors to dominate  DOE\u2019s activities while eluding management and financial oversight. In  contrast, in 2009, we reported that NNSA had plans to provide technical  training to certain federal oversight officials in an effort to rely less on  contractor-generated performance information and more on independent  federal expertise to test and recognize performance.", "In our recently released report, we evaluated DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s  framework for overseeing M&O contractors, which has been in place  since 2011. This DOE and NNSA framework describes an oversight  approach that is tailored to take into account the risk and hazard of  operations, as well as the maturity and operational performance of the  contractor\u2019s programs and assurance systems. The oversight framework  requires that contractors develop contractor assurance systems (CAS),  management systems and processes designed and used by M&O  contractors to oversee their own performance and self-identify and correct  potential problems. Further, this framework was viewed as an opportunity  to gain efficiencies in the conduct of oversight by leveraging information  from CAS, when appropriate, allowing federal oversight resources to be  prioritized where most needed. Recent safety and security incidents at  DOE and NNSA sites\u2014such as a February 2014 radiological release at  WIPP\u2014have caused some to question the extent to which information  from CAS can be relied on for overseeing M&O contractors.", "My testimony is primarily based on our May 2015 report that was recently  released and preliminary observations from our ongoing work. I will  discuss deficiencies identified in our issued report on (1) NNSA\u2019 s policy  for implementing the DOE oversight framework, including for using  information from CAS; (2) NNSA field office oversight procedures for  implementing the oversight framework, including for using information  from CAS; and (3) NNSA\u2019s process for evaluating oversight effectiveness.  To conduct our work on NNSA\u2019s implementation of the oversight  framework, including for using information from CAS, we surveyed all  seven NNSA field offices and analyzed key policies and guidance on  DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s use of information from CAS. More details on our  scope and methodology can be found in the full report. In addition, I will  provide preliminary observations from our ongoing work that includes  examining NNSA\u2019s and DOE\u2019s processes for oversight of WIPP.

Examples, in chronological order, of the problems on which we have  reported and where ineffective oversight was identified as a cause include  the following:  \uf0b7  2004: a suspension\u2014or stand-down\u2014of operations at one NNSA  laboratory to address systemic safety and security concerns identified  after an undergraduate student was partially blinded in a laser  accident and two classified computer disks were reported missing;  \uf0b7  2006: the discovery of a large number of classified documents and  electronic files that had been unlawfully removed from an NNSA  laboratory as a result of a drug raid on a private residence;  \uf0b7  2007: nearly 60 serious accidents or near misses including worker  exposure to radiation, inhalation of toxic vapors, and electrical shocks  at three nuclear weapons laboratories from 2000 through 2007;  \uf0b7  2008: the identification of significant protective force weaknesses (i.e.,  13 specific deficiencies) during an independent physical security  evaluation of an NNSA laboratory that included a force-on-force  exercise to simulate an attack on a sensitive facility;  \uf0b7  2012: 11 public hearings held since 2002 to address concerns about  DOE\u2019s safety practices by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety  Board\u2014an independent executive branch agency created by  Congress to independently assess safety conditions and operations at  defense nuclear facilities at DOE\u2019s sites, including NNSA and EM;  \uf0b7  2012: a serious security breach at an NNSA production plant\u2014the Y- 12 National Security Complex (Y-12) near Oak Ridge, Tennessee\u2014in  which three trespassers gained access to the protected area directly  adjacent to one of the nation\u2019s most critically important nuclear  weapon-related facilities before being interrupted by the security  measures in place, resulting in the identification of multiple and  unprecedented security system failures; and  \uf0b7  2014: operations were shut down at WIPP following an underground  fire involving a vehicle and, 9 days later, an unrelated radiological  event occurred when a nuclear waste container breached  underground at WIPP, contaminating a portion of the WIPP facility  and releasing a small amount of contamination into the environment.", "DOE and NNSA policies and orders concerning oversight of M&O  contractors have evolved over time and now require that each DOE M&O  contractor\u2014including those overseen by NNSA and EM\u2014have a CAS. In  April 2002, in an internal memorandum, DOE outlined an approach for  improving contract performance and promoting greater contractor  accountability by, among other things, moving from an oversight  approach focused on compliance with requirements contained in DOE  orders and directives to relying on contractor management information  provided through CAS to establish accountability and drive improvement.  In 2005, DOE issued DOE Policy 226.1, Department of Energy Oversight  Policy, and followed it with an associated implementing order requiring  that assurance systems be implemented by DOE M&O contractors,  among others, to encompass all aspects of the activities designed to  identify deficiencies and opportunities for improvement. The focus of this  DOE policy and order was to drive continuous improvement through  contractor self-assurance and effective federal oversight. In March 2010,  the Deputy Secretary of Energy announced a reform effort to revise  DOE\u2019s safety and security directives and modify the department\u2019s  oversight approach to \u201cprovide contractors with the flexibility to tailor and  implement safety without excessive federal oversight or overly  prescriptive departmental requirements.\u201d In the memorandum announcing  this effort, the Deputy Secretary noted that oversight of contractors\u2019  activities at DOE and NNSA sites had become excessive and that  burdensome safety requirements were affecting the productivity of work  at DOE\u2019s sites. The memorandum stated that reducing this burden on  contractors would lead to measurable productivity improvement. In  February 2011, NNSA issued a policy (NAP-21) with the purpose of  providing further direction to NNSA officials and M&O contractors about  the framework for the oversight model. Later in 2011, DOE issued Policy  and Order 226.1B, which updated DOE\u2019s oversight policy. While the  previous DOE oversight policy and order were focused on driving  continuous improvement, the 2011 versions\u2014which are still in use\u2014focus  on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of DOE oversight programs  by leveraging the processes and outcomes of CAS to reduce direct,  hands-on oversight, when appropriate. Under the oversight framework,  federal overseers are to continue to give additional oversight emphasis to  high-hazard and high-risk operations, but where it can be determined that  risk is lower and contractor-generated information in CAS is reliable,  federal oversight can rely more on information from CAS.", "NAP-21, which similarly focuses on the oversight efficiencies that can be  gained by appropriately leveraging information from CAS, specifically  applies to NNSA and its M&O contractors and elaborates on the more  general DOE oversight policy and order by (1) developing an approach  for federal officials to use in determining the appropriate mix of oversight  activities for different contractor-performed functions and (2) by  establishing a process by which NNSA would affirm the effectiveness of  both CAS implementation by the contractor and the federal oversight  approach at each site in the nuclear security enterprise.", "First, NAP-21 describes a spectrum of approaches that can be employed  by NNSA officials to oversee M&O contractors. On one side of the  spectrum is \u201ctransaction-based oversight,\u201d or direct, hands-on oversight  activities to test or observe contractors\u2019 performance through such  mechanisms as on-site reviews, facility inspections, and other actions that  involve direct evaluation of contractor activities. On the other side of the  spectrum is \u201csystems-based oversight,\u201d where federal overseers rely on  contractors\u2019 processes and information from their CAS. NAP-21 calls for  NNSA to use a mix of systems-based and transaction-based oversight  approaches in overseeing contractors\u2019 performance and provides a  framework for determining the appropriate mix of these approaches  based on the results of a three-pronged evaluation: (1) a risk assessment  that analyzes the likelihood that an event will occur that adversely affects  the achievement of mission or program objectives or harms human health  or the environment; (2) a CAS maturity assessment that establishes the  level of confidence NNSA officials have in the adequacy of performance  information developed by the contractor and the ability of the contractor to  effectively identify and address performance weaknesses; and (3) an  assessment that considers the contractors\u2019 prior performance for a  specific activity. NNSA\u2019s oversight framework allows for the oversight for  any particular activity to range from primarily transaction-based oversight  to primarily systems-based, or anywhere in between based on the  outcome of these three assessments. Figure 1 shows the factors\u2014as  described in NAP-21\u2014that should be considered by NNSA officials in  determining an appropriate oversight approach. NAP-21 anticipates that,  over time, as contractors\u2019 CAS mature, NNSA officials will use  transaction-based oversight primarily for areas of highest risk and hazard,  and systems-based oversight for lower risk and hazard activities where  they can rely more heavily on a contractor\u2019s CAS.", "Second, NAP-21 includes a process, known as \u201caffirmation,\u201d designed for  a federal assessment review team\u2014composed of staff from NNSA  program offices and field offices\u2014to review each field office\u2019s mix of  oversight approaches and practices, as well as implementation of each  M&O contractor\u2019s CAS. The goal of the review is to affirm that each  contractor has a fully implemented and reliable CAS and that each field  office\u2019s approach to oversight is appropriate. According to senior agency  officials, these affirmation reviews were envisioned as a crucial element in  ensuring the effectiveness of NNSA\u2019s overall approach to contractor  oversight across the nuclear security enterprise.", "In addition, as the nation\u2019s only permanent disposal site for certain types  of defense nuclear waste, key nuclear weapons missions depend on the  availability of DOE\u2019s WIPP in order to continue their own operations.  WIPP\u2019s operations were suspended in February 2014 following the  underground vehicle fire and unrelated radiological event. In April 2015,  DOE formally determined that the nuclear waste container that breached  resulting in the radiological event at WIPP was packaged at NNSA\u2019s Los  Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). At the time of the 2014 incident at  WIPP, waste packaging operations at LANL, were overseen by NNSA\u2019s  Los Alamos Field Office in coordination with EM\u2019s CBFO,  which  provided additional verification by certifying packaged radioactive waste  containers to ensure they met criteria set by CBFO for disposal in WIPP.   At WIPP itself, oversight of the M&O contractor is led by EM through  the CBFO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Has Not Fully Established Policy or Guidance for Using Information from CAS to Conduct Contractor Oversight", "paragraphs": ["In our May 2015 report, we found that NNSA has not fully established  policy or guidance to support determining appropriate approaches to  overseeing its M&O contractors, including for using information from CAS.  Specifically, we found that NNSA does not have complete policy or  guidance to support the assessments NAP-21 requires for determining an  effective approach to overseeing M&O contractors at each site. NAP-21  outlines the three-pronged evaluation framework NNSA officials are  responsible to carry out in determining an appropriate mix of oversight  approaches based on assessments of risk, CAS maturity, and past  performance. However, NAP-21 does not provide detailed or  comprehensive guidance to NNSA officials on how to conduct these  assessments, and NNSA headquarters has not issued any additional  guidance for this purpose. We found that DOE and NNSA have some  policies and guidance that are relevant to conducting risk assessments  for security and safety and, in some cases, for large construction projects.  We did not, however, identify any headquarters-level policy or guidance  for assessing CAS maturity, for assessing contractors\u2019 past performance  to inform an oversight approach, or for assessing risk in other areas.  Without such policy or guidance, NNSA officials responsible for  conducting assessments may do so inconsistently, and thus treat similar  risks differently. Further, we found that NNSA did not complete a chapter  of NAP-21, which appears in the policy\u2019s table of contents with the title  Requirements Analysis Process, but the corresponding page in the  document simply notes that the details of the chapter would be developed  at a later date. NNSA officials told us the content of this chapter was  intended to establish a process for NNSA to identify requirements in DOE  and NNSA orders and directives essential to support safe and effective  mission accomplishment and that this identification could assist M&O  contractors in identifying key performance measures that could be  tracked in CAS to help contractors ensure their compliance with  requirements.", "As a result of our findings, we recommended that NNSA establish  comprehensive oversight polices including for using information from CAS  to conduct oversight of M&O contractors and describing how to conduct  assessment of risk, CAS maturity, and the level of the contractor\u2019s past  performance in determining an appropriate oversight approach. NNSA  concurred with our recommendation and stated that it will cancel NAP-21  and instead issue a new corporate policy that will form a comprehensive  framework for CAS in the context of ensuring safe, secure, and high- quality mission delivery. NNSA estimated it will complete this policy by  September 30, 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Field Offices Developed Procedures for Determining Appropriate Oversight Approaches, but the Procedures Are Not Always Complete and Differ", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of sufficiently detailed and comprehensive guidance from  NNSA headquarters for determining an appropriate mix of oversight  approaches, NNSA field offices responsible for day-to-day oversight of  M&O contractors reported developing their own procedures for this  purpose. As described in our May 2015 report, these officials reported  that their field office procedures for assessing risk were complete, but that  their procedures for assessing CAS maturity and past performance in  determining an appropriate oversight approach were not always  complete. In addition, we found substantial differences among the  procedures field offices had that may affect NNSA\u2019s ability to ensure  consistent oversight of its contractors. For example, the five field offices  that reported having complete procedures for assessing CAS maturity  used different processes and scales for rating maturity. While each of  these procedures may be effective for each field office\u2019s purposes, these  differences could affect the consistency with which NNSA\u2019s field offices  are determining an appropriate mix of oversight approaches across the  nuclear security enterprise. We recommended that NNSA work with field  office managers to establish field office procedures consistent with  headquarters policy and guidance to support assessment practices for  determining appropriate oversight approaches. NNSA concurred with our  recommendation and stated that field offices will develop new or modify  existing procedures, as appropriate, to support the new requirements and  estimated the completion date for these activities is September 2016.", "Furthermore, field office officials have raised concerns that staffing levels  and the mix of staff skills may not be adequate to conduct appropriate  oversight in the near future and that this may result in overreliance on  information from CAS without the ability to ensure that this information is  sufficiently reliable. For example, in response to our survey of field offices  conducted for our May 2015 report, six of NNSA\u2019s seven field offices  responded that having fewer staff to implement NAP-21\u2019s approach to  oversight is a challenge. Furthermore, five of seven field offices noted that  not having certain subject matter experts is a challenge for oversight that  could be exacerbated in the future as senior field office staff are expected  to become retirement eligible. In a January 2013 report to DOE\u2019s Federal  Technical Capability Panel, one field office reported that its staffing levels  were less than the number required to perform the oversight identified as  necessary. This field office noted that staffing shortages were offset  through support from other offices and increased reliance on contractor- generated information from CAS. The 2013 report did not indicate if the  field office\u2019s increased reliance on information from CAS for oversight was  supported by the field office\u2019s analysis of the risk of the activity, the  maturity level of the contractor\u2019s CAS, and contractor performance in the  area. We found that NNSA has not assessed whether it has sufficient,  qualified personnel to implement the oversight framework described in  NAP-21.", "We recommended that NNSA assess staffing needs to determine  whether it has sufficient qualified personnel to conduct oversight activities  consistent with comprehensive polices and guidance, including use of  information for CAS. NNSA concurred with our recommendation and  stated that it will assess staffing needs by December 2016, to allow for  field level policies and procedures to be considered in the development of  the staffing strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Discontinued the Process for Headquarters Review of Field Offices\u2019 Oversight Approaches", "paragraphs": ["We also found that NNSA headquarters discontinued affirmation reviews  (the process established by NAP-21 for reviewing the effectiveness of  contractors\u2019 CAS implementation and field offices\u2019 oversight approaches)  effectively eliminating the primary internal control activity that NAP-21  included for the agency to evaluate oversight effectiveness across the  nuclear security enterprise. Prior to discontinuing this process, NNSA  conducted affirmation reviews at three sites\u2014Sandia National  Laboratories, the Nevada National Security Site, and the Y-12 National  Security Complex\u2014and all three reviews resulted in affirmations of the  effective implementation of the contractor\u2019s CAS and of the federal  oversight approach. However, following the 2012 security incident at Y- 12\u2014which occurred after NNSA affirmed the implementation and  reliability of the contractor\u2019s CAS and the effectiveness of the Y-12 field  office\u2019s mix of oversight approaches\u2014NNSA discontinued its affirmation  review process. According to NNSA officials, after investigating the root  causes for the security lapse at Y-12, NNSA determined that its  affirmation reviews focused too heavily on affirming that a CAS existed  and covered the five required attributes of a CAS as outlined in NAP-21.  According to NNSA officials, the affirmation reviews did not focus enough  on evaluating the effectiveness of either the contractor\u2019s CAS or the field  office\u2019s approach to determining the appropriate mix of systems- and  transaction-based oversight.", "After discontinuing the affirmation reviews, NNSA initiated an Oversight  Improvement Project to focus on evaluating the effectiveness of  contractors\u2019 CAS and field offices\u2019 oversight approaches. However, a  senior NNSA official told us the project was never completed, and NNSA  has not developed another process in lieu of affirmation reviews.  Discontinuing affirmation reviews without replacing them with another  form of validation eliminates the internal control activity in NAP-21 to  provide NNSA with assurance of oversight effectiveness across the  nuclear security enterprise. Further, continuing a process to review the  effectiveness of oversight approaches would have provided information  allowing for oversight practices to be compared across field offices and  for differences among them to be evaluated. According to NNSA  headquarters and field officials, there is no current mechanism for this to  occur.", "We recommended that NNSA reestablish a process for reviewing the  effectiveness of field offices\u2019 oversight approaches, including their  determinations for how and when to use information from CAS.

Our preliminary observations are based on our review  of specific sections of DOE\u2019s Phase II accident investigation board report  on the radiological release.  \uf0b7  First, with regard to our finding that NNSA has not fully established  policies or guidance for using information from CAS to conduct  oversight of M&O contractors, the accident investigation board report  on WIPP found that NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos Field Office was overreliant  on CAS for environmental compliance oversight. The accident  investigation board report also found that the field office did not  adequately conduct transactional assessments of the contractor in  areas such as environmental compliance and operations of the LANL  facility where the TRU waste container that breached was processed  and packaged. According to the accident investigation board report,  the NNSA field office\u2019s overreliance on the contractor-generated  information in CAS was not consistent with a 2011 NNSA review that  observed CAS was still maturing and that a strong NNSA field office  oversight presence should continue. Moreover, the accident  investigation board identified specific deficiencies in CAS such as  inadequate contractor self-assessments regarding waste processing  and packaging and concluded that CAS was not effective in  identifying weaknesses that contributed to the incident. Under the  oversight framework, determining that a CAS is not fully mature would  result in a heavier reliance on transactions-based approaches to  overseeing LANL\u2019s waste packaging operations.  \uf0b7  Second, with respect to our finding that NNSA field office officials  have raised concerns that staffing levels and the mix of staff skills  may not be adequate to conduct appropriate oversight\u2014which may  result in overreliance on information from CAS\u2014according to the  accident investigation board report on WIPP Los Alamos Field Office  officials attributed their overreliance on the information in CAS for  environmental compliance oversight to a lack of resources to directly  perform this oversight. The report also found that the field office did  not have senior technical expertise, such as organic chemistry  expertise, necessary for conducting adequate technical reviews  related to the contractor\u2019s processing of the TRU wastes, which were  the source of the radiological release at WIPP.", "Our preliminary observations on DOE\u2019s processes for overseeing the  contractor responsible for managing and operating WIPP indicate that EM  has not outlined an EM-specific policy framework for its field office  officials to use in establishing and implementing effective oversight  programs beyond the 2011 DOE oversight policy and order. However  incomplete, NNSA developed NAP-21 in an effort to elaborate on DOE\u2019s  policy and order by providing an NNSA-specific oversight policy  framework that included a three-pronged evaluation framework for  determining an appropriate oversight approach. EM headquarters officials  told us that EM does not provide its field offices supplemental EM-specific  policy or other formal direction on how to use the broad DOE oversight  order but encourages them to use DOE\u2019s oversight guide focused on  nuclear safety that provides suggested, not mandatory, approaches to  designing and implementing field office oversight programs.  For  example, this guide describes site-specific conditions that field offices  should consider in establishing oversight priorities and allocating  oversight resources, including consideration of the types of nuclear  facilities and their hazards and the status and effectiveness of the  contractor\u2019s CAS. At this point in our ongoing review, we are not aware  of examples of direction provided to EM field offices to oversee M&O  contractors\u2019 performance in areas other than nuclear safety, such as  business operations or safeguards and security. EM headquarters  officials told us that EM provides field offices with evaluation guides that  they can use to develop their evaluations of specific elements of a  contractor\u2019s nuclear facility safety program, such as the WIPP\u2019s M&O  contractor\u2019s CAS. We have not yet evaluated the DOE oversight guide,  EM\u2019s reliance on it, or the evaluation guides EM has developed for its  field offices, but we will do so as we complete our work.", "In conclusion, GAO has reported for years on the management  challenges DOE faces, as well as specific safety and security incident  such as the recent accident at WIPP. DOE\u2019s management and oversight  reform efforts have sought to address the conditions underlying safety  and security failures, but recent events at WIPP show that more work is  needed. Our recently released report concludes that NNSA does not have  complete standards against which to measure whether oversight  approaches are effective, including how information from CAS is being  used for oversight. This is because NNSA does not have complete policy  or guidance to implement the oversight framework and has discontinued  its reviews intended to evaluate the effectiveness of field offices\u2019 oversight  approaches; also, in the absence of headquarters policy or guidance, its  field offices have developed procedures that are not fully complete and  differ. As a result, NNSA runs the risk of not using its oversight resources  effectively, either by underutilizing information from CAS and missing  opportunities for efficiency, or by overrelying on information from CAS  and possibly missing contractor performance issues that put safety,  security, or mission accomplishment at risk. With respect to the recent  events at WIPP, these issues concern DOE as well.", "Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member DeGette, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
