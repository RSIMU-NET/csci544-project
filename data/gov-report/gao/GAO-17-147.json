Specifically, the 2012 Corps' post-authorization change report (PACR) and a 2012 consultant report identified the Corps' 1997 selection of an innovative in-the-wet method to construct the dam as a contributing factor. With this method, concrete sections of the dam, or shells, are built on shore, carried out into the river, and set in place in the riverbed. The Corps decided to use this method based on projections that it would cost less and allow the project to be completed sooner than the traditional in-the-dry method using temporary, watertight structures, or cofferdams, to drain the riverbed to allow work. However, the Corps' initial cost estimate was low and did not adequately consider such things as river conditions that slowed construction. A 2012 Corps study compared the in-the-wet and in-the-dry methods and found that continuing to use the in-the-wet method would cost more but would allow the project to be completed sooner. Based on this study, the Corps continued to use the in-the-wet method. In addition, the PACR and a 2008 consultant report found that the Corps' decision to use a cost-reimbursement contract for the dam construction after receiving no offers for a firm fixed -price contract contributed to increased administrative and overhead costs. The reports noted that managing a cost-reimbursement contract was more cost- and time-intensive than managing a firm fixed-price contract, which the Corps typically uses. The Corps and consultant reports also identified other contributing factors, including limited funding; market condition changes, such as unexpected and significant increases in the price of construction materials; and design changes during the dam construction in response to soil conditions and other issues.", "The benefits foregone because of delays at Olmsted are uncertain, primarily because the Corps' estimates for the project are no longer relevant or are of limited use for estimating the benefits that might have been generated had the project opened as planned in 2006. The Corps estimated the benefits associated with the project several times, including in a 1990 study. Corps officials said, however, that the benefit estimates from this study are no longer relevant for estimating benefits foregone because of past project delays. In particular, the 1990 study did not anticipate the regulatory and market factors that reduced the demand for coal shipments on the Ohio River, beginning in the 1990s. In the 2012 PACR, the Corps updated its benefit estimates based on a revised opening date of 2020, but they are of limited use for estimating benefits foregone for several reasons. For example, the analysis was based on assumptions about barge forecasts that may not represent the actual traffic that transited the locks and dams during past delays. According to Corps economists, the additional interest incurred during construction because of project delays is another type of benefit foregone because it represents the hypothetical return or \u201cbenefit\u201d that could have been earned by investing the money in some other use. GAO found that the difference in interest estimated in 1990 and in the PACR to be about $400 million, which represents an estimate of the additional interest associated with such factors as changes in the project design that led to the construction delays and increased construction costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is responsible for planning  and constructing the Olmsted Locks and Dam project, which is on the  Ohio River, 17 miles upstream from the Mississippi River.

A lock and dam enable vessels to navigate through a shallow  or steep section of river. A lock is an enclosed chamber in a waterway  with watertight gates at each end, for raising or lowering vessels from one  water level to another by admitting or releasing water.

One of these methods was in-the-wet construction, which had  been used to construct tunnels and bridges in a marine environment, but  which had not been used to construct a project such as Olmsted in a river  environment.", "In the early to mid-1990s, the Corps commissioned several studies to  look at different ways to construct the dam, including using the in-the-wet  method. One study examined using a mobile cofferdam instead of a  conventional fixed cofferdam. Another study looked at alternate  methods for constructing the tainter gate section of the dam. A third  study performed a life cycle cost analysis of five different alternatives of  dam types and construction methods, including in-the-dry, in-the-wet, and  a combination of the two methods. A fourth study, issued in December  1997, evaluated and compared using the in-the-wet and in-the-dry  construction methods, as well as using a combination of both methods to  provide a basis for deciding between the methods. This study found that  using the in-the-wet method under two different construction schedule  scenarios would cost either $54.9 million less and allow the project to be  completed 2 years earlier or about $63.2 million less and be completed 5- 1/2 years earlier.", "Prior to the issuance of the 1997 study, the Corps established a team of  Corps engineers, program managers, and others to review the study and  recommend a construction method. The team members evaluated  specific project components, including structural engineering, cost  estimating, and design. The team said in a July 1997 document that it  would be feasible to construct the dam with either the in-the-wet or in-the- dry method. However, using the in-the-wet method option would more  likely allow the project to be completed 1-1/2 to 2 years earlier than using  the in-the-dry method and the estimated cost savings would be  approximately $40 million. Some team members expressed concerns with  the in-the-wet method, including three engineers, one of whom stated that  the in-the-wet method\u2019s foundation would be more expensive than the  foundation required for the in-the-dry method, another who expressed  doubts over whether the project would be finished according to schedule,  and another who noted that the Corps\u2019 Louisville District had little or no  experience using the in-the-wet method. The Corps district decided to use  the in-the-wet method, citing four reasons\u2014lower cost, shorter  construction schedule, less impact on navigation during construction, and  the potential for fewer negative environmental impacts.

These include certain river conditions that slowed construction, the  effect of the site\u2019s seismic conditions on fabricating the shells, and  funding constraints. Also, the 2012 consultant report stated that the  independent government estimate, prepared in 2003, inadequately  characterized the uncertainty and risk in pursuing an innovative in-the-wet  construction method and set expectations of project cost and duration far  too low.

For example, according to the PACR, as the project design continued  following the 1989 General Design Memorandum, the Corps planned to  construct a hydraulic wicket dam. In May 1994, the Corps awarded a  contract to construct a full-sized prototype of the dam to test how the gate  would operate and to test maintenance procedures, and this contract was  completed in December 1995. This modeling revealed the complexity of  the design, and the Corps revised the design to construct tainter gates  and boat-operated wickets instead. In addition, the PACR stated that the  in-the-wet method required specialized equipment that increased costs,  such as the super gantry crane and the catamaran barge, which have  minimal salvage value.", "In January 2012, the Corps\u2019 Deputy Commanding General for Civil and  Emergency Operations directed the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division  to explore alternative construction methods and to present  recommendations to Corps headquarters by June 1, 2012. In providing  this direction, the Deputy Commanding General stated that the in-the-wet  construction method had proven more expensive and time-consuming  than originally envisioned. Among other things, the division was to  develop concept-level designs for in-the-dry construction that could be  used to develop a reliable cost estimate, and to compare that estimate to  the in-the-wet estimate.", "The Corps completed its review of the in-the-wet versus in-the-dry  methods in a May 2012 study, which underwent agency technical review  and was certified by its Cost Engineering and Agency Technical Review  Mandatory Center of Expertise. The study concluded that constructing the  dam components using the in-the-dry method was a technically feasible  alternative. The study found that continuing to use the in-the-wet method  would cost more than switching to the in-the-dry method, but it would  allow the project to be operational sooner. Specifically, the study  estimated that the in-the-dry method would cost $2.810 billion compared  to the PACR\u2019s $2.918 billion estimate of performing the work with the in- the-wet method. However, the study found that using the in-the-dry  method would result in the project not being operational until 2022, which  is 2 years later than the PACR\u2019s estimated operational date of 2020.", "A June 2012 Corps internal memorandum stated that based on the  findings of the in-the-dry study, the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division  recommended continuing to use the in-the-wet construction method for  Olmsted. The memorandum stated that if the Corps changed course and  used the in-the-dry method, it would require that a new contract be  awarded. As a result, potentially two contracts would be ongoing for a  period of time, which would likely exceed available funds and cause a  delay. The memorandum also stated that because the Corps does not  have the authority to use incremental funding or a continuing contracts  clause, it would need to award another cost-reimbursement contract for  the in-the-dry construction. The Deputy Commanding General for Civil  and Emergency Operations directed the division to explore the possibility  of soliciting opinions of industry rather than prescribing the construction  method. In response, a Corps official presented the study\u2019s findings in an  August 2012 meeting of the Inland Waterways Users Board, which is  composed of members of industry. This official said that the division  recommended using the in-the-wet construction method, in part based on  the Corps having learned from its experience with the construction and  having become more efficient at setting shells. This official also stated  that the contractor was about to begin setting shells for the navigable  pass and, compared to the shells for tainter gates, these shells were  smaller, lighter, and uniform in size, which would allow the contractor to  set them more quickly.

Specifically, the Corps requested  proposals for a cost-plus-award-fee contract, rather than a cost-plus- incentive-fee or a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, because according to a  Corps official, it was the best fit for the project. According to the Federal  Acquisition Regulation, an award fee contract is suitable for use when the  work to be performed is such that it is neither feasible nor effective to  devise predetermined objective incentive targets applicable to cost,  technical performance, and schedule. Alternatively, an incentive fee  contract should be used when cost and performance targets are objective  and can be predetermined, allowing a formula to adjust the negotiated fee  based on variations relative to the targets. A district official stated that a  cost-plus-incentive-fee contract was not appropriate because targets  could not have been reasonably determined since the in-the-wet  construction method had never been attempted before. Difficult river  conditions provided additional risks to the contractor. According to the  Corps official, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract would not have provided  sufficient incentive for the contractor because the fee would not change.", "In May 2003, the Corps requested proposals for the dam construction as  a cost-plus-award-fee contract and received two offers, and awarded the  contract in January 2004 to a joint venture. According to a Corps cost analysis of the proposals, the winning proposal included a lower  maximum award fee of 5 percent, capped overhead costs, and had more  overall budgeted cost savings than the other proposal. The winning  proposal was $564 million, which was more than 25 percent higher than  the independent government estimate. However, the Corps\u2019 Office of  the Chief Counsel said that the statutory prohibition on the Corps  awarding a contract for river and harbor improvements with a price that  exceeds 125 percent of the independent government estimate did not  apply to the Olmsted dam contract because it was a cost-reimbursement  contract.", "The PACR and the 2008 consultant report noted that the effort to manage  a cost-reimbursement contract is more cost- and time-intensive than  managing a firm fixed-price contract. For example, the PACR stated that  there are additional activities associated with a cost-reimbursement  contract, such as audit services, voucher reviews, and award fee  evaluation boards. The PACR estimated that the Corps\u2019 cost of  construction management for these additional activities increased by  more than $74 million (in October 2011 price levels), in part because the  change in completion date had extended the construction schedule. The  2008 consultant report stated that the cost-reimbursement contract  necessitated a substantial amount of administrative effort to track, record,  and evaluate the contractor\u2019s performance, and that doing so increased  the Corps\u2019 staff needs by approximately 40 percent. A district official said  that the Corps hired 3 additional staff and the contractor hired 10 to 15  additional staff to perform these administrative tasks.", "In 2009, we reviewed federal agencies\u2019 use of cost-reimbursement  contracts and found that they involve significantly more government  oversight than do fixed-price contracts, which means the government  incurs additional administrative costs on top of what it is paying the  contractor. For example, we found that the government must determine  that the contractor\u2019s accounting system is adequate for determining costs  related to the contract and update this determination periodically. In  addition, we found that contractor costs need to be monitored\u2014known as  cost surveillance\u2014to provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods  and effective cost controls are used.", "Another cost associated with the cost-reimbursement contract is  evaluating the contractor\u2019s award fee. For each evaluation period, the  Corps is to assess the contractor\u2019s performance against explicit criteria  relating to cost, schedule, quality, and safety and environmental  compliance, as set forth in the award fee plan. The 2012 consultant report  found that the Olmsted project team did not have the experience to  manage a cost-reimbursement contract, but that the team had instituted  management methods and techniques to control project costs, many of  which were industry best practices and consistent with Corps and  Department of Defense guidance. The Corps agreed with the report\u2019s  recommendation that if the Corps plans to use a cost-reimbursement  contract for other civil works projects, the agency needs to identify  training required for project members when it develops the acquisition  strategy. The report also concluded that the Corps\u2019 management of the  cost-reimbursement contract was not a significant factor in explaining the  project\u2019s cost and schedule overruns, and Corps officials we interviewed  agreed.", "Within the last few years, the Corps has taken actions to help improve its  management of civil works projects, including Olmsted. In 2012, the  Corps designated Olmsted as a mega-project because of its cost,  importance, and complexity, among other things. The Corps issued  guidance in 2012 on managing mega-projects. According to the 2012  guidance, the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division is to provide progress  reports to Corps headquarters and an integrated project schedule and  cost estimate that the project team updates monthly. Corps officials said  that the Corps created its Integrated Project Office in 2012 to help  increase its management focus on Olmsted. In 2016, the Corps updated  its mega-project guidance to require quarterly reports on such things as  analysis of risk. The Corps also has daily, weekly, and monthly  meetings to discuss how the dam contractor is staying on schedule,  controlling cost, and managing risks. In 2014, the Corps adopted a  recommendation from a 2010 report prepared by navigation industry  representatives and Corps navigation experts to prioritize new  construction and rehabilitation projects based on an examination of  factors such as economic return, risk-based analysis, and the estimated  cost and construction schedule. As a result, the Corps made Olmsted its  top priority construction project. In the Corps\u2019 March 2016 capital  investment plan, prepared in response to WRRDA 2014, Olmsted  remained its top priority construction project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Key Factors Identified as Contributing to Cost Increases and Schedule Delays", "paragraphs": ["The reports by the Corps and others also identified other key factors that  contributed to cost increases and schedule delays, including limited  funding, changes in market conditions, and design changes.", "The Olmsted project\u2019s authorized cost was based on the Corps\u2019  assumption that each year the agency would receive the maximum  amount of funding that it could efficiently and effectively spend. However,  according to the reports by the Corps and others, the Olmsted project  was significantly underfunded in some years, which contributed to cost  increases and schedule delays. Specifically, according to these reports,  the amount the Corps allocated for the Olmsted project from its annual  appropriation, together with the amount appropriated from the Inland  Waterways Trust Fund, was less than optimal for construction, and in  2004 and 2005, the Corps reprogrammed appropriations from Olmsted to  another project. Incremental funding from the Inland Waterways Trust  Fund also contributed to delays and increased costs, according to the  2012 consultant report.", "According to the Corps reports, limited funding resulted in delayed  contract awards and increased contract durations to conform to the  funding received. For example, according to the PACR, the approach wall  contract was awarded 2 years later than originally planned because of  limited funding, which delayed the award of the dam contract by 2  years. About 2 months before the award of the Olmsted dam  construction contract, the Corps told the offerors to develop revised  estimates based on the assumption that $17.5 million would be available  the first year, with $80 million available each year thereafter, which  increased proposal costs by $18.2 million and added 1 year to the  completion date, according to the PACR. However, according to the  reports by the Corps and others, during the first 2 years of the dam  contract, the project had less funding than assumed. Specifically,  according to the 2012 consultant report, the dam contract received  approximately $5 million of the anticipated $17.5 million in 2004. The  other funds were reprogrammed to the McAlpine locks, which the Corps  viewed as urgent because their failure would cause the Ohio River  navigation system to fail. In 2005, funds were again reprogrammed, with  the dam contract receiving approximately $47 million of the anticipated  $80 million for the year. However, according to the 2008 Corps and 2012  consultant reports, reprogramming was curtailed significantly in fiscal year  2006 in accordance with the Energy and Water Development  Appropriations Act and accompanying congressional committee reports.", "Also, according to a Corps headquarters official, in fiscal year 2003, the  balance of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, which generally pays half of  the construction costs of navigation and rehabilitation projects, started to  decline because so many projects were under construction. The official  said that from fiscal years 2005 to 2009, there was a sharp decrease in  the balance of the trust fund as fuel tax revenues started to decline, and  that by fiscal year 2009, the fund was nearly depleted. As a result,  expenditures from the fund were limited to the amount of annual fuel tax  revenues collected for that particular year. According to the 2012  consultant report and the headquarters official, the Olmsted project was  funded on a monthly basis, and this incremental funding also contributed  to delays and increased costs. For example, incremental funding caused  the 2009 shell fabrication season to be split between 2009 and 2010,  according to the 2012 consultant report.", "According to the reports by the Corps and others, changes in construction  market conditions contributed to increases in the cost of the dam. After  the Corps awarded the dam contract in January 2004, unexpected and  significant increases in the price of construction equipment and materials  occurred. According to the PACR and the consultant reports, the 2005  hurricane season, which included Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, created a  scarcity of barges and cranes at the time when the contractor was trying  to mobilize the necessary equipment to construct the dam. Specifically,  according to the 2012 consultant report, most of the barges scheduled for  use in building the dam were under construction in shipyards along the  Gulf Coast when the hurricanes struck. As a result, barge production  slowed tremendously and prices doubled as the demand for existing  barges increased because of the hurricane restoration efforts.", "Also, according to the reports by the Corps and others, domestic and  international construction booms created a high demand for construction  materials after the award of the construction contract. The Corps reports  presented data from the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor  Statistics, which showed that the price of construction materials increased  significantly after 2004. According to the 2008 consultant report, from  2002 to 2007, the price of fabricated steel increased about 300 percent,  the price of cement increased about 90 percent, the price of riprap  increased by 100 to 200 percent, and the price of fuel increased about  300 percent. In addition, insurance and bonding cost increased about 230  percent. Since the dam construction contract was awarded in January  2004, the contractor\u2019s proposal did not include these increases in the cost  of materials.", "The reports by the Corps and others identified design changes during the  dam construction as contributing to increased costs. However, the reports  do not provide the amount by which the changes increased costs.  Examples of design changes included the following:", "The consultant reports cited the use of a super gantry crane instead of  sleds to move the precast shells into the river as a design change that  contributed to increased cost. The Corps\u2019 2016 Lessons Learned  Report stated that the change was made because design issues  related to sled deflection could not be overcome.", "The PACR and the 2012 consultant report cited the need to reinforce  the site for the shell precast yard and the marine skidway as  contributing to increased cost. According to the PACR, after  awarding the construction contract, it was determined that the soil  conditions at the site for the precast yard and the marine skidway  were inadequate to support the foundation loads and that an  extensive amount of piling was required to support their weight.", "The Corps reports and the 2012 consultant report cited the need to  address slope stability issues on the shore as contributing to  increased cost. The Corps reports stated that an active slide was  observed during monitoring of the Illinois bank at the site of the locks.  A district official said that the Corps observed the slide. Defining the  extent of the slide problem and determining the best solution required  additional effort. The Corps reports stated that these problems also  added to the effort required to design and build the precast yard and  marine launching facility.", "The PACR cited the need to increase the length of the foundation  piles for the tainter gate portion of the dam and to conduct additional  excavation because of sand waves as contributing to increased  cost. According to a district official, sand waves are constantly  migrating downriver to the construction site, and as sand collects on  the footprint of the foundation, the riverbed has to be excavated so  that shells can be set correctly, which increases cost."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Total Cost of Benefits Foregone from Project Delays at Olmsted Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["The total cost of benefits foregone from project delays that have occurred  at Olmsted is uncertain, primarily because the estimates that the Corps  developed for the project are no longer relevant or are of limited use for  estimating the benefits that might have been generated had the project  become operational as planned in 2006. The extent to which the project  incurs another type of benefit foregone\u2014the additional interest during  construction incurred because of the longer construction period\u2014 depends on economic factors, such as the project discount rate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Benefits That the Olmsted Project Would Have Generated Had It Become Operational as Planned Are Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["The benefits that the Olmsted project would have generated had it  become operational as planned in 2006 are uncertain, primarily because  the estimates that the Corps has made are no longer relevant or are of  limited use for this purpose. The Corps analyzed the benefits and costs  associated with the project several times, including in a 1990 study. In  that study, for example, the Corps estimated that the project would begin  generating average annual benefits of about $920 million in 2006.  According to the PACR, the Olmsted locks and dam project once  operational would reduce the cost of shipping products on the Ohio River  by processing barge shipments more efficiently than the two existing  locks and dams. Corps officials said, however, that this estimate is no  longer relevant for estimating the benefits foregone from past project  delays. In particular, as noted in the PACR, the 1990 study did not  anticipate the regulatory and market factors that reduced the demand for  coal and coal shipments on the Ohio River, beginning in the 1990s. In  addition, because the 1990 study did not assess the uncertainty  associated with key assumptions, such as the barge traffic forecast, it  cannot be used to assess what the benefits might have been, beginning  in 2006, under lower barge traffic forecast assumptions. In general, fewer  barge shipments mean less congestion and delay and lower benefits from  replacing the existing locks and dams, if all else remains the same.", "In 2012, the Corps updated its analysis of the benefits and costs  associated with the Olmsted project, based on a revised operational date  of 2020. The Corps estimated, for example, that the project would  generate average annual benefits of about $875 million per year over 50  years, beginning in 2020. The Corps used the analysis to estimate the  benefits foregone from potential delays in the future, should the project  opening be delayed again. In a June 2012 presentation before the Inland  Waterways Users Board, for example, the Corps indicated that a pause in  construction at Olmsted (e.g., to shift funding to other Corps projects)  could delay its opening 4 years to 2024, which could result in benefits  foregone of about $3.5 billion ($875 million each year).", "The updated estimates from the PACR could be viewed as rough  estimates of the benefits foregone since the delayed 2006 opening, but  the estimates are of limited use for this purpose for several reasons. First,  the PACR economic analysis assesses whether the potential benefits of  the Olmsted project would outweigh its remaining costs. Corps  economists said that the analysis was not designed to estimate the  benefits foregone from project delays that occurred in the past, and as a  result, the benefit estimates would be less reliable when used for that  purpose.", "Second, the PACR estimates were based on assumptions about  economic conditions expected in the future and may not represent the  economic conditions that existed when past project delays occurred. For  the PACR analysis, the Corps assumed that the existing locks and dams  would need to be closed for repairs several times over the period of  analysis (i.e., beginning in 2020) and that this would reduce the volume of  shipments that could transit the locks during those closures. As a result,  transportation cost savings could be generated by replacing the existing  facilities with the Olmsted project, which is expected to be closed less  often. These assumptions, however, may not align with the actual  performance of the existing locks and dams in the past. For example,  Corps economists said that the existing facilities have performed more  reliably than expected, in part because funds were expended to maintain  them in an operating condition. Moreover, changes in the PACR  assumptions about the reliability of the existing locks and dams can  significantly affect the benefit estimates. As a result, the PACR benefit  estimates would be less reliable as a measure of benefits foregone if the  assumptions about the expected performance of the existing facilities do  not align with their actual performance in the past.", "Third, the benefit estimates, which are based on forecasts of barge  shipments through the locks beginning in 2020, may not represent the  actual traffic that transited the locks and dams in the past. For example,  the PACR assumed that barge shipments through Locks and Dam 52  would reach about 113 million tons in 2020 and grow thereafter. This  tonnage is greater than the roughly 94 million tons that the PACR  indicates were shipped through the same locks in 2006\u2014the year that the  Olmsted project was projected to open. In addition, according to Corps  documentation, barge shipments through the existing locks have  generally fallen since 2006. Barge traffic is a key input in the benefit  analysis because it is used in estimating the effect of congestion and  delay at the locks and the transportation cost savings expected to be  generated by replacing the existing structures with the Olmsted project.  The PACR indicated that the benefit estimates are extremely sensitive to  changes in barge traffic assumptions, but did not present the benefits  associated with alternative traffic forecasts.", "Finally, the barge traffic forecasts on which the PACR benefit estimates  are based were developed in the early 2000s. However, the forecasts do  not incorporate factors that have reduced the demand for barge  shipments, particularly for coal, since the forecasts were developed.  According to the PACR, for example, coal is the dominant commodity in  terms of volume on the Ohio River System. In 2015, we found that coal\u2019s  share of electricity generation had declined from 2001 through 2013,  partly because of plant retirements brought about by comparatively low  natural gas prices and the potential need to invest in new equipment to  comply with environmental regulations. In addition, in 2014, we found  that power companies plan to retire an even greater percentage of coal- fired generating capacity than expected earlier. The panel that  conducted the peer review of the PACR in 2010 found that the traffic  forecasts should be updated to include more recent actual barge traffic  (i.e., for years 2006 through 2009) and that additional sensitivity testing  should be conducted to analyze uncertainty associated with coal-related  environmental issues. In addition, Corps officials said that barge  shipments containing coal are expected to continue to decline over the  short and medium terms, but that shipments for some other commodities,  such as those related to natural gas production, have increased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Another Type of Benefit Foregone\u2014Additional Interest Incurred during Construction\u2014Depends on Factors Such as the Project Discount Rate", "paragraphs": ["According to Corps economists, another type of benefit foregone is the  additional interest during construction incurred as a result of project  delays. Corps guidance states that costs incurred during the construction  period should be increased by adding compound interest at the applicable  project discount rate from the date that expenditures are incurred up to  the year the project begins operation. The interest represents the  hypothetical return or \u201cbenefit\u201d that could have been earned by investing  the money in some other use. Delays that increase the construction  period can also increase the interest because interest is compounded  over a longer construction period. The Corps\u2019 1990 study assumed that  the construction period would last from 1991 to 2006, and the PACR  extended the time frame for the construction to 2024.", "To illustrate the potential effect of past delays on the interest cost during  construction, we compared the Corps\u2019 estimate of interest during  construction from the PACR with its estimate of the interest during  construction from the 1990 study. The interest estimate in the PACR  represents the interest cost expected over the entire construction period  estimated by the Corps, including delays, from 1991 through 2024. The  interest estimate from the 1990 study represents the interest expected  over a shorter construction period, from 1991 through 2006 (i.e., updated  in terms of price level and present value using a 4 percent project  discount rate). We found the difference in interest to be about $400  million, which represents the additional interest associated with factors  such as changes in the project design, spending levels, and market  conditions that led to the construction delays and increased construction  costs. For the PACR analysis, for example, the Corps estimated that the  Olmsted project would incur about $1.3 billion in interest during  construction by the time construction was completed in 2024. Based on  the 1990 study, the Olmsted project was expected to incur about $900  million in interest during construction. Nonetheless, the estimate of  additional interest would change if factors such as the project discount  rate were changed. For example, the additional interest cost would be  about $300 million, based on the 7 percent discount rate that Office of  Management and Budget economic guidance indicates should be used  for evaluating proposed federal investments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for review  and comment.
