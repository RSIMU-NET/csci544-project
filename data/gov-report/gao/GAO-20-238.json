The agencies generally agree on what constitutes an individual  feature\u2014for example, a feature can be a mine opening (such as a tunnel,  pit, or vertical shaft), a structure, or a pile of discarded materials (known  as mine tailings or waste rock) that is left behind after ore is crushed and  the valuable minerals are extracted. They also generally agree that an  abandoned mine site can be comprised of only one feature (e.g., an  isolated mine shaft) or many features (e.g., an area with multiple entries,  shafts, open pits, mill buildings, and tailings piles). There is no  universally agreed-upon average number of features per site. Also, not all  federal and state agencies count both sites and features\u2014some agencies  only count sites, some only count features, and some count both.", "The individual features that make up a mine site may pose hazards to  physical safety and risks to human health and the environment.", "Physical safety hazards. Abandoned hardrock mine features that pose  physical safety hazards generally present immediate danger of injury or  death. Examples of physical safety hazards include unstable mine tunnels that can collapse without warning; unmarked open mine shafts and deep pits that pose a danger to  individuals who may inadvertently drive off-road vehicles into them;  and deadly concentrations of gases, such as carbon monoxide and  methane, present inside some mines that can asphyxiate explorers.", "To address physical safety hazards, federal and state agencies typically  focus on identifying and mitigating the risk from individual features. They  may safeguard these features by, for example, filling, capping, or gating  the abandoned mine openings with engineered structures. After a  dangerous feature is identified, an agency may post a warning sign or  erect a fence to temporarily limit access to the feature until the agency  can permanently close it. According to a 2008 Interior Inspector General  report, physical hazards require the least expertise to identify and  evaluate and the least funding to fix or mitigate.", "Environmental hazards. Mine features can also contribute to  degradation of the environment and present short- and long-term risks to  human health. For this report, we refer to these collectively as  environmental hazards. People may be exposed to these hazards when  recreating or living near an abandoned mine. Examples of environmental  hazards include a mine tunnel that drains acidic water laden with heavy metals into a waste rock or tailings piles located along the banks or in the middle of  streams that release hazardous substances such as arsenic, lead,  and mercury into the water; and  tailings that have dispersed into a surrounding community\u2019s soil,  exposing residents to harmful substances.", "The extent of environmental hazards at abandoned mines can vary  widely, from sites that contain one draining tunnel and a few waste rock  piles to sites with extensive underground tunnel networks, many waste  rock piles, and miles of dispersed tailings. Some contaminated hardrock  mine sites are included on the National Priorities List, which includes  some of the most seriously contaminated sites that EPA identifies for  long-term cleanup. The work required to address environmental hazards  varies depending on the extent, type, and concentration of contaminants.  For example, agencies may take one or more of the following actions at a  site:  remove waste rock or tailings from streams; develop passive water treatment systems that allow water to flow out  of mines into treatment ponds; manage the waste on-site or transport it off-site for disposal; or establish active water treatment systems for the most contaminated  sites that require continuous long-term monitoring, among other  actions.", "According to EPA documents, sites with environmental hazards can cost  hundreds of millions of dollars and take many years to address. For  example, as of July 2019, the actual costs at the 25 most expensive mine  and mineral processing sites ranged from $50 million to $583 million per  site, and EPA had been working on some of the sites for over 20 years.  Furthermore, agencies monitor remedies after completion to help ensure  that they are achieving the desired results.", "Figure 1 depicts examples of physical safety and environmental hazards  found at abandoned hardrock mine sites and activities that could take  place to address them.", "Land ownership at abandoned mine sites is often complicated. The  General Mining Act authorizes miners to patent, or purchase, the land  associated with their mining claims\u2014thereby mined land often passed  from federal to private ownership.

The local government  and individuals also used tailings as fill material in yards, roadways,  and other locations, including the high school track. The Forest  Service took the lead on the portion of the site on the land it manages,  and EPA and the state took the lead on various nonfederal portions of  the site. At the state\u2019s request, in 2000, EPA started assessing and  cleaning up 79 residential and community properties in Superior; it  completed this effort in 2013. In 2017, the state removed mine tailings  from the private lands along Flat Creek with EPA oversight. As of  November 2019, the Forest Service has been working with Trout  Unlimited and the state to remove the mine tailings from the banks of  Flat Creek on Forest Service land.

In developing this estimate, the Forest Service did not assume that  responsible parties would cover any of these costs.", "BLM. BLM estimated a portion of the costs associated with  addressing environmental hazards at abandoned hardrock mines on  BLM-managed land, since BLM officials said there are too many  unknowns and unique circumstances at each feature to  comprehensively estimate total costs. These officials said the agency  has estimated costs for some sites with confirmed environmental  hazards in accordance with Interior\u2019s environmental liabilities reporting  guidance. Specifically, as of June 2019, BLM estimated that future  costs to address environmental hazards at 105 abandoned hardrock  mine sites on BLM-managed land range from $61 million to about  $265 million. Interior and BLM officials explained that these costs do  not represent all future costs needed to clean up these sites. Instead,  the range includes the future costs that the agency determines are  reasonably estimable at the time for these sites. In some cases, these  costs are limited to the cost of conducting a study if the agency has  not selected a cleanup remedy.

As of fiscal year 2018, EPA  identified about $519 million in planned obligations for 115 hardrock  mine or mineral processing sites. EPA officials said the planned  obligations do not necessarily reflect the total estimated costs  remaining at a site because the agency typically requires its regions to  report known planned obligations for 3 years, or longer, if available.  According to EPA data, future costs to address hardrock mines likely  will exceed these obligations. For example, EPA did not report  planned obligations for 423 mine and mineral processing sites where  the agency has not completed site assessment work or selected a  cleanup remedy. According to EPA officials, they generally do not  plan obligations for future cleanup work while conducting an  assessment.

These  officials also noted that there is not a similar or consistent source of  funding for states to address hazards at abandoned hardrock mines. In  Nevada, although state-collected mining fees contribute to addressing  safety hazards at abandoned hardrock mines, state officials said they do  not have a consistent source of funding to address environmental  hazards. As a result, Nevada officials explained that they tend to work  primarily on mines where there is a viable responsible party to fund the  cleanup.

Specifically, a Good Samaritan  undertaking cleanup actions at an abandoned hardrock mine might  become a responsible party under CERCLA and thereby would be  responsible for the entire cost of cleaning up the site. As a result,  representatives from an industry association and a nongovernmental  organization told us that while they are interested in addressing  contamination on private land in the West, they generally have not done  so, in part because of concerns about becoming responsible under  CERCLA for cleaning up all of the contamination present at the site.", "In addition, a Good Samaritan undertaking cleanup actions to address  draining mine tunnels may be required to do so in accordance with a  discharge permit under the Clean Water Act. Complying with such a  permit requires that the cleanup meet and maintain water quality  standards, which can be expensive and may require perpetual water  treatment. State officials and stakeholders explained that meeting and  maintaining such standards at certain mines is difficult because of  naturally occurring heavy metals and continual drainage from the mines.  They said they are interested in undertaking smaller-scale projects to  address mine tunnel drainage that may significantly improve water quality  and aquatic habitat but would not fully meet water quality standards.  However, Colorado and Montana state officials and various stakeholders  said they generally decide not to undertake such projects, even if they  could make incremental improvements, because of the risk of being held  responsible for meeting and maintaining water quality standards in  perpetuity.", "To encourage nongovernmental organizations, other stakeholders, and  states to participate in abandoned hardrock mine projects at mixed  ownership sites and on other private land, EPA developed administrative  tools aimed at limiting Good Samaritans\u2019 CERCLA and Clean Water Act  liability.

As of January 2020,  EPA had issued four comfort letters and entered into three settlement  agreements, generally to address hazards at sites that did not require a  Clean Water Act permit. Some state officials and stakeholders we  interviewed said they have not pursued using EPA\u2019s administrative tools  because, in part, these tools do not sufficiently alleviate liability under the  Clean Water Act. For example, they explained that the tools and guidance  provide reassurance that EPA may not sue the Good Samaritan but do  not ensure that certain outside parties will not sue to require they meet  water quality standards.", "State officials and stakeholders we spoke with said that they believe that  resolving the concerns over CERCLA and Clean Water Act liability may  require federal legislation. However, other stakeholders expressed  concerns that legislative changes, such as amending CERCLA or the  Clean Water Act, could inadvertently result in weakening the existing  environmental protections in these and other laws or could limit the ability  of outside parties to enforce their provisions. Since 1999, several bills  have been introduced that would have responded to liability concerns but  as of December 2019, none had been enacted.

Federal officials explained that, unlike Good Samaritans, the abandoned  hardrock mines the federal agencies address are under their jurisdiction  and the agencies are already responsible for meeting the requirements of  CERCLA and other applicable laws. However, federal agency officials  have observed the effects of Good Samaritan legal liability concerns on  projects. For example, Forest Service officials in Colorado said that  potential partners have expressed interest in addressing contamination  on the private land portions of mixed ownership sites but declined once  they learned they would be subject to liability under CERCLA.", "In the absence of legislative changes, EPA officials said they are looking  for new ways to encourage Good Samaritan participation in abandoned  hardrock mine projects. For example, they are working to update and  refine the agency\u2019s administrative tools and identify new solutions to  better address Good Samaritans\u2019 concerns.

In each  interview, we asked the officials to provide information about the numbers  of abandoned hardrock mine sites they identified in their state, features  that posed a hazard to public health and safety, and features that caused  environmental degradation as of the time of our review. We provided the  states with a common definition of abandoned mine site and feature.  However, officials with five states provided information only for  abandoned mine sites and not features. For those states, we counted the  minimum of one feature per site to calculate the states\u2019 total number of  abandoned hardrock mine features. As a result, the states\u2019 total number  of features likely is underestimated. We assessed the reliability of the  states\u2019 information by reviewing documents about the data systems,  checking for missing data and errors, and discussing the data and their  sources with state officials, including any limitations. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable to describe what the state agencies  know about abandoned hardrock mines within their jurisdictions.", "To describe federal agency expenditures to address abandoned hardrock  mines from fiscal years 2008 through 2017, we summarized expenditure  information from the Forest Service, BLM, the Park Service, EPA, and  OSMRE for this time period, the most recent 10 years of information  available at the time of our review. Specifically, we collected information  about total expenditures to address abandoned hardrock mines,  expenditures to address physical safety hazards, expenditures to address  environmental hazards, and expenditures of collections from responsible  parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as applicable. We  assessed the reliability of the agencies\u2019 information by testing the data for  accuracy and completeness by checking for missing data and errors. We  also reviewed our previous related work regarding the use of the  information and interviewed agency officials involved with collecting or  analyzing the information. We determined that the information obtained  from the agencies was sufficiently reliable for our descriptive purposes.  Additional details on agency-specific information we used follows:", "Forest Service. The Forest Service provided expenditure information  for fiscal years 2008 through 2017 for its Abandoned Mine Land and  Environmental Compliance and Protection programs from its  Foundation Financial Information System. The Forest Service also  provided information from this system about expenditures of  reimbursements from responsible parties. USDA provided information  about the Forest Service\u2019s expenditures from the department\u2019s  Hazardous Materials Management Account for fiscal years 2008  through 2017 from the Financial Management Modernization Initiative  system.", "BLM. BLM provided expenditure information from Interior\u2019s Financial  Business Management System for fiscal years 2009 through 2017.  BLM\u2019s budget office provided expenditure information for fiscal year  2008 since information prior to fiscal year 2009 is not included in  Interior\u2019s current financial system. BLM provided information about  abandoned hardrock mine expenditures from relevant subactivity  codes, including Abandoned Mine Lands, Hazardous Materials  Management, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Abandoned  Mine Land projects, and Central Hazardous Materials Fund, among  others.", "Park Service. The Park Service provided expenditure information  from Interior\u2019s Financial Business Management System and the Park  Service\u2019s Project Management Information System and Administrative  Financial Systems 3 and 4 for fiscal years 2008 through 2017 for its  Abandoned Mine Lands program and the Contaminants Cleanup  Branch. The Park Service also provided information from Interior\u2019s  system about expenditures of reimbursements from responsible  parties.", "OSMRE. OSMRE provided expenditure information from Interior\u2019s  Financial Business Management System for fiscal years 2008 through  2017 from its non-coal account, which includes spending for projects  to address abandoned hardrock mines, non-hardrock abandoned  mines, and other eligible projects. To further narrow the non-coal  account expenditures to spending on abandoned hardrock mines, we  reviewed information for projects that states completed during the  10-year period and eliminated expenditures that were clearly identified  for non-hardrock-related projects. We also compared the expenditure  information from OSMRE with expenditure information we obtained  during our semi-structured interviews with officials from six state  agencies that reported spending OSMRE grants specifically on  hardrock abandoned mines\u2014Alaska, Colorado, New Mexico,  Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. We determined that Alaska\u2019s and  Colorado\u2019s reported expenditures were more specific to abandoned  hardrock mines than the information OSMRE provided for those  states. As a result, we used Alaska\u2019s and Colorado\u2019s information to  report expenditures for those states and used OSMRE\u2019s information  to report expenditures for all other states. OSMRE officials agreed  with this approach.", "EPA. EPA provided information about the Superfund program\u2019s  expenditures at mine and mineral processing sites from the Integrated  Financial Management System for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 and  the Compass Financial System for fiscal years 2012 through 2017.  EPA provided expenditures from its (1) Superfund appropriation  accounts, (2) special accounts through which EPA receives resources  from settlements with responsible parties for EPA to conduct site- specific work, and (3) state cost-share accounts, through which states  contribute 10 percent of costs for EPA\u2019s Superfund-financed remedial  actions. EPA also reported expenditures of funds provided by other  federal agencies; we excluded these expenditures from our reporting  of EPA\u2019s spending to avoid potential double counting.", "Further, we obtained information through our semi-structured interviews  with officials from the 13 selected states about their expenditures of  nonfederal and federal funds at abandoned hardrock mines for state fiscal  years 2008 through 2017. We obtained and summarized information on  total expenditures to address abandoned hardrock mines, expenditures to  address physical safety hazards, and expenditures to address  environmental degradation. We also obtained information about the  sources of the agencies\u2019 funding, such as collections from responsible  parties. The states provided expenditure information by state fiscal year  and not federal fiscal year because their financial systems are organized  by state fiscal year.", "We assessed the reliability of the states\u2019 expenditure information by  testing for missing data and errors, reviewing documents, and discussing  the information and any limitations with state agency officials. Three  states were unable to provide expenditure information specific to  abandoned hardrock mines for the entire 10-year period. Therefore, we  discussed and agreed with each of these states how they could provide  information that most closely responded to our request\u2014for example, by  providing information for the years that were available\u2014and we are  reporting the state agencies\u2019 total expenditures as estimates. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to describe an estimate  of how much in nonfederal and federal funds the state agencies spent to  address abandoned hardrock mines.", "We are reporting both federal and state agency expenditures in nominal  dollars. We are doing so for several reasons, including that there was a  relatively low rate of inflation from fiscal year 2008 through 2017 (about  1.5 percent per year, on average); not all states reported annual  expenditures that could be adjusted for inflation; and federal and state  agencies reported annual expenditures differently, with federal agencies  reporting by federal fiscal year and state agencies reporting by state fiscal  year.", "To describe what is known about future costs to address abandoned  hardrock mines, we reviewed and summarized documentation of the  federal agencies\u2019 most recently available estimates of costs to inventory  additional abandoned hardrock mine features and to address physical  safety and environmental hazards that have not been addressed. We  discussed these estimates, and the assumptions used to create the  estimates, with relevant agency officials. We describe the estimates and  their underlying assumptions in the report.", "To identify factors that limit federal and state agencies\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019  efforts to address abandoned hardrock mines, we reviewed relevant  agency documents and independent reports that describe limiting factors.  We interviewed federal agency officials, state agency officials, and  stakeholders. More specifically, we interviewed Forest Service, BLM,  Park Service, EPA, OSMRE, and Interior headquarters officials and  officials from these agencies\u2019 regional or state-based offices who work in  Colorado, Montana, and Nevada. We also interviewed officials with the  relevant state agencies that address abandoned hardrock mines in these  three states. We selected these states for geographic diversity, higher  numbers of abandoned hardrock mines, and variation in the types of  hazards posed by abandoned hardrock mines in these states. The  sample of states is not generalizable, and the results of our work do not  apply to all states where abandoned hardrock mines are located, but  provide illustrative examples.", "In addition, we obtained perspectives from stakeholders that have  participated in or expressed interest in participating in projects to address  abandoned hardrock mines. We interviewed a sample of stakeholders,  selected to provide perspectives from industry associations,  nongovernmental organizations, state agency associations, and  individuals with long-standing involvement in issues related to addressing  abandoned hardrock mines. We identified and selected these  stakeholders based on our previous work, including the stakeholders we  interviewed for our March 2008 report; a review of relevant literature,  including written testimony statements and a summary of proceedings  from a 2018 conference on abandoned hardrock mines; interviews with  federal and state agency officials; and recommendations from  stakeholders. Our sample of stakeholders is not generalizable to all  stakeholders involved with abandoned hardrock mines, but provides  perspectives on factors that limit efforts to address abandoned hardrock  mines.", "In total, we obtained responses from officials with 13 federal agency  offices, including six headquarters offices and seven regional or state- based offices; officials with three states; and representatives of  11 stakeholder organizations, including three state associations that  represent states with abandoned mine programs, two nonprofit  conservation organizations, two mining industry associations, one mining  company, and three individuals with long-standing involvement in  abandoned hardrock mine policy. In our discussions, officials and  representatives with each entity identified the factors that limit their or  others\u2019 efforts to address abandoned hardrock mines. We reviewed the  responses and identified the factors that officials and stakeholders in  each group (i.e., federal agencies, state agencies, and stakeholders)  frequently mentioned. Two factors arose frequently both within and  across the groups\u2014we describe these factors in our report.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2018 to March 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based  on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Federal Expenditures to Address Abandoned Hardrock Mines, by State, Fiscal Years 2008 through 2017", "paragraphs": ["Table 4 includes expenditures to address abandoned hardrock mines for  the Bureau of Land Management, Environmental Protection Agency,  Forest Service, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement,  and National Park Service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Elizabeth Erdmann (Assistant  Director), Leslie Kaas Pollock (Analyst-in-Charge), Matthew Elmer,  William Gerard, Anne Rhodes-Kline, Sheryl Stein, Sara Sullivan, and  Rajneesh Verma made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["Until the 1970s, mine operators could mine for valuable hardrock minerals\u2014i.e., gold or copper\u2014then abandon the land.

Hundreds of thousands more likely exist.", "Remedies include sealing tunnels and treating contaminated water to address safety and environmental hazards. But this can come with a hefty price tag.", "Most federal and state officials said they had trouble identifying and eliminating hazards at abandoned mines because doing so would cost millions and create potential liability issues."]}
