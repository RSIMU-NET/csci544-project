Many beneficiaries were attracted to managed care plans because they typically offered services not covered under Medicare's traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program\u2014such as routine physical examinations and outpatient prescription drugs\u2014and because members generally paid less out of pocket than they would in FFS. However, many areas of the country were not served by these plans. About 30 percent of the nation's 39 million Medicare beneficiaries\u2014particularly those living in rural areas\u2014had no alternative to the FFS program. A second problem was that Medicare was not realizing the expected savings from managed care. A number of studies by GAO, other government agencies, and researchers had concluded that plan payments were not adequately adjusted to reflect the fact that plans tended to attract beneficiaries with lower-than-average health costs.", "In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), the Congress sought to address some of these concerns by creating the Medicare+Choice program. To expand Medicare beneficiaries' health plan options, the BBA included payment and other changes to encourage the wider availability of health maintenance organizations and permitted other types of health plans, such as preferred provider organizations, to participate. Medicare+Choice was also expected to improve Medicare's financial posture by better controlling spending. Accordingly, the BBA contained provisions to temporarily slow the growth of plan payment rates relative to FFS spending and required that future payments better reflect the expected health care utilization of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in plans.", "Following the implementation of Medicare+Choice, nearly 100 plans either terminated their contracts and fully withdrew from the program or partially withdrew by reducing the geographic areas they served for the 1999 contract year. We previously reported that these plans tended to be recent market entrants, had low enrollment, or faced competition from larger plans, and that the withdrawals may have largely resulted from competitive market forces.Since then, more plans have either withdrawn for the 2000 contract year or announced that they will withdraw for the 2001 contract year. Because of your continuing interest in the Medicare+Choice program, you asked us to (1) determine the geographic distribution and the distribution among plans of enrollees affected by the recent plan withdrawals, (2) identify the factors associated with plans that terminated or reduced their participation in the program, and (3) examine the likely role of payment rates in affecting plans' decisions. (Requesters are listed at the end of this letter.) To answer these questions, we analyzed enrollment and plan participation data from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and synthesized findings from our previous reports. Appendix I presents the details of our methodology. Our work was done from August 1999 to September 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As of July 2000, about 6.2 million people\u2014or approximately 16 percent of Medicare's 39 million beneficiaries\u2014were enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans. These plans receive a fixed monthly payment for each beneficiary, regardless of what an individual enrollee's care actually costs. Higher costs reduce a plan's profits or result in losses, while lower costs can enable it to offer additional benefits that help it to retain existing enrollees and attract new enrollees. Because managed care plans have a financial incentive to provide care efficiently, policymakers have long looked to them to curb unnecessary spending and produce savings for Medicare. Among BBA's major reforms to contain Medicare spending was the creation of Medicare+Choice, which was also designed to increase the plan options available to Medicare beneficiaries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare Managed Care Before the BBA", "paragraphs": ["Before the BBA, numerous studies by us, the Physician Payment Review Commission\u2014which has been incorporated into the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission\u2014HCFA, and others demonstrated that the Medicare program spent hundreds of millions more on beneficiaries enrolled in health plans than it would have spent if the same individuals had remained in traditional FFS Medicare.This occurred because Medicare payments were based on the estimated cost of FFS beneficiaries with average health and were not adequately adjusted to reflect the fact that plans tended to enroll beneficiaries in better-than-average health who had lower health care costs\u2014a phenomenon known as favorable selection.", "Before 1998, base payment rates to plans in each county were set at 95 percent of the estimated FFS cost of the average beneficiary. The wide variation in local FFS expenditures, caused by local differences in both the prices of medical services and in beneficiaries' use of services, led to corresponding variation in these base rates. This variation may have accounted for some of the unevenness in plan availability across the country. Other factors, such as the higher concentration of Medicare beneficiaries, may have prompted plans to serve primarily urban areas. Beneficiaries in most rural areas lacked access to plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BBA Changes to Medicare Managed Care", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 1998, the BBA substantially changed the method used to set plan payment rates. The new method involves paying the highest of three alternative rates: a minimum amount, or \u201cfloor\u201d; a minimum increase over the previous year's payment rate; or a blend of historical FFS spending in a county and national average costs adjusted for local price levels. Some of the new payment provisions were designed to reduce excess payments, while others were designed for different purposes\u2014such as increasing plan participation in geographic areas that had low payment rates.", "The BBA aims to reduce the excess in Medicare's health plan payments primarily by holding down per capita payment increases for 5 years and by mandating a new health-based risk adjustment system. In January 2000, HCFA implemented a method for adjusting plan payments based on beneficiary health status, as required by the BBA. The new method, to be phased in over time, will pay plans more for serving Medicare beneficiaries with serious health problems and less for serving relatively healthy ones.", "The BBA also contains provisions to gradually remove graduate medical education (GME) payments from plan payments and provide for teaching hospitals to receive these payments directly from Medicare.Because GME spending is concentrated in high-payment-rate counties, its removal is expected to slow payment rate growth more in those areas.", "Another BBA objective is to reduce the geographic disparity in payment rates. A methodological approach known as \u201cblending\u201d will, over time, move all rates closer to the national average by providing for larger payment increases in low-rate counties and smaller payment increases in high-rate counties. In addition, the BBA established a minimum payment rate, known as a \u201cfloor,\u201d to encourage plans to offer services in areas that historically had low payment rates and few participating plans\u2014primarily rural counties. The BBA also eliminated the requirement that no more than 50 percent of a plan's enrollment may consist of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. This means that Medicare plans can now serve areas without first building a commercial base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare+Choice Plan Participation in 1999", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, 45 of the 346 plans that participated in 1998 terminated their Medicare contracts and 54 others reduced the number of counties they served. These withdrawal decisions affected about 407,000 enrollees (7 percent of the managed care population) who had to choose a new plan (if one was available in their county) or switch to FFS. About 61,000 of these enrollees, or 1 percent of the total Medicare managed care population, lived in counties in which no other plan was offered. Even if another plan was available, the approximately 450 beneficiaries affected by the withdrawals who had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) had to return to FFS.Medicare prohibits beneficiaries with ESRD from joining a health plan, although they may stay in one if they develop the disease while enrolled.", "Plan withdrawals can be disruptive and costly for affected beneficiaries. Although many affected beneficiaries can enroll in another plan, this option may require them to switch health care providers and accept different benefit coverage. Those who return to FFS may be able to retain their providers, but typically face out-of-pocket costs that are higher than they incurred as managed care enrollees. For example, most plan enrollees receive some coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, a benefit not offered in the FFS program. Although the BBA guarantees beneficiaries affected by plan withdrawals the right to purchase certain supplemental insurance policies (known as Medigap), none of the guaranteed policies cover prescription drugs.", "Officials from organizations representing plans reported that the BBA changes to the payment rates and the increased administrative burden of the new regulations were largely responsible for the plan withdrawals. According to the officials, Medicare payment rate increases did not keep pace with plans' costs or medical inflation.", "Our analysis indicated that a combination of market factors may have influenced plans' participation decisions. Plans more frequently withdrew from counties they had entered more recently, where they had attracted fewer enrollees, or where they faced larger competitors. Some plans indicated that they withdrew from areas where they were unsuccessful in establishing sufficient provider networks. The effect of Medicare's payment rates on withdrawals was much less obvious. For example, about 90 percent of high-payment-rate counties experienced a plan withdrawal compared with only 34 percent of low-payment counties. Taken as a whole, these findings suggested that a portion of the withdrawals may have been the result of plans that were less able to compete effectively in certain areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Post-BBA Legislative Changes", "paragraphs": ["In November 1999, the Congress passed the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA). The BBRA contains provisions designed to encourage plan participation in Medicare+Choice. Among other changes, the BBRA provides a new entry bonus to plans that begin serving currently unserved areas. It also increases plans' flexibility to vary benefits within a geographic area and reduces some administrative requirements. In addition, the act slows the phase-in of the new risk adjustment methodology, reducing the short-term effect of the new methodology on plan payments. The BBRA also reduces the length of time that a plan has to wait to reenter the program after terminating its Medicare contract.

Combined, these plan withdrawals directly affect about 1.3 million Medicare+Choice enrollees. The 2001 withdrawals affect a much larger percentage of enrollees, approximately 15 percent, compared with the 2000 withdrawals that affected about 5 percent of all enrollees. All affected enrollees have to choose a new plan (if a plan accepting new enrollees is available in their county) or switch to FFS. By 2001, almost 75 percent of the counties that had a Medicare+Choice plan in 1999 will have been affected.About 238,000, or approximately 19 percent, of the affected enrollees live in counties in which no other managed care plan is being offered. Some of these beneficiaries may have the option of enrolling in a new private FFS plan, but the remainder will have no alternative to the traditional FFS program. The 1,940 beneficiaries in withdrawing plans who have ESRD must return to FFS.", "Plan withdrawals in both years disproportionately affect beneficiaries living in small urban, fringe, and rural counties.In 2000, approximately 65 percent of the 328,000 beneficiaries affected by the withdrawals lived in one of these types of counties even though these areas accounted for less than 33 percent of Medicare's managed care enrollees. (See fig. 1.) In contrast, the effects of the 2001 withdrawals will be more widespread and more representative of the distribution of Medicare+Choice enrollees. In both years, beneficiaries living in less densely populated areas were also likelier to be left only with the FFS alternative compared to affected beneficiaries in major urban areas.

Since the initial offering, Sterling has added 8 more states to its service area.(See fig. 2.)

This year, HCFA implemented a new methodology to adjust payments for beneficiary health status. However, our results suggest that this new methodology, which will be phased in over several years, may ultimately remove less than half of the excess payments caused by favorable selection.HCFA expects to introduce a more refined methodology in 2004 that may better adjust payments to reflect enrollees' expected health care costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Payment Rates Exceed Plans' Costs of Providing Medicare-Covered Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Medicare+Choice payment rates not only surpass what the FFS program would spend to provide Medicare-covered benefits to plans' enrollees, but data submitted by plans show that rates also generally exceed plans' estimated costs to provide those same benefits. As part of the annual contracting process, each Medicare+Choice plan is required to project its per enrollee cost of providing Medicare-covered benefits.If estimated Medicare payments exceed a plan's projected costs, the plan must use the difference to provide additional benefits during the contract year or contribute to an escrow account and use the funds to provide benefits in future years. To fulfill Medicare's requirement, plans choose to provide additional benefits\u2014such as routine vision care, dental care, and coverage for outpatient prescription drugs\u2014that are not covered in the traditional FFS program.", "In their 1999 contract submissions, the average plan\u2014including plans that withdrew in 2000\u2014projected that its costs would be substantially less than its Medicare payment. On average, plans estimated that they could provide Medicare-covered services for about 89 percent of Medicare's payment.Plans indicated that they would provide additional benefits to make up the difference. Most plans' benefit packages exceeded the minimum requirements. Consequently, the average plan in 1999 estimated it would spend about $1,300 per enrollee, an amount equal to about 22.5 percent of its Medicare payment, on benefits that are not covered in the FFS program. Among plans that terminated their contracts or reduced their service areas in 2000, the average annual amount spent on additional benefits was slightly lower\u2014about $1,100, or 21.6 percent of Medicare's payment. (See table 5.)", "Plans' contract submissions for 2000 exhibited a similar pattern of additional benefits.Plans that will terminate their contracts in 2001 projected that they would spend an average of about $1,200 per enrollee, or 22 percent of their Medicare payment, on additional benefits in 2000. Plans that will reduce their service areas projected they would spend slightly less, about $1,000 or 18 percent of their Medicare payment, on additional benefits. In contrast, spending on additional benefits was estimated at nearly $1,500 per enrollee, or about 25 percent of 2000 Medicare payments, for plans that will remain in the program in 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between Payment Rates and Plan Withdrawals Difficult to Interpret", "paragraphs": ["The effect of payment rates on Medicare+Choice plan participation is ambiguous. While changes in payment rates are an important influence on plans' participation decisions, we found that plan withdrawals were not limited to counties with low payment rates.", "On the one hand, plan withdrawals appear to be more extensive in the 2 years with lower payment rate increases. In both 1999 and 2001, county rates increased by an average of 2 percent. In 1999, plan withdrawals affected 42 percent of counties that previously had a managed care plan, and in 2001 plan withdrawals will affect 58 percent of such counties. In contrast, a smaller proportion of counties\u2014approximately 37 percent\u2014 were affected in 2000 when rates increased by about 4 percent. The extensiveness of plan withdrawals may also be related to the gap between average county rate increases and the change in expected per capita FFS spending. For example, the projected increase in per capita FFS spending is much higher for 2001 than it was for 1999 and withdrawals will be more extensive.Therefore, withdrawals may moderate after 2002 when payment rate increases will mirror expected increases in per capita FFS spending except for adjustments to correct prior spending forecast errors.", "The relationship across counties between plan participation and payment rates, and rate increases, is not clear. Both high-payment rate and low- payment rate counties are affected by the 2000 and 2001 plan withdrawals, although the relationship between payment rates and withdrawals is somewhat different in the two years. In 2000, approximately 39 percent of the non-floor counties that had at least one plan in 1999\u2014those with payment rates set above the minimum payment of $402\u2014were affected by a plan withdrawal. A slightly higher proportion of counties in the middle payment categories were affected compared to the proportion of affected counties in the highest rate category and the rate category just above the floor. (See table 6.) In 2001, about 80 to 90 percent of counties in the higher payment ranges, but less than two-thirds of the counties in the lower payment ranges will be affected. (See table 7.) The 2001 withdrawal pattern is similar to the one that occurred in 1999 in that a disproportionate number of high payment rate counties were affected by withdrawals. In both 2000 and 2001, floor counties that previously had a Medicare+Choice plan will be proportionately less affected by the withdrawals compared to counties that receive payment rates above the floor. However, the difference between floor and nonfloor counties is less pronounced in the 2001 withdrawals.", "The relationship between payment rate increases and plan participation in a particular county is unclear. In 2000 and 2001 floor counties may have been less affected by the withdrawals because the BBA substantially increased payment rates in those counties, and those rates remain considerably above the average cost of Medicare benefits in the traditional FFS program. Between 1997 and 2001, payment rates in floor counties increased by 27 percent. In contrast, payment rate increases have been more modest in nonfloor counties, around 11 percent.However, the pattern of plan withdrawals in 2000 suggests that even relatively large payment rate increases may not be enough to keep some plans in certain counties. While county payment rates increased by an average of 4 percent in 2000, the BBA's rate \u201cblending\u201d provision increased rates by 10 percent or more in certain counties.Nonetheless, 40 percent of these counties with large increases were affected by plan withdrawals in 2000\u2014about the same as the percentage of affected counties among those that received the lowest (2 percent) rate increase.(See table 8.) Some areas may have too few beneficiaries or providers to support multiple plans, or even a single plan. Moreover, plans that fail to attract a sufficient number of enrollees will not realize their revenue goals even if payments are adequate on a per capita basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Medicare+Choice is at a crossroads. Because of contract terminations and service area reductions, by January 2001 more than 1.6 million beneficiaries will have had to switch to a different plan or the traditional fee-for-service program since 1999. Industry representatives contend that payment rate increases are necessary to keep the program viable.", "However, the Medicare+Choice program has already been expensive for taxpayers. As our work on payment rates shows, the vast majority of plans have gotten paid more for their Medicare enrollees than the government would have paid had these enrollees remained in the traditional fee-for- service program. Raising payment rates to a level sufficient to retain the plans leaving Medicare would mean increasing the excess that currently exists in payments for plan enrollees relative to their expected fee-for- service costs. In areas of the country where there are few beneficiaries and providers are in short supply, no reasonable payment rate increase is likely to entice plans to participate in Medicare. Thus, a trade-off exists between the significant additional costs that would be needed to keep more plans in the program and the benefits of providing more beneficiaries with options for accessing Medicare covered services. Such a trade-off raises questions about the equity of providing a greater array of benefits to a fraction of the Medicare beneficiary population. In our view, efforts to protect the viability of Medicare+Choice plans come at the expense of ensuring Medicare's financial sustainability over the long term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on our report, HCFA stated that our findings confirmed its own analysis of Medicare+Choice plan withdrawals. HCFA noted that the pattern of withdrawals, analyzed at the corporation level instead of at the individual plan level, reinforces our finding that factors besides payment rates likely influenced plans' participation decisions. For example, HCFA said that in 2001, 54 percent of Aetna's Medicare+Choice enrollees and 69 percent of Cigna's enrollees will be affected by plan withdrawals, but less than 2 percent of Pacificare's enrollees and only 0.1 percent of Kaiser's enrollees will be affected. The agency contends that these differences provide evidence that the withdrawals reflect corporations' strategic business decisions that go beyond Medicare payment adequacy. HCFA also said that it believes the Administration's proposal to provide a prescription drug benefit to all enrollees would both reduce inequities in benefit availability and increase payments to Medicare+Choice plans that cover prescription drugs. (HCFA's comments appear in app. IV.)", "We also provided representatives of the American Association of Health Plans (AAHP), the BlueCross BlueShield Association (BCBSA), and the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) an opportunity to comment on the report. All three groups disagreed with our conclusions and stated that our report did not touch on important issues relevant to plan withdrawals. They also said that withdrawals can be costly for beneficiaries because Medicare+Choice plans typically provide preventive care services and other benefits that are not covered in the traditional FFS program. (AAHP's, BCBSA's, and HIAA's comments appear in apps. V, VI, and VII.)", "AAHP, BCBSA, and HIAA believe that inadequate Medicare+Choice payment rates are a principal cause of plan withdrawals. BCBSA stated that many plans could not afford to continue providing sufficient additional benefits (beyond those covered in FFS) to attract beneficiaries. All three industry groups stated that it is inappropriate to compare Medicare+Choice payment rate increases with changes in per capita FFS spending (as we did in fig. 6) because plans' costs have been growing faster than per capita FFS spending. HIAA said that FFS spending slowed only as a result of BBA's unprecedented reductions in Medicare reimbursements and that the Congress began correcting these reductions with the enactment of BBRA in 1999. BCBSA commented that the comparison is unfair because the traditional program can control costs in ways that are unavailable to plans. In our report, we acknowledge that plans typically provide benefits that are not available in the FFS program. However, we found that Medicare+Choice payments substantially exceeded plans' projected costs (including normal profits) of providing Medicare-covered benefits and that plans contracted with Medicare to use the difference to provide benefits that are not available in the FFS program. Furthermore, the contention that plans' costs have grown more rapidly than per capita FFS spending, or that plans have a limited ability to control their own cost increases, does not alter our finding that Medicare+Choice payments exceed the estimated amount that the traditional program would spend on the individuals enrolled in plans.", "AAHP and HIAA stated that our methodology for estimating the FFS costs of plan enrollees, based on enrollees' prior use of services in the FFS program, underestimates the health care costs of plan enrollees and therefore overestimates excess payments to plans. In developing our methodology, however, we employed assumptions that would tend to underestimate excess payments.Therefore, we believe our findings likely represent a lower bound on the estimated excess payments plans receive and the potential savings from improved risk adjustment. HIAA stated that services are overutilized in the FFS program and that by using FFS spending as a comparison we overestimated the degree of favorable selection and the extent of excess payments to plans. In our analysis, we did not attempt to quantify an appropriate level of care. If services are overutilized in the FFS program, a comparison of plan payments with a more efficient delivery system might indicate less favorable selection, but it would not alter our finding that current Medicare+Choice payment rates\u2014 largely based on FFS spending patterns\u2014exceed the estimated cost of providing Medicare-covered benefits in the FFS program.", "AAHP, BCBSA, and HIAA said that we did not address the issue of regulatory burden in our report. They believe that recent regulations have increased plans' administrative costs and discouraged plan participation. Because many of the recent regulations resulted from provisions in BBA designed to increase plan accountability, facilitate informed choice and plan comparisons, protect beneficiary rights, or foster quality improvement efforts, a comprehensive analysis of this issue would require an assessment of the regulations' benefits as well as their costs. Such an analysis was beyond the scope of our report.", "Finally, AAHP and BCBSA stressed that plans typically provide benefits not covered in the traditional FFS program and that plan withdrawals are not only disruptive for beneficiaries but can also result in beneficiaries having to pay more in out-of-pocket costs. Although we agree, and did discuss this issue in the report, it was not the focus of our study.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, and other interested parties who request them.", "If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please call me on (202) 512-7114 or Laura A.

To do our analysis, we obtained data files from HCFA, which the agency uses to compute Medicare+Choice plan payments and which are widely used by researchers.", "To identify counties with a plan in 1999, we used HCFA's 1999 Medicare Compare Database combined with HCFA's July 1999 Medicare Managed Care Market Penetration for All Medicare Plan Contractors Quarterly State/County/Plan Data Files.

In July 2000, HCFA provided us with the same information for plans that had announced changes for 2001.", "We excluded Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands from all county- level analyses. In some of the analyses, the same counties are defined as separate entities if plans can contract with them separately. For example, Los Angeles County, California, is divided into Los Angeles-1 and Los Angeles-2; they are counted separately because plans may contract with them separately. The independent cities of Virginia are also counted as separate counties because their payment rates differ from those of their counties, and plans contract to serve these areas as if they were independent counties.", "We classified counties as urban, rural, or small urban/fringe using the rural/urban continuum codes in the February 1999 Area Resource File, which we obtained from the Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services. We defined urban counties as the central counties of metropolitan areas of 1 million population or more and rural counties as all nonmetropolitan counties. Finally, included in the small urban/fringe counties are counties in metropolitan areas of less than 1 million population and fringe counties of metropolitan areas of 1 million population or more. The February 1999 Area Resource File combines the Virginia independent cities into their original counties and does not report separate rural/urban continuum codes for these.
