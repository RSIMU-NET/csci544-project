GAO reviewed documents and interviewed federal officials, and interviewed hospital and nursing home administrators and state and local officials in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi and Hurricane Charley in Florida."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Hospital and nursing home administrators faced several challenges related to evacuations during recent hurricanes, including deciding whether to evacuate or stay in their facilities and \"shelter in place\", obtaining transportation necessary for evacuations, and maintaining communication outside of their facilities. Administrators took steps to ensure that their facilities had needed resources--including staff, supplies, food, water, and power--to provide care during the hurricane and maintain self-sufficiency immediately after. However, when evacuations were needed, facility administrators said that they had problems with transportation, such as securing the vehicles needed to evacuate patients. Although facility administrators had contracts with transportation companies, competition for the same pool of vehicles created supply shortages when multiple facilities in a community had to be evacuated. In addition, communication was impaired by hurricane damage. For example, a nursing home in Florida was unable to communicate with local emergency managers. NDMS is a partnership of four federal agencies, and has two limitations in its design that constrain its assistance to state and local governments with patient evacuation. The NDMS partners are the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Veterans Affairs; DHS is the lead agency. The first limitation is that NDMS evacuation efforts begin at a mobilization center, such as an airport, and do not include short-distance transportation assets, such as ambulances or helicopters, to move patients out of health care facilities to mobilization centers. The second limitation is that NDMS supports the evacuation of patients needing hospital care; the program was not designed nor is it currently configured to move people who do not require hospitalization, such as nursing home residents. Although NDMS moved nursing home residents due to Hurricane Katrina who were brought to mobilization centers, NDMS officials had to make special arrangements for people in need of nursing home care because NDMS lacked preexisting agreements with nursing homes. Neither of these limitations is addressed in other documents GAO reviewed, including DHS's National Response Plan (NRP). At the federal level, HHS's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has requirements related to hospital and nursing home evacuation planning as a condition of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. CMS requires that hospitals maintain the overall hospital environment to assure patient safety, including developing plans that consider the transfer of patients to other health care settings. For nursing homes, CMS requires that plans meet all potential emergencies and disasters; however, requirements do not specifically mention the transfer of residents. In addition to assessing compliance with CMS requirements, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the American Osteopathic Association, and states can also have additional emergency management requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck near the Louisiana- Mississippi border and became one of the worst natural disasters in U.S.  history. Hurricane Katrina affected a large geographic area and  necessitated the evacuation of parts of the area. Among those needing to  be evacuated were people in health care facilities such as hospitals and  nursing homes. During disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, administrators  of hospitals or nursing homes must make decisions about the best way to  care for their patients or residents under such circumstances, including  whether to evacuate if the facility becomes unable to support adequate  care, treatment, or other services. Moreover, if administrators decide to  evacuate, hospital patients or nursing home residents may need special  equipment or have other complicating factors which inhibit their  movement, thereby increasing the risk to their safety during the  evacuation process. Due to Hurricane Katrina, efforts were made to  evacuate hospital patients and nursing home residents. In the storm\u2019s  aftermath, congressional reports raised questions about how health care  facility administrators plan for hurricanes, how they implement their  plans, and how the federal government assists health care facilities and  state and local governments with facility evacuations.", "Federal, state, and local governments, as well as individual health care  facilities, have plans for how they will respond to emergencies such as  hurricanes. At the federal level, the National Response Plan (NRP)  provides a framework for how the federal government is to assist states  and localities in managing domestic incidents, including both incidents of  national significance and those of lesser severity. A program identified in  the NRP, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), can assist state  and local governments with evacuations of patients who need hospital  care. NDMS is a partnership of four federal agencies, and the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) is the lead agency. At the state and local  levels, governments often have comprehensive emergency management  plans that mirror the NRP. At the individual facility level, hospitals and  nursing homes that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs  must comply with requirements established by the Department of Health  and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS). Compliance with these requirements is assessed by accrediting  organizations such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of  Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the American Osteopathic  Association (AOA), and state agencies.", "Due to broad-based congressional interest, we assessed the evacuation of  hospital patients and nursing home residents due to hurricanes. We  performed this work under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to conduct  evaluations on his own initiative. In February 2006, we reported on  preliminary observations from our work, and in May 2006, we testified on  our preliminary observations before the Senate Special Committee on  Aging. To complete our assessment, we examined (1) the challenges  hospital and nursing home administrators faced related to recent  hurricanes, (2) the extent to which limitations exist in the design of NDMS  or other federal programs to assist state and local governments with  patient evacuations, and (3) the federal requirements for hospital and  nursing home disaster and evacuation planning.", "For our first objective related to the challenges hospital and nursing home  administrators faced related to recent hurricanes, we reviewed  documents, including emergency management plans from state and local  governments and hospitals and nursing homes in Florida and Mississippi.  We interviewed officials in Mississippi who experienced Hurricane  Katrina, including officials from five hospitals, three nursing homes and  assisted living facilities, state officials, and local emergency management  officials in two counties. We also interviewed officials in Florida in areas  that experienced hurricanes in 2004, particularly those affected by  Hurricane Charley, which was the strongest hurricane to hit the United  States since Andrew hit southern Florida in 1992. In Florida, we spoke  with officials from three hospitals and three nursing homes, state officials,  and local emergency management officials in two counties. We also  interviewed officials from national hospital and nursing home  associations, Florida hospital and nursing home associations, and a  Mississippi nursing home association. For our second objective  concerning the extent to which limitations exist in the ability of NDMS or  other federal programs to assist state and local governments with patient  evacuations, we reviewed federal documents such as the NRP, including  the September 2005 draft Catastrophic Incident Supplement to the NRP.  We also interviewed officials from the Department of Defense (DOD),  HHS, DHS, the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA), including officials who are responsible for NDMS,  asking about moving patients out of facilities and out of the affected areas.  For our third objective on federal requirements for hospital and nursing  home disaster and evacuation planning, we reviewed CMS documents  describing hospital and nursing home emergency planning requirements  that specifically relate to evacuations. We also interviewed officials from  CMS, JCAHO, and AOA concerning these requirements, as well as officials  from national hospital and nursing home associations, Florida hospital and  nursing home associations, and a Mississippi nursing home association. In  addition, we interviewed officials and obtained documents from the  Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration and Mississippi Department  of Health concerning state hospital and nursing home requirements for  evacuation.

By definition, a catastrophic  incident almost immediately exceeds resources normally available to  state, local, tribal, and private-sector authorities in the impacted area. A  separate Catastrophic Incident Supplement, which was drafted but had  not been approved at the time of Hurricane Katrina, provides additional  detail on the roles and responsibilities of federal, state, and local  responders during catastrophic incidents. However, as of June 2006, the  supplement had not been finalized.", "Among its many components, the NRP establishes 15 emergency support  functions (ESF), which identify resources and define the missions and  responsibilities of various federal agencies in helping coordinate support  during incidents of national significance. For each of the NRP\u2019s 15 ESFs,  which include Transportation, Communications, Firefighting, and Public  Health and Medical Services, the NRP designates a federal agency as the  ESF coordinator responsible for pre-incident planning and coordination. It  also designates one or more primary agencies to be responsible for  operational priorities and activities, coordinating with other agencies and  state partners, and planning for incident management.

It is a nationwide medical response system to  supplement state and local medical resources during disasters and  emergencies and to provide back-up medical support to the military and  VA health care systems during an overseas conventional conflict. DOD,  HHS, DHS, and VA are federal partners in NDMS. These partners most  recently signed a memorandum of agreement in October 2005 that  describes the roles and responsibilities of each partner. DHS has the  authority to activate NDMS in response to public health emergencies,  which include, but are not limited to, presidentially declared emergencies  or major disasters under the Stafford Act.", "NDMS consists of three key functions:    medical response, which includes medical equipment and supplies, patient  triage, and other emergency health care services provided to disaster  victims at a disaster site through NDMS medical response teams such as  Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT);    patient evacuation, which includes communication and transportation to  evacuate patients from a mobilization center near the disaster site, such as  an airport, to reception facilities in other locations; and  \u201cdefinitive care,\u201d which is additional medical care\u2014beyond emergency  care\u2014that begins once disaster victims are placed into an NDMS inpatient  treatment facility (typically a nonfederal hospital that has signed an  agreement with NDMS).", "DHS has lead responsibility for the medical response function of NDMS.  DOD takes the lead in coordinating patient evacuation for NDMS, in  collaboration with DOT, the other NDMS federal partners, and commercial  transportation companies.

NDMS officials told us that  Hurricane Katrina was the first time that the patient evacuation and  definitive care components of NDMS were used for a large number of  patients. In response to state requests for assistance, NDMS moved people  from Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina and from Texas before Hurricane  Rita.

The House of Representatives Select  Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to  Hurricane Katrina reported that medical care and evacuations suffered  from a lack of advance preparations, inadequate communications, and  difficulties in coordinating efforts. The select committee\u2019s report and a  DHS Office of Inspector General Performance Review of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) both noted that search and  rescue efforts during Hurricane Katrina were effective but could have  benefited from improved coordination among federal agencies. The  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  reported that federal agencies involved in providing medical assistance did  not have adequate resources or the right medical capabilities to fully meet  the medical needs arising from Katrina, such as meeting the needs of large  evacuee populations, and were forced to use improvised and unproven  techniques to meet those needs.

Administrators told us that they evacuate only as a last resort and that  facilities\u2019 emergency plans are designed primarily to shelter in place. Some  hospitals provided a safe haven for devastated communities after a  hurricane. In addition, some hospitals saw a surge in the number of people  seeking care as a result of injuries sustained during the hurricane. For  example, clinicians at a 153-bed hospital in Mississippi treated  approximately 500 patients per day in the days after Hurricane Katrina, a  substantial increase from their normal workload of about 130 patients per  day. This hospital\u2019s administrators told us that they felt obligated to  remain open to serve the community\u2019s needs. In addition, facility  administrators and county representatives that we interviewed agreed that  sheltering in place is generally safer than evacuating vulnerable hospital  patients and nursing home residents. Although state and local  governments can issue mandatory evacuation orders for certain areas,  health care facilities may be exempt from these orders, as they were in a  Mississippi county for Hurricane Katrina. When preparing to shelter in  place, hospital administrators told us that they discharge patients when  possible and stop performing elective surgeries to reduce the number of  patients in the hospital.", "In anticipation of an inability to replenish resources during a hurricane,  hospital and nursing home administrators take steps before hurricanes to  ensure that the facilities have the resources needed to shelter in place and  adequately care for patients and residents, including sufficient supplies,  food, water, and power. For example, a nursing home administrator in  Florida told us that the facility prepared for Hurricane Charley by  obtaining 10 days of food and water for its 120 residents plus additional  Meals, Ready-to-Eat to feed 500 people for up to 4 days, including staff  and their families. Administrators from a hospital told us that they call  their vendors 72 hours before a hurricane to order bulk supplies of milk,  bread, and paper goods. Administrators from a Mississippi hospital noted  that they prepare for hurricanes by ensuring that the facility has 3-4 days  of clean linens and 5-6 days of medical supplies. Administrators must also  make sure they have sufficient backup electrical power because life  support systems require electricity to operate. One hospital administrator  acquired an additional generator to extend the hospital\u2019s capacity to  supply backup power to 10 days. In addition, many of the administrators  we interviewed noted that they maintain large fuel tanks to power the  generators. For example, one hospital maintained a 20,000 gallon tank,  which holds enough fuel to run the facility\u2019s generators for 1 week. Some  administrators told us that they also had difficulty obtaining sufficient fuel  after the hurricanes.", "In addition to obtaining tangible supplies, administrators face the  challenge of ensuring that facilities have the staff needed to provide  adequate patient care during and after a hurricane. Hospital administrators  noted the challenges involved with having sufficient numbers of clinical  staff, such as doctors, available during hurricanes. Some facility  administrators we interviewed identified \u201cstorm teams\u201d of staff that were  required to report to the facility before a hurricane and remain on site  during the event. One hospital required the \u201cstorm team\u201d to be prepared to  stay at the facility for 3-4 days. Staff members were required to bring  clothes, bedding, snacks, and other personal items. In some cases,  facilities also allowed these staff members to bring their families and pets.  One hospital administrator in Mississippi noted that the severity and  destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina prevented the relief staff from  taking over and the \u201cstorm team\u201d remained at the facility for 14 days.  Another hospital administrator in Florida noted that after Hurricane  Charley, relief staff did not report for work.", "Hospital and nursing home administrators we interviewed reported that  their facilities needed to be self-sufficient for a period of time immediately  after a hurricane because new supplies may not arrive for several days.  For example, a representative of a Florida nursing home association said  that facilities need at least 10 days of supplies to effectively shelter in  place until help can arrive. The need to be self-sufficient is especially  important when disasters affect entire communities and delay response  efforts, as demonstrated during hurricanes Charley and Katrina. Facilities  that were part of networks were able to call on their corporate offices or  sister facilities outside of the affected area to replenish needed supplies  after a hurricane. For example, one administrator said that the company  that owns his hospital has a division that tracks each facility\u2019s  preparedness resources, and the company\u2019s supply warehouse has  \u201cdisaster packs\u201d of necessary supplies ready to be deployed in case of  emergency.

While  some people can be moved using buses, some may require wheelchair- accessible vehicles, and others may need to be transported by ambulance.  For example, one nursing home administrator noted that the facility  contracted with a bus company, but stated that transportation remained a  challenge because most of the facility\u2019s residents used electric wheelchairs  and needed vehicles with power lifts, which were not available. In  addition, facilities also needed trucks to move staff and supplies to care  for the patients. For example, one Florida nursing home administrator  noted that the facility had arrangements with a trucking company to load  and transport patient medical records, medications, laundry supplies,  food, and water. Another nursing home administrator in Mississippi said  that he rented a truck to move mattresses and other supplies for his  residents.", "Having a contract with a transportation company or relying on the local  government did not guarantee availability of transportation resources  during a hurricane. Although facility administrators reported having  contracts with transportation companies, competition for the same pool of  vehicles created supply shortages. Hospital and nursing home  administrators in several communities told us that their transportation  companies also had contracts with other facilities in the community to  provide services, a situation that may be sufficient for small evacuations  but did not work when there were multiple facilities from the same area  that needed to evacuate. In addition to contracting with multiple facilities,  some companies\u2019 vehicles were unavailable due to advance notice  requirements, and others may have had vehicles that were badly damaged  by the hurricane. For example, one nursing home administrator said that  the bus company his facility contracted with required 24-hours notice  before a bus could be chartered, and that providing this notice was  difficult in a disaster situation. Some facilities relied upon local  government resources to provide assistance with evacuations, but when  an entire community was severely affected, local ambulances were  damaged or in short supply and therefore unavailable. For example, one  Florida hospital administrator had arranged for transportation through the  local emergency operations center (EOC), but the hurricane destroyed the  EOC. In contrast, when local officials in Mississippi faced a shortage of  ambulances immediately after Hurricane Katrina, they called upon a  national ambulance company, with which they had a contract, to provide  additional resources from Texas and Alabama.

For example, one nursing home administrator who faced  communications difficulties after Hurricane Charley has since purchased  satellite phones. However, during Hurricane Katrina, some Mississippi  hospital administrators told us that their satellite phones did not function.  Because no single communications technology is universally reliable,  some facility administrators told us that they plan to diversify their  communication capabilities by utilizing multiple forms of communication.", "Communication problems also affected county officials. Local EOC  officials in both Mississippi and Florida reported being unable to  communicate with state officials or local health care facilities. Because of  communication problems at the local EOC, one nursing home  administrator in Florida asked a staff member to drive to the EOC to  communicate in person.

NDMS flights evacuated people  with various needs from mobilization centers to NDMS patient reception  areas where officials assessed their health needs and arranged for them to  receive additional medical care through the definitive care portion of  NDMS.

In addition, DHS\u2019s draft Catastrophic  Incident Supplement to the NRP, which is intended to offer guidance for a  situation in which state and local resources are overwhelmed, also would  leave responsibility for moving people out of health care facilities on state  and local authorities. It does not describe the role the federal government  may play in coordinating with state and local authorities during hospital  and nursing home evacuations. In terms of the second limitation, we noted  that the evacuation of nursing home residents was not considered when  NDMS was originally designed in 1984\u2014nor is it currently addressed  elsewhere in the NRP\u2014but the experiences of these recent hurricanes also  showed that the needs of this population when evacuations are required  have been overlooked in the federal plans.", "DHS is the lead agency responsible for issuance and maintenance of the  NRP, development of the draft Catastrophic Incident Supplement, and  activation of NDMS. Until it addresses these limitations\u2014within NDMS,  the NRP, or through other mechanisms\u2014vulnerabilities in the evacuation  of hospitals and nursing homes will continue, and the federal  government\u2019s response will not be as effective as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To address limitations in how the federal government provides assistance  with the evacuation of health care facilities, we recommend that the  Secretary of Homeland Security take the following two actions:    Clearly delineate how the federal government will assist state and local  governments with the movement of patients and residents out of hospitals  and nursing homes to a mobilization center where NDMS transportation  begins.  In consultation with the other NDMS federal partners\u2014the Secretaries of  Defense, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs\u2014clearly  delineate how to address the needs of nursing home residents during  evacuations, including the arrangements necessary to relocate these  residents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from DHS, DOD,  HHS, and VA.", "DHS stated that it will take our recommendations under advisement as it  reviews the National Response Plan. According to DHS, all of the NDMS  federal partners are currently reviewing the NDMS memorandum of  agreement with a view towards working with state and local partners to  alter, delineate, and otherwise clarify roles and responsibilities as  appropriate. DHS confirmed that the primary responsibility for  evacuations remains with state and local governments and that the federal  government becomes involved only when the capabilities of the state and  local governments are overwhelmed. However, as stated in the draft  report, neither NDMS documents, the NRP, nor the draft Catastrophic  Incident Supplement to the NRP\u2014to be used in cases when the  capabilities of state and local governments are almost immediately  overwhelmed\u2014describe the federal role in coordinating with state and  local authorities during hospital and nursing home evacuations. We also  noted that reliance on state and local resources was inadequate when  multiple facilities in a community had to evacuate simultaneously. DHS\u2019s  written comments are reprinted in appendix IV.", "DOD disagreed with our conclusions concerning NDMS\u2019s two limitations.  First, DOD stated that our report implies that the provision of short- distance transportation is a federal responsibility, but DOD maintains that  it is a state and local responsibility. However, during a catastrophic  incident, the capabilities of state and local governments may almost  immediately become overwhelmed. As we stated above in our response to  DHS\u2019s comments, the federal role in these situations has not been  described. Second, DOD stated that our conclusion regarding the needs of  nursing home residents was technically correct, but that we failed to  describe the successful evacuation of nursing home residents during  Hurricane Rita. Our draft report did describe NDMS\u2019s evacuation of  people, including nursing home residents and other people who did not  need hospital care, during recent hurricanes due to the immediate  demands posed by the storms. However, we also noted that the NDMS  after-action report on hurricanes Katrina and Rita states that NDMS was  not optimally prepared to manage the nursing home requirements of  evacuees who did not require hospitalization. For this reason, we believe  that explicit consideration of the needs of nursing home residents is  warranted. DOD\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix V.", "HHS concurred with our recommendations and made two general  comments. First, HHS noted that we should address the role of DOT in the  NRP to provide transportation support for domestic emergencies. Under  ESF #8, DOT can assist with identifying and arranging for all types of  transportation. However, as stated in the draft report, the NRP does not  indicate how DOT or other federal agencies are to assist state and local  authorities in moving hospital patients and nursing home residents from  their facilities. Second, HHS commented that the report does not describe  why NDMS was designed to focus on hospital evacuation, but HHS did not  provide any additional information about NDMS\u2019s origins. Although the  draft report included available information on the origins of NDMS, our  assessment focused on the program\u2019s current status. HHS\u2019s written  comments are reprinted in appendix VI.", "VA agreed with our conclusions and recommendations and stated that it  would continue to address issues raised in the draft report. VA\u2019s written  comments are reprinted in appendix VII.", "DHS and HHS also provided technical comments. In addition, DOT  provided technical comments via email. We incorporated these comments  where appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of DOD, HHS, DHS,  DOT, VA, and other interested parties.

We selected these states based on their  experience with previous disasters. During 2004, the state of Florida was  hit by four hurricanes\u2014Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. Hurricane  Charley was the strongest of these four, and the strongest hurricane to hit  the United States since Hurricane Andrew hit southern Florida in 1992. In  2005, Mississippi received heavy storm damage from Hurricane Katrina  caused by wind and an extremely high storm surge.", "In Florida, to understand the role of the state and local governments in  evacuating hospitals and nursing homes, we interviewed and obtained  documents from state and county officials. At the state level, we  interviewed officials from the Florida Department of Health\u2019s Office of  Emergency Operations. We reviewed the Florida Comprehensive  Emergency Management Plan, as well as Florida\u2019s after-action report for  the 2004 Hurricane season. At the local level, we selected two counties  affected by Hurricane Charley\u2014Charlotte and Volusia counties. Charlotte  County, the entry point for the hurricane, is located on the Gulf Coast of  Florida. Volusia County, the exit point for the hurricane, is located on the  Atlantic Coast of the state. Within each county, we interviewed emergency  management officials and reviewed county emergency management plans.", "To obtain information on the experiences of individual health care  facilities in Florida, we identified hospitals and nursing homes within each  of the selected counties, interviewed facility administrators, and reviewed  documents. To select facilities, we asked emergency management officials  in each county to provide contact information for hospitals and nursing  homes that either evacuated or sheltered in place due to Hurricane  Charley. In cases where the representatives identified by county officials  were unavailable, we selected alternate health care facilities based on  their proximity to the ocean. For each facility, we obtained and reviewed  applicable emergency plans, hurricane plans, and/or evacuation plans. In  total, we interviewed administrators from two hospitals and two nursing  homes in Charlotte County and one hospital and two nursing homes in  Volusia County. In addition to facility administrators, we interviewed  officials from the Florida Hospital Association, the Florida Association of  Homes for the Aging, and the Florida Health Care Association.", "In Mississippi, to understand the role of the state and local governments in  evacuating hospitals and nursing homes, we interviewed and obtained  documents from state and county officials.

At the local  level, we selected the two coastal counties that were hit most directly by  Hurricane Katrina\u2014Hancock and Harrison counties. Hancock County,  which includes the cities of Waveland and Bay St. Louis, was directly in  the path of the storm and sustained extensive damage. Harrison County,  which is adjacent to Hancock County and includes the cities of Gulfport  and Biloxi, sustained extensive damage and has the area\u2019s largest  population. In each county, we interviewed emergency management  officials. We also reviewed emergency management plans from Hancock  and Harrison counties.", "To obtain information on the experience of individual health care facilities  in Mississippi, we identified hospitals, nursing homes, and assisted living  facilities within each of the selected counties; interviewed facility  administrators; and reviewed documents provided.

We also identified facilities in Harrison County that were operated  by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). We excluded nursing homes  with fewer than 20 licensed beds. From this list, we selected facilities  based on ownership type, vulnerability and proximity to the ocean, and  size. For each facility, we obtained and reviewed emergency plans,  hurricane plans, and/or evacuation plans.
