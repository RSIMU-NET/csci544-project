Given the importance of these data, it is essential that they meet high quality standards before they are distributed to the public. After questions arose about the quality of certain data from the 2000 Census, the requesters asked GAO to review U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) standards on the quality of data disseminated to the public."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau did not have detailed agencywide standards for the review of data from the 2000 Census to determine if the data were of sufficient quality for public dissemination. Instead, analysts and managers in different parts of the Bureau primarily used their own judgment and unwritten, program-specific guidance to decide when and whether data should be released and what supporting information should accompany the data. The lack of sufficient data quality review standards led to a variety of problems, including missed opportunities for correcting data before release, inconsistent decisions on disseminating data with similar quality issues, and inadequate communication to users about the reasons for dissemination decisions. As a result, some users of data from the 2000 Census lost confidence in the quality of the data and in the Bureau's review procedures. In the 4 years since the 2000 Census, the Bureau has publicly issued general information quality guidelines, including eight performance principles, and one new standard that allows individuals to request correction of certain errors in data disseminated by the Bureau. Both of these documents resulted from the enactment of the Information Quality Act in 2000 and the subsequent guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget in 2002. However, except for the one standard, the Bureau did not provide any specific guidelines or procedures on the implementation of the general guidelines. The Bureau also began work on other standards, including one on minimal information that must be provided with data and another on discussion of errors in data released to the public. Neither has been issued in final form. In response to our earlier recommendations, the Bureau created an interdirectorate working group charged with developing and publicly issuing Bureau-wide standards for quality in data releases. The working group has taken some steps, but the Bureau has not provided information on the scope or the time frame for its efforts to develop these standards. The standards that the Bureau has under development and the activities of the working group are encouraging. However, it will be important for the Bureau to proceed with greater urgency to ensure that fully tested standards are in place for the 2010 Census. Until spring 2004, no additional resources were provided to support the working group, and over a year after it began, it has not issued any new standards or said when it will be ready to do so. A comprehensive, Bureau-wide data quality framework, with interrelated standards, and specific implementing procedures could help ensure consistent decisions about the quality of the data from the next decennial census and conditions under which the data will be disseminated. Moreover, the benefits the Bureau can achieve by developing and effectively implementing comprehensive data quality standards would not be limited to the decennial census. Because they would apply to all data disseminated by the Bureau, it will be important for any new standards to be developed promptly, implemented across the Bureau, and released to the public."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As one of the nation\u2019s principal statistical agencies, the U.S. Census Bureau  (Bureau) collects and disseminates data that are used to apportion and  redistrict seats in the House of Representatives, distribute billions of  dollars of federal funds, and guide the planning and investment decisions of  the public and private sectors. Given the importance of Bureau data to our  economy and system of governance, census information, like other federal  statistics, must be of high quality before it is released to the public.  Specifically, the data must be accurate, timely, accessible, relevant, and  objective. Failure to meet this threshold could impair decision making and  erode public confidence in the information and the Bureau\u2019s credibility.", "Producing high-quality data is a continuing challenge, in part because the  methods used to collect and process census data are complex and subject  to some degree of error. Consequently, the Bureau must decide if and when  the quality of each set of data is high enough for it to be released and what  caveats, if any, are needed to inform users of any shortcomings that could  affect whether and how the data are used. The development and use of  comprehensive data quality review standards\u2014if they are well  documented, transparent, clearly defined, and consistently applied\u2014help  statistical agencies make such decisions and communicate the results of  the decisions to the public.", "After the reliability of certain publicly released data from the 2000 Census  was called into question, concerns were raised about the adequacy of the  Bureau\u2019s data quality review standards. Chief among these concerns was  that the Bureau did not routinely and consistently include an adequate  discussion of limitations to the data it disseminates or provide information  on how it reaches its dissemination decisions.", "At your request, we reviewed the Bureau\u2019s data quality review standards.  Specifically, as discussed with your offices, we (1) examined the review  standards that the Bureau had in place to guide decisions to disseminate  2000 Census data, (2) determined if the Bureau has subsequently developed  additional review standards to guide decisions about data quality, and   (3) assessed whether any such standards are likely to address for the 2010  Census the data quality review concerns raised after the release of certain  data from the 2000 Census.", "To meet these objectives, we interviewed Bureau officials, reviewed  relevant documents prepared both before and after the enactment of the  Information Quality Act of 2000, and examined the guidelines other  statistical agencies and organizations have developed governing the public  dissemination of data. We did our audit work in Washington, D.C., and at  the Bureau\u2019s headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, from August 2003 through  October 2004, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau is best known for counting the nation\u2019s population every  10 years. In the future, the Bureau intends to collect much of the data that  have traditionally been collected during the decennial census from the  long-form questionnaire with the annual ACS. Beyond the decennial  census, the Bureau also conducts numerous other surveys and censuses  that measure changing individual and household demographics and the  economic condition of the nation. Lawmakers and agency officials at the  federal, state, and local levels rely on these data when they make decisions  in a wide range of policy areas. Private-sector decision makers also use  census data to guide their business plans.", "Because of the critical and varied uses of census information, it is  important that the Bureau\u2019s published data meet minimum quality  standards. In addition, when the data are made public, it is equally  important for the Bureau to disclose what has been done to ensure the  quality of the data and identify any limitations so that potential consumers  can decide whether the data are appropriate for a particular use.", "Some degree of error in the census (and in virtually any survey) is  inevitable because of limitations in enumeration, processing, and  dissemination methods and errors in responses and imputation of data  for nonresponses. Given the size and diversity of the U.S. population, the  effort to count the entire population and provide detailed demographic  characteristics every 10 years is one of the most complex of all government  operations. The Bureau devotes significant resources to minimizing error  and improving the quality of the decennial census.", "Data quality standards and standardized quality control procedures can  provide a consistent basis for making data dissemination decisions and  informing the public about the quality of the data made available to it. In  2000, Congress passed what is now known as the Information Quality Act.  This legislation directed OMB to issue governmentwide guidelines that  \u201cprovide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring  and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information  (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.\u201d  The legislation also required each agency to issue its own implementing  guidelines that include administrative mechanisms allowing affected  persons to correct information maintained and disseminated by the agency.", "The OMB guidelines, issued in final form in February 2002, define quality  as encompassing utility, objectivity, and integrity. The guidelines require  agencies to issue their own implementing guidelines by October 1, 2002.  Additionally, they mandate that agencies adopt a standard of quality as a  performance goal and act to incorporate data quality criteria into their data  dissemination practices. The guidelines also require agencies to develop  processes for reviewing the quality of data before they are disseminated.", "Although OMB had some general guidance for survey processes prior to the  enactment of the Information Quality Act, other than requirements for the  evaluation of selected monthly and quarterly economic indicators, there  were no governmentwide requirements relating to the quality of data  disseminated by the federal agencies. Some statistical agencies within the  United States developed their own extensive guidelines and standards that  apply to data disseminated to the public. In July 2001, OMB identified the  statistical agencies within the Departments of Education and Energy, the  National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Energy  Information Administration, as good examples of agencies that have  developed specific guidelines to implement their broad principles and  diverse professional standards.", "Statistical agencies in other countries have also developed good examples  of comprehensive guidelines for ensuring the quality of data disseminated  to the public. Since 1985, Statistics Canada, the central statistical agency of  the Canadian government, has published quality guidelines for its statistical  activities. Subsequently, it added guidelines on quality assurance processes  and management context and developed a policy and standards on  informing users about data quality. More recently, the European Union  recognized the importance of comprehensive, well-documented guidelines  and standards to support its task of developing high-quality, comparable  statistics from member countries. All members of the European Statistical  System (ESS) have signed a quality declaration and approved 22  recommendations for quality for future work within the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address our first question on the standards that the Bureau had in place  to guide its data dissemination decisions, we interviewed census officials,  reviewed relevant agency documents, talked to data users, and reviewed  various complaints about the quality of 2000 Census data. We built on our  prior reports about the quality of data from the 2000 Census on Hispanic  subgroups and the homeless and the Bureau\u2019s decision-making  processes for its decisions on whether to release those data. We also  reviewed other GAO reports addressing aspects of the Bureau\u2019s procedures  for assessing the quality of disseminated data. From these reports, we  identified examples of several types of problems the Bureau encountered  with 2000 Census data, which might have been alleviated if the Bureau had  implemented data quality standards and procedures. Our examples of data  quality problems are not comprehensive, but illustrative.", "To determine whether the Bureau has since developed Bureau-wide data  quality standards, and, if so, whether they would likely address for the  2010 Census the data quality problems raised after the 2000 Census,  we interviewed census officials responsible for developing agencywide  standards, examined documents related to the development of new  standards on data quality review, and reviewed the agency\u2019s Internet site  for information on data quality review standards available to the public.  We also reviewed OMB guidelines on the quality of data disseminated by  federal agencies as well as the action taken by the Department of  Commerce and the Bureau in response to the guidelines. We attended  meetings of the Secretary of Commerce\u2019s Decennial Census Advisory  Committee, the National Academy of Science Panel on Research on Future  Census Methods, and the Washington Statistical Society\u2019s conference on  Quality Assurance in the Government, all of which examined issues related  to the quality of the data disseminated by the Bureau. We also discussed  information quality standards and guidelines with officials in Eurostat, the  statistical directorate of the European Union.", "Additionally, we considered how the Bureau\u2019s actions in developing  dissemination guidelines could improve the quality of data disseminated  after the 2010 Census and for other Bureau data collection programs, such  as the ACS that among other things, is intended to replace the long-form  census questionnaire. To benchmark the Bureau\u2019s progress in developing  data quality review standards with that of other statistical agencies, we also  reviewed documents from entities that have developed standards for the  quality of data disseminated to the public, including NCES; Statistics  Canada, the central statistical agency of Canada; and ESS. However, we did  not evaluate the implementation or effectiveness of these guidelines and  standards or their specific applicability to the Bureau.", "Our work addressed only standards and guidelines on data quality review.  Although OMB\u2019s information quality guidelines and the Bureau\u2019s guidelines  and performance principals cover all the key steps in data collection,  analysis, and dissemination, we did not look at the Bureau\u2019s guidelines or  standards for ensuring quality during the planning and data collection  stages. Instead, as requested, we looked at Bureau guidance on steps taken  after data collection, that is, guidance related to processing data, assessing  their quality, and making them available to the public. We looked for  documents spelling out standards, guidelines, procedures, and other  criteria to guide decisions about identifying and correcting errors,  determining if and when to release data, and revising data after release.", "Our audit work was conducted in Washington, D.C., and at the Bureau\u2019s  headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, from August 2003 through October  2004. Our work was done in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of  Commerce.

Although Bureau officials emphasized that  the Bureau has a long tradition of high standards and procedures that yield  quality data, they acknowledged that these practices were primarily part of  the agency\u2019s institutional knowledge. According to one official, key  individuals in each program area, relying primarily on professional  judgment, determined whether the quality of the data was acceptable for  release to the public. The official explained that the program areas develop  their own guidance and procedures for ensuring data quality. Sometimes  their guidance and procedures were written, but more often they were not.

As release of data for each of these purposes is required by  statute, they are known collectively as \u201cpublic law\u201d data. The Bureau had a  number of quality assurance programs and procedures for assessing the  accuracy of, and correcting errors in, public law and other data prior to  their release. However, the lack of standard procedures and guidelines for  dealing with quality problems contributed to lost opportunities to correct  errors in the count of the population identified before the data were  disseminated.", "One such quality assurance program we reviewed was known as  Demographic Full Count Review, in which analysts were to identify,  investigate, and document suspected data discrepancies or \u201cissues\u201d in  order to clear census data files and products for subsequent processing or  public release. The Bureau contracted out some of the analysts\u2019 work  because it lacked sufficient staff to conduct the Full Count Review on its  own. Bureau reviewers were to determine whether and how to correct the  data by weighing quality improvements against time and budget  constraints. Analysts identified 4,809 possible discrepancies, such as  instances when the location, population count, demographic  characteristics, or a combination of these for housing units and group  living facilities differed from what analysts expected. According to Bureau  officials, only 5 of the 4,809 issues were investigated and corrected prior to  the release of the public law data. All five involved group living facilities the  Bureau calls \u201cgroup quarters\u201d for which the Bureau had the correct  population counts, but placed the living facilities in the wrong places. The  Bureau did not investigate most of the remaining issues prior to the release  of the data in large part because they were insufficiently documented and  the Bureau lacked the time and people to further investigate these issues.", "Subsequently, according to Bureau officials, the remaining issues that  contained sufficient documentation were investigated as a part of the  Count Question Resolution program, which ended in September 2003.", "As we noted in our July 2002 report, the fact that public law data were  released with over 4,800 unresolved data issues of unknown validity,  magnitude, and impact is cause for concern. To the extent these unresolved  discrepancies were in fact true errors in the population count or geography,  they could have affected the drawing of congressional districts as well as  other purposes for which census data are used.", "The existence of data quality review guidelines could have helped the  Bureau in this situation. For example, we found that the Bureau\u2019s lack of  clearly defined requirements for documenting data issues resulted in a  significant number of cases with inadequate documentation that the  Bureau could not use to resolve the issues. Additionally, the Bureau had no  mechanism for setting priorities for resolving these potential data errors.  A sufficient set of guidelines could have helped the Bureau to ensure that  the documentation of potential errors was adequate for decision making  and to maximize the use of scarce resources in addressing the various data  issues, giving top priority to investigating discrepancies likely to have the  most adverse affect on the data.", "The quality of certain data from the census long-form questionnaire have  been called into question as well. In its 2004 comprehensive review of the  2000 Census, a panel of the National Research Council of the National  Academy of Sciences assessed the quality of the long-form data using  various benchmarks, and found that the overall quality of the information  was less than that of the short-form questionnaire and had deteriorated  since the 1990 Census. For example, at least 32 percent of the  respondents failed to provide information on their property taxes, and  30 percent did not respond to all or some of the questions relating to  income (compared with 12 and 13 percent, respectively, in 1990).  Additionally, the panel noted that the Bureau did not measure and report  the impact of some of the steps it took to address problems with missing  data and recommended that the Bureau develop such measures and inform  users about the need for caution in analyzing and interpreting these data.", "Even more significant quality problems plagued the data for residents of  group quarters. The panel found these data to be poor in comparison with  the data for household residents, and also in comparison with data for  group quarters from the 1990 Census. In 2000, missing data rates for some  items were over 25 percent\u2014one item was over 50 percent\u2014for all  residents of group quarters, and as high as 75 percent for prison inmates.  Given the prevalence of missing data from residents of group quarters, the  panel questioned whether the Bureau should have published these data at  all for some or all types of group quarters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Made Conflicting Dissemination Decisions on Data with Similar Quality Problems", "paragraphs": ["Our earlier work on Hispanic subgroups and the homeless showed that the  Bureau\u2019s approach to data quality review led to inconsistent decision  making. Faced with similar quality problems in data from the 2000 Census,  Bureau officials made different decisions about disseminating data and did  not explain the reasons for their decisions.", "For example, in an effort to improve the count of Hispanics and simplify  the questionnaire, the Bureau redesigned its 2000 Census question on  Hispanic origin and dropped a list of examples of Hispanic subgroups  included in the 1990 Census. In May 2001, the Bureau released data on  Hispanics and Hispanic subgroups as part of its first release summarizing  the results of the 2000 Census. The Bureau also published The Hispanic  Population, a 2000 Census brief that provided an overview of the size and  distribution of the Hispanic population in 2000 and highlighted changes in  the population since the 1990 Census. For the first time, the Bureau  released data on Hispanic subgroups as a part of its release of the Full  Count Review data even though it had not fully tested the impact of  questionnaire changes on the subgroup data and provided little discussion  of the potential limitations of the data.", "Shortly after the Hispanic and Hispanic subgroup data from the 2000  Census were released to the public, questions were raised about the counts  for specific Hispanic subgroups. For example, the reported count of  Dominican Hispanics was significantly lower than counts reported in other  Bureau surveys. Representatives of affected Hispanic subgroups asked for  an investigation and explanation of why the Bureau reported data that  these subgroups considered to be of questionable quality. We found that a  key factor behind the Bureau\u2019s release of apparently less-than-accurate  Hispanic subgroup data appeared to be a lack of adequate guidelines  governing decisions on quality considerations that should be addressed  before making data publicly available.", "In contrast, the Bureau, citing quality problems, decided not to separately  report certain information on people without conventional housing,  including those commonly referred to as \u201chomeless.\u201d Enumerating this  segment of the population has been an ongoing challenge for the Bureau.  To help locate and count these people in 2000, the Bureau partnered with  organizations providing services to the homeless and with local  governments, some of which put considerable resources into the effort.  When the Bureau decided not to separately report the number of people in  transitional and emergency shelters as originally planned because of data  quality problems, some of the organizations and local governments, which  had expected to use the data for directing services to the homeless,  questioned the Bureau\u2019s process for making that decision. Additionally, we  found that the decision about when and whether to release data on people  in emergency and transitional shelters changed several times. Decisions  about the release of data with identified quality problems were not well  documented and communicated with some Bureau partners and other  stakeholders.", "As a result, outside parties interested in both the Hispanic and homeless  data from the 2000 Census questioned the quality of the data, the  procedures the Bureau used to determine what data to release, and the  value of their own participation in helping the Bureau prepare for the  2000 Census. Because the Bureau\u2019s reasons for data release decisions were  not obvious, and it had no guidelines or standards that spelled out criteria  for decisions, the Bureau left itself open to questions about the objectivity  of its decisions and risked loss of public confidence.", "In our reports on Hispanic and homeless Census 2000 data, we  recommended that the Bureau (1) develop agencywide guidelines for its  decisions on the level of quality needed to release data to the public, how to  characterize any limitations in the data, and when it is acceptable not to  release data and (2) ensure that these guidelines are documented,  transparent, clearly defined, and consistently applied. We also  recommended that the Bureau ensure that its plans for releasing data are clearly and consistently communicated to the public. The Bureau agreed  with each of our recommendations and asked its Methodology and  Standards Council to review existing statistical and quality guidelines,  bring them together in one place, and develop data quality standards.

Instead, the Bureau has developed the ACS that among other things, is  intended to replace the long-form census questionnaire. The detailed data  on social and economic conditions that were previously collected as a part  of the decennial census will in the future be collected annually in the ACS.  In fact, the ACS is a key component of the Bureau\u2019s plan for a reengineered  2010 Census.

A Bureau-wide set of  quality standards on data disseminated to the public covering both the  quality of the data and quality control procedures would apply not only to  the decennial census, but also to all other data collected by the Bureau and  released to the public. Such standards could help the Bureau avoid some of  the problems it experienced in disseminating data from the 2000 Census.

Commerce agreed with one of our two recommendations\u2013namely, to  establish data quality review standards as part of its plans for the 2010  Census, and as indicated in the Secretary\u2019s letter, the Bureau is taking steps  to implement it. However, Commerce disagreed with our first  recommendation that the Bureau accelerate its effort to establish  comprehensive data quality standards. Commerce also identified some  specific issues and suggested changes to provide additional context and  clarification and in some cases technical corrections. We made these  changes and corrections to the text as appropriate, but believe our first  recommendation still applies.", "Commerce took exception to our characterization of the amount of work  that the Bureau has completed in developing comprehensive data quality  review standards and in developing a specific standard for decisions on  data release. However, the activities and documents Commerce cited to  demonstrate the Bureau\u2019s progress were mentioned in our draft report.  For example, Commerce noted that the Bureau had developed a quality  framework for Bureau documents, inventoried quality guidance used in  specific program areas, and created an in-house repository of such  documents. Commerce also pointed to the quality principles the Bureau  developed and included as a part of its Information Quality Guidelines  issued in response to OMB requirements. Our draft report credited the  Bureau with all of these activities, although not always at the same level of  detail as Commerce described in its comments.", "Moreover, while these are important steps, most of this work is not  available to the public. As we observed in our draft report, the only  documents that have been made public on the agency\u2019s Internet site are the  documents required by the Information Quality Act and the related OMB  guidelines: (1) the Bureau\u2019s Information Quality Guidelines and (2) the  standard allowing individuals to seek correction of certain errors in data  disseminated by the Bureau.", "Indeed, our primary concern is not with how much work has been done but  whether the Bureau has well-documented, transparent, clearly defined  quality review guidelines and standards, and whether the pace of its efforts  is sufficient. As yet, the Bureau has not produced such guidelines nor has it  documented plans for completing this work. Bureau officials said they will  make existing standards available to the public on the agency\u2019s Internet site  by the end of 2004, but have not indicated which standards will be included.", "Therefore, we reaffirm our recommendation that the Bureau should  accelerate its efforts to establish such data quality review standards by  making public a detailed plan, including interim milestones, for developing  such standards and procedures. Such a plan can assist the Bureau in  prioritizing its work and addressing the resource constraints that will  inevitably be present. If, as Commerce maintained, much of the work has  already been completed, implementing the recommendation should not be  unduly burdensome or time consuming. While we commend the Bureau for  agreeing with our recommendation to implement data review guidelines  and standards for the 2010 Census and the ACS, we believe it needs to  accelerate its efforts to complete, make public, and fully implement these  data review standards.
