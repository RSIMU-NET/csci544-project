The embassy noted that, although Marshall Islands  citizens living in the United States are eligible to purchase individual  market health insurance plans through exchanges established under  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, many who are  employed lack access to affordable health care because of the limited  insurance benefits offered by most service industries or the high cost  of covering family members. Furthermore, the embassy called for an  objective accounting of revenue received from compact migrants and  depiction of their contributions to, for example, the health and food  security of the United States through employment in the food  processing industry and other essential work. Last, the embassy  commented that the addition of Marshallese workers to the 2020  census effort may remedy the potential undercounting of its citizens in  the previous census.", "Palau. The Embassy of the Republic of Palau observed that it would  be helpful to know the number of compact migrants from each FAS  country who are able to access the federal programs for which they  are eligible.

Compact migrants who are not fluent in English may  experience challenges accessing or navigating health care, the judicial  system, and educational institutions, according to state government  officials, FAS consulate officials, private sector and nonprofit organization  representatives, and compact migrant communities. State government  officials reported frequent difficulty in finding interpreters and translators  for the multiple languages spoken by compact migrants. State  government officials recommended that grants be made available to help  pay for interpreters until more FAS community members graduate from  college and become qualified.

They said that, in addition to  translating content, interpreters should fully explain the context of  programs to ensure compact migrants\u2019 understanding. FAS community  members proposed the creation of a group of paid, full-time interpreters  and a language certification requirement to guarantee the availability and  quality of language services.", "Create \u201cone-stop shops\u201d with information and resources for  compact migrants. State government officials and health care providers  identified a need for one-stop shops\u2014centers that serve compact migrant  populations\u2014in areas that do not currently have them. According to  stakeholders in a U.S. state without such a center, a one-stop shop could  reduce duplication and increase coordination among the many groups  that serve the FAS community. Other stakeholders suggested that each  state government establish a single point of contact for compact migrants.

State government officials noted the importance of community- based approaches to supporting compact migrants. For example,  stakeholders recommended hiring community health workers from the  FAS population to engage with their communities in U.S. areas.  According to the officials, community health workers, as known and  trusted entities, are better sources of information for FAS communities  than any government agency.

Some studies found that migration may result in worsened  employment prospects or wages\u2014particularly in the short term and if the  influx of migrants is sudden\u2014for nonmigrant workers who are most  similar to the migrants in terms of demographics and skills. If the  migrant workers are close substitutes for nonmigrants, they may intensify  competition for jobs, increasing unemployment and lowering wages for  such nonmigrant workers as well as for similar prior migrants. In the case  of compact migration, this might include younger and less educated  nonmigrants.", "However, according to other studies and survey papers that we reviewed,  nonmigrants, both low and high skill, could benefit as a whole from  migration. For example, one study of the effects of migration on 20  countries found that both low- and high-skill nonmigrants clearly benefited  from an influx of migrant workers about two-thirds of the time.  Nonmigrant workers may benefit from migration if the migrant workers  specialize in different skills and vocations than the nonmigrant population,  leading to complementary effects from scale and specialization. For  example, larger numbers of construction workers may result in greater  efficiency and quality in the building of more restaurants and bars,  benefitting workers in nonconstruction trades as well as nonmigrant  investors and business owners.", "Institutions may play an important role in determining the effects of  migration on the receiving country\u2019s workforce. For example, a study  estimating the effect of migrant workers in European Union countries and  controlling for institutional and noninstitutional factors showed that the  effect of migrants varied between countries, driven in part by differences  in their institutional environment, such as the extent of unemployment  insurance, fiscal redistribution, and government spending on services and  public goods. This study found that, while fiscal redistribution to migrant  workers through taxation and unemployment benefits somewhat worsens  outcomes for nonmigrants, this effect is often outweighed by the  economic contribution of these migrants.", "Distinctions in statistical methodologies and assumptions may explain  studies\u2019 seemingly contradictory conclusions about the effects of  migration on the workforce of receiving countries. According to a survey  paper reviewing other previously published work, the statistical controls  selected for studies of the impact of migration can result in subtle but  economically important distinctions in what the studies attempt to  measure, such as the total effects of migration on a given region or the  effects of migration on a specific group (e.g., a particular education or skill  group). According to this and a second survey paper we reviewed,  contradictory conclusions may also result from differing assumptions  about factors such as the extent to which migrants \u201cdownskill\u201d (compete  for jobs for which they may be overqualified) and, therefore, about the  nonmigrants that should be used as a comparison group to examine the  effect of migrants of a particular skill and education level. According to  a third survey paper we reviewed, studies also vary in whether they  measure the shorter- or longer-term effects of migration; the survey found  that negative effects are more often reported when studies measure  migration\u2019s shorter-term effects.", "Academic journal articles that we examined also discuss the potential  fiscal effect of migration. Several studies argue that evaluations of  migration\u2019s fiscal effect should consider the potential effects over multiple  generations and should also consider the indirect fiscal effect of migrants\u2019  influence on native workers. For example, a panel discussion report of the  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine states that  descendants of immigrants are often studied only as children, in cross- sectional data providing a point-in-time snapshot. As a result,  according to the report, the average immigrant household is counted as a  net fiscal burden in part because young children of immigrants, like the  children of natives, receive public education. The report stated that  studying the descendants of immigrants as they complete their education,  become workers, and start paying taxes provides a more complete  measure of migration\u2019s fiscal effect, because such an analysis may  include not only the cost of their education but also the delayed fiscal  benefits of that education: larger tax payments made possible by the  investment in human capital that education represents. Another paper  we reviewed argues that because migrant workers can positively  influence the upward mobility of native workers, the higher taxable  income from these native workers should be considered, in addition to the  low taxable income of the migrants, to avoid negatively biasing the  estimated fiscal effect of migrants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Compact Migrant Eligibility for, and Access to, REAL ID\u2013Compliant Identification", "paragraphs": ["The REAL ID Act, passed by Congress in 2005, set minimum document  requirements and issuance standards for driver\u2019s licenses and personal  identification cards.
