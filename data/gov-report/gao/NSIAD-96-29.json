This downsizing has taken place largely through the base closure and realignment (BRAC) process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Depot Maintenance Overview", "paragraphs": ["Prior to downsizing, DOD had 36 major maintenance depots\u20148 Army depots, 6 naval aviation depots, 8 shipyards, 2 ship repair activities, 3 Navy warfare centers, 7 Air Force depots, and 2 Marine Corps depots\u2014as well as other industrial facilities with a depot maintenance mission. This total includes 15 depots that are closing, 6 of which have already ceased maintenance operations. It does not include an Air Force depot maintenance activity in Colorado Springs that performs software maintenance for space systems or most specialized government-owned, contractor-operated repair depots.", "These depots, which represent a large government investment, have historically had more extensive technical capability\u2014in terms of the facilities, equipment, and personnel\u2014than lower maintenance levels.However, in recent years, various programs within the military services have resulted in blending some of the maintenance levels.", "In addition to in-house depot maintenance capability, DOD also contracts with thousands of firms, including both repair houses and original equipment manufacturers. These firms supply parts and provide direct maintenance support in both their own facilities and government facilities.", "In our April 1994 testimony, we reported that DOD\u2019s estimate of the workload mix between the public and private sectors\u2014about 35 percent to the private sector and the remainder to public depots\u2014understated the portion of private sector funding. We noted that an actual accounting of the amount going to the private sector, either directly or through the purchase of repair parts or secondary services, was not readily available because of limitations in the way DOD collected data. However, based on our review of available data, we projected that more than 50 percent of depot maintenance funds goes to the private sector.", "Figure 1.1 depicts DOD\u2019s major depots, which collectively employ about 100,000 civilian employees and 2,000 military personnel.

However, depot downsizing has largely occurred through the BRAC process.", "Closing unneeded facilities has never been easy, partly because of the public\u2019s concerns about the effects of closures on communities and about the impartiality of the decision-making process. Additionally, 1970s legislation requiring congressional notification of proposed closures and preparation of economic, environmental, and strategic consequence reports has greatly impeded base closure efforts. Legislation enacted in 1988 (P.L. 100-526) facilitated a successful round of base closure decision-making. It outlined a special process for considering base closure actions, authorized a special commission to review proposed closures and realignments, and provided relief from certain statutory provisions that hindered the base closure process.", "In 1990, the Secretary of Defense found it was difficult to complete additional base closure actions without special enabling legislation. Therefore, Congress passed the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (title XXIX, P.L. 101-510), which halted any major closures unless DOD followed the new act\u2019s requirements. The act created independent BRAC commissions and outlined procedures, roles, and time frames for the President, Congress, DOD, GAO, and the commissions to follow. It required that all bases be compared equally against (1) selection criteria to be developed by DOD and (2) DOD\u2019s current force structure plan. The legislation mandated rounds of BRAC reviews in 1991, 1993, and 1995.", "The first 3 rounds of the BRAC process resulted in decisions to close  10 maintenance depots: 1 in BRAC 1988, 2 in BRAC 1991, and 7 in BRAC 1993.

DOD estimated that this approach would reduce the Air Force\u2019s excess capacity by 1.5 depot equivalents. However, after these recommendations were forwarded to the BRAC Commission for review, the Commission added all five air logistics centers, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and Tobyhanna Army Depot to the list for further review.", "The Commission ultimately recommended closing the Long Beach Naval Shipyard; the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division Detachment, Louisville, Kentucky; and the Sacramento and San Antonio Air Logistics Centers. In addition, it recommended that (1) the depot maintenance mission be discontinued at the Letterkenny Army Depot (Pennsylvania); (2) the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport, Washington, retain its torpedo depot maintenance workload, but transfer its ship combat systems workload; and (3) the Red River Army Depot remain open and retain its Bradley Fighting Vehicle Series workload, but transfer its other maintenance missions to other depots or the private sector.", "President Clinton disagreed with some of the Commission\u2019s recommendations, especially those that affected depots in California and Texas, but he ultimately approved the Commission\u2019s report on July 13, 1995, and forwarded it to Congress.

Although not directly comparable, these estimates are considerably less than the Commission\u2019s estimates\u201485 percent less for the implementation period and 10 percent less in annual recurring savings. However, actual savings are still uncertain because (1) the budget estimates do not include many closure-related costs, (2) DOD has not updated the annual savings estimates since it submitted the initial budget estimates to Congress, and (3) DOD has not developed an effective methodology for estimating the cost of accomplishing closing depots\u2019 workloads at new sources of repair. Further, DOD has not developed a methodology to determine actual closure savings, and there are already indications that the data needed to make this determination will no longer be available after the closures have been completed.", "As a result of these problems, the services lack reliable data for making their workload redistribution decisions and may be selecting more costly alternatives. For example, preliminary cost estimates indicate that the Air Force\u2019s decision to privatize-in-place work currently performed at the Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center (AGMC) will increase costs rather than save money. Nevertheless, the services are either implementing or considering a similar approach at four of the five depots that the 1995 BRAC Commission recommended for closure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Net Savings Estimates Have Decreased", "paragraphs": ["Initially, DOD used the COBRA model to estimate the cost of and savings from closing each depot.

Requirements for budget submissions are established in the BRAC acts (P.L. 100-526, sec. 206 and P.L. 101-510, sec. 2907), which require that annual DOD budget requests (1) include cost and savings estimates for each closure or realignment and (2) indicate the time for achieving these savings. The final budget estimate for the Lexington-Bluegrass Army Depot, which was the only depot closed during the first BRAC process, was submitted in February 1994. The latest budget estimates for the other nine depot closures were submitted in February 1995.", "Defense and service officials emphasized that the COBRA model was never intended to provide budget-quality estimates, and they pointed out that budget and COBRA estimates are not directly comparable\u2014primarily because the COBRA model excludes environmental cleanup costs. They said the COBRA estimates (1) were intended to be used to compare realignment and closure options, (2) are based on limited data, and (3) exclude environmental cleanup costs because DOD is liable for these costs regardless of whether a depot is closed or realigned.", "Table 2.1 shows the differences between the BRAC Commissions\u2019 6-year net savings estimates and the military services\u2019 latest budget estimates. As indicated, the major reasons for the $1,215.4-million difference are (1) a $711.1-million reduction in the amount of gross savings that are expected during the implementation period resulting from such factors as fewer than expected reductions in the number of personnel eliminated, (2) the addition of $409.1 million in environmental costs, and (3) a $100.5-million increase in nonenvironmental costs for such items as the relocation of civilian employees.", "Estimates of annual recurring savings after the 6-year implementation period have also been reduced. Specifically, the Commissions\u2019 COBRA analyses indicated that closing the 10 depots would save about $729 million annually, when adjusted to fiscal year 1996 dollars, but DOD\u2019s current budget estimates indicate the savings will be only $656 million annually. For example, the net savings estimate for Tooele Army Depot was reduced from the $112.5-million estimate by COBRA to $17.6 million in the budget over the 6-year implementation period, and from $53.5 million (COBRA) to $27.5 million (budget) for each subsequent year. Our analysis shows the reduction was largely due to a change in assumptions about the number of civilian positions that would be eliminated by the closure. The COBRA estimate assumed the elimination of 1,268 civilian positions, while the budget estimate assumed the elimination of 671 positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budget Estimates Do Not Include Some Costs", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s current budget estimates understate the actual cost of closing the  10 depots. The primary reason for this is that they do not reflect closure-related costs that either have been or will be paid from the operation and maintenance account or by the Defense Business Operations Fund. For example, the Navy estimates that, through fiscal year 1995, closing naval aviation depots and shipyards will have accumulated operating losses of about $882 million that will be recouped from its operation and maintenance account ($695 million) or written off within the Fund ($187 million). Only some of this loss is directly related to depot closures. For example:", "Naval aviation depots and shipyards were directed to freeze overhead rates at the time the closure decision was made and, as a result, they were unable to recover some of their overhead costs when their workloads declined.", "Two of the three closing shipyards have had losses from higher than normal leave usage that is not reflected in the Navy\u2019s BRAC budget estimates because this cost is being financed from the Navy\u2019s operation and maintenance account. The operation and maintenance account is paying for the $7.8-million loss that the Charleston Naval Shipyard incurred in fiscal year 1994 and for losses the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard will incur during fiscal year 1995.", "The Navy\u2019s most current budget estimates do not reflect the impact of productivity reductions that naval aviation depots experienced after their closures were announced. For example, according to the Naval Depot Operations Center\u2019s information, direct labor efficiency for two aircraft repair programs\u2014measured by comparing established norms to the actual number of direct labor hours required to overhaul EA6B aircraft at Alameda and A6E aircraft at Norfolk\u2014declined about 9 percent and 2 percent, respectively, between fiscal year 1992 (the last full year before closure was announced) and fiscal year 1994 (the first full year after closure was announced).", "In addition, closing Army depots have incurred closure-related costs and losses that are being financed by the Defense Business Operations Fund. For example: In fiscal year 1993, the Sacramento Army Depot charged about $12 million in closure-related costs to the Defense Business Operations Fund instead of the BRAC account. For example, the Navy and other organizations charged depot employees\u2019 voluntary separation incentive pay (VSIP) to their BRAC account, but the Sacramento Army Depot used the Defense Business Operations Fund to finance these costs.", "The Sacramento Army Depot\u2019s maintenance mission ended in fiscal year 1994, but the Army continued to use Defense Business Operations Funds to finance base support and other costs during fiscal year 1995.

However, according to an analysis by the Naval Aviation Depot Operations Center, closing three aviation depots and consolidating work at the three remaining depots have enabled the Navy to reduce fiscal year 1995 customer rates by $82.7 million.", "In December 1994, we reported that closing AGMC could result in an annual recurring cost rather than the $3.8-million savings that was initially projected in the Air Force\u2019s February 1994 budget submission. Air Force officials acknowledged that the closure and privatization of the Center could increase annual costs\u2014possibly by as much as $600 million over a 6-year period.

They considered using an Economic and Personnel Analysis Model that was developed to evaluate the financial impact of various interservicing alternatives. However, although the model is compatible with the COBRA model, it requires an additional data call. Further, all of the services did not agree to use the model during the 1995 BRAC process.

First, if one or more additional rounds of base closures are required, having more accurate information on the costs and savings associated with past closures should allow DOD, the services, and any future closure commissions to develop more reliable estimates and, in turn, make more informed decisions. Additionally, we believe the services could make more informed and cost-effective workload redistribution decisions if they had more reliable cost and savings data on past closures. For example, the privatization-in-place concept that is being implemented at AGMC is also being considered for four of the five depots that the 1995 Commission recommended for closure, even though DOD has not developed a methodology for determining (1) how much this privatization will save or cost the government and (2) if this approach is more cost-effective than closing the depots and transferring their workloads to either the remaining depots or the private sector."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Limit Involuntary Separations Have Been Successful, but Costly", "paragraphs": ["DOD has thus far been successful in limiting the number of employees that must be involuntarily separated when depots close.

About 54.5 percent of the workers found other jobs, while 8.5 percent took either an optional or disability retirement; 14.1 percent took voluntary early retirement; and 13 percent resigned. VSIP of up to $25,000, depending upon length of service, is one tool DOD used. It is too early in the closure process to determine DOD\u2019s overall success in limiting involuntary separations. However, for two depots that have closed or are near final closure, the number of involuntary separations remains low. For example, at the Sacramento Army Depot, although 164 employees were separated through the reduction-in-force process, this represents only 7.3 percent of the total losses and, according to the depot commander, most of these employees chose to be separated rather than to relocate to other localities where DOD jobs for which they qualified were available.

For example, in 1992, we reported that the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Command could have saved as much as $1.1 million in fiscal year 1992 by eliminating the requirement for the Red River Army Depot to overhaul all 6V53 engines (used in M113 personnel carriers) and allowing the depot to (1) establish a pre-shop analysis program and (2) perform only those repairs necessary to return the engines to service. Similarly, in the same report, we indicated that the Tooele Army Depot was completely overhauling certain items that required only inspection and repair and that it was doing so without the knowledge of its higher headquarters or the approval of its customers.", "A comparison of two bids submitted by the Sacramento Air Logistics Center for the first competition illustrates the impact that eliminating unnecessary repairs can have.

Inflated labor standards have persisted, in part, because depots lacked an incentive to reduce their labor standards. In fact, there is a disincentive because (1) labor efficiency, which compares actual labor time with labor standards, is one of the factors maintenance employees and supervisors are evaluated on and (2) reducing inflated labor standards will result in a corresponding reduction in reported labor efficiency.

In addition to these DOD-wide actions, some depots have independently improved the quality and accuracy of their maintenance databases, systems, and processes, including cost accounting. For example, one of the basic problems that we and others have pointed out with the Air Force\u2019s accounting system is that actual costs are accumulated at the maintenance shop level rather than at the job level.
