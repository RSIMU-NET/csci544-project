According to gerontology experts, the percentage of elderly patients affected by the inappropriate use of prescription drugs would be even greater if other situations, such as potentially dangerous drug interactions or incorrect dosages, were taken into account. The inappropriate use of prescription drugs may cause unnecessary adverse drug reactions that may lead to subtle deterioration of function or precipitate medical crises resulting in hospitalization or death. They also contribute to higher medical costs borne in part by either Medicare or Medicaid. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that the annual cost of hospitalizations due to inappropriate prescription drug use is $20 billion.", "Concerned that the inappropriate use of prescription drugs harms the health and quality of life of the elderly, you asked us to determine if the inappropriate use of prescription drugs among the elderly is widely viewed as a serious health problem; identify the ways prescription drugs are inappropriately used and why these situations occur; identify how physicians, pharmacists, and patients receive information on prescription drugs and how their knowledge of prescription drugs and drug therapies could be improved; and provide information on how emerging trends in health care delivery affect drug prescribing for the elderly.", "To address these issues, we conducted a literature review and obtained documents from leading researchers in the fields of gerontology and elderly clinical pharmacology. We interviewed these individuals as well as representatives of FDA, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), state Medicaid programs, industry trade associations, senior citizen and consumer advocacy groups, and medical associations who are knowledgeable in the use of prescription drugs for the elderly. We analyzed data on prescription drug use from HCFA\u2019s 1992 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.

The elderly use more prescription drugs than any other age group and are more likely to be taking multiple prescription drugs, which increases the probability of adverse drug reactions. Furthermore, the elderly are more susceptible to adverse drug reactions because of the aging process. As a result, many experts believe that some drugs are generally inappropriate for the elderly because equally effective and safer alternative drugs exist. Additionally, other drugs though appropriate should be used at reduced dosage levels to accommodate elderly physiology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inappropriate Prescription Drug Use Is Widespread Among the Elderly", "paragraphs": ["Based on 1987 data from the National Medical Expenditure Survey, a research study published in July 1994 concluded that almost 25 percent of the noninstitutionalized elderly 65 or older used prescription drugs at least once during the year that are generally considered unsuitable for their age group. The study used a list of 20 drugs, based on criteria published in 1991, that generally should not be used by elderly patients.", "A second study published in October 1994 reinforced the findings of the earlier study. In this study, the researchers interviewed a sample of community residents, 75 or older living in Santa Monica, California, during 1989 and 1990 about their use of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and home remedies within the 4 weeks prior to the interview. The researchers used primarily the same criteria as the July 1994 study, but only looked at drug usage over a 1-month period rather than the entire year. This study concluded that 14 percent of those interviewed used at least one of the drugs generally identified as not suitable for elderly patients.", "Several experts we interviewed expressed reservations about the appropriateness of using 1991 criteria to evaluate prescription drug use in years before the criteria were developed. However, these experts did not disagree with the criteria themselves. To determine if there was much change in prescribing patterns after 1991, we analyzed data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey conducted by HCFA\u2019s Office of the Actuary to see what percentage of noninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries in 1992 used any of the 20 drugs. Our analysis showed that an estimated 17.5 percent of the almost 30 million senior citizens in the survey used at least one of these drugs in 1992. Although this represented an improvement over the 1987 data, more than one out of six elderly patients were still using prescription drugs generally considered unsuitable for their age group.", "Many health care practitioners questioned whether the use of these drugs should always be characterized as inappropriate. They maintained that, under certain circumstances, their use would be perfectly acceptable. For example, if a patient was already using a particular drug and doing well, there would be little medical justification for switching to another drug. Still, none of these practitioners said that this rationale would account for the high percentage of elderly patients using drugs deemed inappropriate. All the experts we interviewed agreed that the inappropriate use of prescription drugs continues to be a significant health problem.", "Several experts also pointed out that these research studies only looked at one type of the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. In their opinion, when other examples are considered such as potentially dangerous drug interactions or incorrect dosages, the percentage of senior citizens affected by the inappropriate use of prescription drugs would be even greater than the estimates provided in those studies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Elderly Are Particularly Vulnerable to Inappropriate Prescription Drug Use", "paragraphs": ["The elderly are more likely than other segments of the population to be affected by the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. As a group, the elderly are more likely to suffer from more than one disease or chronic condition concurrently, which means that they may take several different drugs at one time. As the number of prescriptions increases, so does the potential for adverse drug reactions caused by drug interactions or drug-disease contraindications. The physiological changes of aging are a major reason drugs have the potential to cause problems in the elderly. Elderly patients often lack the ability to eliminate drugs from their systems as efficiently as younger patients do because of decreased liver and kidney function. In addition, they are more sensitive to the effects of drugs. Thus, they are not able to accommodate the normal adult dosage.", "The inappropriate use of prescription drugs is a major cause of adverse drug reactions that, if severe enough, can result in hospitalization or death. Since the elderly are more vulnerable to the effects of the inappropriate prescription drug use, they are at greater risk from adverse drug reactions than other segments of the population. Studies indicate that about 3 percent of all hospital admissions are caused by adverse drug reactions.However, the percentage is much higher for the elderly. One study estimated the percentage of hospitalizations of elderly patients due to adverse drug reactions to be 17 percent, almost 6 times greater than for the general population. Applying an average unit cost to the proportion of hospital admissions that are drug-related, FDA estimates that hospitalizations due to inappropriate prescription drug use cost about $20 billion annually.", "Less severe adverse drug reactions may go unnoticed or be discounted by both health practitioners and the elderly as the normal effects of the aging process. However, these side effects, such as drowsiness, loss of coordination, and confusion, can result in falls or car accidents. A study estimated that 32,000 senior citizens annually suffer hip fractures as a result of falls caused by adverse drug reactions. Another study concluded that about 16,000 car accidents resulting in injuries each year can be attributed to adverse drug reactions experienced by elderly drivers. Even if no serious bodily injury occurs, adverse drug reactions decrease the general quality of life for patients because of drug-induced mental impairment, loss of coordination, or addiction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Many Factors Contribute to the Inappropriate Use of Prescription Drugs", "paragraphs": ["The factors leading to the inappropriate use of prescription drugs are multifaceted and interconnected, according to experts we interviewed. These factors reflect the behavior of the physician, pharmacist, and patient, either collectively or individually. From the time a drug is prescribed to the point where the drug is taken, many possible events, often interconnected with each other, can lead to an adverse drug reaction or other serious results.", "The inappropriate use of prescription drugs can take several different forms, ranging from potentially life-threatening drug-drug interactions to therapeutic duplication (using two or more similar drugs to treat the same problem), which yields little benefit at increased cost. Other examples of the inappropriate use of prescription drugs include drug-age contraindication, drug-allergy contraindication, drug-disease contraindication, incorrect drug dosage, incorrect duration of drug therapy, and less effective drug therapy.", "A physician, a pharmacist, or a patient may take or omit actions that can produce an adverse drug reaction. For example, a drug-drug interaction could be due to a physician not recognizing that a prescribed drug interacts badly with another prescribed medication or over-the-counter drug used by the patient. (See fig. 1.) The pharmacist may contribute to the situation by not detecting the negative interaction or by failing to determine which drugs the elderly patient is taking. The elderly patient may not give the doctor and pharmacist a complete list of all the medications, including over-the-counter drugs, that he or she is taking. Thus, all three parties may contribute to a drug-drug interaction, with potentially serious consequences to the patient.", "Health care professionals noted that the overuse and underuse of drug therapies may also contribute to the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. Drug overuse occurs when a medication is prescribed but either no medication was needed or an alternative treatment approach existed. For example, changes in diet and lifestyle may be more appropriate than drug therapy. More controversial is the selection of drug therapy over counseling to treat psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression. Drug underuse occurs when an appropriate medication either is not prescribed or is underprescribed. For example, one study reported that patients with advanced cancer were at risk of receiving less than adequate pain medication."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Better Information and Communication Can Help Prevent Inappropriate Drug Use", "paragraphs": ["According to several experts we interviewed, lowering the elderly\u2019s risk of adverse drug reactions requires that more detailed information on the impact of drug therapies on the elderly be developed and disseminated to health practitioners.

Increased communication between and among physicians, pharmacists, and patients is vital to ensuring that this process is effective."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FDA Has Improved Drug Guidelines for the Elderly", "paragraphs": ["One difficulty in prescribing drugs for the elderly has been the lack of specific information on dosage levels established for the elderly through clinical tests. Recognizing the need for additional information on the effects of drugs on the elderly, FDA issued voluntary guidelines in 1989 governing the testing of new drugs intended for elderly patients. These guidelines call for the inclusion of elderly patients during the drug\u2019s testing process. The intent of these guidelines is to develop better information for both physicians and pharmacists on dosage standards for new drugs intended for elderly patients as well as to identify side effects that are more pronounced in the elderly than in the general population. FDA\u2019s Director of Drug Policy and Evaluation stated that he believed that pharmaceutical manufacturers have complied with these guidelines. However, several experts said that clinical trials performed under these guidelines are not representative of the elderly population as a whole.

For example, board certification in geriatrics was offered for the first time in 1988. Recognizing the aging of the population, most medical schools now offer courses in geriatrics, though only 12 schools require courses devoted solely to geriatrics. Experts we interviewed agreed that medical schools could improve how they train doctors in geriatrics. Moreover, several experts stressed the need to improve the quality of continuing education in geriatrics, because a large portion of the education doctors receive in medical school becomes outdated during their careers. Since medical schools have only recently introduced geriatric training in their curricula, many doctors in practice today have had little formal training in that area. Two experts also pointed out a similar need for an emphasis on geriatrics in the training of pharmacists, both in pharmacy school and through continuing education.", "While preclinical training in pharmacology is routinely provided in medical school, several experts said that improvements are needed in the teaching of clinical pharmacology, which trains doctors in the use of drug therapies to treat disease. Doctors obtain their clinical pharmacology training during their residencies. Physicians\u2019 clinical knowledge of the unique aspects of elderly pharmacology depends on their exposure to elderly patients.

Drug utilization reviews are intended to screen drug therapies for potential problems, such as drug-drug interactions, drug-disease contraindications, incorrect dosages, or improper duration of treatment. These reviews can be done either prospectively or retrospectively. Prospective drug utilization reviews are designed to detect potential problems before a prescription is filled by the pharmacist. Retrospective drug utilization reviews occur after the prescription is filled and are intended to detect prescribing patterns that indicate inappropriate or unnecessary medical treatment as well as fraud or abuse. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires all states to conduct ongoing retrospective reviews of Medicaid prescription drug claims and prospective reviews before each prescription is filled. Most states have expanded that requirement to mandate drug utilization review of all prescriptions. While several experts acknowledged the potential benefits of drug utilization review systems, two experts cautioned that these benefits have not been thoroughly documented to date.", "A prospective drug utilization review system allows point-of-sale vendors such as pharmacies to check a prescription and a patient\u2019s history against a central database. This database can alert a pharmacist to possible drug-drug interactions or a drug-disease contraindication. Our study of prospective Medicaid drug utilization review systems in five states during fiscal year 1993 found that pharmacies\u2019 use of automated drug utilization review systems linked to statewide Medicaid databases provided a more thorough prospective review than a manual or localized system. This type of automated review can reduce the risk of inappropriate drug therapy and increase patient safety, though we recognized the need for these benefits to be demonstrated conclusively and recommended that HCFA take steps to do so. We also recommended that HCFA develop guidance for the development of these systems to ensure standard implementation of effective drug utilization review systems.", "New York State\u2019s Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage program provides prescription drug insurance coverage for low-income senior citizens not eligible for Medicaid. This program uses a retrospective drug utilization review system for its therapeutic drug monitoring program. This review system monitors each client\u2019s prescriptions, using data from prescription claims submitted for payment by pharmacies, to detect potential problems such as overutilization of a drug or a drug-drug interaction. Once a potential problem is detected, a program official notifies the prescribing physician. The alert is informational only and provides the doctor with a history of the patient\u2019s prescription drug usage, the suspected problem, its effect and severity, and recommendations for resolving the problem. No action is required, but the doctor is asked to respond. In one analysis conducted by program staff, 38.4 percent of the patients whose doctors received letters alerting them to a potential problem subsequently had their drug therapy changed.", "The Massachusetts Medicaid program also uses its retrospective drug utilization review system to detect questionable prescribing practices affecting any of its recipients. For example, if a patient is prescribed a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to relieve the symptoms of arthritis, the system will monitor that patient for potential side effects of this type of medication, such as stomach or intestinal bleeding. If the patient later begins to take antiulcer medications, the system will issue an alert to the prescribing doctor that the usage of the first drug may be the cause of the ulcers. This allows the doctor to evaluate the situation and, if warranted, alter the patient\u2019s drug therapy.", "A retrospective drug utilization review system can also monitor patient compliance with a prescribed drug therapy. For example, a patient may discontinue his or her blood pressure medication when the symptoms disappear. Despite the lack of symptoms, the causes remain, leaving the patient still at risk.

Often, subtle side effects of drugs are ignored by patients and not reported back to the doctor or pharmacist. Unless alerted that the patient is experiencing side effects, a doctor would not be likely to change drug therapies. Counseling not only improves the information received by the patient but also that obtained from the patient. This improved communication between doctor or pharmacist and the patient may prompt a question that leads to the discovery of a drug-drug interaction or drug-allergy interaction.", "Although effective counseling by doctors and pharmacists can help reduce the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction, two studies have found that many patients do not receive this counseling. A Consumer Reports study of 70,000 people published in 1995 found that about 26 percent had not been counseled by a physician about their drug therapies. A 1989 study by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) found that more than one out of three patients reported that they were not counseled by their doctors on their drug therapies. Time pressures on both doctors and pharmacists may also be an obstacle to effective counseling.", "Recognizing the importance of counseling, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated that pharmacists counsel Medicaid patients when they receive prescription drugs. A majority of states have expanded this requirement to include all patients. Officials of the American Pharmaceutical Association and the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, two professional associations that represent pharmacists, stressed the importance of counseling but noted that the current system of compensation for pharmacists is based on dispensing drugs and lacks meaningful incentives for counseling.

Public Citizen Health Research Group, a public advocacy group, has also published a consumer guidebook for prescription drugs. Moreover, pharmaceutical manufacturers have begun to make information available directly to consumers. Increased understanding of their drugs, dosage requirements, and possible side effects makes patients more likely to avoid the inappropriate use of drugs.", "State and local agencies have developed several initiatives to alert consumers to the dangers of inappropriately using prescription drugs. For example, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health sponsors brown bag seminars at senior citizen or community centers. At these seminars, elderly patients are encouraged to bring in all their medicines for review by pharmacists. The goal is to inventory all the medications a senior citizen has and eliminate those that are for conditions no longer being treated or which have expired. The remaining drugs are cataloged in what is called a \u201cmedicine passport\u201d that can be shown to doctors and pharmacists as new or additional drugs are prescribed.

The growing emphasis on controlling health care costs creates a strong incentive to reduce the inappropriate use of prescription drugs and the physical and financial costs associated with adverse drug reactions. Likewise, the increasing importance of cost containment has helped spur the emergence of managed care as a major form of health care delivery. The number of people covered by managed care plans has increased dramatically from 10 million in 1980 to almost 90 million in 1992. Moreover, many managed care plans have recently initiated major marketing efforts to enroll elderly patients. Similarly, the number of people whose prescriptions are filled by pharmacy benefit management companies has also increased. While it is too early to understand the full impact these changes may have on reducing inappropriate drug use\u2014in general, and among the elderly in particular\u2014several experts we interviewed stated that these changes have the potential to improve the coordination of care and to increase the ability to detect inappropriate use of drugs.

At times, these doctors may prescribe several drugs to treat various ailments. Unless these various drug therapies are coordinated, adverse drug reactions pose a serious risk. Experts in gerontology and elderly clinical pharmacology that we spoke to stated that the most effective way to deal with the inappropriate use of prescription drugs was to improve the coordination of care. Ideally, this role should fall to the patient\u2019s primary physician.", "Proponents of managed care have stressed improved coordination of care as a major goal. Though there are several variations of managed care such as health maintenance organizations (HMO) or preferred provider organizations, a basic characteristic of managed care is control over utilization. Often, this is done through a gatekeeper. A gatekeeper is usually the patient\u2019s designated primary doctor who oversees the individual\u2019s care, referring the patient to specialists as needed. This allows one doctor to coordinate various treatments, including drug regimens. Several experts agreed that such coordination could help lower the risk of adverse drug reactions posed by inappropriate drug therapy or a patient receiving multiple prescriptions from different doctors. However, they cautioned that the improved coordination of care is dependent on the quality of patient care, which varies widely among managed care plans.", "Managed care plans also have the potential to use formularies to reduce the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. A formulary lists the preferred drugs used to treat certain diseases or conditions. Typically, the formulary is developed by a committee of doctors and pharmacists associated with the managed care plan, who seek to identify the most effective drug therapies at the lowest cost to the plan. For example, if two drug therapies are deemed equally effective, then the plan will recommend the less costly of the two as the preferred treatment. However, several experts expressed the concern that cost concerns rather than effectiveness may be the primary driving force in selecting which drugs to place on a managed care plan\u2019s formulary.", "A managed care plan can change its formulary to reflect new drug therapies. This has an impact on the prescribing behavior of a plan\u2019s doctors who may have to seek an exception if they wish to prescribe a drug not designated by the plan\u2019s formulary. However, two experts said that few managed care plans have used their formularies to improve prescribing practices for elderly patients though the experts acknowledged this potential exists.", "Another potential advantage of managed care is the data collected on patients. This gives managed care plans the information needed to monitor both the drug therapies patients receive and the prescribing patterns of physicians.

Of these alerts, 25 percent dealt with drug-age contraindications and excessive daily dosages, two types of inappropriate drug use prevalent among the elderly. Likewise, by monitoring patient prescription drug use, pharmacy benefit management firms can detect a patient\u2019s failure to refill a prescription for a persistent medical condition such as high blood pressure.

The most current compiled data are for 1992. The first step was to identify survey participants who were 65 or older and who were noninstitutionalized. Of their survey population, 9,182 participants met these criteria. This group represented 29,862,854 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide according to HCFA\u2019s Office of the Actuary. The next step was to determine which of these participants used at least 1 of the 20 drugs sometime during 1992 and project that use to the national population. The results indicated that an estimated 17.5 percent or 5,219,811 noninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries 65 or older used at least 1 of those drugs during 1992.", "These results are displayed in table IV.1. Specifically, the table lists the percentages of noninstitutionalized elderly found to be using each of the 20 drugs. The middle column details the results based on research using data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey covering noninstitutionalized residents 65 or older. The right-hand column presents the results of the analysis described above. We did not include the research results based on interviews conducted during 1989 and 1990 of a sample of noninstitutionalized elderly 75 or older residing in Santa Monica, California. This was because the participants in this study represented one community rather than a national sample and belonged to a different age group than the other two studies.
