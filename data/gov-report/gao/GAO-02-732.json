It reported that for the  year ended September 30, 2001, about 230,000 cardholders used purchase  cards to make about 10.7 million transactions at a cost of over $6.1 billion.   Purchase cards are to be used exclusively for government-related  purchases.  Purchase card transactions include acquisitions at or below the  $2,500 micropurchase threshold, commercial training requests valued at or  below $25,000, and payments on contracts.  The use of purchase cards has  dramatically increased in past years as agencies have sought to eliminate  the lengthy process and paperwork long associated with making small  purchases.  The benefits of using purchase cards versus traditional  contracting and payment processes are lower transaction processing costs  and less \u201cred tape\u201d for both the government and the vendor community.", "We support the use of a well-controlled purchase card program to  streamline the government\u2019s acquisition processes.  However, it is  important that agencies have adequate internal control in place to protect  the government from fraud, waste, and abuse.   In July 2001 and March  2002, we testified on significant breakdowns in internal control over  purchase card transactions at two Navy sites in San Diego, California. This  work identified a weak internal control environment; ineffective internal  control; and potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive purchases.", "As a result of our work at the two Navy sites and continuing concern about  fraud, waste, and abuse in DOD\u2019s purchase card program, you requested  that we expand our audits of purchase card controls.   As the initial part of  this requested work, this report focuses on the Army, which has the largest  purchase card program in DOD.  In fiscal year 2001, the Army had about  109,000 cardholders, 4.4 million transactions, and $2.4 billion in purchases.   We plan to report to you separately on the results of our audits of the Navy  and Air Force purchase card programs.", "The objective of our audit of the Army\u2019s purchase card program was to  assess the adequacy of internal control over the authorization, purchase,  and payment of purchase card transactions during fiscal year 2001.    Specifically, we addressed whether (1) the Army\u2019s overall control  environment and management of the purchase card program were  effective, (2) the Army\u2019s key internal control activities operated effectively  and provide reasonable assurance that purchase cards were used  appropriately, and (3) indications existed of potentially fraudulent,  improper, and abusive and questionable transactions.  We audited the  Army\u2019s internal control policies, procedures, and activities at five major  commands that account for about 66 percent of total purchases and 62  percent of total transactions.  At one installation in each of the commands,  we tested a statistical sample of purchase card transactions and conducted  other audit work to evaluate the design and implementation of key internal  control procedures and activities.  The results of our review of the  transactions comprising the statistical samples can only be projected to the  individual installation at which we performed the testing and cannot be  used to project to the command level or to the Army as a whole.  The  cumulative results of all our work offer significant perspective on the  adequacy of the design and implementation of purchase card program  internal control within the Army.", "We also looked for indications of potentially fraudulent, improper, and  abusive or questionable purchases as part of our statistical sampling and  through nonrepresentative selections of transactions using data mining of  fiscal year 2001 transactions.  Our data mining included identifying  transactions with certain vendors that had a more likely chance of selling  items that would be unauthorized or that would be personal items.   Because of the large number of transactions that met these criteria, we did  not look at all potential abuses of the purchase card. While we identified  some potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or questionable  purchases, our work was not designed to identify, and we cannot  determine, the extent of potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or  questionable purchases.  See appendix I for further details on our scope  and methodology.", "We requested comments from the Secretary of Defense or his designee on a  draft of this report.  We received comments from the Acting Director of the  Army Contracting Agency dated June 17, 2002, and have reprinted those  comments in this report.  We conducted our audit work from June 2001  through April 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards, and we performed our investigative work in  accordance with standards prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on  Integrity and Efficiency, as adapted for GAO\u2019s work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s purchase card program is part of the governmentwide  Commercial Purchase Card Program established to simplify federal agency  acquisition processes by providing a low-cost, efficient vehicle for  obtaining goods and services directly from vendors.  DOD has mandated  the use of the purchase card for all purchases at or below $2,500 and has  authorized the use of the card to pay for specified larger purchases.  DOD  has had significant growth in the program since its inception and estimates  that in fiscal year 2001 about 95 percent of its transactions of $2,500 or less  were made by purchase card.", "The purpose of the program was to simplify the process of making small  purchases.  It accomplished this goal by allowing cardholders to make  micropurchases of $2,500 or less\u2014$25,000 or less for training\u2014without  having to execute contracts.  The government purchase card can also be  used for larger transactions, but they still require contracts.  In these cases,  the Army often refers to the card as a payment card because it pays for an  acquisition made under a legally executed contract.", "The Army uses a combination of governmentwide, DOD, and Army  guidance as the policy and procedural foundation for its purchase card  program.  The Army purchase card program operates under a  governmentwide General Services Administration purchase card contract,  as do the purchase card programs of all federal agencies.   In addition,  government acquisition laws and regulations, such as the Federal  Acquisition Regulation, provide overall governmentwide guidance.  DOD  and the Army have promulgated supplements to these regulations.", "The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics, in cooperation with the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller), has overall responsibility for DOD\u2019s purchase card program.   The DOD Joint Purchase Card Program Management Office, in the office of  the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Logistics and  Technology, is responsible for overseeing DOD\u2019s program.  The Army  agency program coordinator, within the joint office, has oversight over the  Army\u2019s purchase card program.  However, primary management  responsibility for the purchase card program lies with the contracting  offices in the major commands and local installations.  Figure 1 depicts the  Army purchase card program management hierarchy as it was during our  audit work.  For the major commands, the figure shows the number of  installation program coordinators within the command.  For the five  installations we audited, the figure shows the number of approving officials  and cardholders at each installation.", "On May 1, 2002, the Army created an Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of the Army (Procurement) and the U.S. Army Contracting  Agency.  The responsibility for the Army purchase card program and the  DOD Purchase Card Joint Program Management Office will be moved to  the newly created office.

The installation program  coordinator, typically a full-time position under the direction of the director  of the contracting office, is responsible for the day-to-day management,  administration, and oversight of the program.  In our work, we noted that  program coordinators develop local standard operating procedures, issue  and cancel cards, train cardholders and approving officials, and coordinate  with other Army units and the card-issuing bank.  Cardholders\u2014soldiers  and civilian personnel\u2014are to make purchases, maintain supporting  documentation, and reconcile their monthly statements.  Approving  officials, who typically are responsible for more than one cardholder, are to  review cardholders\u2019 transactions and the cardholders\u2019 reconciled  statements and certify the official consolidated bill for payment.

It has not focused on ensuring an adequate  environment for a greatly expanding program.  Instead, Army purchase  card management focused significant attention on maximizing the use of  the purchase card for small purchases and on paying bills quickly to reduce  delinquent payments, and it developed performance measures and goals  for them.  However, purchase card management has not focused equal  attention on internal control, and it has not developed performance  measures to assess the adequacy of internal control activities or set goals  for them.  As a result, our audit identified a weak internal control  environment characterized by a lack of (1) adequate operating procedures  specifying needed program management, oversight, and internal control  activities and (2) oversight by all management levels over the program\u2019s  implementation at the installation level.  These weaknesses are  symptomatic of a purchase card infrastructure that is insufficiently robust  to build and sustain a strong internal control environment.  As discussed in  the next section, strong internal control activities are needed to effectively  manage the Army\u2019s purchase card program and provide reasonable  assurance that the billions of dollars spent under the program adhere to  legal and regulatory requirements.

Instead, the Army relies on  memorandums issued by the DOD and Army purchase card program  offices and procedures issued by major commands and installations.  Our  assessment of the existing Army guidance is that it does not adequately  identify and direct the implementation of needed actions and control  activities.", "The memorandums issued by the DOD and Army purchase card program  offices do not provide the Army purchase card program with a  comprehensive set of policies and operating procedures that identify the  actions and control activities needed to manage the program.  Instead, they  address such topics as cash management of certified purchase card  invoices or suggest best practices, including discussions of the importance  of internal control activities.  Also, the memorandums often only request  that Army commanding officers implement a suggested action; they do not  direct that specific actions be taken within specific time frames.  Such  requests might not achieve the desired results.  For example, an August 3,  2001, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Logistics  and Technology memorandum requested Army units\u2019 assistance and  support in implementing the DOD program office\u2019s earlier request to assess  the adequacy of purchase card program human capital resources.   Because  they are only requests, they do not have to result in action.  For example, in  the example above, we found no evidence that the major commands or  installations had made an assessment of their overall purchase card human  capital resource needs.", "Without agencywide operating procedures, the Army has relied on its major  command and local installation program coordinators to establish  purchase card policies and procedures to guide approving officials,  cardholders, and others involved in the purchase card program as they  implement the program.  The standard operating procedures for the major  commands and installations we audited varied widely, and they were not  adequate.  For example, the Army Materiel Command does not have  standard operating procedures, but uses a Web-based tutorial that is part of  required training to guide cardholders and approving officials.  A training  tutorial does not carry the force of a regulation or a standard operating  procedure.  Consequently, installation program coordinators, such as at the  Soldier, Biological and Chemical Command - Natick, developed standard  operating procedures that set program implementation standards and  requirements at the installation.", "At the installation level, the contrast between three installations illustrates  the differences.  As discussed above, the Soldier, Biological and Chemical  Command \u2013 Natick had a detailed operating procedure that was revised  during our work there to add further detailed instructions.   Fort Benning,  in Columbus, Georgia, did not have installation-level operating procedures.   At Fort Hood, in Killeen, Texas, the installation-level procedures were  supplemented with detailed procedures developed by the military units, for  example, battalions and brigades, located there.  Thus, the procedures at  these three installations differed significantly and within Fort Hood  procedures were different.  Collectively, the Army policy memorandums  and the major command and installation-level operating procedures do not  adequately address key control environment issues.  Among the more  important issues not adequately addressed are   responsibilities and duties of installation-level program coordinators,   controls over the issuance and assessment of ongoing need for cards,  appropriate span of control for approving officials, and  appropriate cardholder spending limits.", "In addition to the above control environment issues, we identified  weaknesses in the individual control activities we tested, which we discuss  in the next section of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Responsibilities and Duties of Installation-Level Program Coordinators", "paragraphs": ["Army guidance has not addressed the scope of responsibilities and specific  duties of installation-level program coordinators, although they are the  primary focal point for managing the purchase card program and generally  spend all their time on the purchase card program.

During our work we noted that program coordinators develop  and enforce operating procedures, establish and cancel cardholder and  approving official accounts, train cardholders and approving officials,  interact with the bank, and field myriad questions about the program from  both cardholders and approving officials.  Yet, the Army does not have  guidance on how to do these activities, and it does not provide program  coordinators with guidance or assistance in developing oversight activities  to monitor how well their programs are functioning.

We found that individual  transaction limits were generally set at the micropurchase maximum of  $2,500.  Installations generally set monthly limits at a generic level, such as  $10,000, $25,000, or $100,000, for most of their cardholders.

However, we found that  refresher training, required by DOD guidance for cardholders and  approving officials every 2 years, was seldom provided at the five  installations we audited.  Program coordinators at every location except  the Texas Army National Guard in Austin, Texas, told us that this training  seldom, if ever, occurred because of inadequate time and human capital  resources.", "While devoting time and resources to establishing cardholders and  approving officials, other important activities were not receiving attention.

Program  coordinators at the five installations have not routinely monitored  potentially abusive transactions.  Their activities in this area were generally  confined to answering cardholder questions about potentially questionable  aspects of proposed purchases and occasionally scanning bank data for  questionable transactions.

Our own data mining efforts, including  our analysis of Army-wide data, shows the usefulness of these techniques  and their potential for identifying transactions that contain indicators of  potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive and questionable  transactions, as we discuss in a later section of this report.", "While cardholders and approving officials are the first line of defense in  preventing purchase card abuse, program coordinator activities become  especially critical if the approving official is not carrying out required  duties.  For example, after noting that we were requesting additional details  on purchases from some questionable vendors, the Fort Benning program  coordinator noticed that a cardholder had purchases from such vendors.   Subsequent investigation of the cardholder revealed potentially fraudulent  purchases totaling $10,748.  The cardholder\u2019s potentially fraudulent  activities were not detected promptly because the approving official had  not been monitoring the cardholder\u2019s purchases or reviewing the monthly  statement.", "Program coordinators, in addition to analyzing questionable transactions,  need to analyze other purchase card data, such as bank status reports on  disputed transactions.  The Fort Hood program coordinator, who was not  effectively monitoring bank status reports on disputed transactions, did not  identify that cardholder inaction beyond the expiration date for disputes  had resulted in the loss of ability to recover funds on previously disputed  charges.  At our suggestion, the coordinator followed up on an unresolved  expired dispute and obtained credit for over $1,000 in returned unordered  merchandise.  Such a recovery demonstrates that a data analysis program  for installation program coordinators can produce savings for taxpayers.", "Canceling accounts for departed cardholders.  None of the program  coordinators at the five installations had focused effective attention on  canceling accounts of departed and unneeded cardholders prior to the  completion of our fieldwork.  Program coordinators can reduce the  government\u2019s exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse by monitoring  cardholder account activity and determining whether issued cards  continue to be required.  If cards are not active and unneeded because of  change in duties or other reassignments, timely cancellations of cards is an  important control.  At all five installations, we identified weaknesses in  their processes for canceling accounts for inactive or unneeded  cardholders, and each location had significant numbers of cards that were  inactive and should have been canceled.", "The most serious problem was when some accounts had not been canceled  even though the cardholder was no longer at the installation or even with  the Army.  Each installation had a policy that the program coordinator be  notified when an account should be canceled, but they were not effective.   Even the existence of processes to identify when a cardholder\u2019s account  should be canceled were not always effective.  For example, the Soldier,  Biological and Chemical Command - Natick had developed a process to  terminate the purchase card when the cardholder departed.

Therefore, the cards should have been terminated.

As  identified later in this report, failure to terminate cards of reassigned  cardholders can result in potentially fraudulent transactions.", "The problem at Fort Hood was exacerbated by the high turnover of active  duty military personnel rotating to and from the installation\u2014Fort Hood  military personnel statistics show that about 1,600 soldiers depart the  installation monthly.  The personnel office managing the transfers of  military personnel had established checklist procedures to cancel  government travel cards held by departing employees, but did not have  similar procedures for canceling purchase cards.  They said that the  procedure was not established because the social security numbers of  cardholders are not provided for computerized matching to the social  security numbers of departing soldiers.  Fort Hood\u2019s purchase card  program office agreed to review records and cancel cards for reassigned  personnel and to identify workaround procedures to ensure that cards of  departed personnel were terminated.

Since that  time, the Navy reports that it has reduced its total active cards from about  58,000 to about 26,000.  With the Army\u2019s lack of guidance to installations on  controlling the issuance of cards and on reassessing the need for  outstanding cards, the Army should also have opportunities to reduce its  reported 109,000 active cards.

Approval of a purchase can range from a blanket  approval for routine small dollar purchases of items such as office supplies  to a one-time written approval for specific large dollar items.

Recording these items in the  property records is an important step to ensure accountability and financial  control over these assets and, along with periodic inventory, to prevent  theft or improper use of government property.", "At each of the five installations we visited, we found that accountable items  acquired by purchase cards were not recorded in property records.    In  addition, officials at four of the five installations could not readily locate  property items.  While some of the items were located after considerable  searching, others such as computers and printers were not.  Some or all of  the items might, in fact, be at the installation; however, without positive  assurance, there is substantial risk that items were converted to personal  use or sold.  Property items not recorded in the property books and not  found demonstrate a weak control environment and problems with the  property management system.  Table 7 shows the results of our work.", "Effectively managing accountable property has long been a problem area  and the use of the purchase card has added further difficulties.  With over  100,000 army cardholders, the number of people buying accountable  property has greatly expanded.  Cardholders are responsible for reporting  on the accountable property they buy so that it is recorded in the  installation\u2019s accountable property, but they often do not.  For example,  property book officers at Fort Hood and the Texas Army National Guard  told us that a major problem with property bought in a purchase card  transaction is that cardholders do not properly notify property book  officers and/or provide documentation supporting the purchases.  At Fort  Hood, cardholders are required by the installation\u2019s purchase card  procedures to obtain transaction document numbers for purchases of  equipment items prior to making the purchases, but the requirement is  frequently ignored.  Further, we noted that the installations we audited  generally did not record items such as memorabilia like pictures of famous  people and framed jerseys of sports stars.  Some of these items cost  hundreds of dollars and are pilferable and desirable items.", "Because of its long-standing problems, property management has been the  subject of internal audits at the installations we audited.  At the Soldier,  Biological and Chemical Command - Natick, as a result of an internal audit  of property accountability, the logistics office had worked for over a year to  improve its management of accountable property.  We believe that the  attention focused on accountable property management was the reason  that the installation had the best result in our audit.", "Others had not done so well in correcting their problems.  A Fort Benning  internal audit completed in April 2001 found that 84 percent of the  accountable items purchased with a purchase card had not been recorded  on the property book.  An ongoing internal audit by the Texas Army  National Guard was finding similar property accountability problems.  At  Eisenhower Army Medical Center, an evaluation of the center\u2019s logistics  operations estimated that $2 million to $5 million of accountable property  acquired with the purchase card was not on the center\u2019s property books.", "Cardholders have little incentive to undertake the required coordination  and reporting on property items because of the additional work involved.   Our work showed that items received centrally by logistics officials are  more likely to be recorded on the property books.  Thus, central receiving  appears to help mitigate against cardholders not assuring accountable  property is recorded and may be worth pursuing across the board or for  certain asset types.  In addition, we believe that robust monitoring and  oversight activities of the purchase card program that include examining  how well cardholders are fulfilling their property management  responsibilities could help improve property management related to the  purchase card program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retaining Purchase Card Records", "paragraphs": ["Internal control and all transactions and other significant events need to be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily available for examination ...

At Eisenhower Army  Medical Center, a replacement cardholder destroyed the departed  cardholder\u2019s files because the office had little room to store old files and  the new cardholders did not see the need to store someone else\u2019s files.   In  some cases, we were told that the departed cardholders took the records  with them to their new installations.  In other cases, the records were lost  when units were deployed.

The  replacement cardholder told us that the purchases were probably for a unit  party, but the timing of the purchases along with missing documentation  does not allow ruling out the possibility that items may have been bought  for personal use.

The  cardholder believed that the alternate approving official would certify  the statement for payment without reviewing the transactions or their  documentation.  With this belief, the cardholder purchased a computer,  purses, rings, and clothing.  These fraudulent transactions were not  discovered until the resource manager who monitored the unit\u2019s budget  noticed a large increase in spending by the cardholder.  The cardholder  had destroyed all documentation for the 3-month period during which  these transactions took place.

The provost  marshal\u2019s office, after our March 2002 inquiry about the $630  transaction, investigated it and other suspicious charges by the  cardholder.  The investigators could not get an invoice from the vendor.   Their investigations revealed no other fraudulent, improper, or abusive  and questionable transactions.  They determined that for a short period,  the cardholder was also serving as the billing official and that it was  during this period that the fraudulent transaction with the escort service  occurred.

Another type was split purchases in which the  cardholder circumvents cardholder single purchase limits.  The Federal  Acquisition Regulation guidelines prohibit splitting purchase  requirements into more than one transaction to avoid the need to obtain  competitive bids on purchases over the $2,500 micropurchase threshold or  to circumvent higher single transaction limits for payments on deliverables  under requirements contracts.  The third type was purchases from an  improper source.  Various federal laws and regulations require  procurement officials to acquire certain products from designated sources  such as the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD) vendors.  The program  created by this act is a mandatory source of supply for all federal entities.

We  identified most of them as part of our Army-wide data mining of  transactions with questionable vendors although several were identified as  part of our work at the five audited installations.", "The following examples of the improper transactions illustrate of the type  of cases included in table 9.", "We identified purchases of clothing by Soldier, Biological and Chemical  Command \u2013 Natick that should not have been purchased with  appropriated funds.

Further, according to a Comptroller General decision dated March 6, 1984, clothing purchased pursuant to this statute is property  of the U.S. government and may only be used for official government  business.  Thus, clothing purchases, except for rare circumstances in  which the purchase meets stringent requirements, is usually considered  a personal item for which appropriated funds should not be used.  In  one transaction, a cardholder had purchased 10 L.L. Bean Gore-Tex  parkas at a total cost of about $2,400 for employees who worked outside  in cold weather.  These parkas were not specialty items, and they were  not used solely for official use.  The employees were allowed to take the  parkas home and wear them in off-duty hours.", "In another example of clothing for personal use from our Army-wide  data mining, several charges for amounts from $330 to $770 were  identified at Macy\u2019s and Hecht\u2019s.  We were informed that these were for  purchases of civilian clothes for enlisted personnel who are serving as  assistants to general officers.  We were informed by the Director,  Purchase Card Unit, Defense Contracting Command Washington, that  this appears to be a fairly widespread practice and that the practice is  clearly improper and is believed to violate fiscal law.", "As part of our data mining of Army-wide purchase card transactions, we  identified a questionable transaction, which a subsequent investigation  determined that a cardholder purchased a Bose radio for $523 to use in  his office.  The radio was clearly for his personal use in his office;  therefore, it should not have been purchased with the Army purchase  card.  The employee was required to reimburse the U.S. Treasury for the  cost of the radio.  A broader review of the purchases made by this  cardholder\u2019s unit revealed other problems similar to those we identified  in our work such as property accountability, not purchasing from  mandatory sources, purchases at excessive costs, and missing records.   As with our other work, these problems indicate that approving officials  were not adequately reviewing cardholder transactions.", "In our Army-wide data mining we identified charges by two cardholders  under one approving official of about $7,600 at the Opryland Hotel in  Nashville, Tennessee, in November 2000.  In response to our inquiry, we  were told that these charges were unexpected and resulted from the  Chief Information Officer\u2019s Management Conference at the hotel in  August 2000.  The charges were unexpected because registration fees  were to cover all charges.  After a large bill of over $20,000 was  eventually reduced to about $7,600, the supervisor instructed the  cardholders to pay the additional charges with their purchase cards.   However, to pay the $7,600 in charges of less than $2,500 and avoid  obvious split purchases, the bill was split into segments and divided  between two cardholders.  The amounts paid were $2,500 for long- distance phone calls, $934 for phone line hookup, $2,500 for meeting  room rental, and $1,715 for audio visual services.  However, because  separate invoices for the charges do not exist, the officials can neither  support the correct amount of any charges nor support that the charges  are for purposes permitted by law, regulation, or policy.", "Fort Hood paid improper and excessive cell phone charges because no  one was monitoring them.   The information management division\u2019s  approving official certified the installation\u2019s consolidated monthly  charges for payment for over 1,100 cell phones and over $50,000  monthly time charges without reviewing the usage.  While local  procedures require the units using the cell phones to verify their own  monthly usage, the procedures do not address how and when this is to  be done.  We found that some units had not routinely verified the  charges.  Others, who said they usually did verify their charges, could  not for the period November 2001 through March 2002 because a change  in the phone company\u2019s billing processes did not allow the units to have  access to their monthly charges.  Without reviewing the charges, the  Army has no assurance that charges are proper and not excessive.  We  reviewed current usage and identified excessive monthly time charges  and charges for phones that had no monthly usage.  For example, one  cell phone user, who had a $79.95 per month plan that allowed 650  minutes of airtime, used 3,400, 2,696, and 1,915 minutes during a 3- month period and incurred time charges of $1,040, $795, and $523.  Fort  Hood officials told us that improper and excessive charges occur  because units do not have the appropriate monthly plan.  In the above  example, the unit could have reduced its costs to $550, $374, and $200\u2014 a 52 percent savings\u2014with an appropriate plan.  Fort Hood officials also  told us that excessive costs occur because of personal use.

In addition, internal auditors at four of the installations  identified split purchases as a continuing problem.  In some of these  instances, the cardholder\u2019s purchases exceeded the $2,500 limit, and the  cardholder \u201csplit\u201d the purchase into two or more transactions of $2,500 or  less.  For example, in our Army-wide data mining, we identified a series of  split purchases at Fort Stewart, Georgia.

These purchases included elegant desks,  chairs, and a conference table.", "We also identified numerous cases where the Army is making repetitive  micropurchases to meet requirements that in total greatly exceed the  micropurchase limit.  While some repetitive purchases might not clearly be  split purchases, the Army is not taking advantage of a mechanism designed  to foster lower prices for repetitive acquisitions of similar items over an  extended period.  Section 13.303-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  provides for blanket purchase agreements as a \u201csimplified method of filling  anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services.\u201d  Use of a blanket  purchase agreement, rather than repetitive, individual micropurchases,  could lower per unit prices for the goods or services acquired.  Below we  discuss four situations in which blanket purchase orders should have been  used.", "At the Soldier, Biological and Chemical Command \u2013 Natick, the public  works department routinely used the same vendors 35 times to provide  and install carpeting, 25 times to provide heating and air conditioning  services, and 39 times to provide graphic display services.  Although  each of the transactions for these vendors was under the micropurchase  limit, the total purchases for fiscal year 2001 were about $38,000,  $44,000, $77,000, respectively.  However, the installation did not have a  blanket purchase agreement with the vendors.  In these instances the  public works department officials had not recognized they needed such  a contract, and they agreed to pursue one.  We noted that the installation  had blanket purchase agreements for other similar circumstances that  the internal auditor identified.", "At the Texas Army National Guard, the Occupational Health Office used  purchase cards to pay for routine medical examinations and to buy  ergonomic chairs and safety glasses for employees.  While the individual  cost for purchases were much less than the micropurchase limit, the  total annual cost significantly exceeds the limit.  For instance, the office  paid over $80,000 for about 705 examinations at a dozen clinics and  hospitals throughout the state in the first 10 months of fiscal year 2001.   The guard also used purchase cards to pay for meals provided troops  while they attended mandatory weekend drills or training.  While the  individual cost for any single guard unit\u2019s training meal would rarely  exceed the single-purchase $2,500 limit, the total recurring cost of the  meals is one of the guard\u2019s largest annual expenses\u2014over $500,000 in  the first 10 months of fiscal year 2001.", "At Fort Benning, the Dismounted Battlespace Battle Lab, a combat  training unit, routinely purchased doors that were destroyed during  training exercises to instruct troops how to enter a building that may  contain an enemy.  The battle lab spent $111,721 in 84 transactions with  one vendor to buy doors during a 10-month period in fiscal year 2001,  but the unit did not have a blanket purchase agreement.  In this case,  battle lab officials had refused attempts by the Fort Benning contracting  division and purchase card program coordinator to execute an  agreement.  We found that the battle lab also needed a contract for the  numerous computer modems it purchased.  Further, in these purchases,  the battle lab cardholder\u2019s purchasing pattern was to split purchases to  avoid the micropurchase limit of $2,500.  We saw numerous instances in  which the cardholder made more than one purchase near the limit for  the same item over a short period.", "In a data-mining example, the Army Personnel Command made  repetitive buys of interment flag cases from the same vendor.

We  also noted that some cardholders did not know their responsibilities or the  requirements, despite the fact that these requirements are a primary  emphasis during cardholder training programs.  For example, some said  that they had not heard of JWOD or either of the institutes that cardholders  should use.   As further evidence of cardholders\u2019 noncompliance with this  mandatory source requirement, the Director of Sales for the National  Industries for the Blind told us about large decreases in sales of JWOD  products at Fort Hood and other Army installations over the past 2 years  because cardholders were purchasing from commercial firms rather than  buying the mandatory products.", "The following two examples involving Franklin Covey illustrate the  situations we found.", "In our data mining work, we identified a cardholder at Tooele Army  Depot who made 10 purchases for a total of about $11,900 from Franklin  Covey, with most of the purchases in August 2001.  These purchases  were primarily for inserts to day planners, an item that is available from  the JWOD catalog.  In response to our questions as to why the  mandatory source was not used, we were advised that (1) in the past  JWOD planners were not used by the self-service store\u2019s customers  because they did not include pages with dates for each day and (2) under an interpretation that is now recognized to be in error, the  purchases were made from another source under the premise that  planners from JWOD did not meet customer needs.  We were informed  that future purchases of planners would be in one purchase through  JWOD.", "In another case, a unit spent $3,100 over an 18-month period to purchase  day planners from Franklin Covey.

For  questionable items, we concluded that cardholders purchased items for  which there was not a reasonable and/or documented justification.", "Questionable purchases often do not easily fit within generic  governmentwide guidelines on purchases that are acceptable for the  purchase card program.  They tend to raise questions about their  reasonableness.  Many, such as gym quality exercise equipment, are  common Army\u2014and DOD\u2014purchases because the Army must provide  more than merely a work environment for its soldiers.  However, others,  like the fine china purchased for the culinary arts team competition  discussed below, clearly raise questions about whether they are  appropriate purchases.  Precisely because these types of purchases tend to  raise questions and subject the Army to criticism, they require a higher  level of prepurchase review and documentation than other purchases.   These types of purchases raise questions that go beyond the confines of the  purchase card program.", "When we examined purchases that raised these types of questions, we  usually did not find evidence of prepurchase justification.  In attempting to  justify whether purchases were acceptable, improper, or abusive, program  coordinators, approving officials, and cardholders often provided an after- the-fact rationale for the purchases.  We believe that these types of  questionable purchases require scrutiny before the purchase, not after.   Table 10 identifies examples of these types of purchases.", "To understand more fully the nature of potentially questionable purchases,  we selected six of the examples above to explain in more detail below.", "Palm Pilots for Pentagon officials.  In February 2001, two purchases for  a total of 80 Palm Pilots at a total cost of $30,000 were made for the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics.   Two questions about this purchase are whether a valid  need had been identified for the purchase and whether the urgency of  the purchase justified the purchase from a vendor that could deliver  immediately but was charging $1,540 more than the lowest competitor.   No documentation was available to show how the office had determined  that 80 Palm Pilots were a valid government requirement.  An e-mail  related to the purchase suggested that there was a need \u201cto get enough  goodies for everyone.\u201d  The documentation also suggested that the items  were being ordered for inventory and would be issued to personnel  when requested.  This does not indicate a predetermined requirement  and does not appear to support that the requirement was urgent, as the  office determined.  Based on the determination of urgency, the price  paid was $1,540 more than the lowest competitor\u2019s price so that delivery  could be immediate.", "Culinary arts.  At Fort Hood and during our Army-wide data mining  effort, we noted several purchases for various culinary arts events.   Among the purchases were fine china and crystal from Royal Doulton  and Lenox.  Other purchases were for accessories such as a rotating  lighted ice-carving pedestal.  Although participation in culinary arts  team events is an approved Army activity, the transactions we examined  and inquired about did not have a documentation of the need for the  specific items purchased.  Although the transactions we examined  totaled about $3,800, we believe that the total cost of such purchases  Army-wide is far more.  We were told that purchases of culinary arts  accessories are common throughout the Army.  One reason, we were  told, is because most installations have culinary arts teams that attend  competitions involving the use of expensive accessories and fine crystal  and china.", "Sunglasses for the Golden Nights parachute team.  In February 2001, a  cardholder purchased 30 pair of sunglasses from Sunglass Hut at about  $100 each for a net cost of $2,450\u2014some glasses were returned for  credit from a prior purchase\u2014for the Golden Knights.  In response to  our inquiry about this purchase, we were told that it was not  preapproved and that sunglasses were authorized in the common table  of allowances when they are needed for training.  However, because  goggles are worn during parachute jumps, not sunglasses, we believe  these purchases were personal use items and thus of questionable  government need.  The approving official for the transaction believed  that the purchase was appropriate.  According to the official, the  parachute team has 85 members and the purchase was for new  members.", "Tree for Earth Day.  The Environmental, Safety and Health Office at the  Soldier, Biological and Chemical Command \u2013 Natick bought a $2,250  tree to plant in celebration of Earth Day.  Although this transaction did  not have documented approval prior to purchase or a documented  justification for its need, we were told that the tree was purchased for  the commanding general to plant among a grove of other trees between  two installation buildings during an Earth Day celebration.  While  planting a tree for Earth Day may be an acceptable expenditure of  government funds, we believe the expenditure of over $2,200 for a tree  is an excessive cost.", "Cigars.  In April 2001 a cardholder at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii  purchased three boxes of Hula Girl Cigars for $300.  According to  information provided in response to our inquiry about the purchase, the  cardholder bought the cigars for gifts to VIPs to be presented by the  Commanding General, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks,  during deployment on an exercise in Thailand.  The purchaser was an  acting protocol officer during a changeover in officers and did not have  an approving official reviewing the purchases.  No documentation was  available from the Army to demonstrate that this purchase was a valid  government need.  The current Chief of Protocol said that no other  cigars had been purchased.", "Wine.  A cardholder purchased two cases of wine on September 20,  2001, from the Naked Mountain Vineyard.  After we questioned this  purchase, the Army concluded that the cardholder had used the wrong  card to purchase the wine, but it had corrected the error to put the  purchase in the correct accounting classification.  An Army official  assured us that the purchase was appropriately authorized by  \u201ccompetent authority in the course of execution of a highly classified,  compartmented program.\u201d  We were provided no evidence that this  purchase was a valid government need."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We support the use of a well-controlled purchase card program.

Such an environment is an important counterbalance to the  increased risk of potentially fraudulent and wasteful spending that results  from the rapidly expanding use of the purchase card.  The Army now  spends billions of dollars through a purchase card program for which  internal control is not adequate and for which appropriate management  oversight does not exist.  The Army needs to ensure that installation-level  program coordinators, the primary program management officials, have the  tools to develop local control systems and oversight activities.   Strengthening the control environment will require a renewed focus on,  and commitment to, building a robust purchase card infrastructure.

For the Army, we performed work in the major commands that  have the largest purchase card programs, accounting in fiscal year 2001 for  about 66 percent of total Army purchases and about 62 percent of total  Army transactions.  We conducted detailed work at the following major  commands and installations.", "At the Army and major command levels we evaluated the policies and  procedures used to guide the purchase card program, and we evaluated the  activities they engage in to oversee the program.  At the installation level,  we used a case study approach to evaluate the local purchase card  program, and our work there consisted of three major segments.  We  evaluated the overall control environment, including the adequacy of the  Army\u2019s policies and procedures.  We evaluated the implementation of key  internal control activities at the installations.  Finally, we identified  evidence of potentially fraudulent, improper, or abusive or questionable  transactions at each audited installation and conducted limited follow-up.", "To assess the control environment, we examined the installations\u2019 policies  and procedures and oversight activities.

With these statistically valid probability samples, each  transaction in the five installations\u2019 populations had a nonzero probability  of being included, and that probability could be computed for any  transaction.  Within each installation we stratified the population of  transactions by the dollar value of the transaction and by whether the  transaction was likely to be for a purchase of computer-related equipment.   Each sample transaction in an installation was subsequently weighted in  the analysis to account statistically for all the transactions in the  population of that installation, including those that were not selected.", "For each transaction sampled, we tested whether key internal control  activities had been performed.  For each control activity tested, we  projected an estimate of the percent of transactions for which the control  activity was not performed, for each installation.

Our data mining  included identifying transactions with certain vendors that had a more  likely chance of selling items that would be unauthorized or that would be  personal items.  For a small number of these transactions at each of the five  installations and from the Army-wide database, we requested limited  documentation, usually the supporting invoice, that could provide  additional indications as to whether the transactions were potentially  fraudulent, improper, and abusive or questionable.
