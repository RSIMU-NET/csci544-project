Without such a framework, the program risks losing its current momentum and failing to meet new language-training needs that SOF personnel are likely to acquire as they take on expanded roles in combating terrorism and other military operations. The SOF foreign language program continues to face challenges, such as more frequent and longer deployments, that limit personnel's access to language training. Army Reserve and National Guard SOF members face additional difficulties in gaining access to centrally located training because of geographical dispersion and part-time status; they also have lower monetary incentives to acquire language proficiencies and fewer training opportunities. As a result, most SOF personnel have been unable to take needed training or required tests to qualify in their respective language(s).

The entire military  has faced shortfalls in language capability in recent operations, such as  difficulties in finding sufficient numbers of qualified language speakers  during peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and combat actions in  Afghanistan. In recent reports, we have stated that shortages of staff with  foreign language skills have affected agency operations and have hindered  U.S. military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and  diplomatic efforts.", "The U.S. Special Operations Command faces similar challenges in  managing its SOF language training to maintain sufficient language  capability to support its missions. For example, (1) it is common for SOF  personnel to have received language training in more than three languages  during their career; (2) SOF units often operate in geographic regions  where there are numerous languages, (3) high operational demands and  force structure limitations often require SOF personnel to operate in areas  where their specific foreign language(s) are not spoken, and (4) it is  difficult to determine the right languages and personnel mix to address a  wide variety of unknown and hard-to-forecast small-scale conflicts.", "The U.S. Special Operations Command established its SOF Foreign  Language Program in 1993 to provide combatant commanders with SOF  individuals and units that have the required foreign language proficiency  to meet current and future operational requirements.

For example, the Army\u2019s Special Forces units  (active-duty and National Guard), which account for about half of the  Army personnel with a language requirement, generally need only a limited  command of the language for immediate survival needs. Personnel who  conduct psychological operations, foreign internal defense, and civil  affairs missions generally need higher proficiency skills because of their  greater contact and interaction with local civilians and military personnel.

If this figure  remains the same each year, the total cost of the 5-year contract is  projected to be about $30 million. A SOFLO official said that the total  amount could be higher if SOF service components utilize more of the  contract\u2019s language services. This could happen as the service components  and their units become more familiar with the contract services and as  more SOF personnel return from current deployments and are able to  access language training. The official also said that some costs are higher  than those in prior contracts for such language-training services as total  immersion, in which students practice a language while living in another  country or in a language-controlled isolated environment.

In recent years, both active-duty  and reserve/guard SOF personnel have had less time for overall training  because they have been deployed more frequently and for longer periods  of time. In addition, when they have had time to train, their language  training has often competed with other higher-priority training needs, such  as marksmanship or nuclear-biological-chemical training. As a result, they  have often been unable to complete the necessary language training to  reach required proficiencies and to take the necessary tests to qualify in  their respective language(s).", "Furthermore, Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers, who make up  more than half of the total number of SOF personnel requiring language  proficiency,face additional hurdles in finding time and gaining access to  language training. These soldiers are spread across 28 states and are often  located at long distances from their unit\u2019s facilities, making it difficult to  get to centrally located training resources. In addition, they have fewer  days available for training because of their part-time status.", "Moreover, because of their part-time status, Army Reserve and National  Guard soldiers have lower monetary incentives to undertake language  training than do active-duty personnel.

By contrast, Army Reserve and National Guard personnel get  $13.33 each month if they attain the same proficiency because their  proficiency pay is prorated according to the number of days they train.Many of the more than 50 Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers we  spoke with said that, despite the hurdles, they often undertake language  training on their own time because of the value they place on foreign  language skills in conducting their missions. They added that higher  proficiency pay allowances would give them more incentive to study  language and improve their proficiencies. In its May 2002 report, DOD\u2019s  Ninth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation recommended that  the services be authorized to pay their reserve and guard members the  same monthly amount as active-duty members for maintaining proficiency  in designated critical languages in order to provide consistency in the  application of special pay between reserve and active-duty members.", "Additionally, a SOFLO official told us that current pay and allowancefunding levels for Army Reserve and National Guard units do not allow  units to send more soldiers to language courses at the command\u2019s  language schools and unit programs and Defense Language Institute.

The official said, however, that these proficiency pay and funding  issues are not limited to foreign language training but are broader DOD  issues that affect reserve and guard personnel throughout the military.", "These access constraints have prevented large numbers of SOF  personnel from getting the necessary training (both initial and sustainment  training) and taking the annual tests that are necessary to qualify in their  language(s). As table 2 shows, for the quarter ending in March 2003,  more than 11,200 SOF personnel, or 93 percent of the 12,116 of those who  had a language requirement, needed to take either initial or sustainment  training. According to a SOFLO official, these statistics may be higher  than usual because of recent deployments to the Middle East and because  of some administrative underreporting. Earlier quarters in 2002 show that  about 75 percent of SOF personnel required training. As table 2 also  indicates, most of the training needs for Navy SOF personnel were for  initial language acquisition (83 percent of 1,128), while for Army and  Air Force SOF members, the training needs were primarily for sustainment  (85 and 64 percent, respectively).", "In reflection of this trend, the number of SOF personnel who have taken a  proficiency test and have qualified in their respective language(s) within  the last 12 months is low.

This percentage  decreased in the subsequent quarters. While acknowledging some  administrative underreporting of data, a SOFLO official attributed the low  qualification levels to the longer and more frequent deployments that  hinder SOF personnel from getting the training they need to take and pass  the language tests.

While most SOF  personnel qualify in their languages by taking the Defense Language  Proficiency Test, an Oral Proficiency Interview can also be used when the  Defense Language Proficiency Test is not available in a given language.  The SOFLO official stated that SOF prefers the oral test when it can be  used because of the importance placed on verbal skills in conducting  SOF missions. However, the certified oral testers, who are normally  members of the Defense Language Institute\u2019s teaching staff, are sometimes  unavailable because they are teaching or doing other primary duties.  Coordinating the schedules of the institute\u2019s staff and the SOF members  to conduct the tests is also difficult. For example, while reserve and guard  members are primarily available to take the tests on weekends during their  unit\u2019s drill time, it is not always possible for the institute to schedule the  two testers that are required to administer the test in a given language  during that same time.

While the new B.I.B. contract  provides additional flexibility and training options, it focuses primarily  on traditional methods of delivering language training, such as classroom  training, one-on-one tutoring, and total-immersion training. This type  of live, person-to-person instruction is the preferred method for most  language learning.

At the forefront of the recent actions is a  major shift in the way that the program provides language training for  active-duty, reserve, and guard SOF personnel in the Army, Navy, and  Air Force. Rather than using multiple contractors, the command has  consolidated all of the training under a single contractor to provide a  standardized curriculum and standardized training materials, more flexible  delivery mechanisms, and consistent monitoring of student and teacher  performance. These ongoing management actions address a wide range  of issues, including the need for more coordination and communication  within the program, the creation of a database to track language  proficiencies and training requirements, and better utilization of other  national language assets. However, because the program has not yet  issued a strategy and developed the necessary strategic-planning tools  (a strategic plan with an associated performance plan and reports) to  carry it out, the value and impact of these disparate actions on the  program as a whole is difficult to evaluate. As a first step, the command  could issue a strategy for meeting SOF language requirements to establish  its vision for language training across the command. As a second step, the  command could use the strategic vision to develop necessary strategic  planning tools to guide the program in the future. Such strategic planning  with the support of top leadership would allow the program to determine  what actions are needed to meet its overall goals and objectives; ensure  that these actions are well integrated with each other; identify key target  dates, priorities, and the resources needed to undertake them; develop  performance measures to assess their progress and effectiveness; identify  corrective actions; and better manage risk. It also should be aligned with  DOD\u2019s overall human capital efforts to more effectively address its  personnel challenges. Without a cohesive management framework based  on strategic planning, the program risks losing the momentum it has  achieved so far and risk failing to meet the growing needs of special  operations forces for increasingly critical foreign language skills.", "Despite continuing challenges in accessing training, the development of  distance/distributive learning promises to offer SOF personnel greater  access to language resources. While SOF personnel are often unable to  take advantage of traditional, instructor-based language training because  of long deployments and geographical dispersion, they could benefit from  distance/distributive-training approaches that offer more flexibility and  accessibility to language training, including on-demand, \u201canytime,  anywhere\u201d options. The use of distance/distributive learning would also  provide a good complement to the training services offered by the  command\u2019s new contract. The command has an opportunity to support  several promising DOD distance/distributive-learning initiatives under way  with participation and resources. Also, DOD could consider expanding  the use and availability of oral proficiency interview testing to provide  additional opportunities for SOF personnel to test and qualify each year  in their respective language(s). DOD could also consider changing the  amount paid to Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers for foreign  language proficiency to provide additional incentive for them to maintain  and improve their language skills and provide more pay and allowance  funds for these soldiers to allow more to attend language schools and  pursue other venues for language training. Such changes might be a way to  provide greater assurance that Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers  take advantage of current language training and training that becomes  available through the use of distance/distributive learning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen the management and delivery of foreign language training  for special operations forces, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command to adopt a strategy for meeting special operations forces\u2019 foreign language  requirements and develop the necessary strategic-planning tools (a  strategic plan with associated performance plan and reports) to use in  managing and assessing the progress of its foreign language program and  to better address future human capital challenges and  incorporate distance/distributive-learning approaches into the program to  improve the special operations forces\u2019 access to language training, and if  additional resources are required, to request them.", "In addition, the Secretary of Defense should evaluate current (1) foreign  language proficiency pay rates and (2) pay and allowance funding levels  for Army Reserve and National Guard personnel to determine if changes  are needed to provide them with a greater incentive to undertake language  study and allow for more personnel to attend language schools and other  training venues.
