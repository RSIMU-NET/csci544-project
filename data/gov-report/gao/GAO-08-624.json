In recent years, PBGC's projected financial liabilities and workloads have increased greatly due to a large number of pension plan terminations. Given this, it is important that PBGC remain well positioned to fulfill its promise to those retirees who depend on it. GAO was asked to report on (1) PBGC's recent experience in hiring and retaining key staff and how it compares to other federal agencies and (2) the actions PBGC has taken to strategically hire and retain key staff and what additional steps, if any, can be taken. To do this, we analyzed PBGC's workforce by using the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Central Personnel Data File to identify data and compared those data to data from other federal agencies.

However, PBGC has had some difficulty with hiring and retaining staff for specific occupations and positions, including executives and senior financial analysts. Despite the general ability to hire and retain key staff, data also suggest that PBGC may be faced with workforce challenges; these include managing a workforce with relatively few years of federal experience, the prospect of nearly one-quarter of its key staff retiring within the next 4 years, and difficulty hiring and retaining key staff in the future due to PBGC's existing compensation structure, which offers salaries lower than some federal agencies that employ similar staff, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. While PBGC is making progress in its human capital management approachby taking steps to improve its human capital planning and practices--such as drafting a succession management plan--the corporation lacks a formal, comprehensive human capital plan that integrates several critical components such as workforce planning. Also, even though it collects workforce data, PBGC has not routinely and systematically targeted and analyzed all necessary workforce data--such as attrition rates, occupational skills mix, and trends--to understand its current and future workforce needs. Instead, officials stated that they generally reacted to management personnel requests, and developed human capital data as needed. In addition to limited planning and data analysis, PBGC has not fully explored all available compensation options under its existing statutory authority, even though officials say and data suggest that the corporation's current compensation structure may limit its ability to hire and retain certain key staff."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures the pensions  of 44 million private sector workers and retirees in over 30,000 employer- sponsored pension plans. Established with the passage of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), PBGC employs over 800  federal employees and utilizes the services of some 1,500 private sector  employees working for the corporation under various contracts. These  individuals support, in part, the corporation\u2019s timely and uninterrupted  payment of pension benefits to thousands of Americans. PBGC\u2019s financial  portfolio is one of the largest of any federal government corporation\u2014in  September 2007, its assets totaled almost $70 billion. Since fiscal year  2000, the number of participants to whom PBGC has paid benefits has  more than doubled and PBGC\u2019s projected financial liabilities have  increased significantly due to a large number of companies terminating  their pension plans.", "Although PBGC has taken steps to address its projected financial  liabilities, the accumulated large and growing deficits resulting from the  termination of several large plans in recent years continue to threaten  PBGC\u2019s solvency. In prior GAO work, we have highlighted how these  losses may have significant implications for retirement security and the  federal budget. In fact, in 2003, we added PBGC\u2019s single-employer pension  insurance program\u2014its largest insurance program\u2014to our high-risk list, a  group of federal programs that need urgent attention and transformation.  PBGC\u2019s single-employer insurance program remains on the high-risk list  today.

Governmentwide, many federal agencies have lacked a  strategic approach that integrates their human capital efforts with their  mission and program goals; therefore, we have also placed the area of  strategic human capital management on our high-risk list. On the basis of  these concerns, we were asked to review PBGC\u2019s human capital approach  to recruiting and retaining its federal workforce. Specifically, this report  assesses (1) PBGC\u2019s recent experience in hiring and retaining key staff and  how it compares to that of other federal agencies and (2) what actions  PBGC has taken to strategically hire and retain key staff and what  additional steps, if any, can be taken.", "To determine PBGC\u2019s recent experience in hiring and retaining staff, we  consulted with PBGC executives and human capital officials to identify  the key occupations critical to conducting its organizational mission. On  the basis of these discussions and in conjunction with a 2002 PBGC  workforce planning team report, it was agreed with PBGC officials that we  would focus on seven occupations\u2014accountants, actuaries, attorneys,  auditors, financial analysts, information technology specialists, and  pension law specialists. To identify trends in PBGC\u2019s hiring, we analyzed  data from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Central Personnel Data  File (CPDF) on PBGC\u2019s key occupations from fiscal year 2000 to 2007 and  compared that information with that of the rest of the federal government  during the same time period. We determined that the CPDF data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To identify what  actions PBGC has taken to strategically hire and retain staff in key  occupations, we reviewed previous GAO work on strategic human capital  management, PBGC\u2019s insurance programs, and the corporation\u2019s  management challenges.", "We also reviewed information on PBGC\u2019s organizational objectives and  succession planning goals from PBGC documents, such as annual reports  and workforce and succession documents. For both objectives, we  interviewed officials from PBGC, the Department of Labor (DOL),  representatives of PBGC\u2019s board of directors, as well as officials from  Office of Personnel Management (OPM). As part of our work, we  coordinated with OPM on a concurrent review of PBGC human capital  operations. At the time of our review, OPM officials confirmed they were  finalizing a PBGC Human Resource Operations Evaluation. While OPM\u2019s  review covered certain aspects of strategic human capital management,  OPM\u2019s review also focused on specific human capital programs, such as  competitive examining. OPM officials stated they would be presenting  findings and working with PBGC on corrective measures to improve the  corporation\u2019s human capital program.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2007 to June 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. Appendix I discusses our scope and  methodology in further detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Congress passed ERISA to protect the interests of participants and  beneficiaries of private sector employee benefit plans. Before the  enactment of ERISA, few rules governed the funding of defined benefit  pension plans, and participants had no guarantee that they would receive  promised benefits. Title IV of ERISA created PBGC to insure private sector  plan participants\u2019 benefits. PBGC receives no funds from general tax  revenues. Instead, operations are financed by insurance premiums set by  Congress and paid by sponsors of defined benefit plans, investment  income, assets from pension plans trusteed by PBGC, and recoveries from  the companies formerly responsible for the plans.", "Since its inception, PBGC\u2019s workloads have increased significantly. In  fiscal year 1975, PBGC administered three pension plans covering a total  of 400 participants. By fiscal year 2007, PBGC administered almost 3,800  pension plans, incurring responsibility for more than 1.3 million  participants. To service this increased workload, PBGC employed 847  federal employees in fiscal year 2007 working across several divisions. Of  the 847, PBGC\u2019s key staff totaled 486, of which approximately 10 percent  were attorneys, 7.2 percent were accountants, and 3.4 percent were  financial analysts (see table 1).", "PBGC also relies heavily on the services of a variety of private sector  contractors to assist in its mission. As of June 2007, these contractors  accounted for 64 percent of PBGC\u2019s total workforce. In fiscal year 2007,  PBGC reportedly spent $297 million (75 percent) of its $398.3 million  operating budget for contracting and related expenses. In addition to  operating PBGC\u2019s 10 field benefit administration offices throughout the  country, private sector contractors supplement federal staff at the  corporation\u2019s headquarters and a call center facility.", "PBGC, like many executive branch agencies, is subject to the General  Schedule and the federal pay system. In contrast, certain federal financial  regulatory agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the National  Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC), have the flexibility to establish their own  compensation programs outside the various statutory provisions on  classification and pay for executive branch agencies. (See app. II for a list  and description of the federal financial regulatory agencies.) These  financial regulatory agencies are generally required to seek to maintain  pay comparability with each other.", "In June 2007, we examined the actions these agencies have taken to assess  and implement comparability in pay and benefits with each other. While  PBGC has unique responsibilities pertaining to insuring certain employee  defined benefit pensions, some of these federal financial regulators  highlighted under the Federal Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), such as FDIC and NCUA, also have  insurance programs and funds. Further, PBGC employs occupations not  only similar to those of the FIRREA agencies, but also to those of SEC, the  Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), and the Federal  Reserve Board (FRB).", "While human capital authorities and flexibilities vary governmentwide, we  have noted in our prior work that there are two key principles that remain  central to the human capital idea. First, people are assets whose value can  be enhanced through investment, and second, an organization\u2019s human  capital policies must be aligned to support the organization\u2019s \u201cshared  vision\u201d\u2014that is, the mission, vision for the future, core values, goals and  objectives, and strategies by which the organization has defined its  direction and expectations for itself and its people. As noted in the report,  all human capital policies and practices should be designed, implemented,  and assessed by the standard of how well they help the organization  pursue its shared vision.", "We have also reported that strategic workforce planning generally  addresses the alignment of an organization\u2019s human capital program with  its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals and the  development of long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, motivating,  and retaining staff to achieve programmatic goals. There are a variety of  models of how federal agencies can conduct workforce planning, but  certain key principles are generally common to such planning:  involving top management, employees, and other stakeholders in  developing, communicating, and implementing the strategic workforce  plan;    determining skills and competencies needed in the future workforce to  meet the organization\u2019s goals and identifying gaps in skills and  competencies that an organization needs to address;    selecting and implementing human capital strategies that are targeted  toward addressing these gaps and issues;    building the capacity needed to address administrative, educational,  and other requirements important to support workforce planning  strategies; and    evaluating the success of the human capital strategies.", "According to our strategic human capital management model, self- assessment is the starting point for creating \u201chuman capital  organizations\u201d\u2014agencies that focus on valuing employees and aligning  \u201cpeople policies\u201d to support organizational performance goals. Part of the  impetus for creating human capital organizations comes from the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, but agencies  themselves must follow through on tailoring their human capital systems  to their specific missions, visions for the future, core values, objectives,  and strategies. To strategically manage an agency\u2019s human capital  approach, there are certain planning documents an agency can utilize:    Strategic mission plan: An overall agency strategic plan includes a clear  and coherent shared vision of an agency\u2019s mission, goals, values, and  strategies that is clearly and consistently communicated and reinforced to  all employees.", "Human capital strategic plan: A coherent human capital strategic plan,  integrated with the agency\u2019s overall strategic planning, outlines a  framework of human capital policies, programs, and practices specifically  designed to steer the agency toward achieving its shared vision.", "Succession plan: A formal succession plan includes a review of the  agency\u2019s current and emerging leadership needs in light of its strategic and  program planning, identifies sources of executive talent both within and  outside the agency, and includes planned development opportunities,  learning experiences, and feedback for executive candidates.", "Workforce plan: A workforce planning document, linked to the agency\u2019s  strategic and program planning efforts, identifies its current and future  human capital needs, including the size of the workforce; its deployment  across the organization; and the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for  the agency to pursue its shared vision.", "Appendix III discusses elements of GAO\u2019s human capital framework in  further detail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PBGC Has Generally Been Able To Hire and Retain Key Staff, but May Face Workforce and Compensation Challenges in the Future", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2000 to 2007, PBGC was generally able to hire and retain  staff in its key occupations, but the corporation has had some difficulty  hiring and retaining financial analysts and certain other staff.

PBGC\u2019s overall average attrition rate was about 6 percent for these  occupations, roughly equal to that of other federal agencies over that  period (see fig. 1). For example, for occupations like attorneys and  information technology specialists, the attrition rates were similar to those  of other federal executive branch agencies. Likewise, the attrition rates for  PBGC\u2019s executives were similar to those of other federal executive branch  agencies. Our analysis also found that PBGC\u2019s overall attrition experience  was comparable to those at the federal financial regulatory agencies\u2014 such as FDIC and SEC. However, attrition rates did differ for certain key  occupations. For example, PBGC\u2019s attrition rates for financial analysts  were greater than those of other agencies, with an average attrition rate of  8.4 percent, compared to 3.7 percent in other federal executive branch  agencies governmentwide, and 5.5 percent for the financial regulators.", "Further, over the last 3 years, PBGC\u2019s and other executive branch  agencies\u2019 overall attrition rates were higher than their 8-year averages,  which were nearly identical, as shown in figure 2, while the rates for the  federal regulators collectively dipped below their 8-year average in 2007  (see fig. 2).", "PBGC\u2019s attrition rates for staff hired from fiscal years 2000 to 2007 were  also similar to rates at other federal executive branch agencies. For the  seven key occupations collectively, a total of 10.8 percent of key PBGC  staff hired from fiscal years 2000 to 2007 left during their first 2 years of  employment, roughly equal to staff in these positions at other federal  executive branch agencies. However, at PBGC, only 60 percent of financial  analysts remained; a rate lower than for the six other key occupations  hired during these 8 years (see fig. 3).", "In reviewing staff separations from the corporation, we found that  departing PBGC staff in key occupations were more likely to resign from  federal employment\u2014for example, seeking employment outside the  federal government\u2014than their counterparts in other federal agencies (see  fig. 4). We could not determine where employees that resigned from the  federal government moved to because CPDF does not include information  on employment outside the federal government. However, PBGC officials  indicated that while they do not systematically track the employment of all  their employees after separation, it was common for employees to find  employment with private sector entities after leaving PBGC.", "Our analysis also found that during the same time period, key staff  departing from PBGC were slightly more likely than staff from other  agencies to transfer to another federal agency (see fig. 4). However, no  identifiable pattern existed among the specific federal agencies to which  PBGC staff transferred. In fact, from fiscal year 2000 to 2007, CPDF data  showed that 47 PBGC staff in key occupations transferred to 23 different  federal agencies and only one of those agencies\u2014the Department of  Labor\u2014employed more than 5 of these staff. On the basis of the results of  PBGC\u2019s voluntary exit surveys and additional information collected by  PBGC officials, employees frequently cited greater pay as a reason why  they left PBGC for the private sector or another federal agency.", "Further differences existed in PBGC\u2019s seven key occupations with respect  to whether departing staff retired, transferred to another agency, or  otherwise resigned. According to CPDF data, resignations accounted for  83 percent of separations for financial analysts, the highest rate of any key  occupation, while resignations accounted for just 13 percent of auditors\u2019  separations.

Specifically, according to CPDF data, overall key PBGC  staff had an average of 12.8 years of federal experience, while staff in  similar positions at the other federal executive branch agencies had 16.8  years of federal experience. Additionally, we found that while 25 percent  of PBGC\u2019s accountants had less than 3 years of experience, only 10  percent of accountants in other executive branch agencies had similar  years of experience. In fact, for every key occupation except pension law  specialist, PBGC had a greater percentage of staff with less than 3 years of  experience compared to other agencies, though in some cases the  differences were slight (see table 2). Similarly, PBGC\u2019s workforce data  corroborated this finding. Our analysis of the corporation\u2019s tenure data  indicated that 23.3 percent of accountants, auditors, attorneys, financial  analysts, and actuaries had 3 or fewer years of experience.", "The limited federal experience may indicate a workforce challenge for  PBGC, because PBGC officials said that it can take entry-level staff 3 to 4  years to reach full productivity. However, PBGC officials added that the  corporation regularly hires individuals with prior private sector  experience, so not all staff with limited tenure at PBGC would be entry- level staff. For more seasoned staff, PBGC officials said that there is  generally an expectation that such staff will reach full productivity within  a 90- to 120-day time frame. Using CPDF, we could not determine the  extent of an individual\u2019s work experience outside of the federal  government.", "Second, PBGC faces the prospect of losing a significant number of its key  staff due to retirement eligibility. Over the next 4 years, nearly one-quarter  of PBGC\u2019s staff in key occupations will be eligible to retire. While this rate  is lower than that of other federal executive branch agencies\u2014about 32  percent of staff at other federal executive branch agencies in these  occupations will be eligible to retire in the next 4 years\u2014retirement  eligibility could still present a workforce challenge for PBGC, because the  corporation could lose key institutional knowledge. According to CPDF  data, PBGC\u2019s pension law specialists and attorneys will have the greatest  retirement eligibility over the next 4 years (see fig. 6).", "Third, PBGC may face difficulties in hiring and retaining certain key staff  in the future due to the corporation\u2019s existing compensation structure,  which offers salaries lower than some other federal agencies that employ  similar occupations. Specifically, PBGC officials noted that the  corporation\u2014which is subject to the General Schedule\u2014has lost staff to  some federal financial regulators that are not on the General Schedule and  pay higher salaries for these key occupations. While our analysis found  that PBGC has lower pay ranges and lower average basic salaries (which  do not include locality pay) than the federal financial regulators in these  key occupations, CPDF data did not suggest that large numbers of key  PBGC staff were leaving the corporation for these agencies. In addition,  PBGC\u2019s data indicated that just 7 of 99 departing employees (from all  occupations, not just key occupations) transferred to federal financial  regulators between fiscal year 2005 through 2007\u2014PBGC officials said  that these 7 employees left PBGC for increased pay.", "While PBGC\u2019s average salaries were lower than those at the financial  regulators, PBGC staff collectively have pay ranges and salaries similar to  those in other federal executive branch agencies, many of which are  subject to the General Schedule. For example, salaries for attorneys,  auditors, and executives at other federal agencies were generally similar to  those at PBGC. However, PBGC had higher average salaries for financial  analysts, accountants, and information technology specialists and lower  average salaries for pension law specialists and actuaries (see fig. 7).", "While this information may be informative on a broad scale, the number of  years of experience and general schedule grade level at which PBGC  workers are hired play a significant role in their salaries, as is true for  other federal executive branch agencies on the General Schedule as well.

PBGC has made some  progress toward these goals. For instance, PBGC recently hired a new  director of human resources and a new human capital specialist with  expertise in human capital and succession planning.

PBGC human capital officials stated that certain recruitment  strategies are being reassessed, with the goal of increasing their  effectiveness.", "Despite these actions, the corporation lacks a formal, comprehensive  human capital strategy, articulated in a formal human capital plan that  includes human capital policies, programs, and practices.

In 2001,  PBGC established a workforce planning team and conducted a  comprehensive review of its future human capital needs in response to a  GAO recommendation in 2000. As part of this effort, the team identified  needed skills and future critical needs for the corporation and prepared a  gap analysis for the seven key occupations.  From this analysis, the team  then determined if and where workforce gaps existed and formulated  corresponding strategies to address the gaps, all of which was  documented in a workforce planning report drafted in 2002 that was to  serve as the basis for its future ongoing workforce planning efforts. Since  that time, the corporation has conducted little workforce planning and the  workforce planning team has dissolved. However, PBGC has recently done  more in the area of succession planning, with the goal of identifying and  developing appropriate leaders to meet their future challenges. In fact,  PBGC human capital officials have drafted a succession management plan,  and the corporation continues to use a program developed in 2002 to  prepare staff for PBGC\u2019s leadership vacancies.", "According to a senior PBGC official, the corporation has lacked a formal,  comprehensive human capital plan in recent years because the increased  workload and demand for qualified staff required the human capital office  to primarily focus on hiring and training new staff, with little time to  strategically plan, and because the human capital office required a higher  level of expertise to develop a comprehensive human capital strategy.  However, PBGC officials stated that because PBGC has now acquired such  expertise with the hiring of a new human capital director and a new  human capital specialist, the corporation intends to have a formal human  capital strategic plan by the end of fiscal year 2008.", "GAO\u2019s prior work has shown that high-performing organizations must  have a leadership team committed to human capital management who  personally develop and direct reform and continuously drive  improvement. Several PBGC officials have undertaken actions to conduct  succession planning within their own departments; however, differing  opinions among PBGC\u2019s leadership concerning some aspects of human  capital planning\u2014such as workforce and succession planning\u2014may  complicate and prolong PBGC\u2019s strategic efforts. For example, some  PBGC executives conduct departmental succession planning, while others  believe any succession management plan should incorporate a corporate  viewpoint.

However, because such analysis has been conducted only  periodically and on requested topics, information on PBGC\u2019s overall  workforce trends has been limited and therefore unavailable for  anticipating the corporation\u2019s current and future needs.", "While PBGC\u2019s human capital office has conducted some workforce  analysis, it has not taken steps to formally evaluate needed data that could  inform its workforce planning efforts. Our prior work has found that  collecting and analyzing workforce data are fundamental to measuring the  effectiveness of an organization\u2019s human capital approaches in support of  the mission and goals of an agency. To evaluate factors affecting attrition,  agencies can compare their attrition rates to those of other federal  agencies, estimate the cost of recruiting and training new employees who  leave and the cost of recruiting and training their replacements, and  evaluate labor market conditions in locations where it operates. While  PBGC\u2019s human capital office maintains data on the corporation\u2019s attrition  rates, it does not perform certain types of analysis to better understand its  attrition. As of March 2008, PBGC had not conducted any of these  analyses.", "Similarly, the corporation has done little since 2002 to identify and analyze  its workforce skills by gathering skills data on current employees, critical  skills that are needed throughout the agency, to determine if and where  gaps exists. Our prior work has noted that maintaining current information  on staff members\u2019 critical skills and competencies is especially important  for federal agencies operating in an ever-changing environment. Shifts in  national priorities, budget constraints, and other factors affect the critical  skills an agency needs to fulfill its mission. For PBGC, such information  is particularly useful for determining and addressing gaps in the critical  workforce skills of staff and making efficient resource allocations,  because PBGC must respond quickly to changes in the financial markets  and defined benefit pension plan industry. However, PBGC has only in  recent months, and at the request of the newly hired Chief Information  Officer, taken steps to evaluate the critical skill needs and gaps of one of  its key occupations\u2014Information Technology Specialist. For the other key  occupations, PBGC had not yet determined or updated the skills inventory  and competencies of its workforce, as of March 2008.

While data suggest that PBGC is generally able to hire and retain  most key staff, PBGC officials have expressed the belief that the  corporation is at a competitive disadvantage not only with the private  sector, but also with certain federal agencies like FDIC and SEC that  employ similar staff. As we noted, while PBGC staff in key occupations  have pay ranges and salaries similar to those of the rest of the federal  government, PBGC\u2019s pay ranges and average salaries are lower than those  of their counterparts at some similar agencies. Moreover, data suggest that  as of September 2007, PBGC\u2019s highest pay for financial analysts, the key  occupation that PBGC appears to have the most difficulty hiring and  retaining, was lower than that of both the federal financial regulators and  the rest of the federal government. Yet, despite corporate concerns, PBGC  has not taken steps to fully explore all available compensation options  with OPM and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).", "Our prior work has found that the insufficient and ineffective use of  flexibilities can significantly hinder the ability of an agency to recruit, hire,  retain, and manage its workforce, and that the effective, efficient, and  transparent use of human capital flexibilities must be a key component of  agency efforts to address human capital challenges. According to our  Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool, an agency\u2019s  compensation system should be adequate to acquire, motivate, and retain  personnel, and incentives should be used to provide encouragement for  personnel to perform at their maximum capability. Further, to assist  agencies, OPM has developed a handbook describing currently available  human capital flexibilities.", "In recent years, PBGC has made use of various human capital flexibilities  in which the corporation has discretionary authority to provide direct  compensation in certain circumstances to support its recruitment and  retention efforts. Our review of PBGC\u2019s use of the compensation options  recorded in CPDF found that PBGC had used options such as recruitment  and retention incentives, superior qualification pay-setting authority, and  special pay rates for specific occupations. We also found that PBGC used  performance management incentives, such as awards (bonuses) for  suggestions, superior accomplishments, or special acts. (See app. V for a  list of selected compensation flexibilities and authorities.) However, some  PBGC officials stated that the corporation has not used these flexibilities  to their fullest potential. For example, some senior management officials  said the corporation should provide recruitment and retention incentives  to more employees. Our review of CPDF found that between fiscal year  2004 and 2007, PBGC used recruitment incentives 14 times and retention  incentives 10 times.", "Further, PBGC officials said that they had not recently explored additional  flexibilities that required the approval of OPM and OMB to determine  whether they would be applicable or appropriate for the corporation. For  example, as of March 2008, PBGC officials said that they had not explored  whether positions, such as its Chief Insurance Program Officer, Chief  Financial Officer, and Chief Investment Officer\u2014positions that require  specialized technical expertise specifically related to defined benefit  pension plan structure and finance\u2014may fall under OPM\u2019s criteria for  critical position pay authority. While most of these positions are currently  filled, PBGC officials have cited difficulty filling some of these more  technical positions and have expressed concern about filling them in the  future as individuals leave. In another example, PBGC had not explored  whether it would be appropriate or applicable to waive the recruitment  and retention incentive limitation of 25 percent based on a critical agency  need.", "In addition to not exploring all available compensation options, PBGC has  done little over the last decade to determine what effect its compensation  system and lower pay ranges may have on its recruitment and retention  efforts and the extent to which an alternative pay system may be needed.  In the early 1990s, PBGC evaluated its workforce and conducted a  compensation study comparing its compensation system with those of  federal financial regulators and the private sector. The study concluded  that some PBGC staff were relatively under compensated compared to the  private sector and those federal agencies classified under FIRREA. On  the basis of that evidence, PBGC sought to establish a new compensation  system (outside of the federal government\u2019s General Schedule and merit  pay systems), arguing that PBGC could do so because the corporation did  not pay compensation entirely from appropriated funds. However, in  response, the Solicitor of Labor concluded that PBGC\u2019s compensation was  in fact paid from appropriated funds and that PBGC was not exempt from  the General Schedule. As of March 2008, DOL\u2019s Office of the Solicitor had  not changed its conclusions. In addition, GAO has long held the view that  the revolving funds of PBGC are appropriated funds.", "According to PBGC officials, the corporation has not taken steps to  evaluate its compensation structure since the early 1990s, because of the  position taken by the Department of Labor. Officials told us that it would  not be cost-effective for the corporation to invest resources in evaluating  the corporation\u2019s compensation structure if no action could be taken to  modify the pay system, if needed. However, other federal agencies also  facing increased workload demands have in some cases explored and  obtained alternative pay systems\u2014systems where market rates and  performance are central drivers of pay\u2014after establishing a need for  additional compensation.

While it appears that PBGC is  generally able to hire and retain key staff, the corporation has faced hiring  and retaining difficulties in certain technical positions, such as its financial  analysts and chief financial officer. In addition to these difficulties, the  corporation may face several workforce challenges in the near future if it  does not take steps now to strategically prepare itself by identifying its  current and future challenges. However, because PBGC does not  systematically collect and analyze all necessary workforce data, the  foundation on which to identify and address such challenges is limited. In  order to develop strategies for identifying and filling any workforce gaps  or spotlight areas in need of attention, PBGC management must rely on  valid workforce data.

To identify trends in some of these data, we analyzed hiring, attrition, and  separation workforce data sets for PBGC\u2019s key occupations from fiscal  year 2000 to 2007 and compared attrition and separation information with  comparable information from the rest of the federal government for the  same period.

We supplemented that work as necessary  by analyzing employee movement using CPDF data when we found  exceptions from standard personnel procedures, such as employees with a  transfer-out code but with an accession code in the hiring agency that did  not include a transfer-in code. We also found duplicate separation or  accession records for the same individual on the same day. However,  these types of data limitations represented less than 1/10th of 1 percent of  the data used. As a result, we concluded that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our review. We also requested attrition and  other workforce data from PBGC\u2019s computerized system called the  Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS) to determine the extent to  which CPDF data matched FPPS data. We reviewed related agency  documentation, interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the  data, and brought to the attention of these officials any concerns or  discrepancies we found with the data for correction or updating.  However, we did not independently verify the workforce data we received  from PBGC.

Accessions include new hires and hires of  individuals returning to the government. To put PBGC hiring into context,  we used attrition data (discussed below) to compare the numbers of staff  hired with the number of staff leaving. Additionally, we used PBGC hiring  data from 2007 to describe how quickly PBGC fills its job vacancies and  compared that data to OPM standards.", "To determine the overall attrition rates for staff in these key positions, we  analyzed data from the CPDF for fiscal years 2000 to 2007. For each fiscal  year, we counted the number of permanent (career) employees with  personnel actions indicating they had separated from PBGC. Separation  (attrition) data for new hires included resignations, retirements,  terminations, and deaths. We did not include a small percentage of  individuals with inconsistent data such as multiple or different hiring or  separation dates. The small percentage of employees with inconsistent  data is congruent with the generally reliable data in the CPDF we have  reported previously. We then divided the total number of separations for  each fiscal year by the average of the number of these employees in the  CPDF as of the last pay period of the fiscal year before the fiscal year of  the separations and the number of these employees in the CPDF as of the  last pay period of the fiscal year of separation.", "To determine the attrition rates for new hires in the seven critical  occupations, we used CPDF data to identify the newly hired staff and  followed them over time to see how many left PBGC. We identified all new  hires for fiscal years 2000 through 2007 by using personnel action codes  for accessions to career or career conditional positions. Next, we  determined whether these individuals had personnel actions indicating  they had separated from PBGC. By subtracting the hire date from the  separation date, we determined how long individuals worked before  separating. We calculated the attrition rates for a specific time period by  dividing the number of individuals who left within that time period by the  total number of new hires tracked for that time period.", "Once we identified the overall attrition and new hire attrition rates, we  examined CPDF data to determine any patterns or trends for each of the  seven key occupations and for PBGC executives.

Federal agencies have used  varying frameworks for developing and presenting their strategic human  capital plans. Various agencies are using OPM\u2019s Human Capital  Assessment and Accountability Framework (HCAAF) as the basis for  preparing such plans.

Agency approaches to such  planning can vary with each agency\u2019s particular needs and mission;  however, our previous work suggests that irrespective of the context in  which workforce planning is done, such a process should incorporate five  key principles: (1) involve management and employees, (2) analyze  workforce gaps, (3) employ workforce strategies to fill the gaps, (4) build  the capabilities needed to support workforce strategies, and (5) evaluate  and revise strategies (see fig. 8).", "Our human capital model highlights the kinds of thinking that agencies  should apply, as well as some of the steps they can take, to make progress  in managing human capital strategically.

Any sorting of human capital issues may have a sound rationale  behind it, but no sorting should imply that human capital issues can be  compartmentalized and dealt with in isolation from one another.", "Trust requires transparency: To pursue its shared vision effectively, the  agency must earn the trust of its workforce by involving employees in the  strategic planning process and by ensuring that the process is  transparent\u2014that is, consistently making it clear that the shared vision is  the basis for the agency\u2019s actions and decisions.", "Merit principles and other national goals still apply: Performance- based management does not supersede the merit principles or other  national goals, such as veterans\u2019 preference. A modern merit system will  achieve a reasonable balance among taxpayer demands, employer needs,  and employee interests.", "Constraints and flexibilities need to be understood: The purpose of  human capital self-assessment is to help agencies target areas in which to  make changes in support of their organizational missions and other needs.  Agencies that identify areas for improvement need to learn what  constraints exist that apply to them and what flexibilities are available.", "Fact-based human capital management requires data: Federal  agencies typically do not have the data required to effectively assess how  well their human capital approaches support results. A more fact-based  approach to human capital management will entail the development and  use of data that demonstrate the effectiveness of human capital policies  and practices\u2014thereby improving managers\u2019 ability to maximize the value  of human capital investments while managing the related risks.", "The use of best practices requires prudent decision making:  Identifying best practices and benchmarking against leading organizations  are both potentially useful and important pursuits. Federal agencies must  be careful to recognize the unique characteristics and circumstances that  make organizations different from one another and to consider the  applicability of practices that have worked elsewhere. For example, the  environments in which public and private sector organizations operate  differ significantly; our work has shown that many management principles  identified in the private sector are applicable to the federal sector, but  these differences need to be taken into account when agencies consider  alternatives to their current management approaches.", "Attention to human capital must be ongoing: To be effective, strategic  human capital management requires the sustained commitment and  attention of senior leaders and managers at all levels of the agency.  Managing the workforce is not a problem for which the organization can  supply an answer and then move on. Rather, managers must continually  monitor and refine their agencies\u2019 human capital approaches to ensure  their ongoing effectiveness and continuous improvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Minimum and Maximum Pay Ranges and Average Basic Pay for Critical Occupations by Selected Federal Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Baalary minimum and maximum by occupation", "paragraphs": ["CPDF did not indicte tht OFHEO employed IT pecili as of encieExecutives include political appointees above GS-15, such as those in the Senior Executive Service,  those in the Senior Level and Senior Scientific or Professional pay plans, and equivalent officials.
