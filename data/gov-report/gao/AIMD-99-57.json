This equipment helps provide safe, secure, and efficient aircraft operations and other services to the public; it includes controls for such functions as lighting runways, monitoring access to secured areas, handling baggage, and fueling aircraft. Because the software and hardware components used to control airport equipment may not be able to distinguish between the years 1900 and 2000, this equipment may malfunction when the date changes from 1999 to 2000.", "This report responds to your request to examine the status of airports\u2019 efforts to prepare for the year 2000 and to help ensure that the equipment supporting the functions needed for the safe and efficient operation of our nation\u2019s airports will be ready.

Our primary method of data collection for this report was a questionnaire we mailed to 413 airports owned by local municipalities, states, and regional or independent authorities. This questionnaire focused on airports\u2019 preparations to help ensure essential operations continue through and after the year 2000. The questionnaire was based, in part, on a GAO publication describing a structured approach for addressing the Year 2000 date change. To obtain the highest possible response rate, we agreed with your staff that the responses from individual airports would remain confidential. As of December 1998, we obtained responses from 334 airports (81 percent), which represent about 96 percent of the passengers that were served by U.S. airports in 1996. For a full description of our methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Airports are an important component of the National Airspace System (NAS), as they are the entry and exit points to the NAS for most travelers. Although airports differ greatly in size and in the services they provide, most airports provide parking services, security and access control on their grounds, baggage-handling services, aircraft fueling, navigational support (such as runway lighting), and emergency communications throughout the airport and to ground crews. Some airports also provide such additional services as moving sidewalks and subways to connect terminals and computerized monitoring of runway conditions. To help provide these services, airports often rely on computer systems and other equipment with internal microprocessors. Some of these functions\u2014such as baggage handling, controlling access to secured areas, and runway lighting\u2014can also be performed manually and often are performed manually at small airports.", "Other key NAS components include U.S. airlines and FAA\u2019s air traffic control system, both of which provide many functions at airports. Airlines often provide their own ticketing and check-in systems, jet bridges (movable walkways to connect an aircraft to an airport\u2019s gates), and X-ray screening devices. FAA provides air traffic surveillance, navigation, and communications for aircraft. Although FAA and the airlines both have personnel, facilities, and equipment at airports, the responsibilities of an airport operator do not extend to them. Additionally, such conveniences as restaurants, automatic teller machines, and gift shops are not usually the responsibility of the airport; they are usually operated by contractors who lease space from the airport.", "On January 1, 2000, many computers worldwide could malfunction (e.g., produce inaccurate information) or fail simply because the year will change from 1999 to 2000. Such malfunctions or failures could have a costly, widespread impact. The problem comes from how computers and other microprocessors have recorded and computed dates for the past several decades. Typically, they have used two digits to represent the year\u2014such as \u201c98\u201d for 1998\u2014to save electronic storage space and reduce operating costs. In such a format, however, 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900. Nationwide, software and computer experts are concerned that this could cause computers and equipment with internal microprocessors to malfunction in unforeseen ways or to fail completely.", "To help airports prepare for the year 2000, FAA and the aviation industry have developed of a list of 22 core functions for airports, such as baggage handling, access control, and aircraft fueling. Each core function includes specific, discrete tasks that, when carried out together, meet an essential operational need of an airport, such as communications, access control, or aircraft fueling. Certain core functions having to do with safety and security are regulated by FAA and therefore must be present at airports, such as providing navigational aids and access control. FAA, however, does not prescribe what equipment, if any, airports must use to perform these regulated core functions. Other core functions, including automated baggage handling, aircraft fueling, and ground support, help airports meet other needs or enhance the passengers\u2019 convenience and efficiency. FAA has also recommended that airports either (1) complete the process of ensuring that all their equipment supporting core functions regulated by FAA is Year 2000-compliant or (2) have contingency plans to ensure the continued operation of these functions.", "To help federal agencies prepare for the year 2000, we have issued Year 2000 Computing Crisis: An Assessment Guide, which discusses the scope of the challenges and offers a structured, step-by-step approach to review and assess an organization\u2019s readiness to handle the Year 2000 problem. The guide\u2019s general principles are being widely used by entities outside the federal government, and we believe this approach would also help airports better prepare for the year 2000.", "However, even if an organization uses a structured approach to prepare for the year 2000, its operations could still face major disruptions. Many organizations will not be able to repair or replace, fully test, and implement all of their essential equipment in time. Furthermore, equipment that an organization considers to be completely repaired, validated, and implemented may encounter unanticipated Year 2000 problems because exhaustive testing of interconnected production systems is not a practical option. Moreover, essential services provided by the public infrastructure (including electricity, water, transportation, and voice and data telecommunications) are also vulnerable to Year 2000-induced equipment failures. To mitigate the risk of equipment failures and their potential impact, organizations must ensure that they have established contingency plans to provide operational continuity and to support their core functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Airports May Finish Year 2000 Preparations Late and Are Not Following a Structured Approach", "paragraphs": ["Airports are making progress in their efforts to prepare for the year 2000, but their efforts vary considerably.

Similarly, if runway lighting systems were to malfunction, airport officials reported that they could operate the runway lights manually or restrict landings to daylight hours and divert any aircraft arriving after dark to other airports.", "Such contingency plans, however, will need to be fully developed and tested to help ensure that safety or security is not degraded. For example, some airport officials indicated that their contingency plans for Year 2000 malfunctions with their baggage-handling and access control equipment involve substituting manual procedures. Such contingency plans could require hiring additional airport personnel and performing background checks. In addition, employees performing unfamiliar tasks to compensate for the malfunction of automated equipment would have to be trained to minimize the possibility of human errors affecting airport safety or security. Some airport officials were concerned about having the human resources they might need to respond to equipment malfunctions.

They did not dispute the report\u2019s findings, but they pointed out that the status of airports\u2019 preparations for the year 2000 is rapidly evolving and that data collected in the fall of 1998 may, therefore, not fully portray their current situation. FAA also suggested that we more explicitly indicate that not all of the systems supporting the functions included in our survey of airports, such as heating and ventilation and moving sidewalks, are regulated by FAA. We have incorporated this comment and others from FAA as appropriate.", "We performed our work between July 1998 and December 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As of December 1998 we obtained responses from 334 airports (81 percent), which represents about 96 percent of the passengers served by all 413 airports. The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce unwanted variability in the results. These include differences in how questions are interpreted, errors in entering data, and the types of airports that did not respond. We included steps in both data collection and data analysis to minimize this unwanted variability. We pretested questionnaires with airport officials, reviewed answers during follow-up visits and telephone interviews, double-keyed and verified all data during entry, and validated all analyses with a second analyst.", "FAA subdivides commercial service airports into four categories on the basis of annual enplanements: large hubs, medium hubs, small hubs, and nonhubs. The numbers of airports in these categories are 29, 42, 70, and 272, respectively (see fig. I.1). To facilitate comparisons among airports responding to our survey, we modified FAA\u2019s categories by assigning airports to one of three classes\u2014large, medium, or small\u2014based on the number of enplanements in 1996. We split FAA\u2019s medium hub category by designating 21 of its airports as large and 21 as medium. Consequently, our large category contains the 50 airports with the greatest number of enplanements in 1996; the medium category contains 91 airports; and the small category contains the same 272 airports as FAA\u2019s nonhub category.", "Large airports (50)", "Large hubs (29)", "Medium-sized airports (91)", "Medium hubs (42)", "Small airports (272)", "Small hubs (70)", "Nonhubs (272)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Core Functions at Airports", "paragraphs": ["Although FAA has designated 22 core functions for airports to consider in preparing for the year 2000, to minimize the time respondents would need to fill out our questionnaire, we omitted the functions that are neither required by FAA for certification under part 139 (Airport Operations), part 107 (Airport Security), part 108 (Airport Operator Security) of Federal Aviation Regulations, nor deemed \u201cairfield critical.\u201d As a result, the following functions were not included in our questionnaire: cargo handling, information technology, flight and baggage information display computers and equipment, financial computers and equipment, jet bridge operations and maintenance, noise abatement, and passenger services (see table I.1). In addition, we combined two closely related functions, access control and security and public safety, into one. Although FAA does not deem parking a critical function, we included it as the fourteenth function because airport officials told us that revenues from parking facilities constitute their primary
