OST estimates that almost all key reforms needed to develop an integrated trust management system and to provide improved trust services will be completed by November 2007. Specifically, OST implemented a new trust funds accounting system for processing trust account funds, and BIA and OST are currently validating data for the trust asset and accounting management system for managing Indian land title records and leases for land with recurring income. However, the Special Trustee estimates that data verification for leasing activities will not be completed for all Indian lands until December 2009. OST's most recent strategic plan, issued in 2003, did not include a timetable for implementing trust reforms or a date for OST's termination. The Special Trustee notes that many OST functions, including trust fund operations, trust records management, and appraisal services, need to be performed after reforms are completed. If OST is terminated, these responsibilities would have to be transferred to another Interior office. OST plans to reduce expenditures primarily by terminating contracts once trust reforms are completed. However, OST has not yet developed a workforce plan that reexamines the expenditures and staffing levels needed for trust fund operations once trust reforms are completed. OST has used contractors to perform many of its trust reform activities as a way to minimize the size of its permanent staff. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, OST allocated $89.7 million, or nearly 21 percent, of its appropriated funds to contracting. About 66 percent of contracting dollars from these 2 fiscal years went to two firms. Over $31 million during this period went to the largest contractor, an Indian-owned 8(a) small business, by adding task orders through an existing contract. OST has primarily relied on Interior's National Business Center to award and manage contracts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), within the Department of the Interior  (Interior), for many years was responsible for managing the income that  Indians derived primarily from Interior\u2019s leasing of rights to minerals,  timber, and grazing on Indian lands. However, BIA experienced long- standing problems in managing this income, which it had received and  held in trust. Specifically, BIA\u2019s Office of Trust Funds Management, which  was responsible for providing accounting and investment services and  managing the accounting system that recorded the receipt and  disbursement of Indian trust funds to tribal and individual Indian account  holders, did not have adequately trained personnel or adequate accounting  and information systems to ensure that lease income was deposited in the  correct trust accounts and that trust balances were accurate. Moreover,  each of BIA\u2019s 12 regional offices has been responsible for recording land  title ownership and tracking lease revenues. Several BIA regional and  agency offices created their own automated systems for tracking this  information, while some offices performed this function manually. As a  result, these regional information systems were not integrated, and the  regional offices could not ensure that their information was regularly  updated, accurate, and complete.", "In response to these problems, the Congress enacted the American Indian  Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (the 1994 Act). Among other  things, the 1994 Act established the Office of the Special Trustee for  American Indians (OST) to oversee and coordinate Interior\u2019s  implementation of trust fund management reforms. To improve  information systems and accounting practices, the 1994 Act directs OST to  oversee the development of an integrated information system that  interfaces the trust funds accounting system with BIA\u2019s land title records  and asset management systems for Indian lands. These systems are to be  integrated with asset management systems that Interior\u2019s Minerals  Management Service and Bureau of Land Management are developing. The  1994 Act also requires OST to develop a comprehensive strategic plan with  a timetable for implementing the identified reforms and a date when OST  will be terminated. The 1994 Act directs that the Special Trustee provide  the Secretary of the Interior and the Congress with a 30-day notice prior to  the termination date, and authorizes the Special Trustee to recommend  either the continuation or permanent establishment of OST if necessary  for the efficient discharge of Interior\u2019s trust responsibilities. The 1994 Act  states that OST will be terminated 180 legislative days after reforms are  completed, unless the Congress extends the Special Trustee\u2019s authorities.", "Subsequently, in response to direction in the conference report  accompanying Interior\u2019s fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill, the Secretary  of the Interior directed, through Secretarial Order 3197, that the Office of  Trust Funds Management and other financial trust services be transferred  from BIA to OST. This transfer effectively expanded OST\u2019s responsibilities  from overseeing and coordinating Interior\u2019s implementation of trust fund  management reforms to also include managing tribal and individual Indian  trust fund accounts and providing financial services. OST reports that it  currently maintains about 1,450 accounts for more than 250 tribal entities  with assets of about $2.9 billion and about 300,000 individual Indian  accounts with financial assets of about $400 million.", "Between fiscal years 1997 and 2006, OST\u2019s staff increased from 245 to 590,  and total funding grew from $34.1 million to $222.8 million. In April 2003,  the Secretary of the Interior reorganized OST to create three separate  divisions that are responsible for (1) implementing trust reform activities,  (2) providing financial trust services, and (3) providing trust fund  management and beneficiary services in the field through the creation of 6  regions that are aligned with BIA\u2019s 12 regional offices. The reorganization  also doubled the number of OST\u2019s Senior Executive Service (SES)  positions to 14.", "Over the years, OST and BIA have used contractors to help implement  their trust fund management reforms. In 2003, Interior\u2019s Office of  Inspector General began investigating allegations that senior OST  managers had given Chavarria, Dunne, & Lamey (CD&L) favorable  treatment in awarding contract work. The Inspector General\u2019s May 2006  report presented facts showing that (1) senior OST managers had created  an appearance of preferential treatment of CD&L by socializing and  exchanging gifts with firm officials, in violation of government ethical  standards, and (2) OST contract personnel felt pressured by these senior  OST managers to continue to award work to CD&L. The Inspector  General referred the matter to Interior to take the appropriate  administrative action and review the performance of the contract.  Independent of the Inspector General\u2019s investigation, OST began using  Interior\u2019s National Business Center (NBC), located in Denver, Colorado, in  2003 and Fort Huachuca, Arizona, in 2004 to provide contracting services.  NBC\u2019s Fort Huachuca branch administers a contract with an Indian small  business contractor. The contract, which was awarded noncompetitively  under the Small Business Administration\u2019s 8(a) program, allows OST and  other agencies to place task orders for activities within the contract\u2019s  scope. BIA also provides contracting services for OST in addition to  funding its own contracts for trust reform activities.", "In recent years, representatives of several tribal organizations have  expressed concern to the Congress about the extent, duration, and cost of  OST\u2019s reforms, noting that OST has not provided the Congress with a  timetable for completing these reforms as the 1994 Act requires. These  representatives are also concerned that OST has taken an increasingly  larger role in the management of the trust, rather than limiting itself to  overseeing trust reform efforts.", "In this context, we examined (1) OST\u2019s progress in implementing the  American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 and (2) the  extent to which OST has used contractors in implementing these reforms.  In addition, appendix I provides information on retention allowances and  performance awards provided to OST managers in SES positions.", "To examine OST\u2019s progress in implementing the 1994 Act, we reviewed  laws, regulations, and legislative history pertaining to trust reforms at  Interior. We also reviewed OST\u2019s trust reform planning documents and  interviewed OST and BIA officials to determine the status of the  implementation of trust reforms; however, we did not analyze the  adequacy of OST\u2019s and BIA\u2019s implementation of trust reforms. To identify  the extent to which OST has used contractors in implementing its trust  reforms, we obtained data from the Federal Procurement Data System- Next Generation (FPDS-NG) for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and tested  these data for reliability by comparing them with procurement data from  NBC. Where discrepancies were found, we corrected the FPDS-NG data  to ensure completeness of the data. In addition, we interviewed  contracting officers at NBC and contracting officers\u2019 technical  representatives at OST. On the basis of our testing and correction of  FPDS-NG data, we are sufficiently confident of the reliability of the data  we are reporting. We conducted our review from February 2006 through  October 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has held funds in trust for Indian tribes since  1820. Enacted in 1887, the General Allotment Act, also known as the  Dawes Act, provided for the division of Indian tribal lands into allotments  of up to 160 acres for individual tribal members and families.  Subsequently, the Indian Reorganization Act, enacted in 1934 and also  known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, ended the allotment of tribal lands and  extended indefinitely the period that the federal government would hold  allotted lands in trust. Many of these allotments remain in trust today, now  jointly owned in common by hundreds and, in many cases, thousands of  individual Indians, each with an undivided\u2014or fractionated\u2014interest in  the whole parcel. As trustee for tribes and Indians, the Secretary of the  Interior is required to account for the revenue generated by each interest  (amounting, in some cases, to less than 1 cent per year), invest the trust  funds, and provide other trust services to the beneficiaries. The Secretary  also is responsible for maintaining official Indian land title and ownership  records, managing natural resource assets, and probating estates. Much of  this responsibility has been delegated to BIA, which has 12 regional offices  and 85 agency offices that are located on or near reservations.", "Beginning in April 1997, Interior has issued several strategic plans for  implementing trust reforms. Concerned that Interior had not achieved the  desired improvement in trust management, the Secretary in January 2002  initiated an effort to develop a comprehensive, departmentwide approach  for improving Indian trust management. On March 28, 2003, Interior issued  the Comprehensive Trust Management Plan, which presented a strategic  plan to guide the design and implementation of integrated trust reform  efforts. Interior\u2019s performance of fiduciary trust business practices  nationwide was documented and reported in the As-Is Trust Business  Model Report. The information contained in the Comprehensive Trust  Management Plan and the As-Is Report is the foundation for the  recommendations for reengineered business processes that appear in the  To-Be Model\u2014or Fiduciary Trust Model. The Fiduciary Trust Model  contains implementation strategies for major business processes, and  currently serves as Interior\u2019s guide for trust reform.", "As a basis for revising the department\u2019s approach for improving Indian  trust management, Interior contracted with Electronic Data Systems in  2001 to determine how trust reforms were then being conducted and how  they could be improved. The firm\u2019s recommendations included both  improvements in trust management and a reorganization of Interior\u2019s  agencies carrying out trust management and improvement. In response to  these recommendations, the Secretary of the Interior reorganized BIA and  OST in April 2003. The reorganization increased OST\u2019s SES positions from  7 to 14 by (1) creating 6 OST regional trust administrators, located at  OST\u2019s Albuquerque headquarters, who are responsible for providing  account holders with trust services and with overseeing fiduciary trust  officers and other personnel in the field and (2) adding an SES position in  realigning OST\u2019s management structure by creating three divisions.", "As shown in table 1, OST\u2019s budget has grown from $34.1 million in fiscal  year 1997 to $222.8 million in fiscal year 2006. Similarly, OST\u2019s full-time  equivalent positions have increased from 245 employees in fiscal year 1997  to 590 employees in fiscal year 2006. While the growth in budget and staff  mainly reflect OST\u2019s efforts to implement reforms and its growing  responsibility for trust fund management, OST\u2019s funding also supports  other Indian-related activities. For example, in fiscal year 2006, OST  transferred (1) $54.4 million to the Office of Historical Trust Accounting,  (2) $34.0 million for implementing the Indian Land Consolidation Act  activities, (3) $7.6 million to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, (4) $5.6  million to the Interior Solicitor\u2019s Office to cover costs associated with the  Cobell v. Kempthorne lawsuit, (5) $1.3 million to BIA for tribal contract  and compact appraisals, and (6) $300,000 to Interior\u2019s Chief Information  Officer. OST began funding the Office of Historical Trust Accounting in  fiscal year 2001 and activities related to the Indian Land Consolidation Act  in fiscal year 2000. Responsibility for Indian land appraisals was  transferred from BIA to OST in 2002 and is currently managed by OST\u2019s  Office of Appraisal Services.", "In addition to its trust reform activities, OST is responsible for maintaining  trust-related Indian records and developing trust investment strategies for  beneficiaries. In 1999, OST created the Office of Trust Records to ensure  that Indian records are maintained and safeguarded. In September 2003,  Interior signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National  Archives and Records Administration to create a national repository for  American Indian records, including fiduciary trust records, in Lenexa,  Kansas. OST\u2019s Division of Trust Funds Investment is responsible for  managing and investing individual Indian and tribal assets.

OST estimates that almost all of the key reforms needed to develop an  integrated trust management system and to provide improved trust  services will be completed by November 2007, but OST believes some  additional improvements are important to make. In particular, once the  validation of BIA\u2019s new trust asset and accounting management system  (TAAMS) leasing information for Indian lands with recurring income is  completed, BIA and OST plan to validate the leasing information for Indian  lands that do not have recurring income.

The Special Trustee noted  that Interior will need OST\u2019s staff to continue to perform their functions  after trust reforms are completed, whether or not OST is terminated,  because OST was given responsibility for managing trust fund operations  and other trust-related activities after the 1994 Act was enacted.

In March 1998, OST awarded a  contract to SEI Investments to use a modified version of its commercial  trust accounting system that provides basic collection, accounting,  investing, disbursing, and reporting functions. TFAS replaced a module in  BIA\u2019s Integrated Records Management System and two OST systems,  which could not fully perform trust accounting functions.

It also allows, for example, automated trade settlements,  automated payments of financial asset income, daily securities pricing,  and automated reconciliation. In addition, landownership and leasing  accounts will be included in TFAS as part of BIA\u2019s and OST\u2019s TAAMS  conversion project to ensure that both systems contain accurate and  complete information.", "Trust Funds Receivable. In 2004, OST awarded a contract to Bank of  America to centralize the collection of trust payments through a single  remittance-processing center, also known as a lockbox, to minimize the  risk of loss or theft. Under phase I of the new system, which became  effective in October 2005, trust payments are sent to the processing center  in Prescott, Arizona, for deposit into trust fund accounts. Previously, BIA  and OST personnel in agencies for each of the 12 regions collected trust  payments for trust fund account holders and then mailed or deposited the  payments.", "Phase II of this project is to have all collections and distributions  automated in TFAS. However, implementation requires the completion of  the validation of the land title and leasing data in TAAMS. According to  OST officials, full automation of all collections and distributions is  scheduled for November 2007. OST officials said that two agencies in  BIA\u2019s Southern Plains region completed Phase II by the end of June 2005\u2014 the remaining agencies in BIA\u2019s Southern Plains region and one agency in  BIA\u2019s Eastern Oklahoma region completed Phase II by the end of January  2006.

In  addition, OST has completed its desktop procedures for handling the  receipt of trust funds, and BIA is completing its desktop standardization  procedures, with some assistance from OST.", "Trust Beneficiary Call Center. In December 2004, OST established the  Trust Beneficiary Call Center, a centralized call center in its headquarters  office in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Through a toll-free telephone number,  the call center provides timely responses to beneficiaries\u2019 questions and  allows them to access account information. In addition, the call center  operators and staff have recently received training and access to TAAMS  through OST\u2019s trust portal to enable them to better answer questions  about beneficiaries\u2019 assets. If a beneficiary\u2019s question cannot be answered,  the call center operator is to refer the question to an OST Fiduciary Trust  Officer, generally colocated at the BIA field agencies, to research and  respond accordingly. The call center was fully operational by December  2005.", "In establishing the call center, calls were redirected from preexisting toll- free telephone numbers at BIA field agencies. OST officials told us that the  Trust Beneficiary Call Center has helped to relieve some of the workload  from OST and BIA staff in the field.

If other Interior bureaus and offices with trust  responsibilities decide to use the RM-Plus tool, OST will assist them by  providing advice and access to the RM-Plus tool.", "BIA and OST are implementing the following trust reforms to develop  centralized systems for managing land title records and leasing activities  as well as managing and tracking probates for Indian lands:    TAAMS. In December 1998, Interior awarded a contract to Artesia to  develop TAAMS, a centralized system with two components for managing  Indian trust assets: the TAAMS land title system and the leasing module.  Over the years, Artesia was bought out by several contractors. Currently,  the TAAMS contract is with CGI-AMS.

As part of the verification, the DQ&I teams compare the  TAAMS information with the information contained in the BIA region\u2019s  legacy realty system for land tract allotments with recurring income. For  each land tract allotment for which the owner(s) and the interest they own  do not match, the DQ&I teams compare the TAAMS information against  source documents to identify (1) conveyances of title through probate  records, deeds, and gift conveyances and (2) active encumbrances,  including lease permits, rights of way, and timber sale agreements. This  verification is scheduled to be completed in all BIA regions by October 1,  2007, covering land tracts with recurring income for which the legacy  lease and title systems do not match.", "OST also plans to verify the accuracy of the land and leasing records for  which TAAMS and the legacy realty system have matching information by  comparing the TAAMS information with source documents for a sample of  these records.

The land  validation took about 1 hour per tract in BIA\u2019s Southern Plains region  because there are about 12 owners per tract. This validation requires more  time in BIA\u2019s Great Plains region, which has about 32 owners per tract,  and in BIA\u2019s Rocky Mountain region, which has over 100 owners for some  tracts.", "Probate Case Management and Tracking System. BIA used a modified  off-the-shelf software program to develop the probate case management  and tracking system, also known as ProTrac, for use by BIA, OST, and  Interior\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals to manage and track probate  cases from initiation to closing. BIA constructed the ProTrac database  from manual records, spreadsheets, and trust fund records and, according  to a BIA official, has verified its accuracy.

First, the managers  plan to verify the accuracy and completeness of TAAMS information for  (1) a statistical sample of the tracts of land for which the data in TAAMS  and the BIA regional legacy systems match and (2) tracts of Indian land  without recurring income. The Special Trustee estimates that this work  will be completed by the end of 2009. Second, the OST managers plan to  work with BIA to replace the oil and gas distribution system within BIA\u2019s  Integrated Records Management System that tracks oil and gas revenue  from Indian lands.

Other major data processing and  telecommunications services include developing OST\u2019s Trust Beneficiary  Call Center, identifying the owners of whereabouts unknown accounts,  and developing risk management processes. Another major service or  product type for which contracting funds were allocated was for financial  services, at about $28 million.
