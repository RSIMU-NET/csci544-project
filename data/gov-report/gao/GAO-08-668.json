GAO identified four key components of preparing for medical surge: (1) increasing hospital capacity, (2) identifying alternate care sites, (3) registering medical volunteers, and (4) planning for altering established standards of care. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the primary agency for hospital preparedness, including medical surge. GAO was asked to examine (1) what assistance the federal government has provided to help states prepare for medical surge, (2) what states have done to prepare for medical surge, and (3) concerns states have identified related to medical surge. GAO reviewed documents from the 50 states and federal agencies. GAO also interviewed officials from a judgmental sample of 20 states and from federal agencies, as well as emergency preparedness experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Following a mass casualty event that could involve thousands, or even tens of thousands, of injured or ill victims, health care systems would need the ability to \"surge,\" that is, to adequately care for a large number of patients or patients with unusual medical needs. The federal government has provided funding, guidance, and other assistance to help states prepare for medical surge in a mass casualty event. From fiscal years 2002 to 2007, the federal government awarded the states about $2.2 billion through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response's Hospital Preparedness Program to support activities to meet their preparedness priorities and goals, including medical surge. Further, the federal government provided guidance for states to use when preparing for medical surge, including Reopening Shuttered Hospitals to Expand Surge Capacity, which contains a checklist that states can use to identify entities that could provide more resources during a medical surge. Based on a review of state emergency preparedness documents and interviews with 20 state emergency preparedness officials, GAO found that many states had made efforts related to three of the key components of medical surge, but fewer have implemented the fourth. More than half of the 50 states had met or were close to meeting the criteria for the five medical-surge-related sentinel indicators for hospital capacity reported in the Hospital Preparedness Program's 2006 midyear progress reports. For example, 37 states reported that they could add 500 beds per million population within 24 hours of a mass casualty event. In a 20-state review, GAO found that all 20 were developing bed reporting systems and most were coordinating with military and veterans hospitals to expand hospital capacity, 18 were selecting various facilities for alternate care sites, 15 had begun electronic registering of medical volunteers, and fewer of the states--7 of the 20--were planning for altered standards of medical care to be used in response to a mass casualty event. State officials in GAO's 20-state review reported that they faced challenges relating to all four key components in preparing for medical surge. For example, some states reported concerns related to maintaining adequate staffing levels to increase hospital capacity, and some reported concerns about reimbursement for medical services provided at alternate care sites. According to some state officials, volunteers were concerned that if state registries became part of a national database they might be required to provide services outside their own state. Some states reported that they had not begun work on or completed altered standards of care guidelines due to the difficulty of addressing the medical, ethical, and legal issues involved in making life-or-death decisions about which patients would get access to scarce resources. While most of the states that had adopted or were drafting altered standards of care guidelines reported using federal guidance as they developed these guidelines, some states also reported that they needed additional assistance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and  the Pentagon, the anthrax incidents during the fall of 2001, and the  possibility of a naturally occurring disease outbreak or some other large- scale public health emergency have raised public awareness and concern  about the ability of the nation\u2019s health care systems to respond to  bioterrorism and other mass casualty events. In a mass casualty event the  ability of local or regional health care systems to deliver services  consistent with established standards of care could be compromised, at  least in the short term, because the volume of patients would far exceed  the available hospital beds, medical personnel, pharmaceuticals,  equipment, and supplies.", "Following a mass casualty event, health care systems would need the  ability to \u201csurge,\u201d that is, to adequately care for a large number of patients  or patients with unusual or highly specialized medical needs. Providing  such care would require the allocation of scarce resources and could  occur outside of hospitals and other normal health care delivery sites.  Through literature reviews and interviews with experts and professional  associations, we identified four key components related to preparing for  medical surge in a mass casualty event: (1) increasing hospital capacity,  including beds, workforce, equipment, and supplies; (2) identifying and  operating alternate care sites when hospital capacity is overwhelmed;   (3) registering and credentialing volunteer medical professionals; and   (4) planning for appropriate altered standards of care in order to save the  most lives in a mass casualty event.", "Federal and state entities both play roles in preparing for emergency  preparedness. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the  overall federal responsibility under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 for  managing national emergency preparedness. In December 2006, the  Congress passed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act  (PAHPA). PAHPA designated the Secretary of Health and Human Services  as the lead official for all federal public health and medical responses to  public health emergencies, including medical surge. Under the federal  plan for responding to emergencies, states have responsibility for  producing emergency preparedness plans in coordination with regional  and local entities, and both DHS and the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) are responsible for supporting their efforts. In addition,  the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) are expected to assist state and local entities in emergencies. A DOD  directive authorizes local military hospitals to coordinate with state and  local entities to plan for emergency preparedness, and DOD hospitals are  authorized to accept civilian patients in a mass casualty event. VA  policies and procedures allow VA hospitals to participate in state and local  emergency planning, and by statute VA may provide medical care to  nonveterans in a mass casualty event.", "As a result of the nation\u2019s need to prepare for potential terrorist attacks,  naturally occurring disease outbreaks, or other natural disasters, members  of the Congress asked that we undertake a study regarding the nation\u2019s  preparedness for a mass casualty event. In this report, we examine the  following questions: (1) What assistance has the federal government  provided to help states prepare their regional and local health care  systems for medical surge in a mass casualty event? (2) What have states  done to prepare for medical surge in a mass casualty event? (3) What  concerns have states identified as they prepare for medical surge in a mass  casualty event?", "To determine what assistance the federal government provided to states to  help them prepare their regional and local health care systems for medical  surge in a mass casualty event, particularly related to four key components  of medical surge, we reviewed and analyzed national strategic planning  documents. We also analyzed reports related to medical surge capacity  issued by various entities, including the Agency for Healthcare Research  and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR),  and the Joint Commission. In addition, we obtained and reviewed  documents from ASPR to determine the amount of funds awarded to  states through its Hospital Preparedness Program\u2019s cooperative  agreements. We also interviewed officials from ASPR, CDC, and DHS to  identify and document criteria and guidance given to states to plan for  medical surge. To determine what states have done to prepare for medical  surge in a mass casualty event, we obtained and analyzed the 2006 and  2007 ASPR Hospital Preparedness Program cooperative agreement  applications and 2006 midyear progress reports (the most current  available information at the time of our data collection) for the 50 states.", "We also reviewed the 15 sentinel indicators from these reports. Although  ASPR\u2019s 2006 guidance for these midyear progress reports did not provide  specific criteria with which to evaluate recipients\u2019 performance on these  sentinel indicators, we identified criteria to analyze the data provided for 5  of the indicators related to one of four key components\u2014hospital  capacity\u2014from either ASPR\u2019s previous program guidance or DHS  guidance. (See app. I for a list of the sentinel indicators.) In addition, we  obtained and reviewed 20 states\u2019 emergency preparedness planning  documents relating to medical surge and interviewed officials from these  states responsible for planning for medical surge. We selected the 20 states  by identifying 2 states from each of the 10 HHS geographic regions\u2014one  with the most ASPR Hospital Preparedness Program funding and one with  the least funding. These selection criteria allowed us to take into account  population (program funding was awarded using a formula including, in  part, population), geographic dispersion, and different geographic risk  factors, such as the potential for hurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes.  We obtained and reviewed DOD and VA policies and interviewed officials  regarding their participation with state and local entities in emergency  preparedness planning and response. To determine what concerns states  identified as they prepared for medical surge, we interviewed emergency  preparedness officials from the 20 states on their efforts related to four  key components. We also asked what further assistance states might need  from the federal government to help prepare their health care systems for  medical surge. The information from these interviews is intended to  provide a general description of what the 20 states have done to prepare  for medical surge and is not generalizable to all 50 states.

While these programs generally award funds to  states and municipalities for the prevention and detection of terrorist acts,  some funds can be spent on medical response, including medical surge  activities.", "HHS has the principal responsibility for helping states to prepare for  medical surge. In December 2006, PAHPA established ASPR within HHS in  order to enhance coordination of public health and medical surge. The act  reauthorized and gave ASPR authority over the Hospital Preparedness  Program, which provides funds annually to 62 entities\u2014the 50 states, 4  municipalities, 5 U.S. territories, and 3 Freely Associated States of the  Pacific\u2014through cooperative agreements in order to strengthen their  emergency readiness capabilities. Also, beginning in fiscal year 2009, HHS  will require that states provide a 5 percent match to the amount of the  federal cooperative agreement funding, through either state funds or in- kind contributions, such as office space or computer support for the  program. In 2010 and subsequent years, the matching requirement will  increase to 10 percent.", "As part of the 2006 Hospital Preparedness Program, ASPR required all  cooperative agreement recipients to submit midyear progress reports that  include data on 15 sentinel indicators, 13 of which are related to medical  surge. For example, one of the sentinel indicators is the number of  hospitals that have the capacity to maintain at least one patient with a  suspected highly infectious disease in a negative pressure isolation room.  PAHPA also gave ASPR authority for the Emergency System for Advance  Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR-VHP). ESAR-VHP  supports state-based electronic databases designed to register health care  personnel who volunteer to provide medical care in an emergency for the  purpose of verifying their credentials. In order to continue to receive  Hospital Preparedness Program funds, states must participate in ESAR- VHP by fiscal year 2009. Under PAHPA, HHS is required to link state  electronic medical volunteer registries into a national registry.", "DOD and VA do not have a federal responsibility in assisting states in  planning and preparing for medical surge in a mass casualty event.  However, since their hospitals are accredited by the Joint Commission,  they are required to participate in at least one annual emergency  preparedness exercise with their local community. In addition, because  they are part of the local community, they would play a role in planning for  and responding to local mass casualty events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Components of Medical Surge in a Mass Casualty Event", "paragraphs": ["According to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 21 (HSPD-21)  Public Health and Medical Preparedness, issued in October 2007, mass  casualty health care is a critical element of public health and medical  preparedness. HSPD-21 is one of a series of executive orders released  since September 11, 2001, establishing a national strategy to help protect  the nation in the event of terrorist attacks or other catastrophic health  events. It states that mass casualty health care capability needs to be  different from \u201cday-to-day\u201d public health and medical operations, which  \u201ccannot meet the needs created by a catastrophic health event.\u201d It also  states that the nation must develop a disaster medical capability that,  among other things, is rapid, flexible, sustainable, integrated, and  coordinated, and delivers appropriate treatment in the most ethical  manner with available capabilities.", "The four key components we identified follow:    Hospital capacity: Following a mass casualty event, hospitals may need the  ability to adequately care for a large number of additional patients.  Strategies to increase hospital capacity include deferring elective  procedures, applying more stringent triage for admitting patients,  discharging patients early with follow-up by home health care personnel,  and adding additional beds and equipment in areas of the hospital that are  not normally used for inpatient care, such as outpatient examining rooms.", "Alternate care sites: A mass casualty event could overwhelm hospitals\u2019  capacity and require the establishment of alternate sites to provide health  care services. Alternate care sites deliver medical care outside hospital  settings for patients who would normally be treated as inpatients, and  triage patients in order to sort those who need critical attention and  immediate transport to the hospital from those with less serious injuries.  In addition, alternate care sites manage unique considerations that might  arise in the context of mass casualty events, including the delivery of  chronic care; the distribution of vaccines; or the quarantine, grouping, or  sequestration of patients potentially infected with an easily transmissible  infectious disease. The development of alternate care sites involves  several issues, including the level and scope of medical care to be  delivered, the physical infrastructure required, staffing requirements for  the delivery of such care, the medical equipment and supplies needed, and  the management systems required to integrate such facilities with the  overall delivery of health care. Additionally, there are two types of  alternate care sites\u2014fixed and mobile. Fixed facilities are nonmedical  buildings that, because of their size or proximity to a hospital, can be  adapted to provide medical care. Mobile medical facilities are either  specialized units with surgical and intensive care capabilities that are  based on tractor-trailer platforms or fully equipped hospitals stored in  container systems that can be set up quickly.", "Electronic medical volunteer registries: In a time of emergency, it can be  difficult for state and hospital officials who are organizing a response to  use medical volunteers unless they have been preregistered to determine  who is qualified to provide medical assistance. For example, immediately  after the attacks on September 11, 2001, thousands of people  spontaneously arrived in New York City to volunteer their assistance\u2014 many of whom volunteered to provide medical assistance to the victims of  the attacks. However, authorities were unable to distinguish medically  qualified from unqualified volunteers. Generally, an electronic medical  volunteer registry would (1) preregister health care volunteers, (2) apply  emergency credentialing standards to these registered volunteers, and   (3) allow for the verification of the identity, credentials, and qualifications  of registered volunteers in an emergency.", "Altered standards of care: In a mass casualty event, routine resource  shortages would be significantly magnified and hospitals would have  limited access to many needed resources, such as health care providers,  equipment and supplies, and pharmaceuticals. As a result, it could be  necessary to alter standards of medical care in a manner that is different  from normal day-to-day circumstances and appropriate to the situation.  For example, because of an influx of a large number of patients in a mass  casualty event, adequate staffing of health care providers would be  hindered by the current shortages of health care providers. Workforce  shortages could result in hospitals changing their established standards of  care, such as nurse-to-patient care ratios."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Has Provided States with Funding, Guidance, and Other Assistance to Prepare for Medical Surge", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has provided funding, guidance, and other  assistance to help states prepare their regional and local health care  systems for medical surge in a mass casualty event.

The Target Capabilities List provides guidance on building and  maintaining capabilities, such as medical surge, that support the National  Preparedness Guidelines. The medical surge capability includes activities  and critical tasks needed to rapidly and appropriately care for the injured  and ill from mass casualty events and to ensure that continuity of care is  maintained for non-incident-related injuries or illnesses.", "In addition, ASPR provided states with specific guidance related to  preparing for medical surge in a mass casualty event, including annual  guidance for its Hospital Preparedness Program cooperative agreements,  guidance for developing ESAR-VHP-compliant electronic medical  volunteer registries, and guidance to develop a hospital bed tracking  system. The Hospital Preparedness Program cooperative agreement  guidance included activities to assist states in following DHS\u2019s guidelines  and meeting its targets. ASPR\u2019s ESAR-VHP guidelines provide states with  common definitions, standards, and protocols, which can aid in forming a  national network to facilitate the deployment of medical volunteers for  any emergency among states. For example, ESAR-VHP registration  guidelines categorize medical volunteers by profession, ranging from  physicians to mental health counselors. ESAR-VHP guidelines also include  four different levels of credentialing based on verification of each  volunteer\u2019s qualifications. ASPR provided guidance to states for the  Hospital Available Beds for Emergencies and Disasters (HAvBED) system,  which is an inpatient bed tracking system designed to allow emergency  response entities to know where and what type of additional hospital beds  are available, in order to know which hospitals still have capacity to  receive patients. HAvBED reports the number of beds vacant/available at  the aggregate state level to HHS. To enhance consistency among state- reported data, HAvBED provides standard definitions of beds and data  elements each system must incorporate when reporting bed availability  during a mass casualty event.", "Additionally, HHS worked through AHRQ and contracted with nonfederal  entities to develop publications for states to use when preparing for  medical surge. For example, AHRQ published the document Mass Medical  Care with Scarce Resources: A Community Planning Guide to provide  states with information that would help them in their efforts to prepare for  medical surge, such as specific circumstances they may face in a mass  casualty event. This publication notes that the state may be faced with  allocating medical resources during a mass casualty event, such as  determining which patients will have access to mechanical ventilation.  The publication recommends that the states develop decision-making  guidelines on how to allocate these medical resources. The RAND  Corporation developed the publication Learning from Experience: The  Public Health Response to West Nile Virus, SARS, Monkeypox, and  Hepatitis A Outbreaks in the United States, which provides states with  information on challenges that they may face in a disease outbreak or  bioterrorist attack. AHRQ also published Reopening Shuttered Hospitals  to Expand Surge Capacity, which contains an action checklist that can be  used by states and local entities to identify organizations that have an  interest or responsibility in preparing for medical surge, and to determine  what resources each could provide.

Another state issued guidelines in  February 2008 for allocating scarce medical resources in a mass casualty  event that call for suspending or relaxing state laws covering medical care  and for explicit rationing of health care to save the most lives, and require  that the same allocation guidelines be used across the state. For example,  during a mass casualty event in this state, hospitals could ignore their  nurse-patient ratios and nurses could be assigned to jobs outside their  specific area of expertise. In addition, nonlicensed individuals, or retired  health care providers whose licenses had lapsed, could be recruited to  provide emergency care. For example, a nonmedical hospital employee  who had experience as a military medic could get an emergency credential  to stitch up wounds or start intravenous lines.

While 19 of 20 states we surveyed reported that they could  increase numbers of hospital beds in a mass casualty event, some state  officials were concerned about staffing these beds because of current  shortages in medical professionals, including nurses and physicians. Some  state officials reported that their states faced problems in increasing  hospital capacity because many of their rural areas had no hospital or  small numbers of medical providers. For example, officials from a largely  rural state reported that in many of the state\u2019s medically underserved  areas hospitals currently have vacant beds because they cannot hire  medical professionals to staff them. In addition, these officials reported  that because their hospitals did not provide pediatric intensive care or  burn care services and instead transferred these patients to neighboring  states, the state might not be able to provide these services during a mass  casualty event.", "State officials also reported that as time passed and no mass casualty  events occurred, increasing hospital capacity for a mass casualty event  seemed to be a waning priority for hospital chief executive officers. State  officials reported that it was difficult to continue to engage private-sector  hospital chief executive officers in emergency preparedness activities at a  time when these hospitals were facing day-to-day financial problems. For  example, officials from one state reported that hospitals in the state were  consolidating and closing, and officials from another state reported that  fewer hospitals were applying for ASPR Hospital Preparedness Program  funds. Officials from two other states reported that progress in preparing  emergency plans had slowed, especially for the smaller rural facilities,  because the Hospital Preparedness Program allows states to use these  funds to hire staff to assist with emergency planning but prohibits  hospitals from doing so. According to officials from one of these states,  hospital staff have had limited time to spend on emergency planning  activities because they must first attend to the operational needs of the  hospital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternate Care Site Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Some state officials reported that it was difficult to identify appropriate  fixed facilities for alternate care sites.

During the response to Hurricane Katrina, the Secretary of  HHS waived a number of statutory and regulatory requirements related to  medical care, and this waiver allowed for reimbursement of medical care  provided in alternate care sites. However, officials from several states  said that hospitals would prefer to know ahead of time under what  circumstances they would receive reimbursement from the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for medical care provided in  alternate care sites during a mass casualty event. State officials said that  having such information would make planning and exercising easier and  more realistic. CMS officials told us it would be very difficult to provide  specific guidance that would apply to all medical surge events and that the  agency preferred to issue guidance on a case-by-case basis following visits  to alternate care sites by CMS or Joint Commission officials during the  emergency. For example, after Hurricane Katrina, CMS officials visited  alternate care sites and the Secretary of HHS relaxed reimbursement  requirements for medical care provided in a hospital parking lot, the  convention center, and a department store.", "State officials also told us they were unclear how certain federal laws and  regulations that relate to medical care\u2014specifically, the privacy rule  issued by HHS under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor  Act (EMTALA)\u2014would apply in a mass casualty event, especially if the  care were provided in an alternate care site and not a hospital. EMTALA  requires hospital emergency rooms at Medicare-participating hospitals to  screen and treat for emergency medical conditions all individuals who  seek treatment. The HIPAA privacy rule prohibits the unauthorized  disclosure of individually identifiable health information by health care  providers and certain other entities. The Social Security Act authorizes  the Secretary of HHS to waive EMTALA and certain requirements under  the HIPAA privacy rule during national emergencies, such as a mass  casualty event. Federal guidance published in 2006 describes  circumstances where provisions related to emergency treatment and  privacy protections were temporarily suspended. AHRQ\u2019s publication  Providing Mass Medical Care with Scarce Resources: A Community  Planning Guide states that requiring hospitals to adhere to EMTALA  requirements during a mass casualty event could be unworkable because  of the large number of casualties. It notes that during Hurricane Katrina,  HHS temporarily suspended the application of EMTALA in affected  regions. This allowed hospitals to provide individuals\u2019 medical screening  examination at, or transfer them to, alternate care sites, such as a  convention center and department store. During Hurricane Katrina, HHS  also temporarily relaxed the sanctions and penalties arising from  noncompliance with certain provisions of the HIPAA privacy rule,  including the requirements to obtain a patient\u2019s agreement to speak with  family members or friends.

Officials from one state reported that since PAHPA was  enacted, recruiting of medical volunteers was more difficult and that the  federal government should clarify whether national deployment is a  possibility. ASPR officials said that they would not deploy medical  volunteers nationally without working through the states.", "Finally, some states expressed concerns about coordination among  programs that recruit medical volunteers for emergency response.  Officials from one state reported that federal volunteer registration  requirements for the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) and the ESAR-VHP  programs had not been coordinated, resulting in duplication of effort for  volunteers. For example, the volunteers registered in the MRC units in that  state also were expected by the state to register in the state electronic  medical volunteer registry. Officials from a second state reported that a  volunteer for one program that recruits medical volunteers is often a  potential volunteer for another such program, which could result in  volunteers being double-counted. For example, an emergency medical  technician registered in the electronic medical volunteer registry may also  volunteer for an MRC unit, a Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT),  and the American Red Cross.

For example, HHS estimates that in a severe influenza  pandemic almost 10 million people would require hospitalization, which  would exceed the current capacity of U.S. hospitals and necessitate  difficult choices regarding rationing of resources. HHS also estimates that  almost 1.5 million of these people would require care in an intensive care  unit and about 740,000 people would require mechanical ventilation. Even  with additional stockpiles of ventilators, there would likely not be a  sufficient supply to meet the need. Since some patients could not be put  on a ventilator, and others would be removed from the ventilator,  standards of care would have to be altered and providers would need to  determine which patients would receive them. In addition, some state  officials reported that medical volunteers are concerned about liability  issues in a mass casualty event. Specifically, state officials reported that  hospitals and medical providers might be reluctant to provide care during  a mass casualty event, when resources would be scarce and not all  patients would be able to receive care consistent with established  standards. According to these officials, these providers could be subject to  liability if decisions they made about altering standards of care resulted in  negative outcomes. For example, allowing staff to work outside the scope  of their practice, such as allowing nurses to diagnose and write medical  orders, could place these individuals at risk of liability.", "While some states reported using AHRQ\u2019s Mass Medical Care with Scarce  Resources: A Community Planning Guide to assist them as they  developed altered standards of care guidelines, some states also reported  that they needed additional assistance. States said that to develop altered  standards of care guidelines they must conduct activities such as  collecting and reviewing published guidance and convening experts to  discuss how to address the medical, ethical, and legal issues that could  arise during a mass casualty event. Four states reported that, when  developing their own guidelines on the allocation of ventilators, they were  using guidance from another state. This state estimated that a severe  influenza pandemic would require nearly nine times the state\u2019s current  capacity for intensive care beds and almost three times its current  ventilator capacity, which would require the state to address the rationing  of ventilators. In March 2006 the state convened a workgroup to consider  clinical and ethical issues in the allocation of mechanical ventilators in an  influenza pandemic. The state issued guidelines on the rationing of  ventilators that include both a process and an evaluation tool to determine  which patients should receive mechanical ventilation. The guidelines note  that the application of this process and evaluation tool could result in  withdrawing a ventilator from one patient to give it to another who is more  likely to survive\u2014a scenario that does not explicitly exist under  established standards of care. Additionally, some states suggested that the  federal government could help their efforts in several ways, such as by  convening medical, public health, and legal experts to address the  complex issues associated with allocating scarce resources during a mass  casualty event, or by developing demonstration projects to reveal best  practices employed by the various states. Recently, the Task Force for  Mass Critical Care, consisting of medical experts from both the public and  the private sectors, provided guidelines for allocating scarce critical care  resources in a mass casualty event that have the potential to assist states  in drafting their own guidelines. The task force\u2019s guidelines, which were  published in a medical journal in May 2008, provide a process for triaging  patients that includes three components\u2014inclusion criteria, exclusion  criteria, and prioritization of care. The exclusion criteria include patients  with a high risk of death, little likelihood of long-term survival, and a  corresponding low likelihood of benefit from critical care resources.

One state official suggested that using a 3-year funding cycle for the  Hospital Preparedness Program would allow for long-term planning with  more realistic work plans. It would also allow for more time for program  development and less time spent on program administration. ASPR  officials said that they were aware of the concern and were considering a  transition to a multiyear funding cycle beginning in 2009. Another concern  expressed by some state officials was that federal funding for ASPR\u2019s  Hospital Preparedness Program had decreased while program  requirements had increased, making it difficult for states to plan for  maintenance of emergency preparedness systems, meet new requirements,  and replace expired supplies. Hospital Preparedness Program funds  decreased about 18 percent from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2007.  Finally, many state officials were concerned about the new requirement  for matching funds.

However, because of the difficulty in addressing the related medical,  ethical, and legal issues, many states are only beginning to develop such  guidelines for use when there are not enough resources, such as  ventilators, to care for all affected patients. In a mass casualty event, such  guidelines would be a critical resource for medical providers who may  have to make repeated life-or-death decisions about which patients get or  lose access to these resources\u2014decisions that are not typically made in  routine circumstances. Additionally, these guidelines could help address  medical providers\u2019 concerns about ethics and liability that may ensue  when negative outcomes are associated with their decisions. In its role of  assisting states\u2019 efforts to plan for medical surge, HHS has not collected  altered standards of care guidelines that some states and medical experts  have developed and made them available to other states.
