Based on a Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act mandate, GAO analyzed (1) factors that EEO practitioners have identified as impeding the fair, prompt, and impartial processing of federal EEO complaints and (2) actions that EEO practitioners and other stakeholders think could be taken to help address those factors. GAO also identified actions that EEOC is taking to improve the federal complaint process. GAO surveyed 65 EEO practitioners representing a wide cross section of professionals knowledgeable about the federal EEO complaint process, who were selected from 16 federal agencies that accounted for about 88 percent of complaints filed in fiscal year 2005, EEOC, and private sector attorneys' offices. GAO did not assess the validity of practitioners' views or evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO analyzed and grouped into eight, the factors that EEO practitioners identified as those they believed impeded the fair, prompt, and impartial processing of federal EEO complaints: (1) lack of accountability by some agency officials and EEOC practitioners in carrying out their responsibilities; (2) lack of sufficient resources by some EEO programs and EEOC to fulfill their responsibilities; (3) lack of independence by some agency officials, including undue interference by some agency legal counsel and human resources officials in EEO matters; (4) insufficient knowledge and skills by some agency officials and EEO practitioners; (5) lack of authority by some EEO officials to dismiss cases that have no merit and lack of subpoena power by EEOC administrative judges (AJ); (6) lack of clarity in regulation and some guidance and consistent decisions from EEOC; (7) lack of effective communication by some EEO practitioners of relevant oral and written information to participants and that alternative dispute resolution is available; and (8) lack of a firm commitment by some agency management and EEO officials to the EEO process. The practitioners' views do not represent the official views of the selected agencies and should not be generalized to conclude that all federal agencies and EEO practitioners are deficient in all factors identified. Also, a few stakeholders GAO contacted stated that without the perception that the complaint process is fair, people may choose to not participate in it; GAO believes this concern is important and has been accounted for within the discussion of several of the factors. EEO practitioners surveyed and stakeholders suggested potential solutions to address the factors practitioners identified and provided information on relevant changes their agencies had made to the process. For example, to strengthen accountability, practitioners reported establishing measures for timeliness and quality for agency EEO professionals and those contracted to perform EEO complaint functions. To strengthen EEO staff's independence, several practitioners and stakeholders offered that agencies should adhere more clearly to existing EEOC requirements on delineating the roles of the agency general counsels in the EEO process. Stakeholders offered potential advantages and disadvantages to allowing complainants to file directly with EEOC as a means to avoid real or perceived conflicts of allowing an agency to investigate a complaint against itself. Several practitioners and EEOC officials stated that providing subpoena authority to AJs could help improve the efficiency of the EEO complaint process by compelling witnesses to testify. To help agencies achieve model EEO programs, EEOC has begun to measure agencies' progress in such areas as the timeliness of investigations. In June 2008, EEOC announced a proposal that includes provisions that may address some of the factors that practitioners identified. The proposal would require that agency EEO programs comply with EEOC regulations and other guidance and that EEOC review those programs for compliance. The proposal also would permit agencies to conduct pilot projects to test new ways to process EEO complaints that are not presently included in existing regulations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is the nation\u2019s largest employer and as such it has  a special responsibility to ensure equal opportunity of employment for its  employees and applicants for employment. In a high-performing  workplace, federal employees must be able to pursue the missions of their  organizations free from discrimination and should not fear or experience  retaliation or reprisal. To help achieve such a workplace,  antidiscrimination laws prohibit employment discrimination on the basis  of race, color, gender, religion, national origin, age, and disability. Federal  employees or applicants for employment who allege that they have been  discriminated against by a federal agency may file equal employment  opportunity (EEO) complaints with that agency. In addition, a person who  files an EEO complaint or participates in the investigation of such a  complaint is protected from retaliation.", "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued  regulations that govern how the EEO discrimination complaints of federal  employees are to be processed administratively and requires agencies to  provide for the prompt, fair, and impartial processing of complaints.  Under these regulations, the federal EEO process consists of two stages\u2014 informal or precomplaint counseling, and formal, when a complaint is filed  with the agency. The investigation into allegations of discrimination is a  key component of the formal EEO process. EEOC regulations require  agencies to investigate complaints they accept within 180 days.  Complainants may request a final decision from the agency or a hearing  before an EEOC administrative judge (AJ), who has another 180 days to  issue a decision. However, failures by agencies and EEOC to adhere to the  time frames in regulation have been a perennial concern.", "Delays in the processing of federal EEO complaints have been a long- standing concern of EEOC, other federal agencies, and Congress. Since  the mid-1990s, we have reported that the EEO complaint process was  inefficient, expensive, and time-consuming. For example, in 2000, we  testified that the complaint process and EEOC\u2019s role in eliminating  discrimination in the federal workplace had been targets of criticism  because of the rising number of complaints, growing backlogs of  unresolved cases, and increasing amount of time it takes to bring cases to  a close. In 2001 testimony during deliberation of the Notification and  Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation (No FEAR) Act, we  noted that the lack of data on the number of complaints of workplace  discrimination made it difficult for agency managers to understand the  nature and scope of issues in the workplace involving discrimination and  other conflicts and develop strategies for dealing with those issues. We  also stated that agencies and their leaders should be held accountable for  providing fair and equitable workplaces free from discrimination and that  individuals need to be held accountable for their actions in cases where  discrimination has occurred.", "In 2002, Congress passed the No FEAR Act amid concerns about  discrimination and retaliation against federal employees. Through various  provisions of the No FEAR Act, Congress sought to improve accountability  by federal agencies in complying with antidiscrimination laws, finding that  those agencies that practice or tolerate discrimination cannot be run  effectively. More recently, in 2008, the Merit Systems Protection Board  (MSPB) reported that its survey results on retaliation suggest that work  remains to be done in creating a workplace where employees can raise  concerns about organizational priorities, work processes, and personnel   policies and decisions without fear of retaliation and where managers can  respond to such concerns openly and constructively.", "Various requirements in the act, including those for agencies to report on  the cases of alleged discrimination and their disposition and the number of  employees disciplined for discrimination, were intended to enable  Congress to more effectively oversee compliance by agencies. One  mandate in the act required us to evaluate the effect on agencies and  EEOC of allowing complainants to bypass the agency complaint process  and instead file complaints directly with EEOC.", "Based on discussions and agreement with interested committees, we  analyzed underlying concerns with the federal EEO complaint process and  potential options and solutions for addressing them.

Because these practitioners represent  different parts of the complaint process and some of the practitioners may  only be familiar with their part of the process, we could not tally the  number of responses under each factor. While recognizing that the factors  the practitioners identified are not necessarily discrete, we analyzed and  grouped them into eight broad categories of factors and then asked those  same EEO practitioners to rank them in terms of their importance for  improving the federal EEO complaint process. These factors and their  rankings are (1) lack of accountability on the part of some agency  management officials and EEO practitioners in carrying out their  responsibilities; (2) insufficient resources for some agency EEO offices  and EEOC to fulfill their responsibilities; (3) lack of independence  concerning the potential conflict of having agencies conduct their own  EEO complaint investigations and the undue influence of some agency  legal counsel and human resources officials on the EEO process;   (4) insufficient knowledge and skills by some agency officials,  complainants, and EEO practitioners to fulfill their responsibilities;   (5) lack of authority by some EEO officials to dismiss cases that have no  merit and lack of subpoena power by EEOC AJs; (6) lack of clarity in  regulation and some guidance and consistent decisions from EEOC;   (7) lack of effective communication by some EEO practitioners of relevant  oral and written information to participants in the process and that ADR  (e.g., conciliation, facilitation, or mediation) is available; and (8) lack of a  firm commitment by some agency management and EEO officials to the  EEO process.", "In our discussions with stakeholders, they generally concurred with these  eight factors. In addition, a few stakeholders identified the perception of  unfairness as an overarching theme. These stakeholders commented that  without the perception that the complaint process is fair, people may be  frustrated and choose to not participate in it. We discussed with these  stakeholders that fairness is indeed one of the goals of the EEO  complaints process, along with promptness and impartiality. The  perception that the system is not fair, among other issues, has led to calls  for reform and is directly related to our effort in this review to identify  factors that need to be addressed. We agree that this concern is important  and believe it has been accounted for within the context of the discussion  on factors related to accountability; independence; and clarity in  regulation, guidance, and consistent EEOC decisions.", "The eight factors are consistent with concerns raised previously about  problems with the federal sector EEO complaint process. For example, in  November 2002, EEOC held an open meeting to address issues with the  EEO complaint process amid concerns from stakeholders representing  both complainants and federal agencies that the process is \u201cmuch too  slow, far too expensive, unnecessarily cumbersome, and given to potential  conflicts of interest.\u201d In March 2003, a coalition of civil rights employee  advocates and other stakeholder groups submitted a seven-step proposal  to EEOC commissioners to improve the federal sector EEO complaint  process. This proposal included steps to make ADR mandatory for  managers in the informal and formal stages of the administrative process  and have EEO directors report directly to the agency head, and a  recommendation that EEOC adopt a uniform standard for what states a  claim of employment discrimination. Additionally, in September 2006, the  commission held a meeting where stakeholders discussed the practices  that work in obtaining a timely, thorough, and complete investigation as  well as the barriers that prevent such investigations. One issue raised in  that meeting was the lack of consequences (related to accountability) for  agencies that do not comply with the 180-day requirement to complete  investigations. A commissioner noted that a double standard exists,  because a complaint would be dismissed if a complainant missed any of  the deadlines. The quality of investigations was another issue\u2014for both in- house and contract investigations.

Another agency  practitioner said that internal delays are also caused by a lack of resources  in agency EEO offices. Several EEO practitioners stated that retirements  and reassignments have made it difficult to keep counselors in agency  EEO offices. Others mentioned problems with staffing levels at EEOC.

Overall, from  the limited assessment, the AJs reported that most of the reports of  investigation were complete and well organized, containing enough  evidence to allow the AJ to proceed with the hearing process. However,  the AJs reported that several agencies routinely submitted reports of  investigation that were particularly lacking and described common  deficiencies, including reports being disorganized and containing  duplicative materials, being incomplete and always late, and containing an  investigator\u2019s statement of the claim that was legally insufficient. EEOC  officials noted that the commission is considering developing a formal  Quality Control Evaluation system that would rate the quality of agency  investigations. However, EEOC officials did not provide a proposed time  frame for this effort.", "Respondents also reported their agencies\u2019 making greater use of  information technology to process and track complaints. One practitioner  noted that his agency had automated several features of the EEO  complaint process, including the format of decisions through use of  boilerplate language that can be selected for routine matters; parts of  decision writing with its forms, such as coversheets, code sheets, and  envelopes; and storage of case files that are scanned into the Adobe  Acrobat program, thereby expediting the reviewing, bookmarking, and  searching of these files. One EEO director reported that her agency  standardized EEO complaint forms, installed the forms on compact discs  that were furnished to all counselors, trained the counselors in the use of  the electronic forms, and purchased an automated complaints tracking  system to simplify and standardize EEO-related reports. Several  practitioners (EEO directors, an EEO counselor, agency legal counsel, and  an investigator) indicated that their agencies had put in place a complaints  tracking system, which helps in the preparation of standardized reports.  Without a system like this one, several reported, much time is consumed  finding the information that needs to be in such reports. An official from  EEOC\u2019s Office of Field Programs indicated that EEOC has begun piloting  an electronic case management system to provide more expeditious  hearings case processing.

One practitioner, an EEO investigator, reported two  ways her agency uses resources efficiently. First, the investigator stated  that her agency was shifting away from staff investigators and FAD writers  to greater reliance on contractors and that the two firms her agency used  delivered good quality products and were faster and more cost-effective  than agency staff. Second, the investigator also reported that her agency  was engaged in an activity-based costing exercise, so staff must account  for all complaint-processing-related tasks, which her office can then cost  out to the bureau where the complaints arose, allowing the bureaus to  focus on early resolution to keep costs down. In addition, the greater use  of information technology by some agencies, which was cited earlier as  assisting agencies in saving time, can also help them in keeping costs  down. An EEO director stated that EEOC should have the capacity to  process workloads and accept evidence, records, and files electronically.  At EEOC, where its hearings inventory has increased but its  appropriations have generally remained constant, EEOC officials said that  as of April 2009, the agency was in the process of completing draft  instructions to implement the pilot \u201cThree-Track Case Management  Process\u201d system for hearings that the agency expects will result in quicker  resolutions and shorter processing times through expedited discovery and  hearing time frames using its existing resources. Under this process, AJs  would prioritize their cases based on complexity, using one of three  tracks: fast, regular, or complex.", "Further, it is necessary that agencies assess the quality as well as the costs  associated with contracted investigations and proposed FADs. EEOC\u2019s  2004 report on federal sector investigations and costs found that some  agencies were incurring additional costs when they had to supplement the  investigative report or require the contractor to conduct additional work,  which could contribute to delays in meeting time frames. Several  practitioners mentioned that agencies need to have better reviewers for  sufficiency of investigations and to do quality control. For example, an  agency legal counsel stated that at his agency, the EEO office reviews  contracted reports of investigation and draft FADs but that reports of  investigation were not always reviewed for completeness and relevance  before being provided to the complainants.

In its  fiscal year 2007 report on the federal workforce, EEOC reported that 61  percent of the EEO directors reported to the agency head. In addition,  EEOC\u2019s MD-110 states that to maintain the integrity of the EEO  investigative process, it should be kept separate from the agency\u2019s  personnel function, to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of such  conflicts. Moreover, MD-110 states that separating the agency\u2019s  representatives and the offices responsible for defending the agency  against EEO complaints from those responsible for conducting EEO  complaint investigations enhances the credibility of the EEO office and  the integrity of the EEO complaint process.", "At least three-quarters of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and respondents from EEOC  indicated that strengthening independence for EEO directors and EEO  investigators was very or extremely important. Further, several EEO  practitioners believe that agencies should adhere more clearly to existing  EEOC requirements on delineating the roles of the agency general  counsels in the EEO complaint process. For example, an EEO director  stated that EEO legal advisors should be separate and distinct from the  agency\u2019s legal office and should report to the head of the civil rights office  instead of to agency legal counsel. Several EEO practitioners also stated  that agency human resources offices should be required to avoid activities  or actions that may be construed as having undue influence. An AJ favored  having clear firewalls between the human resources and EEO offices  when investigating complaints. In its March 2003 proposal, the coalition of  civil rights employee advocates and other stakeholder groups  recommended that EEOC\u2019s regulations and MD-110 be changed to clearly  prohibit agency actions that interfere with the independent judgment of  the EEO investigator. Noting that stakeholders have complained of  intrusion in the operations of the agency EEO office by staff responsible  for defending the agency against complaints of discrimination and that  such intrusion could affect the impartiality of the investigation, EEOC  officials stated that EEOC has draft guidance on the intrusion into the  EEO process by agency counsel, especially in the informal part of the  process, which is being reviewed by the commissioners.", "Because of the concern that the practice of allowing an agency to  investigate a complaint against itself can represent either a clear conflict  of interest or the appearance of such conflict, practitioners cited filing  complaints directly with EEOC as a means of avoiding such conflicts.  Allowing such filings would alter the current administrative complaint  process. Stakeholders cited several advantages to having EEOC conduct  investigations. One advantage would be its potential to reduce concerns  regarding independence, conflicts of interest, and perceptions of  unfairness surrounding the existing federal EEO complaint process.  Another advantage stakeholders cited was EEOC\u2019s potential to leverage its  expertise, which in addition to administering the federal sector EEO  process, promulgating regulations, providing EEO training, and collecting  governmentwide data on EEO activities, also includes investigating private  sector complaints of discrimination. According to stakeholders, potential  disadvantages of transferring investigations to EEOC included  adding an immense burden along with insufficient resources for EEOC  to handle the larger workload, which would add more time to the  complaint process and compound the time it takes EEOC to make  decisions in EEO complaint processing, and  creating tension between the various roles the agency is responsible  for when one agency is afforded too many functions (e.g.,  investigations, decisions, and appeals) under the EEO process, which  may impair neutrality, fairness, and accountability.", "EEOC officials noted that an overwhelming number of stakeholders who  testified at the September 7, 2006, commission meeting or participated in  focus groups conducted after that meeting recommended that EEOC take  over the investigative function in its entirety from the agencies or that  some type of independent body apart from EEOC assume this function.  According to EEOC officials, stakeholders cited the conflict of interest  perception and agencies\u2019 failure to complete their investigations in a  timely manner as the principal reasons. EEOC also noted its belief that  having it conduct the federal sector investigations would also bring  efficiency, uniformity, and quality to the process as the commission would  either hire a cadre of investigators dedicated to the federal sector or  possibly act as a conduit for contract investigations. In the past, EEOC  stated that fiscal realities have prevented it from assuming responsibility  for all federal sector investigations, noting that in fiscal year 2008,  agencies conducted over 11,000 investigations at a cost of a little more  than $36 million. Thus, according to EEOC officials, the resource  implications of EEOC assuming the investigative function would be  considerable, and the various ways of funding investigations by EEOC  need further study.", "Several EEO practitioners mentioned addressing independence through  the use of contractors for conducting investigations and drafting FADs.  The Postal Service\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that the Postal  Service contracts investigations to enhance the independence and  neutrality of the EEO administrative process and to improve the overall  quality and efficiency of investigations. The report states that a single  office from the Postal Service National EEO Investigative Services Office  oversees investigations and contract FAD writers.

Almost three-quarters of respondents cited enhancing the  knowledge and skills of EEO directors and agency management as very or  extremely important, and about two-thirds of respondents cited enhancing  the knowledge and skills of EEO counselors as very or extremely  important. Several EEO practitioners offered suggestions for enhancing  the knowledge and skills of EEO staff. For example, a plaintiffs\u2019 attorney  offered that counselors should be required to spend at least 8 hours  observing an experienced counselor before providing counseling. EEOC\u2019s  MD-110 requires at least 32 hours of counselor training before providing  counseling as well as 8 hours of continuing annual training. As for  investigators, another plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, noting that the minimum  requirements in EEOC guidance for investigators is insufficient, stated that  EEOC should expand the minimum training and experience requirements  and require additional annual continuing education. Similar to the training  required for counselors, MD-110 also requires at least 32 hours of  investigator training before conducting investigations as well as 8 hours of  continuing annual training. Several practitioners and stakeholders  suggested that investigators should receive some kind of certification. One  practitioner recommended that EEOC certify individual investigator  credentials through a combination of agency-provided training or by  licensing training programs that meet EEOC-established minimum  requirements, and require every investigator, whether in-house agency  employee or contract investigator, to apply for and be certified as meeting  the minimum requirements.", "Some respondents said that their organizations had improved training for  EEO staff. For example, an EEO director reported that her agency has  standardized its basic and advanced EEO counselor training class.

All bureaus send  counselors to the same course, and counselors are issued credentials at  the end of the training by the agency.

This practitioner noted that providing  all EEO staff with all available EEOC training can enhance their  understanding of the process from start to finish, thereby increasing  completeness, accuracy, and effectiveness of complaint processing. An  EEO counselor from another agency reported that at her agency there is a  focus on developing the legal analysis skill set of EEO specialists who  process complaints. During team meetings, the EEO specialists review  intake decisions and FADs that they have prepared, and the specialists  brief the team on the legal analysis conducted and the rationale for  decisions.

In addition, EEO practitioners  expressed the desire for expanded authority for (1) EEO directors to  dismiss complaints of discrimination and (2) EEOC to order discipline  against managers who discriminate. Practitioners also expressed a desire  for EEOC to make sufficient use of its authority to sanction agencies that  do not complete investigations on time.", "Several EEO practitioners felt that allowing AJs to subpoena witnesses  would improve the EEO complaint process. An agency legal counsel cited  cases where the agency and complainant suffer when potential witnesses,  such as those who are no longer with the agency, refuse to testify. Until  AJs are given such power, a plaintiffs\u2019 attorney felt that the administrative  complaint process cannot serve its intended purpose as a viable  alternative to litigation in federal courts. While EEOC AJs have authority  to sanction an agency for failure to produce an approved witness who is a  federal employee, they do not have the authority to subpoena the  statements of individuals and therefore have no mechanism with which to  compel the testimony of witnesses who are not current federal employees.  With respect to subpoena power, according to MSPB officials, the board  has delegated to its regional directors/chief administrative judges and AJs  the authority to subpoena witnesses. EEOC officials also favor granting  EEOC\u2019s AJs subpoena power, noting that AJs have often voiced the belief  that their lack of subpoena power is a significant defect in the hearings  process, in many cases hindering their ability to conduct full and fair  hearings. For instance, without subpoena authority, it is often difficult for  AJs to compel a potential witness for the complainant, such as an agency\u2019s  outside medical personnel or a contractor employee, to testify on the  complainant\u2019s behalf. Although AJs use a variety of means to try to  persuade former employees, contractors, and outside medical personnel  to testify, it would be more efficient if AJs possessed subpoena authority.  EEOC officials stated that having subpoena authority would further ensure  that AJs have access to all relevant evidence. However, according to  EEOC\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, granting subpoena power to AJs would  potentially require a statutory change. According to a senior EEOC  official, EEOC has not sought such a statutory change.", "An example of expanded authority for EEO directors relates to the  dismissal of complaints of discrimination. EEOC regulations set out  circumstances under which complaints can be dismissed, including  complaints that fail to state a claim of discrimination. In this regard, EEOC  has consistently reversed agencies\u2019 dismissals for failure to state a claim  where the agency dismissal is based on the agency\u2019s view of the ultimate  merit of the complaint allegations. An EEO investigator stated that EEO  directors should be given the authority to make a merit analysis to dismiss  those claims that are frivolous and show self-defeating evidence to ensure  quicker and less costly processing of cases. In cases that are dismissed,  complainants could still appeal such decisions to EEOC.", "As for the authority to order discipline for managers who have been found  to have discriminated, EEOC\u2019s practice is to advise rather than direct  agencies to consider disciplining such managers. In addition, the No FEAR  Act requires agencies to report information annually on disciplinary  actions taken. The act also requires the President\u2019s designee, the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM), to undertake a study of best practices  among agencies for taking disciplinary action for conduct inconsistent  with antidiscrimination laws and whistleblower protection laws.

Primarily, practitioners  indicated that increasing the consistency of decisions at several levels  within EEOC was very or extremely important: decisions from EEOC\u2019s  OFO appellate attorneys, decisions by AJs, and decisions resulting from  requests for reconsideration of appeals decisions. An EEO investigator  suggested that EEOC\u2019s OFO should index its decisions and cross-check  them for consistency so that only those decisions that express a cogent,  correct application of the law should be indexed and made available as  precedent.

According to EEOC, such programs can help agencies to avoid the time  and costs associated with more formal dispute resolution processes and  improve workforce communication and morale. Almost all respondents  indicated that improving communication during the informal or  precomplaint phase, claim acceptance/dismissal, and complaint  investigation was very or extremely important. Also, about three-quarters  of respondents indicated that improving communication during ADR was  very or extremely important. Several EEO practitioners suggested that  ADR should be used more often in disputes or even made mandatory. For  example, a plaintiffs\u2019 attorney offered that for ADR to be successful,  agencies need to ensure that officials do not merely \u201cgo through the  motion\u201d on ADR but that an official at an appropriate level of authority  represents management and that this official has settlement authority. In  addition, in its March 2003 proposal, a coalition of civil rights employee  advocates and other stakeholder groups recommended making ADR  mandatory for managers in the informal and formal stages of the  administrative process and for EEOC hearings.", "Several counselors reported that their agencies gave employees the option  of using ADR in the informal and formal stages of the EEO complaint  process as a means for resolving an EEO concern. According to one  counselor, using ADR in this way focuses both parties on the objective of  resolving the conflict rather than defending their respective positions.  Another counselor reported that at her agency, at the time that contact is  made with the informal EEO process, her agency gives employees the  option\u2014explained verbally and in writing\u2014of traditional counseling or  mediation (i.e., a type of ADR) when they initially begin the informal EEO  process.

Among the indicators measured were timeliness of investigations, FADs,  and submission of complaint files for hearings and appeals. EEOC also  measured agencies\u2019 use of ADR. EPCA does not evaluate agencies on the  quality of their investigations, but according to EEOC officials, the  Commission is currently examining how to incorporate agencies\u2019 quality of  investigations as a performance measure under EPCA. In the EEO  program outcome indicators section, EPCA includes selected responses  from OPM\u2019s fiscal year 2006 Federal Human Capital Survey to five survey  questions as \u201cproxy outcome indicators\u201d to gauge each agency\u2019s progress  in creating a fair and inclusive workplace. The outcome indicators section  also includes workforce analyses based on race, national origin, gender,  and targeted disabilities that show how a particular agency\u2019s workforce is  composed by major occupation and compare it to the civilian labor force;  provides an odds ratio analysis on promotions in the senior grade levels;  and shows agencies how they compare to the federal government as a  whole on various climate and other issues. During our audit work,  agencies\u2019 EPCA results were available to the public on EEOC\u2019s Web site;  however, EEOC has since removed the results. According to a senior  EEOC official, EEOC is evaluating the appropriate use of the program  indicators in EPCA in an attempt to ensure that the indicators chosen are  accurate measures of the performance of agency EEO programs. The  official did not provide a time frame for this evaluation.", "In addition to EPCA, EEOC stated in its fiscal year 2008 performance and  accountability report that a key strategy in its efforts to be more  responsive to federal agencies was the continued development of its  relationship management pilot. This initiative was first piloted in fiscal  year 2004 and involves EEOC personnel partnering with EEO staff in 11  agencies in a consultative relationship to improve customer service and  help them successfully implement the essential elements of MD-715\u2019s  model EEO program. In addition to these activities, EEOC staff provide  trend analysis feedback to selected agencies on their MD-715 submissions,  and EEOC is conducting on-site reviews of five agencies with high  underrepresentation of racial minorities at the Senior Executive Service  level and of another agency to investigate a spike in retaliation complaints.", "Finally, in June 2008, EEOC announced a proposal that brought together  previous EEOC commissioners\u2019 efforts. Among the changes contained in  the notice, are the following:    A requirement that agency EEO programs comply with EEOC  regulations, MDs (MD-110 and MD-715), and management bulletins  and that EEOC will review agency programs for compliance.", "Permission from EEOC for agencies to conduct pilot projects\u2014usually  for not more than 12 months\u2014for processing complaints in ways other  than those prescribed in EEOC regulations (Part 1614).", "A requirement that an agency that has not completed an EEO  investigation within the 180-day time limit notify the complainant in  writing that the investigation is not complete and when it will be  completed and that the complainant has the right to request a hearing  or file a lawsuit.", "The proposals for EEOC to review compliance with its regulations, MDs,  and other guidance and to provide additional notification to complainants  have the potential for an immediate impact on the EEO complaint process.", "By reviewing compliance, EEOC could address several of the factors that  EEO practitioners indicated impede the timely processing of complaints  and independence. For example, requiring agency compliance with  regulations and MDs delineating the reporting lines of authority for EEO  Directors and the roles of agency offices of general counsel in the EEO  complaint process could help strengthen the independence of EEO  professionals to fulfill their responsibilities. As we stated earlier, EEOC  stated its belief that a requirement to notify the complainant in writing  about complaints that have not been investigated within 180 days may  provide an incentive for agencies to complete investigations in a timely  manner.", "Pilot projects could provide helpful data with which EEOC could make  decisions about future improvements to the federal sector EEO complaint  process. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) had the authority  to operate pilot programs outside of the procedural requirements  prescribed by EEOC to improve processes for the resolution of EEO  complaints by civilian employees of DOD. DOD operated three such  programs between 2005 and 2007, although only one of the three DOD  pilot programs met the criteria of \u201coperating outside of EEOC regulations.\u201d", "The other two operated within the framework of EEOC regulations by  increasing the use of ADR to informally settle disputes before they became  formal complaints. Our prior work on the DOD pilot programs showed the  importance of having a sound evaluation plan, including key features that  are essential for assessing the performance of the pilot programs and  making determinations regarding the wider applications of the pilot  programs.", "Some key features of a sound evaluation plan include the following:    Well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives.", "Measures that are directly linked to the program objectives.", "Criteria for determining pilot program performance.", "A way to isolate the effects of the pilot programs.", "A data analysis plan for the evaluation design.", "A detailed plan to ensure that data collection, entry, and storage are  reliable and error free.", "In addition to the importance of having a strong evaluation program, our  work on the DOD pilots also identified lessons learned that can be  instrumental for EEOC and potential pilot program officials as they  consider whether to institute pilot projects to address concerns that have  been identified with the EEO complaint process. For example, it is  important to (1) involve senior management and stakeholder groups in  designing, implementing, and evaluating the pilot program to help with  buy-in; (2) emphasize the importance of customer feedback; and   (3) include mechanisms to solicit such feedback.", "As of May 2009, EEOC had not issued its notice of proposed rulemaking  outlining such specific features as the number of pilot projects, how they  will operate, or how they will be evaluated. The solutions that EEO  practitioners and others have offered to improve the quality and timeliness  of investigations may provide candidates for the pilot projects, allowing  EEOC to make data-driven decisions about changes to the federal EEO  complaint process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Equal opportunity in the federal workplace is key to enabling federal  agencies to meet the complex needs of our nation.

Holding agencies accountable for  adhering to EEOC regulations and guidance will help EEOC to ensure that  the EEO complaint process is operating as intended. EEO practitioners  and others have identified shortcomings in the operation of the federal  EEO process at both the agencies and EEOC. Some of these shortcomings  could potentially be addressed through additional guidance that EEOC has  stated it intends to issue in such areas as the appropriate relationship  between EEO offices and offices involved in defending the agencies  against discrimination complaints as well as what constitutes a claim; it  will be important for the commission to follow through with this guidance.  Additionally, EEOC is considering allowing agencies to conduct pilot  projects for processing complaints outside of EEOC regulations. If  agencies were to participate in pilot projects, it would be important for  them to have well-developed evaluation plans that include key evaluation  features. Pilots that are undertaken without sound evaluation plans  increase the likelihood of insufficient or unreliable data, limiting  confidence in pilot project results. Without confidence in pilot project  results, EEOC will be limited in its decision making regarding the pilot  projects, and to the extent that proposed changes in the federal EEO  complaint process require congressional action, Congress will be limited  in its decision making about the pilot projects\u2019 potential broader  application."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["If pilot projects are approved by EEOC, we recommend that the Acting  Chairman of EEOC take the following two actions:    Direct pilot project officials to develop for each pilot project an  evaluation plan that includes key features to improve the likelihood  that pilot project evaluations will yield sound results, such as    well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives;  measures that are directly linked to the program objectives;  criteria for determining pilot program performance;  a way to isolate the effects of the pilot programs;  a data analysis plan for the evaluation design; and  a detailed plan to ensure that data collection, entry, and storage are   reliable and error free.", "Direct commission staff to review and approve pilot projects\u2019  evaluation plans to increase the likelihood that evaluations will yield  methodologically sound results, thereby supporting effective program  and policy decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to EEOC for review and comment.

The 17 agencies that we selected on the  basis of the number of complaints filed and the mechanism for EEO  investigations were the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense,  Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the  Interior, Justice, Transportation, the Treasury, State, and Veterans Affairs;  the Environmental Protection Agency; the General Services  Administration; the Office of Personnel Management; and the U.S. Postal  Service.

(2) What specific changes could be made  to address the factors you listed above, in order to promote the prompt,  fair, and impartial processing of federal EEO complaints? (3) What  changes have been made to the EEO complaint process at your agency?  What effects did these changes have on the prompt, fair, and impartial  processing of EEO complaints at your agency?", "Before launching each survey, we conducted a series of pretests with  internal and external EEO practitioners, including some actual survey  respondents. The goals of the pretests were to check that (1) the questions  were clear and unambiguous and (2) the terminology was used correctly.  To conduct pretests, we selected representatives from several practitioner  categories, provided them with survey drafts for their review, and  interviewed them either in person or by teleconference to obtain their  opinions about the language, format, and tone of questions in the survey.  Based on the reactions of practitioners, we changed the survey content  and format during pretesting as necessary. We also conducted usability  tests that entailed checking each practitioner\u2019s password, user name, and  link to ensure their operability before we launched the Web survey.", "To activate the survey, we posted it to the Internet. We notified the 63 EEO  practitioners of the availability of the questionnaire with an e-mail  message that contained a unique user name and password that allowed  each respondent to log on and fill out a questionnaire while preventing  respondents from gaining access to the surveys of others. Using their  access information, practitioners could access the survey on the Internet  at any time and could complete it at their convenience. If practitioners did  not respond to the confidential link we provided, we accepted official  submissions for responses in another format (e.g., e-mail). Access to the  Phase I survey formally began on April 9, 2007, after which practitioners  had approximately 8 weeks from April 2007 through May 2007 to complete  the survey. While the survey was ongoing, we wrote follow-up e-mails and  made telephone calls to practitioners who did not initially respond to the  survey to ensure that we made every effort to reach them.", "Of the 63 practitioners to whom we made the Phase I survey available, 1  practitioner informed us that she did not work in one of our practitioner  categories. As she was the only respondent from her agency, we sent the  survey to another EEO practitioner at that agency. When we did not  receive a response from another practitioner at another agency, we then  sent the survey to an official from her agency, because that official\u2019s office  is in charge of the discrimination complaint counseling and investigation  processes and alternative dispute resolution. Thus, we selected 65  practitioners to participate in the Phase I Web-based survey. By June 2007,  of the 65, 62, or about 95 percent of the EEO practitioners, had completed  the Phase I survey.
