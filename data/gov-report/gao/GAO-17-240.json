With increased productivity and technological innovation, the sector experienced a decreasing number of jobs and share of the economy. GAO was asked to examine how the federal government supports manufacturing.", "This report examines (1) how selected federal programs and tax expenditures provide support to U.S. manufacturing; (2) how programs are addressing manufacturing trends; and (3) the extent to which agencies measure performance and assess effectiveness in support of manufacturing generally, and advanced manufacturing specifically. GAO reviewed selected programs with a focus on manufacturing, among other criteria, and conducted a survey of these selected programs to collect data on their budget, activities, and effects. GAO also reviewed reports and interviewed agency officials and experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified 58 programs in 11 federal agencies that reported providing support to U.S. manufacturing by fostering innovation through research and development, assisting with trade in the global marketplace, helping job seekers enhance skills and obtain employment, and providing general financing or business assistance. Twenty-one of these programs reported using all of their obligations in fiscal year 2015 to support U.S. manufacturing. For these 21 programs, obligations of each program ranged from $750,000 to $204 million in fiscal year 2015, the most recent full year of data. Twenty-six other programs reported using funding to support manufacturing\u2014in addition to other sectors\u2014and provided ranges of estimates for the obligations directly supporting manufacturing. The remaining 11 programs either did not provide an estimate of their support to manufacturing or reported no program obligations in fiscal year 2015. GAO also identified nine tax expenditures that can provide benefits to manufacturers, amounting to billions of dollars in incentives for both the manufacturing sector and other sectors of the economy.", "Most (51) of the 58 programs reported addressing trends toward an increase in advanced manufacturing (e.g. activities using automation, software, or cutting edge materials), the need for a higher-skilled workforce, and more global trade competition for U.S. manufacturers by providing funds and resources, sharing information, and promoting coordination. Survey responses from the 58 programs indicated that more than two-thirds of them are addressing the shift toward advanced manufacturing, approximately half are taking steps to address increased globalization and competition, and fewer than half are addressing the need for a higher skilled workforce.", "Forty-four of the 58 programs reported having performance goals or measures related to the support of manufacturing, but agencies that comprise an interagency group have not identified the information they will collect from agencies and use to report progress in supporting advanced manufacturing. Ten of the 11 agencies that administer programs GAO reviewed participate in a federal interagency initiative to coordinate activities and report on progress in the area of advanced manufacturing. The Subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing\u2014co-chaired by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and that coordinates advanced manufacturing efforts\u2014supports the updating and reporting on a National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing. The plan, which was published in 2012, identifies objectives and potential measures that could be used to assess progress. The subcommittee plans to report in 2018 on progress in achieving the strategic plan's objectives, as required by the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014. However, OSTP has not worked with the subcommittee member agencies to identify the information needed to report progress in achieving the strategic objectives, such as what measures will be used. While subcommittee officials said the subcommittee does not provide top-down direction to federal agencies on how to measure effectiveness, specifying the information it will collect from federal agencies would better position it to report consistent and comprehensive information on the progress in achieving the plan's objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["OSTP should identify the information it will collect from agencies to determine their progress in achieving the objectives of the National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing.

Over the  last several decades, U.S. manufacturing has undergone changes  marked by increased productivity and technological innovation. However,  these changes have been accompanied by a decline in the number of  jobs in manufacturing and increased competition from other countries.", "The federal government employs a broad range of programs and tax  expenditures that can influence the manufacturing sector by helping  businesses improve their efficiency, update their technologies, export  their products, train their workers, and that can offer financial support in  the form of loans or loan guarantees, among other things. These  programs and tax expenditures are administered and overseen by a  variety of federal agencies, and there is limited information on how they  support manufacturing.", "You asked us to provide information on how the federal government  supports manufacturing. This report examines the following four  questions:  1. How do selected federal programs provide support to U.S. manufacturing? 2. How do selected federal tax expenditures provide support to U.S. manufacturing? 3. How, if at all, do selected federal programs address manufacturing trends, and what, if any, challenges do they face? 4. To what extent do federal agencies measure performance and assess effectiveness in support of manufacturing generally, and advanced manufacturing specifically?", "To answer these questions, we identified selected manufacturing-related  federal programs and tax expenditures, surveyed program officials,  reviewed relevant reports, interviewed selected experts and agency  officials, and conducted two site visits. To select programs and tax  expenditures, we reviewed relevant GAO and Congressional Research  Service (CRS) reports and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,  and we identified federal agencies that, according to those sources,  administered programs that supported manufacturing. We then  contacted each of these agencies to obtain input about their programs.  Programs included in our analysis met the following criteria: The program  (1) was operational in fiscal year 2014 and at the time of selection in  2015, (2) had an identifiable focus on manufacturing, and (3) was not  part of a larger manufacturing program. Next we contacted each agency  again and requested that they confirm the programs we identified support  manufacturing.", "In addition, we administered a web-based survey to the identified  program officials and collected, among other data, descriptive program  information, budget and participation data, information on efforts to  address manufacturing trends, and performance and evaluation  information.

In developing this report, we did not conduct a  legal analysis to confirm the various descriptions of the programs,  including information on their budgetary obligations, program goals, or  intent. Further, we did not review or analyze agencies\u2019 financial data or  materials prepared by the agencies in connection with the annual budget  and appropriations process.", "To gather further insight into federal programs that support  manufacturing, we conducted site visits to Chicago, IL and Knoxville, TN,  interviewed local program officials, and visited manufacturers who  participate in some of these programs. We selected these cities because  several of the manufacturing programs we identified were operating there.", "To identify tax expenditures that provide support to manufacturing, we  reviewed relevant reports from CRS and estimates from the Department  of the Treasury (Treasury) and the U.S. Congress Joint Committee on  Taxation to characterize the scope and cost of tax code provisions related  to manufacturing.", "To identify manufacturing trends, we reviewed reports from the  President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and  the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), and we spoke to  seven experts about the manufacturing sector. These experts were  selected for their knowledge of the manufacturing sector, and they came  from nonprofit institutions such as the National Academy of Engineering,  federal agencies such as the Department of Commerce (DOC) and  National Science Foundation, private companies such as Palo Alto  Research Center, and think tanks such as the Information Technology  and Innovation Foundation. We also collected data through our survey  about how federal programs are responding to trends in the  manufacturing sector.", "To examine the extent to which federal agencies measure their  performance and assess their effectiveness in support of manufacturing  generally and advanced manufacturing specifically, we asked program  officials in our survey what manufacturing-related performance goals and  metrics they used and what program evaluations had been conducted or  planned in the past 5 years to assess any impact that the program had on  the U.S. manufacturing sector.

The Knoxville center also  seeks to assist local companies with the export process by helping to  locate distributors for their products, according to local officials.", "Providing financial support. Based on our survey, 2 of the 11 programs  we identified provide various types of financial support to companies or  their customers that are unable to obtain financing from the private sector  or have been affected by import competition. For example, according to  the Export-Import Bank, it supports companies by using three main types  of financial products:  fixed-rate loans directly to foreign buyers of U.S. goods and services;  loan guarantees to commercial lenders to cover repayment risks on  foreign buyers\u2019 debt obligations incurred to purchase U.S. exports;  and export credit insurance, which supports U.S. exporters selling goods  overseas by protecting them against the risk of foreign buyer or other  foreign debtor default.", "According to the Export-Import Bank\u2019s fiscal year 2015 annual report, the  Bank authorized 41 loans and 344 loan guarantees, in a range of sectors,  including, but not limited to, manufacturing. In one instance, the Export- Import Bank guaranteed commercial loans to support the export of  bridges manufactured by a U.S.-based company. According to the  Export-Import Bank, these guarantees allowed the manufacturer to gain  entry into foreign markets, and they also supported jobs in the United  States.", "Another program we surveyed that seeks to provide financial support,  among other things, is the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms  program, which is administered by DOC. According to our survey, the  program supports a network of trade adjustment assistance centers that  work with manufacturers that have been affected by competition from  imported products. These centers aim to help manufacturers develop and  implement business recovery plans, among other things, and provide  matching funds for consultants to work with manufacturers to implement  projects in business recovery plans, according to agency officials.", "Enforcing trade laws and agreements and supporting policy formulation.  Based on our analysis of survey responses, DOC administers three  programs that enforce trade agreements and support policy formulation  and negotiations. One of the three programs, the Industry Trade Policy  and Analysis program, seeks to provide analysis and expertise to conduct  policy formulation or represent industry members in trade negotiations.  These activities aim to help expand exports and bolster foreign direct  investments in the United States, which can assist many industries,  including manufacturing. Another program, the Trade Enforcement and  Compliance Policy and Negotiations program, oversees policies and  programs related to the negotiation of and pursuing foreign compliance  with trade and investment disciplines in international agreements, the  administration of U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws, and the  negotiation and administration of suspension agreements of U.S.  antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. The Antidumping and  Countervailing Duty Operations program investigates if petitions provide  sufficient evidence that dumping or unfair subsidization is occurring.  Generally, if the results of an investigation indicate that goods are being  dumped or unfairly subsidized, and the U.S. International Trade  Commission determines that U.S. industry is being injured, DOC will  issue an order requiring importers subject to the order to make cash  deposits equal to the amount of dumping and/or subsidization found.  Later, Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Operations program officials  might conduct an administrative review to determine the actual amount of  dumping or subsidization and calculate a final duty rate. According to  our analysis of the survey, these activities help manufacturers by  promoting fair competition in the marketplace, and by ensuring that U.S.  firms are not adversely affected by actions of foreign producers and  governments. The Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Operations  program reported that it assisted at least 440 U.S. companies and unions  in fiscal year 2015. According to agency officials we surveyed, other U.S.  manufacturing companies also may have benefited from actions taken by  the program. For example, as we found in 2013, trade remedy duties,  such as those determined by the Antidumping and Countervailing Duty  Operations program, add to the price of foreign products imported into the  United States, and they can benefit domestic producers of these products  regardless of whether the producers file a petition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eight Programs We Identified Reported They Help Job Seekers Enhance Skills and Obtain Employment", "paragraphs": ["Of the 58 programs, we identified 8 in the training policy area that help job  seekers enhance skills and obtain employment, based on our analysis of  survey responses.

To identify these agencies, we reviewed prior GAO and  Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports, the President\u2019s 2016  budget, and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). We  identified 11 agencies that administered programs that support the  manufacturing sector. We initially met with officials with the Departments  of Commerce, Defense, and Energy. In our meetings with these three  agencies, and in our interviews with experts at CRS and the Information  Technology and Innovation Foundation, we asked officials if these 11  agencies were the main agencies that administer programs to support  U.S. manufacturing, and if there were any other agencies that did so.

The survey also asked programs to  estimate the proportion of obligations the program used to support U.S.  manufacturing, and it also asked for an explanation of how the  proportions were determined. To assess the reliability of these data, we  took the following steps. First, the survey question on the proportion of  obligations that support U.S. manufacturing allowed programs to provide  ranges or other approximate percentages if they did not know the precise  numbers. Second, because we asked the programs to explain how they  determined the proportion of obligations that supported U.S.  manufacturing, we were able to understand, in a limited way, the reliability  and validity of the proportions provided. In general, the programs that  provided numbers and proportions also provided explanations that  suggested the numbers were broadly reliable and accurate. Third, we  checked the obligations data for a number of programs against publicly  available budget data. The funding amounts provided by programs in our  survey generally corresponded well. Fourth, we performed common data  testing steps to assess the reliability of the data, including identifying  outliers and missing data.
