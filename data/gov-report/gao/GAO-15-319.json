The type of electronically readable card that would be most appropriate depends on how the cards would be used. Smart cards could provide substantially more rigorous authentication than cards with magnetic stripes or bar codes, and provide greater security and storage capacity for exchanging medical information. All electronically readable cards could be used to convey beneficiary identity and insurance information since they all have adequate storage capacity to contain such information.", "Using electronically readable cards to authenticate beneficiary and provider presence at the point of care could curtail certain types of Medicare fraud, but would have limited effect since CMS officials stated that Medicare would continue to pay claims regardless of whether a card was used due to legitimate reasons why a card may not be present. CMS officials and stakeholders told us that claims should still be paid even when cards are not used because they would not want to limit beneficiaries' access to care. Using electronically readable cards to exchange medical information is not part of current federal efforts to facilitate health information exchange and, if used to supplement current efforts, it would likely involve challenges with interoperability and ensuring consistency with provider records. Using electronically readable cards to convey identity and insurance information to auto-populate and retrieve information from provider information technology (IT) systems could reduce reimbursement errors and improve medical record keeping.", "To use electronically readable cards to authenticate beneficiaries and providers, CMS would need to update its claims processing systems to verify that the cards were swiped at the point of care. CMS would also need to update its current card management processes, including issuing provider cards and developing standards and procedures for card use.

Together,   Parts A and B are known as traditional Medicare or Medicare fee-for- service. Part C is Medicare Advantage, under which beneficiaries receive  their Medicare health benefits through private health plans, and Part D is  the Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit, which is administered  through private drug plans. Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in Part C or  Part D plans receive separate cards from those plans, in addition to their  traditional Medicare card. Generally, an individual\u2019s eligibility to participate  in Medicare is initially determined by the Social Security Administration,  based on factors such as age, work history, contributions made to the  programs through payroll deductions, and disability. Once the Social  Security Administration determines that an individual is eligible, it  provides information about the individual to CMS, which prints and issues  a paper Medicare card to the beneficiary.

For  example, smart cards can verify whether a user provides a correct PIN or  can confirm a fingerprint match, without being connected to a separate IT  system. Cards with magnetic stripes and barcodes cannot perform such  on-card verification, and require a connection to a separate IT system to  verify PINs or biometric information.", "We also determined that using electronically readable cards to store and  exchange medical information would likely require the use of smart cards  given their storage capacity and security features. Smart cards have a  significantly greater storage capacity than magnetic stripe and bar code  cards, and would be able to store more extensive medical information on  the cards. However, the storage on smart cards is limited, so it is  unlikely that the cards would be able to store all of a beneficiary\u2019s medical  records or medical records of a larger file size, such as medical images.  In addition, smart cards could better secure confidential information,  including individually identifiable health information subject to protection  under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  (HIPAA). Smart cards can be implemented with PKI to perform public  key encryption and authentication to secure and securely transmit any  medical information on the card.

For example, such systems could  identify providers that submit an abnormally high percentage of claims in  which cards are not used, which could be indicative of claims for  beneficiaries who were never seen or rendered care. However, CMS  officials noted that they already use their IT systems to identify providers  that bill for services for beneficiaries who were never seen or rendered  care.

Instead, these types of  fraud typically involve providers that wrongly bill Medicare for the care  provided, or misrepresent the level or nature of the care provided.

Once any issues are addressed, insurers reprocess resubmitted claims.  Based on data provided by CMS, we found that up to 44 percent of the  more than 70 million Medicare claims that CMS rejected between   January 1, 2014, and September 29, 2014, may have been rejected  because of invalid or incorrect beneficiary identity and insurance  information that could be obtained from beneficiaries\u2019 Medicare cards. In  addition, HHS has cited an industry study indicating that, industrywide, a  significant percentage of denied health insurance claims are due to  providers submitting incorrect patient information to insurers. However,  CMS officials stated that using electronically readable cards may not  necessarily reduce claim rejections because providers may still obtain  beneficiary information in other ways, including over the telephone or  paper forms that have been filled out by beneficiaries.", "Stakeholders also told us that problems with collecting beneficiary  information can lead to the creation of medical records that are not linked  accurately to beneficiaries or records that are linked to the wrong  individual, which can lead to clinical inefficiencies and potentially  compromise patient safety. For example, problems collecting beneficiary information can prevent providers from retrieving existing  beneficiary records from their IT systems, leading providers to create  duplicate medical record files that are not matched to existing beneficiary  records. Medical records that are not accurately linked to beneficiaries  can compromise a provider\u2019s ability to make clinical decisions based on  complete and accurate medical records, which can lead to repeat and  unnecessary medical tests and services, and adverse events, such as  adverse drug interactions.", "Furthermore, inaccurate and inconsistent beneficiary records can also  limit electronic health information exchange by limiting the ability to match  records among providers. We previously found that difficulty matching  beneficiaries to their health records has been a key challenge for  electronic health information exchange, and this can lead to beneficiaries  being matched to the wrong set of records, and to providers needing to  match records manually.", "VA also recently issued new paper cards to certain veterans to obtain care outside of   VA facilities.

Providers would include the transaction codes on their claims. When  processing claims, CMS would match the original transaction codes  generated by CMS\u2019s IT systems with the codes on submitted claims.For this option, CMS officials told us that they would need to  implement an IT system to collect and store data on the transaction  codes and build electronic connections with existing claims  processing systems to match the codes with submitted claims.", "The second option is based on the processes used in a CMS pilot  program.  When beneficiaries and providers swipe their cards,  information about the card transaction\u2014such as the date of the  transaction and the beneficiary Medicare number and provider NPI  associated with the cards\u2014would be sent to CMS. CMS would match  this information about the card transaction with information on the  claims submitted by the providers. According to officials, this option  would similarly involve implementing an IT system to collect and store  data on the card transactions and connecting the system with existing  claims processing systems to match information about the  transactions with submitted claims.", "CMS officials told us that verifying that beneficiary and provider cards  were swiped by including new content on claims\u2014such as unique  transaction codes\u2014would be problematic. Doing so would involve  changes to industrywide standards for claim submission and the way in  which CMS\u2019s IT systems receive submitted claims. These industrywide  standards govern the data content and format for electronic health care  transactions, including claim submission. Adding new content to claims,  such as a field for a transaction code, would require CMS to seek  changes to existing claim standards with the standard-setting body  responsible for overseeing the data content and format for electronic  health care transactions. Officials told us that requesting and having such  changes approved could take several years. CMS officials further noted  that the IT infrastructure that CMS developed to accept electronic claim  submissions was built to accept claims based on current standards and  would need to be updated to accept any new content fields. However,  under the second option, verifying that the cards were swiped by  matching information about the card transaction\u2014such as the date and  beneficiary and provider identification information\u2014with information on  the claims submitted would not involve additional content on claims  because CMS would be matching the card transactions with information  currently included on claims.", "See GAO, Information Security: Advances and Remaining Challenges to Adoption of  Public Key Infrastructure Technology, GAO-01-277 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 26, 2001). federal agencies, told us that CMS could leverage such services to use  PKI for electronically readable Medicare cards.

Proponents have  suggested that NIST standards for electronically readable cards could be  used to implement such cards for Medicare. However, these standards  generally apply to the issuance and use of smart cards by federal  employees and contractors for accessing computers and physical  locations, and we found that the application of such standards could  present logistical challenges for Medicare and could entail changes to  current Medicare card management practices. For example, NIST  standards involve procedures for verifying the identities of individuals  before they are issued cards and, among other requirements, require  potential cardholders to appear in person before being issued a card.  Medicare does not require beneficiaries to appear in person to be  enrolled in the program and issued cards. Doing so could present barriers  to beneficiary enrollment and could present logistical challenges, given  that Medicare covered approximately 54 million beneficiaries in 2014 and  CMS does not have an infrastructure in place to meet beneficiaries in  person. Additionally, to use the cards with a PKI system, CMS would  need to implement processes to update and reissue beneficiary cards as  needed to meet security requirements. Currently, the NIST standards  require cards to be reissued every 6 years to update the PKI keys on the  cards. Reissuing cards on a regular basis would likely require the  implementation of new card management processes and additional  resources for CMS. As of now, CMS only reissues cards if they are  reported as lost, stolen, or damaged, or if there is a change to beneficiary  information, such as a name change.", "CMS would face additional card management challenges and practical  concerns to use electronically readable cards in conjunction with a PIN or  biometric information. According to CMS officials, implementing PINs or  biometrics would come with large costs and would involve significant  changes for CMS and beneficiaries. To use PINs, CMS would need to  implement processes for creating, managing, and verifying them. CMS  officials and other stakeholders also noted that certain Medicare  beneficiaries, especially those with cognitive impairments, may not be  able to remember their PINs. Officials we spoke with in France told us  that they decided not to have beneficiaries use PINs with their cards after  a pilot project found that some beneficiaries had difficulties remembering  them.

Stakeholders noted that it might not be practical for providers to swipe the  cards during the course of providing care and that the cards might instead  be used by administrative or billing staff.
