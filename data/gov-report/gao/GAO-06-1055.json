Immigration reform is a matter of continuing debate in the United States. This report examines selected countries' (1) programs for admitting foreign workers; (2) efforts to limit the employment of unauthorized foreign workers; and (3) programs for providing unauthorized immigrants with an opportunity to obtain legal status, referred to as regularization. To address these objectives, we examined reports from foreign countries, intergovernmental organizations, and research organizations.

To recruit foreign workers, some countries use bilateral agreements with other countries. For example, Canada uses bilateral agreements with Mexico and several Caribbean nations to recruit seasonal agricultural workers. Some countries manage foreign worker admissions by various means, such as quotas or points-based systems. However, officials stated that it is difficult to implement a system that responds to changing labor market needs and does not create incentives for employers to hire unauthorized foreign workers. Some countries regulate foreign worker admissions by specifying requirements for participation in a foreign worker program, such as work permit fees. Moreover, foreign worker programs differ in their requirements for workers to return home. Some temporary programs require workers to return upon expiration of work permits, while others allow foreign workers to renew their permits and apply for permanent resident status. The countries GAO studied use a variety of efforts in enforcing laws designed to limit the employment of unauthorized foreign workers. In some of these countries, employers are required to report workers' information to government agencies or to verify workers' authorization status. Among these countries, the employment of unauthorized foreign workers is largely considered one of several illegal labor practices, including failure to pay taxes or social insurance contributions, and government agencies generally focus their enforcement efforts and investigate employers to detect all such practices. Government officials and experts have noted that conducting frequent employer investigations and publicizing those investigations helps deter employers' hiring of unauthorized foreign workers. Countries can penalize unscrupulous employers for employing unauthorized foreign workers, including imposing monetary fines on employers. However, countries have faced difficulties, such as the prevalence of document fraud, in penalizing employers. Some countries have implemented large-scale regularization programs that allow unauthorized immigrants to apply for legal status on either a temporary or a permanent basis. Countries have implemented regularization programs for different reasons, such as to help reduce the size of the underground economy or to facilitate immigrant integration, and governments believe they derive some benefits from implementing these programs, such as increased collection of tax and social insurance contributions. Under these programs, countries require illegal immigrants to meet specified eligibility requirements, such as residency and work requirements, before applying for or receiving legal status. Employers and unauthorized foreign workers have incentives to participate in regularization programs but may not want to because, for example, some employers can save money by employing unauthorized foreign workers from whom they do not pay taxes or social insurance contributions. However, countries have faced difficulties in implementing these programs, such as in ensuring timely review of applications. Moreover, some experts have reported that regularization programs may attract further illegal immigration,while others have concluded that programs' effect on illegal immigration is unclear."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to various studies, immigration affects nearly every country in  the world, as countries are points of origin for immigrants, places of  transit, final destinations, or can serve as all three. Migrants move between  countries for a variety of reasons, including family reunification, political  protection, and employment. However, the opportunity for employment is  one of the most important magnets attracting immigrants, including  unauthorized immigrants, to countries. Reports indicate that migrants,  especially labor migrants, help to keep viable segments of certain labor- intensive industries, expand foreign trade, provide valuable language and  cultural expertise to companies, and contribute to the economic  revitalization of some communities. Yet these reports also note that  immigration, particularly illegal immigration, may have adverse  consequences, such as helping to depress wages for low-skilled workers  and creating net fiscal costs for some levels of governments.", "Countries use a variety of policies and practices related to foreign worker  programs, including actions to limit illegal immigration and to reduce  employment of unauthorized foreign workers. These policies and practices  have been shaped by country-specific economic, demographic, and  political factors, such as countries\u2019 unemployment rates and population  characteristics. They may include visa categories to allow migrants to  enter and work in a country on a legal basis, mechanisms to regularize the  status of unauthorized migrants currently residing in a country, means to  verify workers\u2019 employment authorization status, and efforts to enforce  laws that prohibit the employment of unauthorized workers.", "As in other countries, immigrants can legally enter and reside in the United  States through different channels, such as work visa programs, but some  also illegally enter or overstay their visas and illegally remain in the United  States. Various reports have estimated that the U.S. unauthorized  immigrant population was about 11 million in 2005. Congress has passed  laws to provide legal channels for immigrants to live, work, and become  naturalized citizens and to prohibit unauthorized migrants from entering  and working in the United States. In 1986 Congress passed the  Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), making it illegal for  individuals or entities to knowingly employ unauthorized workers and  establishing an employment eligibility verification process and a sanctions  program for fining employers who do not comply with the act. The Illegal  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996  revised some provisions of IRCA and established voluntary pilot programs  for employers to electronically verify employees\u2019 work eligibility.", "More recently, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed  different bills to further revise certain elements of U.S. immigration law.  Among other things, these proposals would revise current border and  interior enforcement measures and require employers\u2019 mandatory  participation in an electronic employment eligibility verification system.  The Senate proposal would also establish a new temporary foreign worker  program and allow certain unauthorized immigrants currently residing in  the United States to apply to regularize their status.", "You asked us to review other countries\u2019 efforts to reduce the unauthorized  employment of foreign workers.

We also interviewed officials and obtained documents from, but did not  visit, Australia. In addition, we sent four questionnaires to government  agencies in 13 countries and received responses from Argentina, Austria,  the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, and Singapore. We selected the  countries for our review based on their net immigration rate, size of  population, membership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and Development (OECD) or World Bank classification as high income,  range of immigration policies, and geographic location. In the 7 countries  we visited and Australia, we interviewed officials from the labor  ministries, interior ministries, finance ministries, treasury departments,  social security agencies, immigration agencies, law enforcement agencies,  and local government agencies. We analyzed information and documents,  such as agency annual reports, manuals, and briefing materials, from these  countries to determine the characteristics, functions, resources, and  outputs of the countries\u2019 programs to admit foreign workers, enforce laws  that prohibit the employment of unauthorized foreign workers, and  regularize unauthorized immigrants. Our questionnaires included general  questions about the characteristics, functions, outputs, and agency views  on the advantages and disadvantages of these programs in the surveyed  countries. We did not independently examine countries\u2019 laws and  regulations, but rather based characterizations of countries\u2019 programs on  information provided by countries in response to the questionnaires or in  interviews as of July 2006.", "In addition, we interviewed officials and analyzed reports from the  International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Organization  for Migration (IOM), OECD, and the European Union (EU).

Countries also have  established temporary and permanent migration channels through which  individuals can legally enter for employment.", "Social and political factors in countries may affect countries\u2019 immigration  policies. For example, studies have noted that a country\u2019s perception of its  national identity can affect the country\u2019s policies for admitting and  integrating immigrants. A country that perceives itself as being culturally  homogeneous may view immigration differently than countries with long  histories of immigration. Relatedly, countries\u2019 policies for granting  permanent residence or citizenship to immigrants may affect countries\u2019  immigration programs. For instance, policies regarding permanent  residency and citizenship may help shape the types of programs countries  implement for admitting immigrants and facilitating immigrants\u2019 social and  economic integration.", "Studies have noted the importance of social and economic integration for  immigrants. Programs to integrate immigrants into a country provide  benefits to both the country and immigrants by promoting social cohesion;  fostering immigrants\u2019 support for and participation in the country\u2019s  political, economic, and social systems; and helping to ensure the  protection of immigrants\u2019 rights and to enhance their ability to access the  labor market. These programs may provide immigrants with job training or  work experience, language or civics courses, and other educational  opportunities.", "Countries may implement changes to existing immigration policies,  including to reduce immigrant admissions or, conversely, to provide  increased opportunities for legal immigration, based on different factors  or events. Countries may revise their immigration policies to respond to  external events, such as humanitarian crises in other countries or  international conflicts by, for example, changing the number of refugees  and asylum seekers admitted to the countries. Moreover, countries may  strengthen their border control efforts, for instance, in response to  increased illegal immigration flows from neighboring countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic and Demographic Factors Related to Immigration", "paragraphs": ["Various economic and demographic characteristics are linked to  countries\u2019 immigration policies. In particular, studies have noted that  economic factors, such as unemployment rates, economic growth rates,  and the size of the underground economy, may affect countries\u2019  immigration policies. For example, high unemployment rates may limit  the number of foreign workers countries admit, as unemployed native  workers take jobs typically filled by foreign workers. Therefore, high  unemployment rates in certain countries may encourage foreign workers  to seek employment in other countries with lower unemployment rates.  Likewise, studies have suggested that the relative difference in the size and  growth of countries\u2019 economies can affect immigration flows. Countries  with large or fast-growing economies are attractive to foreign workers\u2014 including unauthorized immigrants.", "The employment of unauthorized foreign workers contributes to  countries\u2019 underground economies. The underground economy includes  any employment in a country for which employers do not pay taxes or  social insurance contributions and is thus composed of both unauthorized  foreign workers and native workers for whom appropriate contributions  are not paid. Studies have noted that both employers and workers benefit  from working in the underground economy because in doing so, neither  group pays taxes or social insurance contributions. Employment in the  underground economy may negatively affect government revenue because  governments do not collect taxes and social insurance contributions on  underground employment. Likewise, workers in the underground  economy may find it more difficult to access social insurance benefits and  may be more at risk for exploitation.", "Demographic factors, particularly countries\u2019 birthrates and population  characteristics, may also affect immigration policies. Studies have noted  that aging, low-growth populations may have long-term effects on  countries\u2019 fiscal and economic outlook, and these countries may be more  disposed to admitting foreign workers than other countries. For example,  as the number of younger people in a country decreases relative to the  increase in the number of older people, contributions made by younger  workers to countries\u2019 social insurance systems may not be sufficient to  provide insurance benefits for the increasing older population. Therefore,  countries with aging, low-growth populations may have an incentive to  encourage legal immigration and admit large numbers of foreign workers  who can contribute to countries\u2019 tax and social insurance systems and  may be more at risk for exploitation.", "Yet foreign workers in countries may also be eligible to receive some  social insurance benefits, and foreign workers\u2019 access to such benefits  varies among countries. For example, in some countries foreign workers,  including unauthorized foreign workers, can access unemployment and  health insurance but cannot receive retirement benefits. Given that foreign  workers contribute to tax and social insurance systems but also can  receive social insurance benefits, in most countries it is unclear whether  foreign workers\u2019 contributions are greater than the benefits they receive or  whether foreign workers, particularly unauthorized workers, create net  fiscal costs for governments. In addition, studies suggest that unauthorized  foreign workers create other costs for governments, such as costs for  social services as well as for border and interior enforcement efforts.", "Experts have reported that immigration provides economic benefits to  countries that may exceed any fiscal costs to governments resulting from  unauthorized immigration. These experts have suggested that migration  helps to allocate labor resources among global labor markets, creating net  gains for migrants and countries receiving the migrants. For example, in  some countries there is little direct competition between immigrants and  local workers for jobs in most sectors. In such instances, foreign workers  can fill needed jobs for which no native workers are available. In countries  with more direct competition between immigrant and resident workers,  particularly for low-skilled jobs, immigrants tend to compete with native  workers as well as with other immigrants already residing in the country  with similar skills. In these cases, resident workers, both citizens and  noncitizens, may experience declining wages or wages that rise slowly and  increasing unemployment rates.

This treaty includes EU members,  other than the United Kingdom and Ireland, and does not yet fully apply to  the 10 new members that acceded to the EU in May 2004.

Immigrant visas are issued to foreign  nationals who intend to live permanently in the United States, while  nonimmigrant visas are for foreign nationals wishing to enter the country  on a temporary basis, such as for temporary work, study, or tourism. The  immigrant visas generally provide a path to eventual citizenship, while the  nonimmigrant visas require that, upon expiration of the visa, the visa  holder must either leave the country or change status to a new visa  category.", "Permanent immigrant visas are issued for family reunification,  employment, or humanitarian reasons. Immigrants who apply to enter the  United States for work purposes are required to follow a multistep  process. First, the potential worker and employer determine if the worker  is eligible for a permanent employment-based visa based on the applicant\u2019s  skills. Second, most employment categories require that the U.S. employer  complete a labor certification request for the applicant and submit it to the  Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration Office of  Foreign Labor Certification. This office provides labor certifications to  employers once employers have demonstrated that there are insufficient  qualified U.S. workers available and willing to perform the work at wages  that meet or exceed the prevailing wage paid for the occupation, and  employment of the immigrant will not adversely affect the wages and  working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed. Third, once the  employer receives the labor certification, the employer files an immigrant  visa petition, which must be approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services (USCIS) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Finally,  the Department of State provides the applicant an immigrant visa number.  The visa number indicates that a visa has been assigned to the applicant,  but the applicant is required to wait, sometimes for years, for the visa  number to become available in order to complete the process of becoming  a permanent resident.", "Current U.S. law allows for 140,000 permanent employment-based visas  per year and preferentially grants these visas based on skill level, with  highly skilled applicants receiving the highest preference. The first level of  preference is provided to persons of \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d in the arts,  sciences, education, business, or athletics; outstanding professors and  researchers; and multinational executives and managers all of whom must  meet certain specified criteria. The second level of preference is provided  to members of professions holding advanced degrees or persons of  \u201cexceptional ability\u201d in the sciences, art, or business who meet certain  specified criteria. The third preference level is provided to skilled  workers with at least 2 years\u2019 training or experience, professionals with  baccalaureate degrees, and up to 10,000 unskilled shortage workers  performing work that is not of a temporary or seasonal nature.", "The majority of work-related visas that are granted in the United States are  for a temporary period and require the employer to file a petition with  USCIS. The beneficiaries of the visa petition generally must provide  evidence that they are not coming to live permanently in the country, and  in some cases, as discussed above, employers must receive an  employment certification from the U.S. Department of Labor. The United  States currently has 72 specific types of temporary visas, and a subset of  these permit the visa holder to be employed while in the United States.  Table 1 provides examples of some of these temporary, employment-based  visa programs. Some work visas are designed to attract workers in specific  labor market sectors, such as nursing or corporate managers. One of the  largest categories for work-related visas is the H visa, which includes the  H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B visas, and is not specific to a particular market. H-1B  visas are for professional specialty workers with highly specialized  knowledge or distinguished fashion models and are renewable for up to   6 years. The H-2A visa is for seasonal or temporary agricultural workers  and allows for a maximum stay of 3 years. Finally, the H-2B visa is a  general, temporary visa for nonagricultural workers; is limited to   66,000 visas annually; and does not have requirements for skill levels.   After the temporary visas expire, the foreign worker is required to leave  the United States. Migrants who overstay their visas contribute to the  unauthorized foreign worker population in the United States, despite  provisions in the law that limit or control the ability of unauthorized  migrants to find employment. We have previously reported that the United  States has difficulty in tracking the status of immigrants who enter the  country legally and then overstay their visas.", "U.S. immigration laws have also established a variety of means by which  immigrants can change their status after entering the country. For  example, some temporary visa categories allow a legal visa holder to apply  to adjust to lawful permanent resident status under a permanent  employment- or family-based category after a specified period of time of  working legally in the United States. In addition, IRCA established a  regularization program to provide legal status to aliens who had  continuously resided in the United States illegally prior to January 1, 1982.  It is estimated that the programs under IRCA regularized the status of  nearly 3 million unauthorized immigrants.", "IRCA also established procedures for verifying the work authorization of  foreign employees and for enforcing laws to limit the employment of  unauthorized workers. The act made it illegal for individuals to knowingly  hire, continue to employ, or recruit or refer for a fee unauthorized workers  and established a two-pronged approach for helping to limit the  employment of unauthorized workers: (1) an employment verification  process through which employers verify newly hired employees\u2019 work  eligibility and (2) a sanctions program for fining employers who do not  comply with the act.", "Under the employment verification process, employees and employers  must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (Form I-9) to  certify that the employees are authorized to work in the United States.  Employers must request that newly hired employees present a document  or documents that confirm employees\u2019 identity and work eligibility.  Currently, there are 27 different documents that can be used to establish  work eligibility. On the Form I-9, employees must attest that they are U.S.  citizens, lawfully admitted permanent residents, or aliens authorized to  work in the United States. Employers must then certify that they have  reviewed the documents presented by their employees to establish identity  and work eligibility and that the documents appear genuine and relate to  the individual presenting them. In making their certifications, employers  are expected to judge whether the documents presented are obviously  counterfeit. Employers are deemed in compliance with IRCA if they have  followed the verification procedures, including instances when an  unauthorized alien may have presented fraudulent documents that  appeared genuine. We have previously reported that current weaknesses,  such as difficulty in detecting document and identity fraud and the large  number of acceptable documents for proving work eligibility, have  undermined the effectiveness of the employment verification process.", "Those employers who do not follow the verification process can be  sanctioned for knowingly hiring or continuing to employ unauthorized  workers, or for improperly completing the Form I-9. Employers who fail to  properly complete, retain, or present for inspection a Form I-9 may face  civil or administrative fines ranging from $110 to $1,100 for each employee  for whom the form was not properly completed, retained, or presented.  IIRIRA of 1996 limited employer liability for certain technical violations of  Form I-9 paperwork requirements. According to the act, a person or entity  is considered to have complied with the employment verification process  if the person or entity made a good faith attempt to properly complete the  Form I-9. Employers who knowingly hire or continue to employ  unauthorized aliens may be fined from $275 to $11,000 for each employee,  depending on whether the violation is a first or subsequent offense.  Employers who engage in a pattern or practice of knowingly hiring or  continuing to employ unauthorized workers are subject to criminal  penalties consisting of fines up to $3,000 per unauthorized employee and  up to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment. Efforts to enforce these sanctions are  referred to as worksite enforcement and are primarily the responsibility of  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in DHS.", "We reported in 2005 that worksite enforcement has been a relatively low  priority under both the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)  and ICE, and that since fiscal year 1999, INS and ICE have dedicated a  relatively small portion of overall agent resources to the worksite  enforcement program. Since September 11, 2001, INS and then ICE  focused worksite enforcement efforts mainly on detecting and removing  unauthorized workers from critical infrastructure sites, such as airports  and nuclear power plants, consistent with the DHS mission to combat  terrorism. Yet employers, particularly those not located at or near critical  infrastructure sites, who attempt to circumvent IRCA have faced little  likelihood that ICE would investigate them for knowingly hiring  unauthorized foreign workers. We reported that INS and ICE have faced  difficulties in setting and collecting fine amounts that meaningfully deter  employers from hiring unauthorized foreign workers and in detaining  unauthorized workers, though we noted that ICE has taken steps to  address these difficulties. In addition, in 2006 we reported that data on  individuals\u2019 earnings collected by various agencies, including the Social  Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, could help DHS  detect unauthorized work and enforce immigration laws. However, while  our prior work has highlighted the benefits of earnings information for  detecting unauthorized work, we noted that additional disclosure of  earnings information should be carefully weighed against the various  drawbacks\u2014especially privacy considerations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Countries\u2019 Programs for Admitting Foreign Workers", "paragraphs": ["The countries in our review have programs designed to recruit foreign  workers to fill jobs that cannot be filled by native workers, and these  programs generally focus on recruiting high-skilled or seasonal foreign  workers.

Countries such as Australia, Germany, and Belgium have programs  designed to actively recruit highly skilled workers. For example,  according to government officials, Australia offers numerous foreign  worker programs to recruit highly skilled foreign workers in specific  industry sectors that have experienced labor market shortages. The  country recruits high-skilled workers through, among other means, the use  of promotional campaigns within specific industrial sectors or foreign  countries to target foreign workers with specific business or trade skills  for positions in Australia, such as medical practitioners, visiting  academics, and business workers. In addition, Canadian officials stated  that about 55 percent of the temporary foreign workers admitted to  Canada in 2004 were employed in skilled occupations, such as  professionals, academics, and engineers. According to one expert, because  the education and training required to become high-skilled takes time to  acquire, an efficient way for a country to increase its numbers of high- skilled workers is to recruit these workers from abroad. For example,  during the 1990s, most industrial countries made it easier for foreign  professionals to enter and work temporarily or permanently in response to  the economic growth of that period.", "While countries we studied, such as Canada, Australia, and Germany, have  programs designed to legally admit low-skilled foreign workers, they  generally do not focus their recruitment efforts on this type of worker.  However, jobs in low-skilled sectors, such as manufacturing, construction,  and cleaning services, are also the sectors in which employers with large  numbers of unauthorized workers are typically found. Government  officials and experts told us that the high amount of illegal work in these  sectors can be an incentive for governments to develop programs designed  to legally admit low-skilled workers. In addition, countries\u2019 need for  foreign workers to fill low-skilled jobs is at least partially determined by  the economic situation of the countries. For example, experts from  Germany stated that the high unemployment rate in their country has  decreased the need for low-skilled foreign workers, and the German  government has taken steps to fill low-skilled job vacancies with  unemployed German citizens. In contrast, Canadian officials stated that  their country\u2019s need for temporary foreign workers, of which about   45 percent are low-skilled, has increased as the economy has  strengthened.", "While most of the countries in our review do not recruit significant  numbers of low-skilled foreign workers, government officials generally  told us they recruit foreign workers on a seasonal basis and have  implemented programs designed to fill those needs. For example,  Germany recruits seasonal workers by allowing employers to specify  individual foreign workers to fill positions or by allowing an employer to  request foreign workers through a local employment agency without  specifying particular workers. Seasonal work, while considered to be a  type of low-skilled employment, is generally regulated under specific  programs different from those regulating other types of foreign work  because seasonal work is of a defined amount of time. Seasonal work is  generally in the agricultural or tourism industries in which the length of  such work is defined by growing season and peak tourist season,  respectively. Foreign workers may therefore have the opportunity to  participate in seasonal programs on an annual basis. Government officials  and experts told us that this process of repeatedly participating in  seasonal programs provides an incentive for foreign workers to return to  their home countries at the end of the season because lapsing into illegal  status by overstaying their permits may jeopardize workers\u2019 ability to  participate in future programs. In addition, government officials and  experts suggested that employers benefit from seasonal worker programs  under which the same workers participate year after year because  employers gain benefits from their investments in the seasonal workers,  such as in the provision of training. However, experts also noted that  seasonal workers may be vulnerable to exploitation because they may not  be fully aware of their rights or may not report mistreatment if they fear  doing so would jeopardize their employment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Countries Can Use Bilateral Agreements or Third Party Entities to Recruit Foreign Workers", "paragraphs": ["Some countries we studied use bilateral agreements to manage the flow of  workers between two countries or to manage foreign worker admissions  in specific labor sectors.

Australia runs its  Working Holiday Maker Program through reciprocal bilateral agreements  with other countries. Under this program, Australia admits foreigners aged  18 to 30 from specific countries to enter Australia for up to 1 year for  travel around the country. During their time in the country, these  individuals can earn money by working for up to 6 months each with  different employers. An Australian government official stated that the  working holiday maker program has contributed to the Australian  economy because it allows employers to hire visiting foreigners to do  short-term work that the employers would likely not be able to obtain  Australian workers to do.", "Government officials and experts told us that both the receiving and  sending countries have incentives to enter into a bilateral agreement. The  agreements provide the receiving countries with mechanisms to help  control the flow of illegal migration from sending countries by, for  example, including provisions that require the sending countries to  repatriate citizens who are found to be in the receiving country illegally. In  addition, bilateral agreements allow receiving countries to recruit foreign  workers from specific sending countries or with specific skills or other  characteristics to fill jobs in certain sectors with labor shortages. Bilateral  agreements also may provide employers in the receiving countries with  some control over recruiting workers with appropriate skills to fill job  positions, allow employers to compare foreign workers\u2019 education with  the receiving country\u2019s standards, and help ensure sending countries\u2019  assistance in repatriating workers after work permits expire. In particular,  some receiving countries have set up offices in sending countries to  recruit and provide training for workers to be admitted. In other cases,  companies themselves have become involved in the recruiting process by  sending personnel to countries to train and recruit foreign workers. For  example, in Spain, the autonomous community of Madrid recently signed  an agreement with Colombia that allows employers to train and guarantee  jobs to potential workers while they are still in Colombia. France has  bilateral agreements with Romania and other countries that facilitate  unauthorized immigrants\u2019 repatriation by stipulating that deported foreign  workers will not be able to secure a tourist visa enabling them to return to  France for at least a few months after repatriation. Moreover, experts told  us that receiving countries can use bilateral agreements to help manage  the flows of unauthorized immigrants by providing financial assistance to  the sending countries, helping to improve financial conditions in the  sending countries and thus reducing immigrants\u2019 incentives to migrate  illegally.", "Likewise, sending countries have a variety of incentives for participating in  bilateral agreements to manage foreign worker flows. Sending countries\u2019  economies benefit from the remittances that foreign workers send back to  the countries, and bilateral agreements provide sending countries with a  vehicle to negotiate appropriate wages, living conditions, and job security  for their citizens abroad. In addition, sending countries may benefit  economically and socially from the skills and experiences that temporary  foreign workers bring back to the countries by, for example, encouraging  small business and community development. Experts have indicated that  helping to improve financial conditions in the sending countries reduces  immigrants\u2019 incentives to migrate illegally.", "Bilateral agreements also help sending countries ensure their workers\u2019  rights, such as ensuring employers provide safe working conditions.  According to studies, the rights granted to foreign workers under bilateral  schemes vary by agreement and the terms and conditions negotiated  between the sending and receiving countries. Bilateral agreements can  ensure that workers admitted are entitled to the same working conditions  and wages as native workers, and some agreements also specify whether  and how foreign workers are able to collect social insurance contributions  made in receiving countries upon the workers\u2019 return to their home  countries. However, nongovernmental officials and experts have stated  that sending countries, in some cases, may be reluctant to advocate for  their workers\u2019 rights if the countries perceive that doing so may hinder  their participation in the bilateral agreements and thus the flow of  remittances.", "In addition, countries use private sector entities, called third party entities  or operators, to recruit, select, or transport foreign workers from sending  to receiving countries. For example, the United Kingdom allocates a  defined number of work permits to several third party operators, who then  independently recruit workers from other countries to work in the  agricultural sector. Studies suggest that the use of third party entities is a  means to link employers in the receiving countries with appropriate  foreign workers. Government officials told us that the use of third party  entities requires the government to regulate these groups to ensure they  are complying with program requirements. For example, researchers have  stated that third party entities can exploit foreign workers by soliciting  money from foreign workers in exchange for job placement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Countries Control the Admissions of Foreign Workers by Limiting Their Numbers and Setting Eligibility Requirements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Countries Manage Foreign Worker Admissions Using Various Methods But May Find It Difficult to Effectively Respond to Changing Labor Market Needs", "paragraphs": ["Most of the countries we studied assess the need for foreign workers by  studying the labor market and using the results to determine the number  of foreign workers to admit to work in specific sectors, but the countries  varied in the extent to which they have formalized processes to assess  labor market needs for foreign workers. The officials and experts with  whom we spoke told us that basing the number of allowable admissions of  foreign workers on the results of labor market determinations helps  ensure that the number of foreign workers legally admitted matches the  actual economic need for workers in specific industries. For example,  Spain\u2019s regional governments determine the need for foreign workers in  different labor sectors by discussing labor market needs with employer  and worker associations and submit the results to the national  government, which then uses the information to determine the number of  foreign worker admissions for each sector. Experts and officials told us  that a process for assessing labor market needs helps countries match the  number of foreign worker admissions to labor market needs for those  workers. In addition, many countries, including Argentina, the  Netherlands, and Switzerland, require a potential employer to prove that  no native workers are available to fill a job before the employer can apply  to bring in a foreign worker. Countries such as France and Canada require  employers to advertise job vacancies in local newspapers, trade  publications, or an employment office before the employers can seek  foreign workers. However, officials and experts told us that the burden on  employers for completing this requirement can encourage employers to  circumvent the assessment process and hire unauthorized foreign  workers, resulting in the need for enforcement tools to address  unauthorized foreign workers\u2019 employment.", "In addition to using labor market assessments to determine the need for  foreign workers, some countries we studied use quota systems to indicate  the number of legal foreign worker admissions. Quotas can be set at a  predetermined number or allow for some flexibility in the number of  foreign workers to admit based on labor market needs. Governments may  set quotas on an annual basis in consultation with relevant bodies such as  employers, trade unions, and local labor or employment offices to account  for labor market needs. Quotas can be set for each labor sector or  geographic region or by foreign workers\u2019 countries of origin. For example,  Switzerland has implemented a national quota for both temporary and  long-term workers that limits the number of foreign workers admitted to  Switzerland each year. The United Kingdom introduced a sector-based  scheme in 2003 that created a quota of 10,000 workers in the hospitality  and food-processing sectors and limited the annual number of foreign  workers admitted to the United Kingdom in those sectors, although the  United Kingdom is moving towards an employment-based immigration  system based on a general points scheme to admit foreign workers, as  discussed below. Additionally, in Austria, the government sets quotas of  seasonal workers by sector. In 2006, Austria set quotas of 7,500 for  workers in the tourism sector; 7,500 for workers in the agriculture or  forestry sector; and 7,000 for seasonal harvesters.", "However, it is difficult to implement a quota program that effectively  responds to changing labor market needs when the number of foreign  worker admissions has been set under a quota system. Government  officials, labor unions, and experts told us that quotas may not necessarily  respond to labor market needs, a situation that creates an incentive for  employers to hire unauthorized workers and necessitates enforcement  efforts to control the employment of unauthorized workers. Officials and  experts also stated that as a country\u2019s economy changes, the need for  foreign workers may shift from one employment sector to another.", "Some countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United  Kingdom, have used points-based systems for managing immigration  flows, which allow countries to tailor their admission requirements for  residence or work permits to migrants who meet certain characteristics. In  general, under points-based systems, immigrants, such as temporary  foreign workers, obtain points based on various skills and characteristics,  including educational or professional experience and ability to speak a  country\u2019s native languages. These characteristics may be chosen based on  a country\u2019s perception of attributes that predict a migrant\u2019s potential to  succeed in the labor market. Immigrants whose point totals meet a  minimum point requirement can qualify for work permits and, in some  cases, permanent residence status. Under Australia\u2019s points-based system,  immigrants can earn points for such things as skill, age, English language  ability, specific work experience, an occupation in demand, a job offer, an  intention to reside in regional Australia, and spouses\u2019 skills. Under  Canada\u2019s system, points are assigned to applicants based on age,  education, work experience, intended occupation, and knowledge of  Canadian national languages, among other things. Experts have said that  points-based systems are advantageous because they are transparent to  both the migrant and employer about the requirements a migrant must  meet in order to qualify for entry to the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Countries\u2019 Foreign Worker Programs Specify Employer and Worker Requirements for Participation", "paragraphs": ["Countries we studied have foreign worker programs with requirements  that employers and potential foreign workers are required to meet in order  for the government to issue a work permit. Most countries require either  the worker or employer to pay a fee in order to be granted a work permit.  For example, Canada charges individual workers a C$150 (about $140) fee  to apply for a work permit. The United Kingdom charges employers a \u00a3153  (about $280) fee to apply for a work permit on behalf of each potential  foreign worker. Experts have suggested that requiring employers to pay a  fee for foreign workers\u2019 permits helps to ensure that employers hire only  those foreign workers for whom they truly have a need. However,  government officials and experts stated that the fee requirement may  create an incentive for workers to seek illegal employment and for  employers to hire unauthorized workers in order to avoid having to pay  the fee. In other cases, unscrupulous employers may illegally deduct the  cost of the fees from foreign workers\u2019 wages.", "Many countries\u2019 work permits also stipulate that foreign workers can only  be employed by the employer listed on the permit. Therefore, if foreign  workers would like to change jobs, the workers must reapply for a new  permit or work for an alternate employer illegally. While such a  requirement can help regulate foreign workers\u2019 employment, experts and  other nongovernmental officials told us that the requirement can also  make it difficult for foreign workers to escape unscrupulous employers  who may exploit the workers. In addition, the requirements of work  permits granted under foreign worker programs generally state whether  family members may accompany a foreign worker. For example, under  Austria\u2019s seasonal worker program, foreign workers are not permitted to  bring their family members. According to government officials, employer  and employee groups, and experts, temporary workers may be less likely  to return to their home countries if their family members are permitted to  accompany them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Countries\u2019 Foreign Worker Programs Are Generally Temporary but Vary in Their Requirements for Return", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of the skill level of the foreign worker, the majority of work  permits offered by the countries we studied are temporary, although the  permits vary in their requirement for the workers\u2019 return at the end of the  permit\u2019s duration.

However, not all temporary work permits require workers to  return home at the end of the permit. Some temporary work permits are  renewable and allow workers to renew the permit an unlimited number of  times. For example, the Spanish government offers foreign workers a   1-year temporary permit that is renewable indefinitely, and participants in  this program have the option to apply for permanent residency after   5 years. Nongovernmental officials and experts told us that an advantage  of renewable temporary work permits is that they provide a means for  employers to employ a legal workforce, help governments obtain financial  benefits from hiring legal foreign workers, and reduce employers\u2019  incentives to hire unauthorized foreign workers.", "Some countries\u2019 foreign worker programs offer temporary work permits  that require the foreign worker to leave the country when the permit  expires, but government officials and experts noted that it is difficult to  ensure that the workers return to their home countries. Government  officials and experts noted that temporary programs are most successful  in ensuring worker return when the work is of a short, defined duration,  such as in seasonal labor sectors. Workers may also be more willing to  return to their home countries if they have the opportunity to participate  in future programs. For example, Canadian officials and experts stated  that employers in Canada have an incentive to hire legal foreign seasonal  workers because they have assurance that the workers will be available to  work in subsequent years. In addition, the foreign workers have incentives  to return home because they do not want to jeopardize their status in the  program and, because the agricultural work is located in rural areas of  Canada, it can be difficult for the foreign workers to integrate into or  travel to more populated areas of the country.", "Experts and government officials noted that because it is difficult to  successfully ensure foreign workers\u2019 return to their home countries, a  significant number of foreign workers overstay their work permits and  become unauthorized immigrants, contributing to countries\u2019 illegal  immigrant populations. The countries we studied use a variety of tools to  encourage or enforce foreign workers\u2019 return to their home countries  when their permits have expired (see table 2), and these tools are used in  conjunction with the countries\u2019 laws and policies that limit the  employment of unauthorized workers. For example, government officials  stated that hiring foreign workers who have an existing attachment to  their home countries may help ensure that workers return when their  work permits expire. According to government officials, under Spain\u2019s  seasonal agricultural worker program, the government recruits primarily  married women, because these workers may be more likely to return to  their countries in order to see their families. The United Kingdom\u2019s  seasonal worker program primarily recruits foreign students who are on  vacation from their schools, as these workers have an existing reason to  return to their home countries. In addition, countries may withhold foreign  workers\u2019 social insurance benefits or earnings, which workers can only  collect upon return to their home countries. Singapore requires employers  of non-Malaysian temporary foreign workers to post a bond of S$5,000  (about $3,200) per worker, which is returned to the employer after the  worker has returned home.", "Some programs allow for permanent resident status after a certain period  of employment and residence, although countries\u2019 programs for foreign  workers generally do not allow for workers to become naturalized  citizens. Experts stated that granting permanent status can help ensure  economic growth and sustain social welfare contributions, as well as allow  employers to retain high-quality workers. Experts, government officials,  and nongovernmental officials stated that offering permanent status is  generally reserved for high-skilled foreign workers and therefore can be  used as a means to recruit and retain skilled foreign workers. For  example, Germany instituted a program for recruiting information  technology specialists in which foreign specialists could reside and work  in Germany for a 5-year period, after which they could apply for  permanent residency and bring in family members if the specialists met a  minimum salary requirement. In Switzerland, settlement permits can be  granted to individuals who have resided continuously in the country for   10 years; foreigners from European Economic Area countries and the  United States can receive permits after 5 years of residence.", "Some of the countries in our review have implemented measures to assist  with the integration of foreign workers and their families who are granted  long-term residency status and who may face difficulties in socially and  economically integrating into the countries. For example, immigration  experts in Germany stated that long term residents from Turkey may have  difficulty integrating into German society as, in general, neither they nor  their children could become German citizens. Germany has initiated  programs to help integrate new immigrants, such as requiring them to take  language and civics classes. France has also faced difficulties in  integrating immigrant populations, which, according to a government  official, have contributed to protests and civil unrest. The French  government has taken steps to help better integrate immigrants, such as  establishing a dialogue with immigrant organizations and providing  scholarships for immigrants.

Moreover, Belgian government  officials told us that the government has difficulty collecting monetary  fines from employers because employers have declared bankruptcy or  sold off company assets to avoid paying the fine amounts. French and  German officials similarly told us that employers have declared  bankruptcy to help avoid paying fine amounts, and other government  officials noted that, in many cases, employers went out of business before  the government collected fine amounts.

These challenges include making decisions about how to leverage  resources to meet the goals of their worksite enforcement programs.  Within that framework, it is important for countries to determine how best  to coordinate the various government agencies and to allocate resources  for enforcing employment laws. While employer sanctions play an  important role in countries\u2019 worksite enforcement efforts, it can be  difficult to set penalties that are neither so low as to be considered simply  the cost of doing business by unscrupulous employers nor so punitive that  they are unlikely to be imposed for fear of bankrupting businesses, which  may cause native workers to lose their jobs.

Only a limited number of immigrants  are typically eligible for participation in these programs. In the United  Kingdom, individuals who applied for asylum before October 2000 and had  a dependent residing with them in the country between October 2000 and  October 2003 could apply for legal status for themselves and their  dependents. Moreover, unauthorized immigrants residing in the United  Kingdom continuously for at least 14 years are eligible for permanent  residency. Beginning in 1998, France implemented a program through  which unauthorized immigrants resident in the country for at least   10 years could apply for regularization.", "Other regularization programs are designed to address countries\u2019 large  unauthorized immigrant populations by providing these immigrants with  an opportunity to obtain legal status, typically on a temporary basis.  Governments established eligibility criteria, such as employment or  residency requirements, that unauthorized immigrants were required to  meet to be eligible for participation in the programs. For example, under  Spain\u2019s 2005 regularization program, the Spanish government required  unauthorized immigrants to have job offers from employers in order to be  eligible for regularization. The government required employers to apply for  regularization on behalf of their unauthorized foreign workers and, in  doing so, demonstrate that the workers had been present in Spain for at  least 6 months and possessed a current contract for a job for a minimum  period of 6 months. Some unauthorized foreign workers, such as those  who worked in part-time jobs or for several employers, could directly  apply to the Spanish government for regularization without applying  through their employers. The Spanish government did not penalize  employers or unauthorized foreign workers who applied for regularization,  and only those unauthorized immigrants who met the residency and  employment criteria could apply for legal status. About 700,000  unauthorized foreign workers applied and qualified for the regularization  program out of an estimated 800,000 workers projected to be eligible for  program participation.", "Similarly, other countries\u2019 regularization programs have required  applicants to meet residence or employment requirements. For example,  experts have reported that under Italy\u2019s 2002 regularization program,  unauthorized immigrants were required to provide proof of employment  and payment of 3 months\u2019 social insurance contributions in order to apply  for the program. Under Greece\u2019s 2001 program, unauthorized immigrants  were required to prove that they previously had legal residence status in  Greece and had continuously resided in the country since expiration of  their status or that they had lived in Greece for at least 1 year prior to  enactment of the program. Under France\u2019s 1981-1982 regularization  program, unauthorized immigrants were required to show that they had  resided in France prior to January 1982 and were currently employed or  had a work contract valid for at least 1 year. Table 5 provides information  on selected countries\u2019 regularization programs.", "In addition, experts have suggested development and implementation of  earned regularization programs, which are generally characterized by  countries\u2019 use of a points system for determining whether to regularize an  unauthorized immigrant\u2019s status. Although experts differ on specific  requirements for earned regularization programs, in general, these  programs would link regularization to a temporary worker program and  allow unauthorized immigrants to apply for regularization only after  meeting specified criteria over a certain period of time. For example,  migrants residing illegally in a country would first be granted a temporary  residence and work permit for a certain amount of time, such as for   3 years, during which they would be required to collect credits or points to  eventually qualify for a permanent residence and work permit. The points  could be based on a variety of different criteria, like stable employment,  payment of taxes and social security contributions, legal presence of a  family member in the country, and documented language fluency.  Unauthorized migrants would be required to obtain a minimum number of  points during the length of their temporary permit in order to be eligible to  apply for permanent residency. Those migrants who failed to obtain the  required number of points could be required to return to their home  countries.", "Experts have pointed out advantages to earned regularization programs.  They suggest that initially providing unauthorized foreign workers with  temporary legal status allows the largest possible number of unauthorized  immigrants to participate in the program and transfers work that  previously occurred in the underground economy into the formal  economy. Earned regularization programs also allow unauthorized foreign  workers who would like to work toward permanent residence status to do  so based on specific criteria for earning points. However, experts have  also noted drawbacks to earned regularization programs. For example,  requiring unauthorized foreign workers to earn the opportunity to apply  for permanent residence status may complicate these workers\u2019 ability to  economically and socially integrate into a country. Moreover, an earned  regularization program based on a points system could favor high-skilled  workers over low-skilled workers, making it difficult for low-skilled  workers to obtain permanent residence status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employers and Unauthorized Foreign Workers Have Incentives to Participate in Regularization Programs but Have Not Always Done So", "paragraphs": ["According to officials and studies, employers and unauthorized foreign  workers have incentives to participate in regularization programs but have  not always participated for various reasons. For example, employers may  participate in programs by applying for regularization on behalf of their  workers so as to avoid possible civil, also called administrative, or  criminal penalties for employing unauthorized foreign workers after  implementation of the programs. In implementing regularization programs,  countries such as Spain and France have introduced new or strengthened  enforcement programs, including increased employer monetary penalties,  for employing unauthorized foreign workers. Experts have suggested that  the credible threat of enforcement helps create an incentive for employers,  as well as workers, to participate in regularization programs.", "Unauthorized foreign workers may want to participate in regularization  programs to be better able to seek fair or higher wages and safe working  conditions from their employers, and regularization programs thus can  help to address any employer exploitation of unauthorized foreign  workers. As a result of regularization, formerly unauthorized foreign  workers may also be better able to compete for higher-paying jobs and  obtain opportunities for acquiring or enhancing their work skills.  Regularization programs also allow formerly unauthorized foreign workers  to access social insurance benefits. In addition, participation in  regularization programs may help formerly unauthorized foreign workers  better integrate into a country by, for instance, helping them to acquire  education and language skills. Participation in regularization programs  may also provide formerly unauthorized foreign workers with the  opportunity to visit their home countries.", "Government officials and experts have noted that not all employers and  workers may choose to participate in regularization programs. For  example, unscrupulous employers may not help unauthorized foreign  workers apply for regularization programs because the employers gain  benefits from employing unauthorized foreign workers and do not fear the  possibility of government penalties. Employers can save money or gain  greater profits by employing unauthorized foreign workers and thus not  paying taxes or social insurance contributions or providing safe working  conditions for those workers. Employers who hire unauthorized foreign  workers may have a competitive advantage over other employers who hire  only authorized workers and, as a result, may be less willing to provide  unauthorized foreign workers who want to regularize their status with the  documents needed to prove that the workers meet program eligibility  requirements. For example, studies have reported that during France\u2019s  1981-1982 regularization program, some employers were unwilling to  provide unauthorized foreign workers with the appropriate  documentation, as initially required under the program, and in some cases,  employers fired unauthorized foreign workers who requested their  employers\u2019 assistance in applying for regularization. To address this  problem, the French government modified program requirements to allow  third parties to assist unauthorized foreign workers rather than relying  solely on employers to do so.", "In addition, unauthorized foreign workers may not want to participate in  regularization programs for various reasons. For example, workers  granted temporary legal residency status under regularization programs  may deliberately allow their legal status to expire and revert to  unauthorized status in order to better obtain employment. Because  employers can benefit from employing unauthorized foreign workers,  unscrupulous employers may seek to fill jobs held by workers who  obtained legal status with other unauthorized foreign workers, hindering  the ability of workers with new legal status to compete with unauthorized  foreign workers for jobs. Therefore, government officials and experts have  stated that it is important to implement new or enhanced worksite  enforcement efforts in conjunction with a regularization program to  maximize participation in the program by employers and eligible  immigrants and to help deter employers from hiring unauthorized foreign  workers in the future. Unauthorized foreign workers may also choose not  to participate in regularization programs because they lack knowledge  about program requirements and may fear expulsion if they register for  program participation. According to government officials and experts, lack  of information about regularization program requirements may hinder  unauthorized immigrants\u2019 participation in such programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Governments Perceive Benefits from Regularization Programs but Face Difficulties in Implementing Such Programs", "paragraphs": ["According to officials and experts, countries\u2019 governments benefit from  regularization programs but may incur costs and face challenges in  implementing these programs. In particular, workers who resided and  worked illegally in a country likely did not pay taxes and social insurance  contributions to the government. However, after changing their status to  legal residency under regularization programs, governments could collect  taxes and social insurance contributions from formerly unauthorized  foreign workers by, for example, requiring workers to pay these  contributions prior to changing their status. As a result, formerly  unauthorized workers\u2019 employment is transferred from the underground  economy to the formal economy. Furthermore, governments can collect  social insurance contributions from these workers who previously  accessed benefits but did not contribute to the social insurance system.", "This collection of social insurance contributions from a greater segment of  countries\u2019 populations may also help in the short term to address  demographic challenges faced by countries with aging, low-growth  populations and declining levels of social insurance contributions. In  Spain, for example, the government collected social insurance  contributions from previously unauthorized foreign workers by requiring  employers to pay 1 month\u2019s contributions for their workers. As of  February 2006, officials from Spain reported that approximately 560,000 of  the nearly 700,000 individuals who applied for the regularization program  had paid the required social insurance contribution, and government  officials noted that as a result of the regularization program, the  percentage of individuals contributing to the social insurance system  increased.", "In addition, governments may gain information on and estimates of the  size of the unauthorized immigrant population in the country as a result of  implementing regularization programs. For example, officials and studies  reported that regularization programs may provide governments with data  that can help in estimating the number of unauthorized immigrants  residing in the country prior to program implementation. Regularization  programs may also provide governments with information about the  demographics of migrants, which could assist countries in developing  policies to manage future migrant flows and employment. In addition,  regularization programs may help countries better understand and  regulate their underground economies by providing them with information  on unauthorized immigrants\u2019 labor market participation.", "Yet governments may incur costs and face challenges in implementing  regularization programs, according to officials and experts. For example,  while in many of the countries we studied unauthorized immigrants can  receive some social insurance benefits, particularly health and  unemployment insurance, these immigrants generally cannot access other  benefits, such as retirement benefits. After unauthorized immigrants\u2019  status is regularized, these immigrants can fully access social insurance  benefits, and though they also contribute to the social insurance system, it  is uncertain whether immigrants\u2019 contributions are greater than the  benefits they draw. In addition, according to studies, some unauthorized  foreign workers may qualify for regularization but continue to work in the  underground economy after gaining legal status. In such cases, the  formerly unauthorized foreign workers could continue to receive some  social insurance benefits available to all individuals residing in the country  regardless of their immigration status but may not be contributing to the  social insurance system. As a result, regularization programs may not  necessarily increase countries\u2019 tax and social insurance revenue over time.", "Governments also face difficulties in managing the application process for  regularization programs, particularly in reviewing large numbers of  applications and detecting fraud in the process. In Spain, nongovernmental  officials reported that in past regularization programs, large numbers of  applicants initially overwhelmed the application review process, resulting  in long lines of individuals waiting to apply and requiring the government  to modify application procedures. During the 2005 regularization program,  government officials told us that the Spanish government took steps, such  as developing an electronic database for processing applications, to  address some of the challenges experienced under prior regularization  programs. In Portugal, Italy, and Greece, studies have reported significant  delays in the application review process and a lack of government  oversight of the process. They also noted that unauthorized immigrants  have used fraudulent documents to apply for regularization. During  Canada\u2019s 1974 regularization program, the government provided training  to immigration agency staff for reviewing and processing regularization  applications, which helped limit some problems in the application review  process, according to studies.", "Moreover, governmental and nongovernmental officials told us that  regularization programs may be particularly difficult to implement in cases  where the programs require immigrants to return to their home countries  before applying for the programs. For example, between 1993 and 2000,  the Spanish government managed a program through which employers  could apply to hire unauthorized foreign workers residing in Spain, but  workers were required to return to their home countries to receive a legal  work permit. According to officials, the government granted exemptions  to this requirement for the majority of unauthorized workers because of  low participation in the program and limited government enforcement of  the return requirement. Because many unauthorized foreign workers  developed social and communal ties in the country, they did not want to  leave Spain to apply for regularization and chose rather to remain in the  country in an unauthorized status. According to some officials and  experts, it is important to implement enforcement efforts in conjunction  with a regularization program to help ensure that individuals comply with  program requirements and immigration law and to maximize participation  in the program.", "In addition, governments have faced difficulties when individuals granted  temporary legal status under regularization programs do not renew their  status or lapse into an unauthorized status, contributing to countries\u2019  decisions to initiate other regularization programs in the future. For  example, under regularization programs in Spain, unauthorized foreign  workers were granted temporary legal residence and work status and  were required to periodically renew this status. However, officials and  studies noted that a significant number of workers initially granted legal  status under Spain\u2019s programs did not subsequently renew their status for  various reasons, such as unclear criteria for permit renewals or lack of  knowledge about renewal procedures, and lapsed into an unauthorized  status. Likewise, under other countries\u2019 regularization programs, such as  Greece\u2019s and Italy\u2019s programs, studies have suggested that large numbers  of immigrants initially granted temporary legal status did not renew their  legal status and reverted to an unauthorized status. According to experts,  countries have faced difficulties in determining the number of  unauthorized immigrants eligible for regularization who were granted legal  status under previous programs but had reverted to illegal status. Thus,  countries that have implemented multiple regularization programs that  provide immigrants with temporary legal status may repeatedly provide  this status to the same group of unauthorized immigrants. As a result,  while countries claimed that each large-scale regularization program  would be the last such program offered, these countries have repeatedly  initiated such programs not only to address new unauthorized immigrant  inflows, but also to reregularize previously authorized immigrants.", "Furthermore, experts have noted that countries have experienced  challenges in developing and implementing policies to address the status  of unauthorized immigrants who were not eligible or did not complete  applications for the programs. For example, Spanish government officials  stated that not all unauthorized immigrants eligible for the 2005 program  completed the application process. The Spanish government estimated  that about 140,000 immigrants who initially registered for the program did  not pay the required 1-month social insurance contribution, and thus these  immigrants remained unauthorized. Studies have also noted that  unauthorized immigrants\u2019 difficulties in proving their eligibility, such as  providing documents that prove residency and employment status, may  undermine immigrants\u2019 ability to complete the application process.  Additionally, experts have stated that countries such as Spain may face  challenges in implementing programs to address unauthorized immigrants  who do not gain legal residency status. Because not all unauthorized  immigrants are eligible for or participate in regularization programs, it can  be difficult for countries to develop policies to address remaining  unauthorized immigrant populations, such as determining whether to  deport these unauthorized immigrants or to provide them with other  opportunities to obtain legal status. According to experts, large-scale  removals are extremely expensive and require consideration of  humanitarian factors, such as impacts on families with members of mixed  legal statuses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Regularization Programs on Illegal Immigration and Employment Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Experts have noted that regularization programs may be viewed as a pull  factor in encouraging further illegal immigration. For example,  unauthorized immigrants may illegally enter or stay in a country that has  previously implemented regularization programs with the expectation that  the country will implement a similar program in the future. To guard  against such a perception, experts suggested that it is important for  countries that implement a regularization program to clearly indicate that  the program is a one time program by, for example, introducing new or  enhanced enforcement efforts in conjunction with a regularization  program.", "However, other experts have suggested that the extent to which  regularization programs affect additional illegal immigration flows and  employment is unclear. Countries generally have not evaluated the results  of regularization programs, including the extent to which such programs  encourage further illegal immigration, and as a result, the long-term effects  of these programs are not known. Moreover, a variety of factors can affect  illegal immigration and employment, making it difficult to directly link  regularization programs to increased illegal immigration flows and  employment. For example, because employers have economic incentives  to hire unauthorized foreign workers, employers may continue to recruit  and employ those workers instead of hiring legal workers, such as those  whose status has been regularized.

Countries we  studied have faced various administrative challenges in implementing their  regularization programs, and the largest of the programs in our study  regularized the status of approximately 635,000 immigrants. In addition, it  is critical for countries to evaluate the most appropriate legal status to  grant regularized immigrants\u2014temporary, temporary yet renewable, or  permanent status\u2014and to determine the extent to which regularized  immigrants granted temporary status renew their status or leave the  country upon expiration of their status. Furthermore, a committed effort  by countries to enforce laws that prohibit the employment of unauthorized  workers is a key element of a successful regularization program, as not all  unauthorized immigrants may qualify for the program and the opportunity  for employment may continue to motivate individuals to migrate illegally.  Regularized immigrants granted temporary legal status may also  subsequently lapse into an unauthorized state, which, in the absence of  effective worksite enforcement, may increase the likelihood that a country  undertakes future regularization programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Other countries\u2019 programs for admitting foreign workers, enforcing laws  that prohibit the employment of unauthorized foreign workers, and  regularizing the status of unauthorized immigrants are shaped by each  country\u2019s unique political, social, cultural, and economic characteristics.

Not all employers may want to comply with laws that  prohibit the employment of unauthorized workers, as it is often less costly  for employers to employ unauthorized, rather than authorized, workers.  Likewise, workers have economic incentives to illegally migrate to and  obtain employment in other countries, and even if given the opportunity to  gain legal status, they may perceive that there are benefits to remaining in  an unauthorized status. No one program or mechanism can fully address  the employment of unauthorized foreign workers. Therefore, efforts to  effectively address this problem may require development and  implementation of a strategic approach, including programs to assess  labor market needs for foreign workers and admit any needed workers, to  reliably verify the employment authorization status of workers, and to  enforce laws that prohibit the employment of unauthorized foreign  workers.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 7 days after the  date of this report.
