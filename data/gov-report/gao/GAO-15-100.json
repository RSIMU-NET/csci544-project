GAO has made a number of prior recommendations to NASA, including in December 2012 that the project perform an updated joint cost and schedule risk analysis to improve cost estimates. NASA initially concurred with this recommendation, but it later indicated that the tracking of information it already had in place was sufficient and ultimately decided not to conduct another joint cost and schedule risk analysis.", "GAO was mandated to assess the program annually and report on its progress.

During the past year, delays have occurred on every element and major subsystem schedule\u2014especially with the cryocooler\u2014leaving all at risk of negatively impacting the overall project schedule reserve if further delays occur.", "The project reports its overall schedule reserve is above its plan and standards. However, JWST is one of the most complex projects in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) history and has begun integrating and testing only two of the five elements and major subsystems. As such, maintaining as much schedule reserve as possible to navigate through almost 4 more years of integration and testing that remains, where prior work has shown problems are commonly found and schedules tend to slip, is critical. While the project has been able to reorganize work when necessary to mitigate schedule slips, this flexibility will diminish going forward. JWST is also facing limited short-term cost reserves to mitigate additional project schedule threats.", "The JWST project and prime contractor's cost risk analyses used to validate the JWST budget are outdated and do not account for many new risks identified since 2011. GAO best practices for cost estimating call for regularly updating cost risk analyses to validate that reserves are sufficient to account for new risks. NASA officials said they conduct sufficient analysis to monitor the health of the budget. These efforts, however, do not incorporate potential impacts of risks identified since 2011 into estimates. While the project has subsequently agreed to conduct a cost risk analysis of the contract, it is important that they follow best practices, for example, by regularly updating that analysis. Doing so would provide the project with reliable information to gauge whether the contractor is at risk of future cost overruns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other actions, NASA should follow best practices when updating its cost risk analysis to ensure reliability.

With its 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST will be  able to operate at 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space  Telescope. The JWST\u2019s science instruments require extremely cold  temperatures, so a tennis-court-sized sunshield will be used to protect the  mirrors and instruments from the sun\u2019s heat and allow them to observe  very faint infrared sources. The Hubble Space Telescope operates  primarily in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic  spectrum. The observatory segment of JWST includes several elements  (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument  Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield,  cryocooler).", "These elements and major subsystems are being developed through a  mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts.

Northrop Grumman  performs most of this work under a prime contract with NASA, but its work  on the MIRI cooler is performed under a separate subcontract with the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Exelis is manufacturing the test equipment,  equipping the test chamber, and assisting in the testing of the optics of  JWST. Finally, STScI will collect and evaluate research proposals from  the scientific community and will receive and store the scientific data  collected by those observations, both of which are services that they  currently provide for the Hubble Space Telescope.

After years of requirements changes, cost  growth, low reserve funding, deferred work, and launch delays, the Chair  of the Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and  Related Agencies requested an independent review of JWST. NASA  commissioned the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which  issued its report in October 2010, and concluded that JWST was  executing well from a technical standpoint, but that the baseline funding  did not reflect the most probable cost with adequate reserves in each  year of project execution, resulting in an unexecutable project. Following  this review, the JWST program underwent a replan in September 2011  and Congress in November 2011 placed an $8 billion cap on the  formulation and development costs for the project. On the basis of the  replan, NASA rebaselined JWST with a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835  billion that included additional money for operations and a planned launch  in October 2018. The revised life-cycle cost estimate included a total of  13 months of funded schedule reserve. In the President\u2019s fiscal year 2013  budget request, NASA reported a 66 percent joint cost and schedule  confidence level for these cost and schedule baselines.

We reported  that while the cryocooler subcontractor was making technical progress,  cryocooler development remained an ongoing challenge as there were  still unresolved technical issues related to its performance, and its  schedule was both optimistic and unreliable. We also found that three of  the element and major subsystem schedules the project was using to  manage were unreliable and did not meet best practices, which called  into question the reliability of the integrated master schedule that is built  from those schedules. In 2012, we reported that the accuracy of the  project\u2019s cost estimate was lessened because the summary schedule  used for the joint cost and schedule confidence level was not detailed  enough to determine how risks were applied to critical project activities.  We recommended that NASA conduct an updated joint cost and schedule  risk analysis to address the issues we identified and use more detailed  cost information to adjust its cost estimates. While NASA concurred with  our recommendation, officials subsequently stated that they did not plan  to conduct an updated joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis,  and that the project\u2019s monthly analyses were sufficient for the project\u2019s  needs. Thus, we expressed concern in our January 2014 report that  NASA\u2019s continued lack of up-to-date cost estimates that incorporate new  risks which had emerged since 2011 would inhibit NASA\u2019s ability to  effectively monitor its contractors\u2019 progress.

In the case of JWST, however, the  most significant risks lie ahead in the remaining 4 years, as the project  must complete five integration and test periods, three of which have not  yet started. Essentially, the risk is defined by bringing all of the complex  JWST elements and major subsystems together, testing them, and  resolving problems when there is limited schedule left for resolution. All of  JWST\u2019s five elements and major subsystems have just weeks of reserve  left before their schedules become pacing items on the project\u2019s critical  path, potentially reducing the reserve further. More milestones  established annually for the various elements and major subsystems  have been delayed or deferred during fiscal year 2014 than in the  previous 3 years following the replan. For example, the MIRI cryocooler  deferred seven milestones until fiscal year 2015 as a result of  manufacturing and development delays.

The scale of JWST\u2019s integration and test effort, however, is more  complex than most NASA or Goddard projects. For example, JWST has  five major integration and test periods to build the telescope, test the  optics, integrate the various elements and major subsystems, and ensure  they work properly together. While JWST\u2019s total integration and test cycle  runs almost 7 years, the next longest integration and test cycle for a  current project managed by Goddard Space Flight Center is over 3 years  and the average length of integration and testing for all other current  Goddard projects, excluding JWST, is just over 2 years.

While some use of schedule reserve is expected,  this widespread use has resulted in every JWST element and major  subsystem schedule being within weeks of becoming the critical path of  the project, before most have entered their integration and testing  periods. The proximity of all of the element and major subsystem  schedules to the critical path means that an issue on any of the schedules  may reduce the overall project schedule reserve further, which could then  put the overall project schedule at risk. As a result of this, the project has  less flexibility to choose which issues to mitigate. As an illustration, the  critical path has switched numerous times to several different schedules  as a result of using schedule reserve in the past year. See the different  amounts of schedule reserve remaining on all elements and major  subsystems, their proximity to the critical path and the total schedule  reserve for the critical path in figure 4.", "Delays were also evident in key milestone slips where more than half of  the project-identified key milestones for fiscal year 2014 were completed  late or deferred to fiscal year 2015\u2014the most in any year since the  replan. Seven of the 11 deferred milestones are related to the  development of the cryocooler. The other 4 are due to delays in reviews  or assembly for components of the sunshield and spacecraft and late  completion of some integration activities for the chamber to test the optics  of JWST in 2016. See figure 5 for a list of total milestones and their  status.", "The project has mitigated a number of issues that could have further  impacted the status of schedule reserve by reorganizing work to obtain  efficiencies and maintain schedule or stem further losses. For example, a  component of the cryocooler had some planned acceptance testing  reorganized along with a reduction in the length of time of the testing to  accommodate delays. However, with further progression into subsequent  integration and test periods, flexibility will be diminished because work  during integration and testing tends to be more serial. This is particularly  the case with JWST given its complexity.", "To some extent, projects have the ability to use cost reserves to maintain  schedule. For example, if work is taking longer than expected, a project  may be able to fund a second shift of work to speed it up and maintain  schedule. In the short term, however, this option may be limited for JWST  project officials because approximately 40 percent of the project\u2019s fiscal  year 2015 cost reserves were already committed prior to the start of the  fiscal year. As such, one of the project\u2019s top issues for fiscal year 2015 is  its cost reserve posture, which the project reported is less than desired  and will require close monitoring. The project\u2019s cost reserve status for  fiscal year 2015 is slightly better than in fiscal year 2014 that we reported  on in January 2014, where the project successfully managed low  reserves without delaying work. This issue, however, will likely require  continued monitoring until fiscal year 2016 when more program level  reserves will be available to the project. With schedule losses having  already occurred on most elements and major subsystems across the  project prior to most of the project\u2019s integration and testing efforts, the  fiscal year 2016 funding may arrive too late to prevent further schedule  delays and the risk of such delays impacting the launch date is  heightened."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Schedule Delays Driven by Significant Design and Manufacturing Challenges with Several Key Elements and Major Subsystems", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cryocooler", "paragraphs": ["The project continues to face major technical challenges building the  cryocooler that have significantly delayed delivery of key components,  have made it the driver of the project\u2019s overall schedule or the project\u2019s  critical path, and required the use of a disproportionate amount of project  cost reserves.

Moreover, the cryocooler design was not mature at  the time of the 2013 replan. The cryocooler subcontractor program  manager\u2019s low confidence in the replanned schedule was validated in  2014, when design and manufacturing problems contributed to further  delays.

However, since July, issues such as a  manufacturing error and manufacturing process oversight have delayed  delivery until at least April 2015. For example, one delay occurred when a  subcontractor employee conducted unauthorized work on one of the  cryocooler compressors that led to a concern of possible compressor  contamination. Ultimately, the subcontractor determined that no  contamination occurred and the compressor was still usable\u2014but not  before a 3 week halt in work on the specific compressor for the  investigation into the incident. JPL officials noted that the schedule impact  would only be 8 days as they would be rearranging hardware flow and  adding some holiday work to recover most of the time lost. Subsequently,  a separate manufacturing error on a compressor assembly component  resulted in 3 weeks of additional delay. In addition to these manufacturing  issues, according to the subcontractor program manager, the  subcontractor continues to encounter problems resulting from design  immaturity of certain parts of the compressor assembly as they pursue  the manufacturing effort.", "Given the cryocooler subcontractor\u2019s history of prior schedule delays and  continued performance challenges, the project recognizes the  cryocooler\u2019s late delivery to JWST\u2019s integration and testing schedules as  a top issue to the project and is planning mitigation strategies in  anticipation of further schedule slips\u2014which would reduce the project\u2019s  overall schedule reserve further.

As we have reported previously, GAO\u2019s best practice  criteria call for risk analyses to be updated regularly over the life of a  project in order to ensure an estimate\u2019s accuracy over time and account  for actual costs and new project risks. Without regular updates to the  cost risk analysis, JWST decision makers and stakeholders for the project  cannot be certain that its existing cost estimates accurately portray the  project\u2019s financial status. Updating these analyses is particularly important  in light of prior project optimism and newly discovered risks that threaten  the project\u2019s cost and schedule reserves.", "Although our previous work found that the JWST project\u2019s 2011 JCL was  not fully reliable, the JWST project continues to rely on its original cost  estimate, which was confirmed by the JCL, to provide the basis of its  budget estimates and requests. Based on this estimate, the JWST project  is currently reporting that the project remains on schedule to launch in  October 2018 and within the $8 billion developmental cost cap designated  by Congress. The JWST project manager stated that the project conducts  a number of programmatic and analytical activities to monitor the health  of its cost and schedule that he believes provides him with accurate  information on the project\u2019s status. In addition, the project conducted two  schedule risk analyses in response to a recommendation we made in  2014, but analyses have not been completed for all schedules. The  project stated one of its many methods of measuring cost and schedule  health is analysis of earned value management (EVM) data. However,  EVM analysis provides a cost and schedule projection based on past  performance that does not reflect the potential impact of future risks. The  2011 JCL was the last risk analysis performed to model impacts of future  risks on the project\u2019s cost and schedule. In 2012 and 2014 we made both  a recommendation to NASA and provided a matter to Congress for  consideration related to the need to update the JWST JCL to address  weaknesses we found and to incorporate new risk information. However,  a new JCL has not been conducted to date and NASA has indicated it  does not intend to update the JCL for JWST.", "As a result of the significant changes that have occurred over the last 3  years since the 2011 replan and lacking reliable cost estimates, we  determined that an updated cost risk analysis was warranted to provide  Congress with insight on JWST\u2019s remaining work. The changes we  observed include risks that have been encountered both by JWST and  Northrop Grumman that were not included in their 2011 cost risk  analyses. For example, the highest risk for the JWST project in  September 2014 was the delivery date of the cryocooler to mission  integration and testing events, which was entered into the project\u2019s risk  database in January 2013. By October 2014, this risk had become one of  the JWST project\u2019s top issues and is threatening cost and schedule  reserves. Additionally, 67 percent of the risks present in April 2014 on  Northrop Grumman\u2019s list of project risks were not present in September  2011. The JWST project\u2019s budget system provides a means of quantifying  future threats to the project\u2019s budget by estimating a threat\u2019s potential  cost and likelihood of occurrence. However, our analysis of the system\u2019s  data since the replan found that almost 70 percent of reserve spending  has not been anticipated as threats by the budget system. Without an  analytical framework that comprehensively captures future risks into  potential project costs, the project\u2019s estimates do not represent a  comprehensive portrayal of the financial status of the project. As a  consequence, the project and Congress do not have all the data  necessary to be confident in the project\u2019s projected budgetary needs.", "To address the lack of updated information, GAO planned to conduct an  updated cost risk analysis on the Northrop Grumman prime contract,  given that it represents the most significant contractor work remaining on  the project. The methodology for this analysis, which has been cited as  an important tool by NASA\u2019s cost estimating community, would have  provided an updated level of confidence associated with the project  meeting its cost estimate and allowed decision makers to determine if  additional cost reserves were warranted to mitigate future risks. However,  we were unable to execute our methodology because Northrop Grumman  declined to allow GAO to conduct an independent, unbiased analysis.  GAO best practices for cost estimating require anonymous interviews with  technical experts on a project to discuss the project\u2019s risks. We were not  able to create this environment because while Northrop Grumman  officials were open to allowing us to conduct the analysis, they did not  allow us to interview employees without a manager present. Anonymity is  critical to the methodology in order to ensure the interviews are unbiased  and provide a comprehensive portrayal of project risks.", "The JWST project and NASA disagreed with the approach of an  independent cost risk analysis conducted by an outside organization at  this point in the project. Additionally, neither believes that an organization  external to NASA can fully comprehend the project\u2019s risks, and any such  analysis would be overly conservative due to the complexities of the risks.  As a result, they asserted that the results of any outside analysis would  not be representative of the real risk posture of the project. GAO\u2019s best  practices call for cost estimates to be compared to independent cost  estimates in addition to being regularly updated. Without an independent  and updated analysis, both the committee members\u2019 and NASA\u2019s  oversight and management of JWST will be constrained since the impact  of newer risks have not been reflected in key tools, including the cost  estimate.", "In response to our concerns, NASA indicated it would conduct its own  cost risk analysis for the committee members of the Northrop Grumman  contract. The project already had plans to use additional EVM analysis,  which the project does plan to use as a management tool, that  incorporates risks to provide a health check on the project\u2019s cost  reserves. However, a NASA project official stated that data from the cost  risk analysis was for the purpose of providing cost information to  committee members, but the JWST project does not intend to use it to  manage the project. Additionally, the project has indicated that it will  consider updating the cost risk analysis in the future, but presently has  not committed to regularly updating the analysis. To maintain quality cost  estimates over the life of a project, best practices state that cost risk  analyses be updated regularly to incorporate new risks and be used in  conjunction with EVM analysis to validate cost estimates. If the project  does not follow best practices in conducting its cost risk analysis or use it  to manage the project, the resulting information may be unreliable and not  substantively provide insight into JWST\u2019s potential costs to allow either  Congress or project officials to take any warranted action."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Contractors Have Been Responsive to Incentives, but Final Evaluation May Not Reflect Total Contract Performance", "paragraphs": ["The JWST project has used NASA\u2019s award fee structure to implement  incentives that align with conferee\u2019s priorities for cost and schedule for  JWST and contractors have been responsive to these incentives, for  example by making changes to key practices to improve communication.

During negotiations, NASA  and Northrop Grumman agreed to replace a $56 million on-orbit incentive  fee with award fees to increase the available award fee for the entire  contract to almost a quarter of a billion dollars.

While  some use of schedule reserve is expected, JWST is a schedule-driven  program and preserving the reserve is critical. The project will have fewer  opportunities for the types of workarounds it has been able to incorporate  thus far because initiating work is often dependent on the successful and  timely completion of the prior work. Further, the project has limited funds  available in the short-term to use to preserve schedule. Effectively  managing and making targeted use of existing cost reserves to preserve  schedule reserve until fiscal year 2016, when more reserves are  available, is critical to maintaining the planned launch date in October  2018.", "Three years after the 2011 replan, project officials and the prime  contractor have not recently assessed risks for the potential impact to  cost to ensure they are measuring progress against a valid baseline.  While the project reports that JWST remains on schedule and within its  developmental cost cap, this is based on outdated analysis and risks that  were present in 2011. Without incorporating the myriad of new and  sometimes significant risks into any assessment of cost risk, the project\u2019s  cost risk posture cannot be independently validated. While NASA has  chosen to conduct a cost risk analysis of Northrop Grumman\u2019s remaining  work itself, its quality hinges on whether NASA chooses to follow best  practices. Doing so would better ensure that the results of the analysis  would be reliable and would provide an accurate portrayal of status that  can then be used to ensure better informed decisions are being made  about project funding forward, at least for Northrop Grumman\u2019s remaining  work. Furthermore, because JWST is one of NASA\u2019s most expensive and  complex science projects and any issues can have significant impacts to  other science projects, going above and beyond what is required per  policy or guidance is one small step that could help demonstrate NASA\u2019s  commitment to the success of JWST and to improving acquisition  management outcomes.", "Effectively using the award fee evaluation process to thoroughly and fairly  assess contractor performance is critical given the size and long duration  of the JWST contracts, in particular its prime contract with Northrop  Grumman.

Fairly assessing that performance over the  life of the contract is especially critical for JWST given the variance in  performance that Northrop Grumman has shown from contract award in  2002 to the present.

Furthermore, NASA noted the JWST project initiated a cost risk analysis  of the prime contract that is incorporating best practices and will update it  when required by NASA policy.", "NASA policy did not require cost risk analyses when the JWST project  began, therefore the project is also not required to update such an  analysis. Policy notwithstanding, NASA and GAO\u2019s best practices do  support conducting a cost risk analysis and updating it as product  development progresses. Specifically, NASA's cost estimating handbook  states that while the product is being designed, developed, and tested,  there are changes which can impact the estimate and the risk  assessment. It is critical to capture these changes to maintain a realistic  program estimate now and in the future. During this phase, programmatic  data may have just as much of an impact on the estimate and risk  assessment as technical data. We acknowledge in the report the JWST  project\u2019s use of EVM data, but reiterate that it does not reflect the  potential impact of future risks. As our report notes, the JWST project has  only started two of the five integration and test periods and risks have  changed significantly since a cost risk analysis was last conducted on the  prime contractor's work. As the telescope is one of NASA's most complex  and expensive projects, both JWST and NASA officials have a  tremendous stake in the success of the JWST project. As a result, an  important best practice NASA can follow is to conduct a cost risk analysis  in the future so that realistic estimates are being communicated to  Congress, especially as new risks emerge in future testing.
