As a result, IP version 6 (IPv6) was developed to increase the amount of available IP address space. The new protocol is gaining increased attention from regions with limited IP addresses. For its testimony, GAO was asked to discuss the findings and recommendations of its recent study of IPv6 (GAO-05-471). In this study, GAO was asked to (1) describe the key characteristics of IPv6; (2) identify the key planning considerations for federal agencies in transitioning to IPv6; and (3) determine the progress made by the Department of Defense (DOD) and other major agencies in the transition to IPv6."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The key characteristics of IPv6 are designed to increase address space, promote flexibility and functionality, and enhance security. For example, by using 128-bit addresses rather than 32-bit addresses, IPv6 dramatically increases the available Internet address space from approximately 4.3 billion in IPv4 to approximately 3.4 x 10^38 in IPv6. Key planning considerations for federal agencies include recognizing that the transition is already under way, because agency networks already include IPv6-capable software and equipment. Other important agency planning considerations include developing inventories and assessing risks; creating business cases that identify organizational needs and goals; establishing policies and enforcement mechanisms; determining costs; and identifying timelines and methods for transition. Managing the security aspects of transition is also an important consideration because poorly managed IPv6 capabilities can put agency information and systems at risk. DOD has made progress in developing a business case, policies, timelines, and processes for transitioning to IPv6. Unlike DOD, the majority of other major federal agencies reported that they have not yet initiated key planning efforts for IPv6. In its report, GAO recommended, among other things, that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instruct agencies to begin to address key planning considerations for the IPv6 transition and that agencies act to mitigate near-term IPv6 security risks.

To send a communication  from one computer to another, a series of addresses is attached to  information sent from the first computer to route the information to  its final destination. The protocol that guides the administration of  the routing addresses is the Internet protocol.

An IP address consists of a fixed sequence of numbers.  IPv4 uses a 32-bit address format, which provides approximately 4.3  billion unique IP addresses.", "By providing a numerical description of the location of networked  computers, addresses distinguish one computer from another on the  Internet. In some ways, an IP address is like a physical street  address. For example, if a letter is going to be sent from one  location to another, the contents of the letter must be placed in an  envelope that provides addresses for the sender and receiver.  Similarly, if data are to be transmitted across the Internet from a  source to a destination, IP addresses must be placed in an IP header.  Figure 1 is a simplified illustration of this concept. In addition to  containing the addresses of sender and receiver, the header also  contains a series of fields that provide information about what is  being transmitted.", "Limited IPv4 address space prompted organizations that need large  numbers of IP addresses to implement technical solutions to  compensate. For example, network administrators began to use one  unique IP address to represent a large number of users. In other  words, to the outside world, all computers behind a device known  as a network address translation router appear to have the same  address. While this method has enabled organizations to  compensate for the limited number of globally unique IP addresses  available with IPv4, the resulting network structure has eliminated  the original end-to-end communications model of the Internet.", "Because of the limitations of IPv4, in 1994 the Internet Engineering  Task Force (IETF) began reviewing proposals for a successor to  IPv4 that would increase IP address space and simplify routing. The  IETF established a working group to be specifically responsible for  developing the specifications and standardization of IPv6. Over the  past 10 years, IPv6 has evolved into a mature standard. A complete  list of the IPv6 documents can be found at the IETF Web site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IPv6 Is Gaining Momentum Globally", "paragraphs": ["Interest in IPv6 is gaining momentum around the world, particularly  in parts of the world that have limited IPv4 address space to meet  their industry and consumer communications needs.

As  a result, the region is investing in IPv6 development, testing, and  implementation. For example, the Japanese government\u2019s e-Japan  Priority Policy Program mandated the incorporation of IPv6 and set  a deadline of 2005 to upgrade existing systems in both the public  and private sectors. The government has helped to support the  establishment of an IPv6 Promotion Council to facilitate issues  related to development and deployment and is providing tax  incentives to promote deployment. In addition, major Japanese  corporations in the communications and consumer electronics  sectors are also developing IPv6 networks and products. Further,  the Chinese government has reportedly set aside approximately  $170 million to develop an IPv6-capable infrastructure.", "The European Commission initiated a task force in April 2001 to  design an IPv6 Roadmap. The Roadmap serves as an update and  plan of action for development and future perspectives. It also  serves as a way to coordinate European efforts for developing,  testing, and deploying IPv6.

For example, most major operating systems, printers,  and routers currently support IPv6. Therefore, it is important for  agencies to note that the transition to IPv6 is different from a  software upgrade because, when it is installed, its capability is also  being integrated into the software and hardware.", "Besides recognizing that an IPv6 transition is already under way,  other key considerations for federal agencies to address in an IPv6  transition include significant IT planning efforts and immediate  actions to ensure the security of agency information and networks.", "Important planning considerations include the following:  \u25cf  Developing inventories and assessing risks\u2014An inventory of  equipment (software and hardware) provides management with an  understanding of the scope of an IPv6 transition and assists in  focusing agency risk assessments. These assessments are essential  steps in determining what controls are required to protect a network  and what level of resources should be expended on controls.  \u25cf  Creating business cases for an IPv6 transition\u2014A business case  usually identifies the organizational need for the system and  provides a clear statement of the high-level system goals. One key  aspect to consider while drafting the business case for IPv6 is to  understand how many devices an agency wants to connect to the  Internet. This will help in determining how much IPv6 address space  is needed for the agency. Within the business case, it is crucial to  include how the new technology will integrate with the agency\u2019s  existing enterprise architecture.  \u25cf  Establishing policies and enforcement mechanisms\u2014Developing  and establishing IPv6 transition policies and enforcement  mechanisms are important considerations for ensuring an efficient  and effective transition. Furthermore, because of the scope,  complexities, and costs involved in an IPv6 transition, effective  enforcement of agency IPv6 policies is an important consideration  for management officials.  \u25cf  Determining the costs\u2014Cost benefit analyses and return-on- investment calculations can be used to justify investments. During  the year 2000 (Y2K) technology challenge, the federal government  amended the Federal Acquisition Regulation and mandated that all  contracts for information technology include a clause requiring the  delivered systems or service to be ready for the Y2K date change.  This helped prevent the federal government from procuring systems  and services that might have been obsolete or that required costly  upgrades. Similarly, proactive integration of IPv6 requirements into  federal acquisition requirements can reduce the costs and  complexity of the IPv6 transition of federal agencies and ensure that  federal applications are able to operate in an IPv6 environment  without costly upgrades.  \u25cf  Identifying timelines and methods for the transition\u2014Timelines  and process management can assist a federal agency in determining  when to authorize its various component organizations to allow IPv6  traffic and features. Additionally, agencies can benefit from  understanding the different types of transition methods or  approaches that can allow them to use both IPv4 and IPv6 without  causing significant interruptions in network services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "If Not Managed, IPv6 Features Can Be Abused", "paragraphs": ["As IPv6-capable software and devices accumulate in agency  networks, they could be abused by attackers if not managed  properly. For example, IPv6 is included in most computer operating  systems and, if not enabled by default, is easy for administrators to  enable either intentionally or as an unintentional byproduct of  running a program. We tested IPv6 features and found that, if  firewalls and intrusion detection systems are not appropriately  configured, IPv6 traffic may not be detected or controlled, leaving  systems vulnerable to attacks by malicious hackers.", "Further, in April 2005, the United States Computer Emergency  Response Team (US-CERT), located at the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), issued an IPv6 cyber security alert to federal  agencies based on our IPv6 test scenarios and discussions with DHS  officials. The alert warned federal agencies that unmanaged or  rogue implementations of IPv6 present network management  security risks. Specifically, the US-CERT notice informed agencies  that some firewalls and network intrusion detection systems do not  provide IPv6 detection or filtering capability and that malicious  users might be able to tunnel IPv6 traffic through these security  devices undetected. Further, one feature of IPv6, known as  automatic configuration (where a device that is IPv6 enabled will  derive its own IP address from neighboring routers without an  administrator\u2019s intervention), could allow devices to automatically  configure themselves with an IPv6 address without authorization.

To help ensure that IPv6 would not result  in unexpected costs for the federal agencies, we recommended that  the Director consider amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation  with specific language that requires that all information technology  systems and applications purchased by the federal government be  able to operate in an IPv6 environment. Finally, because poorly  configured and unmanaged IPv6 capabilities present immediate  risks to federal agency networks, we recommended that agency  heads take immediate action to address the near-term security risks.
