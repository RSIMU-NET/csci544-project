To  improve the methodological soundness of future federally funded impact  evaluations, we recommended that these impact evaluations include post- program data and comparison groups within their scope. In 1998, DOJ  implemented our recommendations and, beginning in 1999, required its  DCPO-funded programs to periodically provide performance and outcome  data on their drug court programs. In addition, in 1998, DOJ undertook an  effort, through NIJ, to conduct a national impact evaluation using 14 DCPO- funded drug court programs. These efforts included the collection of post- program data within their scope.", "As agreed with your staffs, this report focuses on DOJ\u2019s (1) Drug Courts  Program Office\u2019s (DCPO) efforts to collect performance and outcome data  from federally funded drug court programs and (2) National Institute of  Justice\u2019s (NIJ) efforts to complete a national impact evaluation of federally  funded drug court programs.

Since fiscal year 1995,  Congress has appropriated about $267 million in Violent Crime Act related  funding to DOJ for the federal drug court program. DCPO funding in direct  support of drug court programs has increased from an average of about $9  million in fiscal years 1995 and 1996 to an average of about $31 million for  fiscal years 1997 through 2001. Between fiscal years 1995 and 2001, DCPO  has awarded about $174.5 million in grants to fund the planning,  implementation, and enhancement of drug court programs. About $21.5  million in technical assistance, training, and evaluations grants were  awarded. About $19.6 million were obligated for management and  administration purposes and to fund nongrant technical assistance,  training, and evaluation efforts. Since the inception of the DCPO drug court  program, a total of $3 million in prior year recoveries have been realized.  About $4.5 million through fiscal year 2001 had not been obligated.

Specifically, the system does not contain a unique drug court program  identifier, does not track grants awarded to a single grantee but used for  more than one drug court program, and contains data entry errors that  impact the reliability of data on the type of grants awarded. For example, at  the time of our review, the system contained some incorrectly assigned  grant numbers, did not always identify the type of grant awarded, and  incorrectly identified several grantees as receiving a planning,  implementation, and enhancement grant in fiscal year 2000.

One of the  Drug Court Clearinghouse\u2019s functions has been to identify DCPO-funded  drug court programs. However, the Drug Court Clearinghouse has only  been tasked since 1998 with following up with a segment of DCPO grantees  to determine their implementation date. Thus, the information provided to  DCPO on the universe of DCPO-funded drug court programs is at best an  estimate and not a precise count of DCPO drug court program grantees.  Noting that its current grant information system was not intended to  readily identify and track the number of DCPO-funded drug court  programs, DCPO officials said that they plan to develop a new management  information system that will enable DOJ to do so.

Until DOJ takes such  actions, the Congress, public, and other stakeholders will continue to lack  sufficient information to (1) measure long-term program benefits, if any;  (2) assess the impact of federally funded drug court programs on the  criminal behavior of substance abuse offenders; or (3) assess whether drug  court programs are an effective use of federal funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the Department of Justice\u2019s collection of data on the  performance and impact of federally funded drug court programs, we  recommend that the Attorney General  develop and implement a management information system that is able  to track and readily identify the universe of drug court programs funded  by DCPO;  take steps to ensure and sustain an adequate grantee response rate to  DCPO\u2019s data collection efforts by improving efforts to notify and remind  grantees of their reporting requirements;  take corrective action towards grantees who do not comply with DOJ\u2019s  data collection reporting requirements;  reinstate the collection of post-program data in DCPO\u2019s data collection  effort, selectively spot checking grantee responses to ensure accurate  reporting;  analyze performance and outcome data collected from grantees and  report annually on the results; and  consolidate the multiple DOJ-funded drug court program-related data  collection efforts to better ensure that the primary focus is on the  collection and reporting of data on DCPO-funded drug court programs.", "To better ensure that needed information on the impact of federally funded  drug court programs is made available to the Congress, public, and other  drug court stakeholders as early as possible, we also recommend that the  Attorney General take immediate steps to accelerate the funding and  implementation of a methodologically sound national impact evaluation  and to consider ways to reduce the time needed to provide information on  the overall impact of federally funded drug court programs.

The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs  noted that we made several valuable recommendations for improving the  collection of data on the performance and impact of federally funded drug  court programs and outlined steps DOJ is considering to address two of the  six recommendations we make for improving its collection of data on the  performance and impact of federally funded drug court programs.  However, concerning the remaining four recommendations for improving  DOJ\u2019s data collection effort, DOJ does not specifically outline any plans (1)  for taking corrective action towards grantees who do not comply with  DCPO\u2019s data collection reporting requirements; (2) to reinstate the  collection of post program data in DCPO\u2019s data collection effort, despite  the evidence cited in our report supporting the feasibility of collecting post  program data; (3) to analyze and report results on the performance and  outcome of DCPO grantees; and (4) to consolidate the multiple DOJ-funded  drug court program-related data collection efforts to ensure that the  primary focus of any future efforts is on the collection and reporting of data  on DCPO-funded programs.", "Although DOJ points out in its comments that a number of individual  program evaluation studies have been completed, no national impact  evaluation of these programs has been done to date. We continue to believe  that until post-program follow-up data on program participants are  collected across a broad range of programs and also included within the  scope of future program and impact evaluations (including nonprogram  participant data), it will not be possible to reach firm conclusions about  whether drug court programs are an effective use of federal funds or  whether different types of drug court program structures funded by DCPO  work better than others. Also, unless these results are compared with those  on the impact of other criminal justice programs, it will not be clear  whether drug court programs are more or less effective than other criminal  justice programs. As such, these limitations have prevented firm  conclusions from being drawn on the overall impact of federally funded  drug court programs.", "With respect to our recommendations for improving DOJ\u2019s drug court  program-related impact evaluation efforts, DOJ, in its comments, outlines  steps it is taking to complete a multisite impact evaluation and its plans to  monitor the progress of this effort and to provide interim information  during various intervals. As discussed on page 18 of this report, this effort  is intended to be done at a national level, and the scope is to include  comparison groups and the collection of individual-level and post-program  recidivism data.", "On April 1, 2002, RAND provided written comments on the segment of the  draft report  relating to DOJ\u2019s efforts to complete a national impact  evaluation (see app. VIII). In its comments, RAND, as we do in our report,  acknowledges the need for improvements in the data collection  infrastructure for DCPO-funded drug court programs. RAND notes its  rationale for why it views the deliverables associated with phase I of the  NIJ-sponsored national impact evaluation as being timely and notes that  researchers generally have discretion to revise timelines and scopes of  work, with the agreement of the client.  However, as we point out in our  report (pp. 17-18 and app. VI), RAND requested several no-cost extensions  to complete the deliverables for various task milestones and did not  produce a viable design strategy for addressing the impact of DCPO-funded  drug court programs. In addition, NIJ officials said that RAND also did not  deliver a complete description and analysis of drug court implementation  issues to NIJ until it received the first draft of RAND\u2019s report in March 2001.  The deliverable RAND refers to in its comment letter was a paper that  RAND had prepared for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which NIJ  never considered to be a product under the grant to evaluate the impact of  DCPO-funded drug court programs. As we also pointed out in our report  (p. 17 and app. VI), NIJ was not amenable to RAND changing the scope or  methodology of the national impact evaluation effort.  In addition, RAND  commented that a \u201csimple\u201d evaluation design was expected. NIJ\u2019s original  objective, however, never called for a simple evaluation design, but rather a  viable design strategy involving the use of comparison groups and the  collection of post-program data.", "We conducted our work at DOJ headquarters in Washington, D.C., between  March 2001 and February 2002 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly release its contents earlier,  we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue  date.

The scope of our  work was limited to (1) identifying the processes DCPO used to implement  its semiannual data collection effort; (2) determining DCPO grantees'  compliance with semiannual data collection and reporting requirements;  (3) determining what action, if any, DCPO has taken to monitor and ensure  grantee compliance with the data collection reporting requirements;  (4) identifying factors and barriers that may have contributed to a grantee's  nonresponse and to delays in and the subsequent discontinuation of the  NIJ-sponsored national evaluation of DCPO-funded programs; and  (5) identifying improvements that may be warranted in DOJ's data  collection efforts.", "To assess how well DCPO has implemented efforts to collect performance  and outcome data from federally funded drug court programs, we  (1) interviewed appropriate DOJ officials and other drug court program  stakeholders and practitioners; (2) reviewed DCPO program guidelines to  determine the drug court program grantee data collection and reporting  requirements; (3) analyzed recent survey data collected by DCPO and the  Drug Court Clearinghouse and Technical Assistance Project (Drug Court  Clearinghouse) to obtain information on the number of drug court  programs that have been able to provide outcome data; and  (4) conducted structured interviews with a statistically valid probability  sample of DCPO-funded drug court programs to determine (a) the  programs' ability to comply with DCPO's data collection requirements,  (b) whether the programs had complied with the data collection  requirements, and (c) for those programs that did not comply with the data  collection requirements, why they did not comply and what action, if any,  DCPO had taken.", "For our structured interviews, we selected a stratified, random sample of  112 DCPO-funded drug court programs from a total of 315 drug court  programs identified by DOJ as DCPO grantees in 2000. We stratified our  sample into two groups based on whether the programs were listed in  DCPO's database as respondents or nonrespondents to the required DCPO  semiannual data collection survey in year 2000. To validate the accuracy of  the list provided by DCPO, we compared the listing of 315 drug court  programs identified as required to comply during a year 2000 reporting  period with information on drug court program-related grant awards made  by DCPO that was provided by OJP\u2019s Office of the Comptroller to  determine if the program was a DCPO grantee during the year 2000  reporting period. We defined a respondent as any drug court program  grantee that was identified in DCPO's database as having responded to the  DCPO survey during each applicable year 2000 reporting period. We  defined a nonrespondent as a drug court program grantee that was  identified in DCPO's database as not having responded to the DCPO survey  during any applicable year 2000 reporting period. We used a structured data  collection instrument to interview grantees. We interviewed 73  nonrespondents and 39 respondents. All results were weighted to represent  the total population of drug court programs operating under a DCPO grant  in year 2000.", "All statistical samples are subject to sampling errors. Measures of sampling  error are defined by two elements, the width of the confidence intervals  around the estimate (sometimes called the precision of the estimate) and  the confidence level at which the intervals are computed. Because we  followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our sample  is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. As each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence  level in the precision of our sample results as a 95 percent confidence  interval. This is the interval that would contain the actual population value  for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95  percent confident that each of the confidence intervals based on the  structured interviews will include the true value in the study population. All  percentage estimates from the structured interviews have sampling errors  of plus or minus 10 percentage points or less unless otherwise noted. For  example, this means that if a percentage estimate is 60 percent and the 95  percent confidence interval is plus or minus 10 percentage points, we have  95 percent confidence that the true value in the population falls between 50  percent and 70 percent.", "We performed limited verification of the drug court programs in our sample  that were identified as non-respondents in DCPO\u2019s database to determine  whether they were actually DCPO grantees in 2000. Data obtained from the  drug court programs was self-reported and, except for evidence obtained  to confirm grantee compliance with DCPO's year 2000 reporting  requirements, we generally did not validate their responses. We also did not  fully verify the accuracy of the total number of drug court programs, or  universe of drug court programs, provided to us by DCPO and the Drug  Court Clearinghouse.", "To assess DOJ's efforts to complete a national impact evaluation of  federally funded drug court programs, we interviewed officials from  (1) NIJ, who were responsible for DOJ's national evaluation effort;  (2) DCPO, who were responsible for administering the federal drug court  program under the Violent Crime Act; and (3) RAND, who were awarded  the NIJ grant to complete phase I of the national evaluation effort.
