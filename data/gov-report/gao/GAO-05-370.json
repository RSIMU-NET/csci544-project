Under this program, NHTSA conducts vehicle crash and rollover tests to encourage manufacturers to make safety improvements to new vehicles and provide the public with information on the relative safety of vehicles. GAO examined (1) how NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program crash tests vehicles, rates their safety, and reports the results to the public; (2) how NHTSA's program compares to other programs that crash test vehicles and report results to the public; and (3) the impact of the program and opportunities to enhance its effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA conducts three types of tests in the New Car Assessment Program--full frontal and angled side crash tests and a rollover test. Each year, NHTSA tests new vehicles that are expected to have high sales volume, have been redesigned with structural changes, or have improved safety equipment. Based on test results, vehicles receive ratings from one to five stars, with five stars being the best, to indicate the vehicles' relative crashworthiness and which are less likely to roll over. NHTSA makes ratings available to the public on the Internet and through a brochure. Other publications, such as Consumer Reports, use NHTSA's test results in their safety assessments. GAO identified four other programs--the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's program and the New Car Assessment Programs in Australia, Europe, and Japan--that crash test vehicles and report the results to the public. They share the goals of encouraging manufacturers to improve vehicle safety and providing safety information to consumers. These programs conduct different types of frontal and side crash tests, and some perform other tests, such as pedestrian tests, that are not conducted under the U.S. program. Only the U.S. program conducts a rollover test. The other programs measure test results differently and include more potential injuries to occupants in ratings. They also reported their test results differently, with all summarizing at least some of the scores or combining them into an overall crashworthiness rating to make comparisons easier. NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program has been successful in encouraging manufacturers to make safer vehicles and providing information to consumers. However, the program is at a crossroads where it will need to change to maintain its relevance. The usefulness of the current tests has been eroded by the growing number of larger pickups, minivans, and sport utility vehicles in the vehicle fleet since the program began. In addition, NCAP scores have increased to the point where there is little difference in vehicle ratings. As a result, the program provides little incentive for manufacturers to further improve safety, and consumers can see few differences among new vehicles. Opportunities to enhance the program include developing approaches to better measure the interaction of large and small vehicles and occupant protection in rollovers, rating technologies that help prevent crashes, and using different injury measures to rate the crash results. NHTSA also has opportunities to enhance the presentation and timeliness of the information provided to consumers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Motor vehicle travel is the primary means of transportation in the United  States. Yet for all its advantages, deaths and injuries resulting from motor  vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for all persons from 3  through 33 years old. In 2003, 42,643 people were killed and more than 2.8  million people were injured in motor vehicle crashes. Frontal crashes  caused the largest portion of occupant deaths (about 41 percent), followed  by rollovers and side impact crashes (30 percent and 22 percent,  respectively). In addition to the loss of life, motor vehicle crashes have a  high economic cost, which the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA) estimated at over $230 billion in 2000, the most  recent year for which cost estimates were available.", "Efforts to reduce fatality rates in motor vehicle crashes have resulted in  some improvement. The fatality rate per 100 million miles of travel in 2003  was at a historic low of 1.48, down from 1.75 per 100 million miles of travel  in 1993. The Department of Transportation (DOT) attributes this change to  several factors, including increased safety belt use, reduction of  alcohol-related deaths, and vehicle safety programs, including Federal  Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and the New Car Assessment Program  (NCAP), both run by NHTSA. Under NCAP, which began in 1978, NHTSA  conducts frontal and side crash tests and rollover tests of new cars, light  trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles (SUV) and reports the results to the  public. The specific goals of the program are to encourage market forces  that prompt vehicle manufacturers to make safety improvements to new  vehicles and provide the public with objective information on the relative  safety performance of vehicles.", "Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards are regulations that establish  minimum performance levels that manufacturers must self-certify to in  order to sell vehicles in the United States. Under the safety standards,  NHTSA requires vehicles to pass a number of performance tests to ensure  that the minimum safety level is met. The NCAP frontal and side crash tests  are based on two of the crash tests carried out under the safety standards.  However, the NCAP tests are conducted at 5 miles per hour faster so that  the differentiation between vehicles becomes more apparent. When  considering changes to NCAP, NHTSA generally follows the rulemaking  process, which includes seeking informal comments on proposed changes  before they become effective.", "The Senate Appropriations Committee Report accompanying the  Department of Transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004  (S. 1589) directed us to conduct a study of the New Car Assessment  Program.

To document how NHTSA  reports the results to the public, we consulted NHTSA officials, the  Internet, and other vehicle safety information sources, such as Consumer  Reports. To compare NHTSA\u2019s program with other crash test and rating  programs, domestic and foreign, we interviewed officials of the Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety and the New Car Assessment Programs of  Australia, Europe, and Japan.

Vehicle characteristics such as size, weight, and the type of  restraint system affect crashworthiness because they play a large role in  determining the likelihood and extent of occupant injury from a crash.  Vehicle characteristics such as vehicle stability and braking performance  are examples of crash avoidance features in that they aid the driver in  preventing a crash from occurring.", "The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) was established in response to  a requirement in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of  1972 to provide consumers with a measure of the relative crashworthiness of passenger vehicles. NCAP\u2019s goals are to improve occupant safety by  providing market incentives for vehicle manufacturers to voluntarily design  vehicles with improved crashworthiness and provide independent safety  information to aid consumers in making comparative vehicle purchase  decisions. NHTSA has pursued these goals by conducting frontal and side  crash tests and a rollover test, assigning star ratings, and reporting the  results to the public.

In 1996, NHTSA first began the  side-impact NCAP test for model year 1997 vehicles. NHTSA expanded the  side-impact NCAP test to include light trucks, vans, and SUVs for model  year 1999. NHTSA began to rate vehicles for their rollover risk beginning  with the 2001 model year. NHTSA initially rated the risk of vehicle rollover  by measuring the top-heaviness of a vehicle and comparing this  measurement to the top-heaviness of vehicles involved in single-vehicle  crashes, as reflected in crash data. As required by the November 2000  Transportation, Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation  (TREAD) Act, NHTSA began dynamic rollover testing on model year 2004  vehicles to supplement the measurement of a vehicle\u2019s top-heaviness in  determining a vehicle\u2019s rollover risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCAP Crash Tests Vehicles, Rates Their Safety, and Reports the Results to the Public", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA conducts three types of tests in NCAP: a full frontal crash test, an  angled side crash test, and a rollover test.

Officials in Australia stated they are  considering replacing the perpendicular side test with a pole side test to  better test the increasing number of SUVs on their roadways. They said that  SUVs are higher off the ground and heavier than most passenger cars.

NHTSA  officials said they use these measures because they are the most important  indicators of serious or fatal injury in frontal and side crashes. In addition  to the U.S. NCAP measures, the Insurance Institute uses measurements of  the neck, left leg and foot, and right leg and foot for its frontal crash  analysis and measurements of the head, neck, pelvis, and left leg for its side  crash analysis. Australia and Euro NCAP use the neck, knee, femur, pelvis,  and leg and foot for frontal tests and head, abdomen, and pelvis for side  tests. Japan uses neck, femur, and tibia measurements for its frontal crash  analysis and head, abdomen, and pelvis measurements for its side crash  analysis. The other organizations use some of these additional measures to  capture what in some cases may not necessarily be life-threatening injuries,  such as those to the victim\u2019s legs.

While this size dummy is used by most programs for the  side-impact tests, there are differences in the dummy types and the  instrumentation it contains. In addition, in its side-impact tests, the  Insurance Institute uses a smaller female dummy (about 5 feet tall and  weighing about 110 pounds). Insurance Institute officials said they chose  this dummy because there is evidence that females are more at risk in side  collisions. It hopes this test will encourage manufacturers to install side  curtain air bags that are designed to extend low enough to protect smaller  passengers.

Without addressing these changes, NCAP  provides little incentive to manufacturers to continue to improve safety and  may provide consumers with only limited comparative information on  vehicle safety.", "Since NHTSA began NCAP testing in 1979, there have been dramatic  changes in the vehicle fleet. Vehicles such as pickups, minivans, and SUVs  have transformed the fleet once dominated by passenger cars. There are  now more than 85 million pickups, minivans, and SUVs on the road,  representing about 37 percent of the vehicle fleet. The change in vehicle  fleet presents new safety challenges that NCAP\u2019s testing does not fully  address\u2014vehicle incompatibility and rollover. The issue of incompatibility  emerges when a large vehicle such as a pickup, minivan, or SUV crashes  into a smaller, lighter vehicle because the larger vehicle can inflict serious  damage that is particularly dangerous to the occupants of the smaller  vehicle. The current NCAP frontal and side tests do not account for  vehicles of different size, weight, and geometry crashing into one another.  Significant differences in ratings can result when tests are designed to  address these vehicle differences, as evidenced by comparing the  Insurance Institute side test results with NCAP results. The Insurance  Institute, which uses a higher SUV-like barrier, gave 27 vehicles its lowest  rating (Poor) in side-impact tests, primarily because there were no side air  bags in the vehicle. NHTSA, which uses a low barrier and, unlike the  Insurance Institute, does not include head measures in its star calculations,  gave 21 of these same 27 vehicles (77 percent) four- or five-star safety  ratings. Also, with the increase in pickups, minivans, and SUVs in the  nation\u2019s fleet, vehicle rollover has become a more important issue; in 2003,  rollovers accounted for over 10,000 fatalities, or more than 30 percent of all  passenger vehicle occupant fatalities. However, the NCAP rollover test only  measures the likelihood that a vehicle will roll over and does not assess the  safety afforded to occupants should a rollover occur.", "NCAP frontal and side crash test results have improved to a point where  there is little difference among most vehicles\u2019 ratings. In 2004, NHTSA provided the public with NCAP rating information for 234 vehicles.

Of the 49  frontal and 18 side crash tests conducted in 2004, over 95 percent received  a four- or five-star rating.

Also, with  almost all scores being about the same, consumers do not have  comparative safety information that differentiates significantly among  vehicles.", "Lastly, NHTSA is upgrading the frontal and side tests under the Federal  Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which make current NCAP testing less  meaningful. For frontal tests, safety standards will require that for  vehicles built after September 1, 2007, manufacturers must certify the  crashworthiness of their vehicles at 35 mph (instead of the current 30  mph). This change will eliminate the speed difference between the frontal  NCAP and the frontal belted safety standard tests. Because of this change,  NHTSA has begun to examine alternatives to its current frontal crash test  program and hopes to finalize any changes to the NCAP frontal test in 2006.  Similarly, NHTSA announced in May 2004 that it is proposing to add a  20 mph side pole crash test to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.  This test will use a more technically advanced average-size male dummy  than is currently used in the NCAP tests and a dummy that represents a  small female. According to NHTSA officials, the new test and advanced  dummy will enable them to confidently measure compliance with head  injury standards and challenge automakers to provide adequate head  protection to vehicle occupants in side impact crashes.

A  2003 NHTSA study found that in frontal collisions involving a car and a light  truck or van, there were almost four times the number of fatalities in the  car than in the light truck or van. The success of NCAP and the other  testing programs may have indirectly contributed to this problem.  According to some experts, to improve crashworthiness scores of large  vehicles, vehicle manufacturers have increased the rigidity of the structure  that absorbs and manages the substantial forces in the crash tests. As a  result, the structure of large vehicles has had to become more substantial  and stiffer than that of smaller vehicles because the larger vehicles must  absorb more energy in the crash test due to their greater weight.", "NHTSA\u2019s NCAP frontal tests could potentially be modified to measure and  rate vehicle incompatibility. Some experts, NHTSA officials, and vehicle  manufacturers told us that there are a number of approaches being  investigated that could help to address vehicle incompatibility. For  example, some researchers are examining the use of sensors in test walls;  crashing a moving deformable barrier into the front of the test vehicles,  instead of propelling the test vehicle into a solid wall; or crashing test  vehicles into a solid wall at varying speeds, depending on the size of the  vehicle, to equate the crash to hitting a standardized vehicle. The  hypothesis is that information obtained by measuring how vehicles strike  the crash test barrier could be used to estimate the relative damage that a  vehicle would cause in collisions with another vehicle and could be used to  rate the aggressiveness of vehicles. Using a moving barrier for frontal crash  tests would make test results comparable across weight classes, as is the  case with the current side-impact rating, because all vehicles would be  struck by the same size barrier. Using variable speeds based on vehicle  weight would also allow ratings of small and large vehicles to be compared.  Each of these alternatives requires further development and testing to  assess the overall safety implications, including the potential for reducing  fatalities in passenger cars when struck by larger vehicles, the potential for  diminished occupant protection for large vehicles in single vehicle crashes, and consideration of potential costs. Ratings based on these tests could  provide manufacturers with incentives to address incompatibilities  between large and small vehicles and provide consumers with information  on the potential safety hazards associated with vehicle incompatibility.", "The problem of vehicle incompatibility is even worse in side crashes. When  a large vehicle like an SUV crashes into the side of a small vehicle, the  larger vehicle may miss the door sill of the vehicle, causing most of the  energy to be directed to the door and window areas, as shown in figure 25.  In such cases, the injuries can be exacerbated when there is no side head  protection, leaving the window as the only barrier between the occupant\u2019s  head and the impacting vehicle. Head injuries are a major cause of fatalities  in side collisions, particularly in crashes where a single vehicle strikes a  tree or utility pole and in intersection crashes where smaller, lighter  vehicles are hit in the side by larger, heavier vehicles. NHTSA has estimated  that in serious side-impact crashes involving one or more fatalities in 2002,  nearly 60 percent of those killed suffered brain injuries.", "There are also possibilities for modifying the NCAP side test to help  address vehicle incompatibility. For example, NHTSA could examine the  barrier that is being used to ensure that it best represents today\u2019s vehicles.  NHTSA\u2019s current side-impact barrier is about the size and weight of a  compact car. As a result, when this barrier hits the test vehicle, it will  almost always hit the bottom sill of the door, which is designed to manage  much of the crash energy. To address the disparity in height between  passenger cars and SUVs, the Insurance Institute uses a side-impact test  barrier that is larger and higher than NCAP\u2019s barrier, as shown in figure 26.  According to Insurance Institute officials, they designed this barrier to  represent an SUV so their test could more accurately reflect the increased  risk for occupants in smaller vehicles. They said that it has encouraged  manufacturers to install side curtain air bags. Using this higher barrier has  resulted in different scores than NHTSA\u2019s NCAP. For example, the  Insurance Institute has given 27 vehicles its lowest rating (Poor) in side-  impact tests, while NHTSA, which uses a low barrier and does not include  head measures in its star calculations, gave 21 of these 27 vehicles (77  percent) four- or five-star safety ratings.", "Click the following link to watch a video of an interior view of the side  impact crash test with an SUV-like barrier conducted by the Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety at 31 mph:  http://www.gao.gov/media/video/d05370v9.mpg Officials from a number of automobile makers told us that vehicle  compatibility is an important safety issue, and they are working to enhance  occupant protection in front and side crashes, outside of NHTSA safety  standards or NCAP testing. Several automakers voluntarily entered into an  agreement with the Insurance Institute to work collaboratively to have all  of their vehicles meet new safety criteria that require large vehicles to  match the height of the fronts of small vehicles by September 2009, as  shown in figure 27. According to Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  members, better matching of structural components may enhance the  ability to absorb crash forces, thereby reducing occupant fatalities by an  estimated 16 to 28 percent. The agreement also specified that by September 1, 2007, at least 50 percent of these automakers\u2019 vehicles offered  in the United States will meet enhanced side-impact protection with  features such as side air bags, air curtain bags, and revised side-impact  structures. By September 2009 all vehicles of these manufacturers are to  meet the new side criteria.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, NHTSA officials noted that in order  for 50 percent of the vehicles to meet the voluntary side requirements by  September 1, 2007, manufacturers can certify by using either the existing  Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard pole test or the Insurance Institutes  side impact test. They noted that in September 2009, the pole test will no  longer be an option and that, therefore, it is very possible that large  vehicles, such as pickups, minivans, and SUVs, would be able to pass the  test without incorporation of enhanced side-impact features such as side  air bags or curtains for the following reasons:  Manufacturers may not need to subject large vehicles to the pole test by  September 1, 2007, if 50 percent of its fleet is comprised of smaller  passenger cars.", "Larger vehicles will sustain a lower velocity change than smaller  vehicles when struck by the Insurance Institute barrier.", "The higher ride height of large vehicles could keep the dummy\u2019s head  from striking the top of the Insurance Institute barrier.", "Given the changes in the vehicle fleet, fatalities due to rollover crashes  have continued to increase. Rollovers are dangerous incidents and have a  higher fatality rate than other kinds of crashes. Just over 2 percent of all  police-reported crashes that occurred in 2003 were rollovers, but they  accounted for over 10,000 highway fatalities, or more than 30 percent of all  passenger vehicle occupant deaths. All types of vehicles can roll over.  However, taller, narrower vehicles such as pickups, minivans, and SUVs  have higher centers of gravity and thus are more susceptible to roll over if  involved in a single-vehicle crash. NHTSA reported that 61 percent of  fatalities in SUVs and 45 percent of fatalities in pickups in 2002 were the  results of rollover crashes. NCAP\u2019s rollover testing does not rate the  chance of a potentially life-threatening injury should a rollover crash occur;  it only measures the risk of rollover.", "Although NHTSA has not incorporated occupant protection in rollovers  into NCAP, officials said they have been examining occupant protection in  rollover crashes, focusing on reducing occupant ejection and increasing  roof strength through regulation. According to NHTSA officials, the most  deadly rollovers occur when unbelted occupants are completely ejected  from the vehicle though doors, windows, and sun roofs and when the roof  crushes into the occupant compartment, causing serious, if not deadly,  head, neck, and spinal cord injuries. NHTSA has proposed changes to the  Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards that would upgrade the door lock  requirements to help prevent vehicle occupant ejection and increase roof  strength. They are also considering other ways to prevent ejection,  specifically looking at the potential of side curtain air bags to prevent  ejection through vehicle windows.", "NHTSA\u2019s NCAP rollover testing could be modified to better measure and  rate the risks of serious injury associated with a rollover crash. NHTSA  officials and others said that they have not been able to develop a  repeatable crash test in which the vehicle rolls over and dummies would be  used to measure injuries. However, in the absence of such a rollover crash  test, NCAP could examine various aspects of the vehicle which are known  to affect occupant safety in rollover, such as rating the roof strength of  vehicles. For example, officials from a consumer group told us that NHTSA  could conduct dynamic tests on roof strength and point to a 2002 Society of  Automotive Engineers paper that attests that such drop tests for roof  strength are repeatable. They also said that there has been other promising  research that would measure roof crush in dynamic tests. However,  including such tests in NCAP would require further development and  funding considerations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incorporating Active Safety Technologies into NCAP", "paragraphs": ["NCAP also has an opportunity to begin assessing new technology that  could help prevent crashes. Vehicle manufacturers and others have been  developing and testing new active safety systems that hold promise for  reducing traffic fatalities by helping drivers avoid crashes altogether. These  active safety systems include improving vehicle handling and braking in  emergency situations, providing warning alerts for potential collisions or  straying out of roadway lanes, and providing distance alerts when driving  too close to another vehicle. A 2004 NHTSA study estimated that the  incorporation of electronic stability control systems could reduce certain  crashes by about 67 percent. Similarly, the Insurance Institute reported  that electronic stability control can reduce the risk of involvement in single  vehicle crashes by more than 50 percent. Some experts suggested that  NCAP might be used to encourage and speed the adoption of active safety  systems into the vehicle fleet.", "Some elements of active safety systems are included in some current tests.  While the rollover test is not designed to measure the effectiveness of  electronic stability control systems, vehicles equipped with this technology  would be expected to perform better in the rollover test because the  vehicle would be less likely to tip up. In addition, brake tests are conducted  as part of Japan\u2019s NCAP, with the results provided as a separate safety  rating. The Euro NCAP has also established committees to identify  potential active safety systems to include in their program, as well as the  testing protocols that would be used.", "While using NCAP to further test and rate active safety systems could  encourage their adoption in the marketplace, there are challenges to  overcome. According to NHTSA officials, NHTSA would first need to  identify those active safety systems that could be effective in preventing  crashes. They said this would be difficult because they would have to  determine how well a system helps drivers avoid crashes. Also,  determining the testing methodology would be challenging because the  effectiveness of some active systems could be affected by factors such as  driver behavior and the physical characteristics of the road, such as the  dampness of the pavement.", "Officials from various automobile manufacturers told us that they are  developing many new active safety systems with the objective of helping  drivers avoid crashes. They pointed out that while NCAP could be used to  encourage them to market such systems, they would have concerns  regarding which systems to include in NHTSA\u2019s program and how the  system would be rated. In addition, they noted that because of competitive  forces, active safety advances could be available sooner than NHTSA is  capable of deciding to include them and developing an acceptable  approach for testing and rating them. Officials from automakers said they  are willing to share their research and work in cooperation with NHTSA to  develop tests or measurements that could help NCAP address these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Using Additional Test Measures and Different Size Dummies", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA could provide consumers with more safety information by using  additional test measures and different crash dummies. All of the other  organizations we contacted used more dummy measures to calculate  vehicles\u2019 safety ratings than U.S. NCAP used. To determine the star ratings,  NHTSA uses head and chest readings from the frontal NCAP test and chest  and lower spine readings for side-impact tests. Other organizations use  measurements that included such areas as the head, neck, chest, leg, and  foot for frontal test ratings and the head, neck, chest, pelvis, and leg for  side test ratings.", "The concern with using few dummy readings is that the safety rating might  not include important safety considerations. While NHTSA uses head and  chest readings for frontal ratings and chest and lower spine readings for the  side ratings, it measures other items during crash tests and may identify  them as  \u201cSafety Concerns\u201d on its Web site if they exceed certain values. We     identified over 140 Safety Concerns on NHTSA\u2019s Web site since vehicle  model year 1990\u201436 of these were for vehicles that received four- or  five-star ratings. The Safety Concerns included high femur readings in  frontal crashes, which could mean there was a high likelihood of thigh  injury; high head acceleration readings in side crashes, which could  indicate a high likelihood of serious head trauma; and doors opening during  side crash tests, which could increase the likelihood of occupant ejection.  Having a Safety Concern noted for vehicles with a four- or five-star rating  presents conflicting information that could be confusing to consumers.", "As NHTSA makes changes to its testing program, it has the opportunity to  reexamine the size and type of dummies it uses in crashes in addition to the  body areas of the dummies being measured. At present, NHTSA\u2019s dummies  equate to an average-size adult male who is about 5 feet 9 inches tall and  weighs about 170 pounds. Most of the other organizations use this size  dummy in their crash tests, and vehicle manufacturers work to maximize  the safety systems for an occupant with these characteristics. However, not  all vehicle occupants are the same size, and optimizing the restraint system  for the average male would not necessarily be optimum for others who may  be smaller, shorter, taller, or heavier. Also, children and the elderly may  react differently to crash forces than the average-size male.  Recognizing  this, the Insurance Institute uses a smaller female dummy (about 5 feet tall  and weighing about 110 pounds) in the driver and rear seat of the side-  impact test. Insurance Institute officials said they made this change to  encourage manufacturers to install side curtain air bags that would extend  low enough to protect the heads of smaller passengers. In addition, in its  proposed side-impact pole standards test, NHTSA specifies using a 50th  percentile male and a 5th percentile female to address the issue of different  size drivers and passengers.", "The U.S. NCAP officials said that at this time they are waiting on the  resolution to the proposed safety standard changes that would add a side  pole test before deciding on altering the size or type of crash dummies they  use. While generating additional information on which to base safety  ratings, altering the size of the dummy in the NCAP tests could provide  challenges for automobile manufacturers because they would have to  conduct more internal tests.

For  example, they said that it is important to develop a rating that considers  more than just the frontal and side-impact test results, such as the rollover  results and vehicle compatibility, which can have a large bearing on the  overall safety of vehicles. In their view, without the elements that address  rollover and compatibility, consumers might get the wrong impression of  the relative safety of vehicles.

For example, the Japan  Automobile Federation creates public awareness of the program with a  portable sled in which the general public can experience a simulated  collision at 5 kilometers per hour and have a protective air bag deploy.

NHTSA published its Buying a Safer Car  brochure for 2004 in February 2004, about 6 months after the vehicles were  available for sale and before all of the tests were completed for the 2004  models. To the extent that test results are available sooner, more car buyers  could have safety information to help make their purchase decisions.

The  growing number of large pickups, minivans, and SUVs in the nation\u2019s  vehicle fleet is creating different safety risks, particularly with regard to the  incompatibility of large and small vehicles and vehicle rollover, which  NCAP does not fully address. In addition, the very success of the program  has brought it to a point where it is not clear that the program\u2019s goals can  continue to be met. Because almost all vehicles today receive four- and  five-star frontal and side-impact safety ratings, NCAP provides little  incentive for manufacturers to further improve the safety of their vehicles  and does not provide consumers with information that differentiates the  safety of one vehicle compared to another. Further, the planned changes to  the safety standards for frontal and side crashworthiness may make  current NCAP tests less meaningful.", "While we believe there are opportunities to enhance NCAP by developing  approaches to better measure the interaction of large and small vehicles  and occupant protection in rollovers, rating technologies that help prevent  crashes from occurring, and using different injury measures to rate the  crash results, there are challenges that must be considered and addressed  before changes can be implemented.

The forces that would injure a  human during a crash are measured by anthropomorphic test devices,  commonly referred to as crash test dummies, which serve as proxies for  human vehicle occupants. These dummies are fitted with accelerometers  and load sensors that measure the forces of impact on particular areas of  the body, as shown in figure 32.", "Because the current dummy technology has yet to replicate a human with  the same biological matter or physiology, dummies cannot exhibit injuries  following a crash as a human would. Therefore, the effects of the forces on  particular areas of the human body, as measured by the dummies, have  been developed by researchers who have gathered information by applying  varying forces to biological specimens and by using a scale developed by  the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine (AAAM).", "This scale, the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), ranks injuries, from minor  through currently untreatable, for particular areas of the body and assigns  a number from 1 through 6 to each rank, as shown in table 2. The AIS is  used to provide a simple numerical method for ranking and comparing  injuries by severity.", "AIS values in NCAP are injury probability values derived from  measurements of dummy response taken from specific characteristics  (e.g., size, shape, mass, stiffness, or energy dissipation) that simulate  corresponding human responses (e.g., acceleration, velocity, or  articulation). These dummy responses are correlated with both  experimental biomechanical research as well as with real world crash  injury investigation. Researchers have used a statistical procedure to relate  the levels of injury to the forces that caused them. This procedure produces  theoretical injury curves, which NHTSA uses as the basis for safety ratings.", "NHTSA develops crashworthiness ratings, expressed in stars, for both  frontal and side crashes. To develop the NCAP ratings for frontal crashes,  NHTSA measures forces to the head and chest. Specifically, the injury  criteria for the frontal star rating are the head, as measured by a composite  of acceleration values known as the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), and the  chest, as measured by a chest deceleration value known as chest Gs. Each  of these two measures has its own injury risk curve that has been fixed at  AIS level 4 or greater\u2014that is, a severe, critical, or currently untreatable  injury, as shown in figures 33 and 34. Using the mathematical functions that  describe each of these injury risk curves, NHTSA transforms the HIC and  chest G measures from the frontal NCAP test into probabilities of head and  chest injuries of AIS level 4 or greater. The lower the HIC and chest G  measures, the less risk of receiving a severe, critical, or currently  untreatable injury to the head and chest in a full frontal crash.", "To convert the probability of severe injury for particular HIC and Chest G  scores into a star rating for the frontal NCAP test, NHTSA adds the  probability of severe injury to the head and chest and then subtracts the  product, shown below in figure 35. NHTSA concluded that a combined  effect of injury to the head and chest should be used since it is well  documented that an individual who suffers multiple injuries has a higher  risk of death. NHTSA calculates the probability of severe injury to the head  and chest for both the driver and the front passenger dummies in the  frontal NCAP test.", "Prob(Combined) = Prob(HIC) + Prob(Chest) - (Prob(HIC) * Prob(Chest))", "To develop the NCAP ratings for side crashes, NHTSA measures forces to  the ribs and lower spine. Specifically, the injury criteria for the side star  rating are the greater acceleration of the upper or lower ribs and the  acceleration of the lower spine. NHTSA averages these accelerations to  generate a measurement known as the Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI). The  TTI also has an injury curve that has been fixed at the AIS level of 4 or  greater, as shown in figure 36. The lower the TTI measure, the lower the  risk of receiving a severe, critical, or currently untreatable injury to the  thorax and upper abdomen in a side crash.", "The Thoracic Trauma Index score and its associated probability of  receiving an AIS level 4 or greater injury is the sole basis for the side NCAP  star rating. NHTSA calculates probability of severe injury to the thorax and  upper abdomen for both the front and rear dummies on the driver\u2019s side.", "Using the probability of injury calculated from the frontal and side NCAP  tests, NTHSA assigns a vehicle a rating of one (the worst) to five (the best)  stars for each of the dummy occupants in each of the crashworthiness  tests.

Together, the two tests assess both the  potential for injuries caused by intrusion and the effectiveness of the  vehicle\u2019s restraint system. The full frontal test is performed by towing a  vehicle to collide with a rigid barrier at 55 km/h (about 34 mph). This test  simulates a head-on collision between two vehicles of the same size  traveling at the same speed. The offset frontal test involves towing a  vehicle into a deformable barrier that represents the front end of another  vehicle and simulates a head-on collision of two vehicles traveling at 40  mph. In this test, only a portion of the front end (40 percent) engages the  barrier, and the impact on the vehicle body is greater than the full frontal  test because much of the crash energy is distributed to one side of the  vehicle. Thus, there is the possibility of substantial vehicle deformation,  which makes this test suitable for evaluating injuries caused to occupants  by intrusion into the occupant compartment. The program uses the Hybrid  III dummy that represents a man of about 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing  about 185 pounds.", "The side-impact test propels a moveable deformable barrier weighing  about 2,090 pounds into the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle,  simulating a perpendicular collision at 55 km/h (about 34 mph). The barrier  is shaped like the front end of a car, and because it is not rigid, its  performance is intended to simulate a vehicle\u2019s response in an actual  collision. A EuroSID-I dummy is placed in the driver\u2019s seat. This dummy is  the same height as the Hybrid III dummy but weighs about 20 pounds less.  The EuroSID-I dummy was designed to measure the risk of injury to the  head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.", "The Japan NCAP conducts a braking performance test that measures how  far a vehicle travels before it stops and how stable it is at the time of  braking when it is stopped abruptly while traveling at about 62 mph. The  braking test is a test of an active safety system because it enables the driver  to avoid a crash. The test is performed under wet and dry road conditions  for a vehicle with a driver and a weight on the front passenger seat. To  ensure consistent testing, Japan NCAP officials said, the dry road surface  temperature must be 95.0 degrees plus or minus 18.0 degrees Fahrenheit  and the wet road surface temperature must be 80.6 degrees plus or minus  9.0 degrees Fahrenheit because the temperature of the road surface affects  the distance it takes to stop the vehicle. Japan NCAP officials also said that  all braking tests must be performed at the same location because road  surfaces vary and surface differences could affect test results. Professional  drivers conduct the tests, and the speed of the vehicle and force with which  the drivers depress the brake pedal are monitored electronically to ensure  consistency. Three braking tests are conducted to be sure that the result is  not due to a flaw in the testing process. Figure 49 illustrates the braking  test.", "In addition, the Japan NCAP assesses and scores the ease with which doors  can be opened and the dummies removed after a crash test.
