Furthermore, EIA projects that imports will supply 60 percent of the total U.S. oil consumption in 2010, up from about 46 percent in 1996. In part, to help reduce the nation\u2019s oil dependence and oil imports, the Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT). Title V of EPACT requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to promote the development and use of domestically produced replacement fuels in light-duty vehicles. A major goal of EPACT is to replace a portion of the motor fuel (conventional fuel) used by light-duty vehicles in the United States with what are termed replacement fuels. The act also stipulates that at least half of the replacement fuels should be produced in the United States. Included among the fuels defined by EPACT as alternative or replacement fuels is liquified petroleum gas, or propane.", "Propane is widely used for other purposes. The petrochemical industry, for example, by far the largest propane consumer, uses propane in its manufacturing processes, and the residential sector uses propane for heating and other household purposes. Some of these traditional users of propane have expressed concern that the achievement of EPACT\u2019s fuel-replacement goal could lead to rapid future growth in the demand for propane, resulting in higher propane prices. This report responds to your request that we determine whether and how including propane as an alternative fuel under EPACT will affect existing propane consumers as well as the supply and price. Specifically, this report addresses the following questions: (1) How likely is it that EPACT\u2019s goal of replacing at least 10 percent of the conventional fuel used in light-duty vehicles by 2000 and at least 30 percent by 2010 with replacement fuels will be achieved? (2) To what extent will the use of propane as a motor fuel increase as a result of EPACT? (3) What impact will the use of propane as a motor fuel under EPACT have on the supply and price of propane?

Specifically, EPACT required that federal fleets acquire AFVs beginning in fiscal year 1993 and that state fleets and alternative fuel providers acquire AFVs beginning in model-year 1996. The federal AFV fleet program went into effect in 1993, but the mandates for state and alternative fuel provider fleets were delayed until 1997 because, according to a DOE official, the Department did not issue the rulemaking, as required by EPACT, early enough for the mandates to take effect in 1996. Also, under EPACT, the Secretary of Energy may require municipal and private (business) fleets to purchase an increasing percentage of AFVs to help meet the fuel-replacement goal. Under EPACT, DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in April 1998 and held public hearings in May and June 1998 to determine whether the establishment of the municipal and private fleet mandate is necessary and whether such a mandate will help attain EPACT\u2019s fuel-replacement goal. EPACT does not require that the goal be achieved and authorizes the Secretary of Energy to modify the goal or the target years if he or she determines that they are not achievable. Table 1 presents a summary of EPACT\u2019s AFV acquisition mandates for the fleets covered by the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPACT\u2019s Replacement Goal Is Not Likely to Be Achieved", "paragraphs": ["The goal of EPACT to replace 10 percent of the conventional fuel consumed by light-duty vehicles by 2000 and 30 percent by 2010 with replacement fuels is unlikely to be achieved. On the basis of EIA\u2019s modeling analysis, we estimate that alternative fuels will account for less than 1 percent of the total fuel to be consumed by light-duty vehicles in 2000 and about 3.4 percent in 2010, even after accounting for EPACT\u2019s provisions mandating that fleets acquire AFVs. Previous studies by DOE have also concluded that EPACT\u2019s goal is unlikely to be achieved after implementing the fleet acquisition mandates. Appendix I summarizes the results of several previous studies by DOE and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.", "Industry and DOE officials we talked with gave several reasons why the consumption of alternative fuels by light-duty vehicles will fall short of EPACT\u2019s replacement goal. First, EPACT mandates that fleets acquire AFVs but does not explicitly require that those vehicles use alternative fuels.Consequently, according to industry officials, some fleets meet their AFV requirements by purchasing vehicles capable of using both gasoline and an alternative fuel (called dual-fueled vehicles), but these vehicles are usually run on gasoline. Moreover, both DOE and industry officials believe that achieving EPACT\u2019s goal will require greater use of alternative fuels by vehicles beyond those in the fleets covered by the act, a development they believe is unlikely. For one thing, the high price of AFVs discourages their use. For example, according to one industry official, converting a conventional vehicle to run on propane can cost over $3,500, while a manufacturer\u2019s AFV that runs on propane can cost about $6,000 more than a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle. In addition, the lower price of gasoline discourages increased use of the higher priced alternative fuels. Both DOE and industry officials said that the price of gasoline is simply too low for the transportation sector to purchase significant quantities of alternative fuels. (See fig. 1 for a comparison of gasoline and propane prices, adjusted for inflation.) Finally, the infrastructure needed to keep AFVs refueled is currently inadequate to support the wide-scale use of AFVs that are not operated as centrally fueled fleet vehicles. Industry officials told us that the consumption of alternative fuels for transportation is too small to justify any large-scale investment in this infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPACT Will Lead to a Small Increase in the Use of Propane as a Transportation Fuel", "paragraphs": ["EPACT is expected to lead to a small increase in the use of propane as a transportation fuel. After EPACT\u2019s AFV acquisition requirements are accounted for, the resulting increase in transportation use will represent only 0.4 percent of the total consumption of propane in 2000 and 3.2 percent in 2010. As a result, consumption of propane as a transportation fuel will account for about 1.5 percent of the total propane used in the United States in 2000 and about 5.1 percent in 2010. The effects of EPACT specifically on the consumption of propane fuel by light-duty vehicles are summarized in table 2.", "Some industry and DOE officials told us that although propane has certain attributes that could make it the alternative fuel of choice, such as permitting a longer driving range than compressed natural gas, the barriers cited previously\u2014the high relative cost of AFVs, the low price of gasoline, and the inadequate infrastructure for refueling\u2014still inhibit its use. In addition, it does not appear that the propane industry will strongly promote the fuel as an alternative vehicle fuel. Propane industry officials and others told us that the industry lacks the internal cohesion necessary to promote the use of propane as a transportation fuel. Some officials pointed out that the history of the industry has been one of small-scale suppliers that primarily serve the heating and other household needs of residential customers. These suppliers do not necessarily want to see propane become a major transportation fuel for fear that that would erode their business. By comparison, DOE and industry officials and other experts told us that the natural gas industry is aggressively promoting compressed natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel. A manufacturer of AFVs also told us that the natural gas industry has been much more aggressive in pushing for the increased manufacture of vehicles that run on its fuel than the propane industry has."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPACT Will Have Very Little Impact on the Supply and Price of Propane", "paragraphs": ["Because EPACT is not expected to cause any significant increase in propane demand, it will have very little impact on the supply and price of propane. Any effects of EPACT on the supply and price of propane are indirect, that is, are in response to any higher demand its mandates might cause. Because EPACT will not cause much change in the demand for propane, little change in the supply and price of propane can be expected to result from EPACT\u2019s mandates. We estimate that the additional U.S. production of propane that will result from EPACT will be about 7,000 barrels per day in 2000 and 85,000 barrels per day in 2010. According to EIA\u2019s modeling results, these levels of domestic production will satisfy most of the additional propane demand or consumption caused by EPACT, while imports will satisfy the rest.", "Some propane users have expressed concern that EPACT could cause imports to become a greater proportion of the U.S. propane supply. We found evidence that U.S. propane imports will increase but not because of EPACT. For instance, Purvin and Gertz, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in analyses of the oil and gas industry, projects that U.S. imports of propane will rise from about 179,985 barrels per day in 1997 to about 264,400 barrels in 2000 and almost triple by 2010 to about 483,200 barrels (see fig. 2). As a percentage of the total U.S. propane supply, imports will rise from about 14.5 percent in 1997 to about 19 percent in 2000 and 28 percent in 2010, according to the firm\u2019s estimates. However, Purvin and Gertz officials told us that these increases in imports are unrelated to EPACT. The firm\u2019s projections of both supply and demand for propane do not account for EPACT because it believes its effects on the propane market will be inconsequential.", "We estimate, based on EIA\u2019s modeling, that the effect of EPACT on the overall price of propane will be negligible: an increase of 0.17 cent per gallon in 2000 and 3.28 cents per gallon in 2010 (fig. 3 shows the average price of propane, in 1996 dollars per million Btu, with and without EPACT\u2019s effects, from 1997 through 2010). Table 3 presents the estimated price impacts of EPACT on three categories of U.S. consumers. The estimated price increase effects for residential consumers will be only 0.10 cent per gallon in 2000 and 1.50 cents per gallon in 2010; the increase for industrial consumers is estimated to be 0.10 cent per gallon in 2000 and 1.70 cents per gallon in 2010; and the increase for transportation consumers is estimated at 0.43 cent per gallon in 2000 and 2.33 cents in 2010. In addition, Purvin and Gertz officials believe that the U.S. market will become the destination for a large share of the increased propane production from natural gas fields being discovered in many parts of the world, which could lead to lower prices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPACT Will Have No Discernible Adverse Effect on Existing Propane Consumers", "paragraphs": ["Existing consumers of propane, such as residential and petrochemical users, are not expected to be adversely affected by EPACT because the act is expected to have a negligible effect on propane prices. EPACT would cause a measurable adverse impact on existing propane consumers if it significantly increased the demand for propane as a transportation fuel and drove up its price. But, as previously discussed, demand and price are not likely to rise significantly given the limited effects of EPACT\u2019s mandates for fleets. DOE, EIA, and most of the industry officials and experts we talked with believe that the price effects of EPACT will be negligible and that propane consumption by nontransportation sectors will not be affected by EPACT.

Appendix I provides additional detail on that study, which indicated a significant impact on the petrochemical industry if EPACT\u2019s replacement goal was met in 2010. According to industry officials and experts, the petrochemical sector is likely to reduce its propane consumption if the price of propane rises because a significant portion of the propane that sector uses can be replaced with other feedstocks, such as naphtha and ethane. However, these officials also told us that switching feedstocks would also lead to increases in the prices of the substitutes, resulting in an increase in the industrial consumers\u2019 production costs.

To meet the 2000 goal, 35 to 40 percent of total 1999 sales of new light-duty vehicles would have to be alternative-fueled vehicles, according to that study. To meet the 2010 goal, sales of alternative-fueled vehicles would have to stay in the range of 30 to 38 percent of all new light-duty vehicles sold. A 1998 draft report by DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, however, found that with the implementation of EPACT\u2019s fleet requirements, including private fleet mandates, alternative-fueled vehicles would make up less than 1 percent of new vehicle sales in 2000 and only 4 percent by 2010. This study concluded it was unlikely that the 2000 goal will be met, or that the 2010 goal would be met without significant new policy initiatives. The study described the following transitional barriers to the greater use of alternative fuels: the lack of scale economies in the production of alternative fuels and alternative-fueled vehicles, the consumer costs of the low retail availability of alternative fuels and the limited model diversity of alternative-fueled vehicles, and the slow turnover of durable capital equipment and vehicles already on the road.", "Table I.1 summarizes the Oak Ridge study\u2019s estimates of what portion of petroleum consumption would be replaced by alternative fuels in 2010 under six different sets of assumptions. In the base case, DOE assumed existing fleet mandates, while in the late rule case DOE assumed a local government and private fleet mandate was added. In either of those cases, alternative fuels would constitute less than 1 percent of light-duty vehicle motor fuel sales in 2010. The assumptions made in the next three cases produced estimated replacement levels between 14 and 22 percent. In the no barriers case, DOE assumed that vehicles and fuels would be produced at large-scale costs and that all fuels would be widely available at retail locations. In the greenhouse gas case, DOE assumed fuel tax reductions in proportion to the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from a baseline level of emissions for gasoline. In the tax credit case, DOE assumed an ethanol tax credit would continue through 2010. The last of the six cases was the only one in which EPACT\u2019s goal of 30-percent replacement was achieved. In this case, called the fuel sales mandate case, DOE assumed that the Congress would require that retail sales of alternative fuel meet EPACT\u2019s goal but does not describe how such a result would be mandated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Relative Contribution of Propane in Meeting EPACT\u2019s Goal Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Although the Oak Ridge study suggests only a minimal role for propane in meeting EPACT\u2019s goal, in January 1996, DOE issued a report on the feasibility of producing sufficient replacement fuels to meet EPACT\u2019s 10- and 30-percent goal. This study indicated a potentially major role for propane. In it, DOE examined two scenarios: the low oil price scenario, which assumed that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was not able to exert monopoly control over crude-oil pricing in 2010 and the reference oil price scenario, which assumed that OPEC exerted partial monopoly power over the pricing of crude oil.", "Under the low oil price scenario, the world oil price would be $20.60 per barrel; the U.S. price, $21.60. Under the reference oil price scenario, the world oil price would be $25.82 per barrel; the U.S. price, $26.74 per barrel.", "For each scenario, DOE examined various possible cases, including the following four. In the benchmark case, DOE assumed that all fuels would be taxed at the same dollar-per-Btu rate, specifically the gasoline tax rate in 1994. It assumed that no well-developed infrastructure for alternative transportation fuels would exist and that alternative-fueled vehicles would be in use by organizations covered by EPACT\u2019s fleet requirements and state mandates, while households would continue to rely on gasoline-fueled vehicles. In the unconstrained case, DOE assumed that a well-developed infrastructure for alternative transportation fuels and vehicles would exist in a long-run situation. In the limited imports case, DOE assumed that at least one-half of alternative fuels used would be produced from within the North American Free Trade Agreement countries. In the letter-of-the-law case, DOE not only assumed limited imports but also assumed that overall petroleum replacement would equal 30 percent. Table I.2 summarizes the results from this study for light-duty vehicle fuel use under the low oil price scenario. Somewhat higher replacement percentages occurred under the unconstrained and limited imports cases in the reference oil price scenario. Propane consumption was higher for the unconstrained and limited imports cases but slightly lower for the letter-of-the-law case under the reference oil price scenario.", "The importance of propane as an alternative fuel differed in the 1996 study and the Oak Ridge study because of the 1996 study\u2019s use of lower cost figures for liquified petroleum gas. According to the authors of the Oak Ridge study, had they also used these lower costs, they would have reported a 28-percent displacement of gasoline by alternative fuels in 2010 versus the 14-percent figure they reported in the no barriers case. Of this 28-percent displacement, propane would have constituted about half. The 1996 study estimated that propane would account for 47 percent of the fuel displaced by alternative fuels.", "In its 1996 study, DOE found, under its low oil price scenario, potentially significant impacts on the propane market once all transitional barriers to alternative fuels were overcome. As seen in table I.3, when comparing the benchmark and unconstrained cases, liquified petroleum gas consumption by motor vehicles rises from 0.042 million to 1.450 million barrels per day in 2010. At the same time, consumption by the petrochemical industry falls from 0.333 million barrels per day to 0. The remaining liquified petroleum gas consumption, categorized as \u201cnonvehicle end use\u201d (such as residential heating and cooking), decreases from 1.742 million to 1.710 million barrels per day. Under the benchmark case, propane supplied by refineries and gas processing plants were somewhat lower in the reference oil price scenario than the low oil price scenario, whereas non-Canadian imports were higher under the reference oil price scenario. In both the reference and low oil price scenarios, the direction of change in values between the benchmark and the other cases were similar.", "Table I.4 summarizes the effect of these changes in consumption and supply on propane prices as estimated in the 1996 report.
