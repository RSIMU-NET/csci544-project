This report describes: (1) how the financial performance and structure of the industry have changed over time, (2) how reported R&D spending and new drug approvals have changed, and (3) what is known about the potential effects of consolidation on drug prices and new drug development. GAO analyzed Bloomberg drug industry financial data for 2006 through 2015, and examined select publicly available estimates of company market shares for 2014 and market shares for certain therapeutic classes for 2016. GAO also analyzed estimates of company self-reported R&D spending and federal funding for biomedical R&D data, aggregate tax credit claims data, and drug approval data for the same approximate time period.

Among the largest 25 companies, annual average profit margin fluctuated between 15 and 20 percent. For comparison, the annual average profit margin across non-drug companies among the largest 500 globally fluctuated between 4 and 9 percent.", "The number of reported mergers and acquisitions generally held steady during this period, but the median disclosed deal value increased.", "The largest 10 companies had about 38 percent of the drug industry's sales revenue in 2014. However, concentration was higher for narrower markets, such as for certain drugs in the same therapeutic class. In addition, experts noted that market pressures such as rising research and development (R&D) costs, fewer drugs in development, and competition from generic drugs, have driven structural changes in the industry such as increased use of acquisition by large drug companies to obtain access to new research.", "From 2008 through 2014, worldwide company-reported R&D spending, most of which went to drug development (rather than research), increased slightly from $82 billion to $89 billion in 2015 dollars. During the same period, federal spending, which funded a greater amount of basic research relative to industry, remained stable at around $28 billion. In addition to grants, several federal tax provisions provided incentives for industry R&D spending, including the orphan drug credit, available for companies developing drugs intended to treat rare diseases, which increased more than five-fold from 2005 through 2014. Pertaining to drug approvals, the total number of new drugs approved for marketing in the United States fluctuated between 2005 and 2016, ranging from 179 to 263 drug approvals annually. Novel drugs\u2014innovative products that serve previously unmet medical need or help advance patient care\u2014accounted for about 13 percent of all approvals each year. Biologics\u2014drugs derived from living rather than chemical sources\u2014and orphan drugs accounted for growing shares of drug approvals, reflecting market and policy incentives to invest in these areas, according to experts GAO interviewed.", "Research GAO reviewed indicates that fewer competitors in the drug industry are associated with higher prices, particularly for generic drugs. Research also suggests that drug company mergers can have varied impacts on innovation as measured by R&D spending, patent approvals, and drug approvals.

Use of  expensive brand-name drugs accounted for much of the growth in recent  years, but price increases have been reported for some generic drugs as  well. Recent concerns about drug prices have sparked interest in drug  company profitability and competition in the industry. Limited competition  for particular drugs due to market exclusivity\u2014granted by law after the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves certain drugs\u2014is one  factor that often has been noted as influencing drug prices. Prior GAO  reports have identified multiple reasons for drug price increases, including  limited competition. Further, some drug companies have undergone  mergers and acquisitions, leading to concerns about reduced competition  and higher drug prices. Economists have expressed apprehension that  reduced competition may also decrease the amount of industry research  and development (R&D) invested into new drugs, which could result in  fewer drug choices for consumers and fewer treatment options for  providers.", "Amid these questions, you asked us to provide an overview of the drug  industry and the potential effects of consolidation on drug prices and new  drug development.

Basic research is often federally funded and conducted to better  understand the workings of disease, which increases the potential of  discovering and developing innovative drugs.", "Drug discovery: This is undertaken by numerous researchers from  drug companies, academia, and government searching for and  identifying promising chemical entities, or chemical and biological  compounds, capable of curing or treating diseases.", "Preclinical testing: During preclinical testing, compounds are tested  in laboratories and in animals to predict whether a drug is likely to be  safe and effective in humans. If the compound is found to be  promising, a drug company may decide to test it as a new drug on  humans and it proceeds to the clinical trials stage. Before doing so,  the company must submit to FDA and have in effect an investigational  new drug application that summarizes the data that have been  collected on the compound and outlines plans for the clinical trials.", "Clinical trials: Clinical trials test potential drugs in human volunteers  to determine if they should be approved for wider use in the general  population. An investigational new drug typically goes through three  phases of clinical trials before it is submitted to FDA for marketing  approval. Clinical trials proceed through Phases I, II, and III, beginning  with testing in a small group of healthy volunteers and then moving on  to testing in larger groups of patients whom the drug is intended to  treat to assess the compound\u2019s effectiveness, rate of adverse events,  and uses in combination with other drugs.", "FDA Review and Approval: To market a drug in the United States,  drug companies submit their research in a new drug application  (NDA) or biologic license application (BLA) to FDA, which then  reviews and approves the drug for marketing if it is shown to be safe  and effective for its intended use. An NDA is an application to market  a new chemically synthesized drug\u2014either an innovative drug or a  variation of a previously marketed drug. A BLA is an application for a  license to market a new biological product (complex drugs derived  from living organisms). Companies may also submit a supplement to  an already approved NDA or BLA\u2014known as an efficacy  supplement\u2014to propose changes to the way an approved drug is  marketed or used, such as adding or modifying an indication or claim,  revising the dose or dose regimen, providing a new route of  administration, or changing the marketing status from prescription to  over-the-counter use.", "For the purposes of its review, FDA classifies certain NDAs as new  molecular entities\u2014products that contain active chemical substances  that have not been approved by FDA previously\u2014and certain BLAs as  new therapeutic biologics. FDA generally considers drugs approved  either as new molecular entities or new therapeutic biologics to be  \u201cnovel\u201d drugs\u2014products that are often innovative and serve previously  unmet medical needs or otherwise significantly help to advance  patient care and public health.", "Post-approval: After FDA has approved a drug for marketing, the  drug company may begin marketing and large-scale manufacturing of  the drug. FDA also continuously monitors the safety of the drug which  includes, amongst other activities, oversight of postmarket clinical  studies that it can require or request companies to complete (known  as phase IV clinical trials). Drug companies may also undertake these  studies independently to identify modifications to the drug such as  new delivery mechanisms or additional indications for use. The  company may then submit a new application or supplement  application with new clinical data to FDA to market the modification as  a new drug, or market it for the new use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Patent and Market Exclusivity and Other Incentives for Drug Development", "paragraphs": ["Patents and market exclusivity periods are two ways brand-name drug  companies may recoup their R&D investments by limiting competition for  specified periods of time. Typically, early in the R&D process, companies  developing a new brand-name drug apply for a patent on the active  ingredient and may additionally apply for patents on other aspects of the  drug, such as the method of use, from the U.S. Patent and Trademark  Office. Once a patent is granted, other drug companies are excluded  from making, using, or selling the patented aspect of the drug during the  term of the patent, which generally expires after 20 years from filing. In  addition, federal law authorizes certain periods of exclusive marketing rights, or market exclusivity, for new FDA-approved drugs, during which  time FDA generally cannot approve a similar competing version of the  drug for marketing. These exclusivities are independent of the rights  granted under patent and can relate to chemical entities never approved  before by FDA (5 years of exclusivity); new biologics (12 years); approval  of a supplement for a new condition or use or other change to a  previously approved chemically synthesized drug based on new clinical  studies (3 years); and orphan drugs\u2014drugs designated to treat rare  diseases or conditions (7 years); among others. Patent protection and  market exclusivity are independent of one another and can run  concurrently or not.", "When brand-name drug products\u2019 patents expire and exclusivity periods  end, similar versions of the drug product that have been approved by  FDA may enter the market. These are referred to as generics for  chemically synthesized drugs and biosimilars for biologics. The Drug  Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984\u2014commonly  known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\u2014facilitated earlier, and less  costly, market entry of generic drugs. A generic drug must generally be  demonstrated to be equivalent to the brand-name drug product in active  ingredient, dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality,  performance characteristics, and intended use. For biologics, the  Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 provided an  abbreviated pathway for companies to obtain approval of \u201cbiosimilar\u201d and  \u201cinterchangeable\u201d biological products. A biosimilar must be demonstrated  to be highly similar to an already approved biological product and to have  no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness  from the reference product. See table 1 for a description of drug  application types.", "In addition to incentivizing drug development through patent and market  exclusivity, the federal government supports new drug research both  directly, through grants from\u2014and intramural research by\u2014agencies  such as NIH and indirectly through tax incentives for companies that  develop new drugs. Specifically, the Internal Revenue Code includes  incentives for research-related spending in three ways: through two  income tax credits\u2014the credit for clinical testing expenses for certain  drugs for rare diseases (known as the orphan drug credit) and the credit  for increasing research activities (known as the research credit)\u2014and  through special methods for treatment and reporting of research and  experimental expenditures, including current-year deduction to arrive at  net income. In general, the credit incentives are available to companies  with qualified research spending in the United States. Companies include  businesses organized as corporations or non-corporate businesses such  as partnerships. These provisions are described below:", "Orphan drug credit: Companies may claim the orphan drug credit for  half the \u201cqualified clinical testing expenses\u201d for drugs intended to treat  rare diseases. Expenditures that give rise to the orphan drug credit  may include expenses related to testing outside the United States. A  company may claim foreign clinical testing expenses if there is an  insufficient testing population in the United States to test the safety  and efficacy of the drug. The orphan drug credit is nonrefundable;  that is, while the credit can be used to reduce a company\u2019s income tax  liability generally, the credit cannot be used to generate a refund if the  business has no tax liability or fully used if the credit would reduce tax  liability below zero. The credit is also a component of and subject to  the limitations of the general business credit.", "Research credit: Companies may claim a research credit for  qualified research expenditures they undertake in a given year that  exceed a threshold or base amount. This incremental design of the  credit is intended to create an incentive for companies to do more  research than they otherwise would. Qualified research expenses are  certain expenses for qualified research incurred by the taxpayer  during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business. Qualified  research is research that is undertaken for the purpose of discovering  information that is technological in nature and the application of which  is intended to be useful in the development of a new or improved  business component of the taxpayer. In general, substantially all the  activities that constitute a process of experimentation relating to new  or improved functions, performance, or reliability or quality are  qualified research. The rate of credit can be 14 or 20 percent. Like the  orphan drug credit, the research credit is nonrefundable and is a  component of, and subject to, the limitations of the general business  credit.", "Deductions of qualified research expenses: If elected, the tax code  allows businesses to currently deduct \u201cresearch or experimental  expenditures\u201d from gross income in the tax year they are incurred  rather than depreciate (or amortize) the assets the R&D created over  time. Research and experimental expenditures include all costs  incident to research, including research conducted outside the United  States. Since \u201cqualified research expenses\u201d and \u201cqualified clinical  testing expenses\u201d are a particular subset of research and  experimental expenditures, expenditures that can give rise to either  the research or orphan drug tax credits can be deducted in the year  that they occur. However, these deductions must be reduced by the  amount of tax credits claimed in order to prevent expenses from both  generating a tax credit and being deducted from income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Distribution, Payment, and Pricing", "paragraphs": ["The distribution of, and payment for, prescription drugs involve  interactions and negotiated transactions among multiple commercial  entities along the supply chain from the drug manufacturer to the  consumer (see fig. 2). Brand-name and generic drug manufacturers  typically sell their drugs to drug wholesalers, who in turn sell the drugs to  retail pharmacies or to health care providers (such as hospitals, clinics,  and physicians). Pharmacies or providers dispense or administer  prescription drugs to consumers. Most consumers purchasing drugs pay  a portion of the drug\u2019s price in the form of a copayment or coinsurance,  with the specifics of this cost sharing dictated by the consumers\u2019  insurance plan. Insurance plans often use pharmacy benefit managers  (PBMs) to help them manage their prescription drug benefits, including  negotiating prices with manufacturers, processing claims, and negotiating  with retail pharmacies to assemble networks where the beneficiaries can  fill prescriptions. PBMs negotiate with manufacturers for rebates on behalf  of the insurance plan based on market share, volume, and formulary  placement. PBMs also contract with pharmacies; contract terms and  conditions may include specifics about negotiated reimbursement rates  (how much the pharmacy will be paid for dispensed drugs) and payment  terms. Health care providers may also negotiate with insurers for the  drugs they administer. The price that payers, PBMs, and ultimately  consumers pay for prescription drugs depends in part on the amount of  competition and the purchasers\u2019 negotiating power. The negotiating  power is influenced by the ability to choose from competing drugs and the  volume of drug purchased.", "According to economic experts, the usual mechanisms that enforce  market discipline may not work in the same way in the health care market  as they do in other markets. In most markets\u2014automobiles, for  example\u2014consumers are expected to be conscious of the price of goods.  If a company raises the price of its goods, consumers would likely  purchase fewer goods, causing the company\u2019s revenues to decline.  However, in the health care market, the purchase of goods and services  is largely influenced by health care providers, who may not be well- informed about, or incentivized to consider, the prices involved. In the  case of drugs, some experts argue that marketing and advertising may  further distort provider decision making. In addition, if the patients\u2019  medical bills are largely paid by insurance plans (other than copayment or  coinsurance costs), then patients\u2019 demand may not be significantly  influenced by changes in price to the extent that it might be in other  markets where the consumers see and pay the bill themselves.", "Certain payment policies may also limit the negotiating power of insurers.  For example, Medicare Part D is required to cover all drugs in six  protected classes, which some experts argue reduces the negotiating  power of its contractors (known as plan sponsors). In addition, some  brand-name drug companies are providing coupons to consumers to  mitigate patient drug costs when a company\u2019s drugs are not covered by  payer formularies or require higher patient costs than preferred drugs.  Some research and experts we interviewed have noted that this practice  erodes the negotiating power of insurers and the cost management utility  of formularies, which may result in lower prices for the patient using the  coupon but higher prices overall. In addition, patients and providers in  many cases may not have clear information about the benefit relative to  cost of one drug over another drug or treatment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidation and the Antitrust Review Process", "paragraphs": ["Experts have said that consolidation as a result of mergers and  acquisitions is one of multiple factors that could influence competition.  Fewer companies producing and marketing drugs can lead to greater  market dominance by certain companies and less competition.", "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of  Justice (DOJ) enforce federal antitrust laws that prohibit activities, such  as price fixing and mergers and acquisitions where the effect may be  substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. Drug  companies are subject to these antitrust laws. Companies are required to  notify FTC and DOJ of certain pending mergers, also known as the  premerger notification program. As part of its premerger review process,  these agencies can approve mergers contingent on company divestiture  of assets, including those related to products in development\u2014a process  known as a negotiated merger remedy. These agreements are subject to  public notice and comment and result in an enforceable order. The goal of  a merger remedy is to preserve or restore competition in the relevant  markets. Although FTC and DOJ each have authority and  responsibilities under the antitrust laws, FTC typically examines proposed  drug industry mergers.

Similarly,  some traditionally generic manufacturers are expanding into brand-name  manufacturing to acquire product lines with more generous profit margins.  For both brand-name and generic manufacturers, expanding the size of  their drug portfolio may improve their bargaining position with PBMs,  according to two economists we interviewed. Experts also said that  traditionally large companies are increasingly relying on mergers and  acquisitions to obtain access to new research and are conducting less of  their own research in-house. In addition, experts told us that investment in  the development of traditional chemically synthesized drugs has  produced increasingly lower financial returns, resulting in some traditional  pharmaceutical companies turning to invest more in the development of  more complicated and costly biologics. Many experts highlighted the  proliferation of biotechnology companies as large pharmaceutical  companies seek to acquire promising new research developments.", "Many experts told us that market pressures have also driven some drug  companies to move towards specialization in certain therapeutic areas,  including through mergers and acquisitions. As one example,  GlaxoSmithKline acquired most of Novartis\u2019s vaccine business in 2015,  bolstering its own line of vaccines and helping to raise its share of sales  of the worldwide vaccine market. Simultaneously, Novartis acquired  GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s oncology business, enabling both companies to shed  one line of business and focus on the newly acquired therapeutic areas.", "Experts again noted that one reason companies may be specializing  through mergers and acquisitions is because of the increasing cost of  R&D\u2014acquiring promising new or developed research or product lines  helps companies mitigate R&D investment risk. Acquiring existing lines of  business from competitors within a therapeutic area may also help a  company increase its presence in a particular therapeutic area.", "Another widely cited factor influencing structural changes in U.S.  industries\u2014including the drug industry\u2014involves tax-influenced mergers,  called corporate inversions. An inversion is a type of merger where a U.S.  corporation merges with or acquires a company located in a foreign  jurisdiction\u2014often a lower-tax country\u2014and reorganizes so the resulting  parent corporation is located in the foreign country. This can reduce a  corporation\u2019s overall tax liability\u2014often by reducing its U.S. tax liability.  While taxes are one of many factors that may influence trends in mergers  and acquisitions as discussed above, the incentive for drug companies to  reduce tax burdens through inversions can be significant.

Studies show that potential market size,  measured by revenue, is a determinant of R&D investment and  market entry for both brand-name and generic drug companies.  Companies also seek to maximize potential revenues by investing in  the development of drugs that can command high prices, and drugs  that address unmet medical needs or differentiate them from  competitors. This includes investment in drugs for niche markets that  may have limited competition, such as orphan drugs. Experts also  noted that some companies invest to extend patent protection or  exclusivity periods for existing drugs as a means to extend revenue  generation by delaying or limiting the effect of generic competition\u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cevergreening\u201d or \u201cpatent hopping.\u201d", "Cost reduction: Drug development costs, particularly for novel drugs,  are increasing and companies have sought various ways to reduce  their costs or limit risk. Experts we interviewed suggested that drug  companies have attempted to reduce costs by focusing on drugs for  which clinical trials are perceived to be less costly, drugs perceived as  more likely to receive FDA approval, modifications to existing drugs  rather than the development of novel drugs, outsourcing of clinical  trials, and acquisition of R&D projects already underway.", "Policy incentives: Often regulatory and other policy incentives  influence potential revenues and risks and, in turn, R&D investment,  according to experts. For example, exclusivity periods and patent  protection, expedited review programs, and tax incentives were cited  as influencing R&D investment. The supply of new science from  federally funded research may also influence company investment  decisions. Expectations about payer reimbursement could also  influence potential pricing and investment decisions, according to  some experts. For example, one expert noted that payers typically do  not resist high prices for oncology drugs.", "These drivers may also explain the observed brand-name drug approval  trends for biologics, orphan drugs, and drugs for certain disease areas.  For example:", "Biologics: Some experts noted that recent technological advances  have spurred opportunity and investment in new biologics. The longer  period of FDA market exclusivity for biologics relative to traditional  chemically synthesized drugs may also be attractive to drug  developers. In addition, there are currently few biosimilar drugs  available to compete for market share once BLA exclusivity expires.  Though FDA had approved seven biosimilars for marketing between  2010\u2014the year the approval pathway for biosimilar biological  products was established\u2014and September 2017, and was reviewing  additional applications, some experts suggest that the added cost and  difficulty in developing biosimilars may hinder entry of biologics\u2019  competitors relative to the entry seen for traditional generics.", "Orphan drugs: In addition to the exclusivity and orphan drug credit  incentives to develop orphan drugs, an industry expert we interviewed  also suggested that it is easier to get FDA approval for orphan drugs,  and another suggested that it is less costly to develop them. In  addition, orphan drugs can often garner high prices compared to non- orphan drugs, according to an industry report.", "Disease areas: Certain drug classes or disease areas, such as drugs  for oncology or multiple sclerosis drugs, can garner higher prices and,  in turn, more R&D investment because they often have fewer  competitors, are often administered by providers who are insensitive  to price, or are perceived as particularly life-saving, according to some  experts we interviewed. In addition, some experts suggested that NIH  investment in oncology research and gains in personalized medicine  have resulted in many more research opportunities in which  companies can invest.

The following summarizes studies we reviewed on the  effect of generic and brand-name competition:", "Generic competition: Most notably, once brand-name drugs lose  patent and marketing exclusivity and generic versions of drugs enter  the market, drug prices fall and continue to decline as additional  generic manufacturers enter. The price moderating effect of generic  competition is well documented by FDA, FTC, the IMS Institute for  Healthcare Information, and other research. FDA found that for drugs  sold from 1999 through 2004, the first generic competitor reduced the  drug price only slightly lower than the brand-name on average, but the  second generic competitor reduced the drug price by nearly half. For  drugs that attracted nine or more generic manufacturers, the average  generic price fell 80 percent or more. The IMS Institute for Healthcare  Information reported similar findings in 2016 based on its review of  generics that entered the market between 2002 and 2014. The  introduction of generics reduced the price of those drugs by 51  percent in the first year and 57 percent in the second year with price  reductions driven, in part, by the increasing number of competitors. In  addition, a 2017 study of 1,120 drugs available as generics between  2008 and 2013 determined that drugs with less market competition,  measured by higher concentration, had higher price increases over  the period compared to drugs in the cohort with the lowest  concentration.", "Brand-name competition: For brand-name drugs, studies show that  the presence of therapeutic alternatives in the market reduces the  launch price\u2014the price the company sets for a new drug. For  example, an often-cited 1998 study of launch prices for 130 new  molecular entities showed that a greater number of brand-name  therapeutic alternatives was associated with substantially lower  launch prices for new brand-name drugs compared to their  predecessors. More recently, there are examples of therapeutic  alternatives creating market pressure on, and thus reducing prices of,  brand-name drugs, such as multiple brand-name hepatitis C therapies  that became available between 2013 and 2014.", "Research has also found that some brand-name drug companies are able  to maintain or even raise prices for their drugs\u2014despite competition from  therapeutic or generic alternatives\u2014for various reasons, such as product  differentiation or brand loyalty stemming from marketing or prescribing  patterns. For example, brand-name companies may actually increase  prices for some of their drugs to capture the price-insensitive segment of  the market. Research also suggests that the extent of price reductions  resulting from the entry of generic drugs into a market can differ by the  characteristics of the drug and may be less dramatic for biosimilar drugs  than traditional generic drugs. For example, the 2016 IMS report noted  that price reductions under these circumstances occurred faster for oral  drugs than for injectable drugs, which often attract fewer generic  competitors. Another 2017 study examining the state of generic  competition found that injectables and drugs with other formulations, such  as topical or inhaled drugs, were more likely than oral drugs to have only  one or two manufacturers. Certain literature we reviewed and experts we interviewed suggested that biosimilars will moderate prices for biologic  drugs, but not to the same extent as traditional generics do because they  are more costly to manufacture and may be less consistently substituted  for the brand-name drug; however, more time and research will be  needed to understand the effects given the small number of biosimilars  on the market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies Find Competition Matters for Innovation, and Some Suggest a Negative Impact of Mergers on Drug Company Innovation", "paragraphs": ["Competition is also relevant to innovation, according to economic studies  we examined.

For example, a 2014 study examining multiple  manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries demonstrated a positive  relationship between competition and innovation (measured by patents),  productivity, and R&D expenditures.

For the software industry, the Congressional  Budget Office only indicated that it had high R&D and low manufacturing  costs similar to drug industry; it did not suggest the same for other lines of  business that software companies might additionally be involved in.  Because we had no reason to isolate industry-specific revenues for our  remaining largest 500 companies, we weighted their profit margins by  their total sales revenues.

The  Business Research, Development and Innovation Survey data are  collected annually from a probability sample of for-profit companies with a  U.S. presence, which are classified in select manufacturing and  nonmanufacturing industries based on their North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) code. We analyzed aggregate company- reported worldwide R&D expenditures and worldwide sales for  respondent companies designated with NAICS code 3254 for  pharmaceuticals and medicines. We also examined pharmaceutical company-reported domestic R&D expenditures by character of work\u2014 basic research, applied research, or development\u2014as defined by NSF as  well worldwide and domestic R&D expenditure by performer (whether  R&D was paid for and performed by the company, or paid for by the  company to be performed by others). We also examined worldwide  expenditures and sales for companies designated as biotechnology  research and development companies (NAICS 541711); however  estimates were not available for 2008 or 2014 and were less reliable in  the years between. We therefore reported biotechnology expenditures  and sales separately from pharmaceutical companies and limited the  majority of our analysis to pharmaceutical companies. For comparison,  we also examined worldwide R&D expenditure and sales for comparably  large industries with high R&D intensity as well as all manufacturing and  all non-manufacturing industries. All spending and sales data were  adjusted to real 2015 U.S. dollars using the gross domestic product price  index. We also examined the Business Research, Development and  Innovation Survey sample selection and sampling error information for  each year of the survey. Finally, we compared worldwide and domestic  R&D expenditure and sales trends to spending and sales reported by  Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)\u2014a  national trade association.", "To examine federal spending trends, we analyzed publicly available data  from NSF\u2019s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics\u2019  Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development on obligations  for research in biomedical related fields made by federal agencies  identified as funding drug-related research between fiscal years 2008 and  2014, years consistent with available industry data from NSF\u2019s Business  Research, Development, and Innovation Survey. Data represent federal  agency obligations for basic and applied research in the fields of  biological sciences, medical sciences, and other life sciences as reported  by federal agencies. Obligations were adjusted to real fiscal year 2015 U.S. dollars using the gross domestic product price index. We identified  agencies that fund drug-related research based on interviews with  officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), NSF, and other  industry experts. The Survey of Federal Funds for Research and  Development is a census of federal agencies that conduct R&D, and  provides data on obligations by agency and field of science rather than by  specific industry or use. Our estimates of federal spending may be  imprecise because the data preclude us from pinpointing spending  specific to drug R&D projects, and because the type of research that  federal agencies typically fund often has an impact on many different  research areas that may not be specific to drugs. We also reviewed  budget documents from NIH and reviewed select studies for spending  estimates by non-federal or industry sources.", "In addition, we obtained estimates of R&D spending by state and local  governments and non-industry private funders for 2015 from National  Health Expenditure account estimates.

Specifically, we analyzed claims from companies with IRS Principle  Business Activity codes for pharmaceutical manufacturing, drug  wholesalers, and scientific research. IRS\u2019s industry codes are based on  NAICS definitions, and corporations are instructed to report the industry  code for which it derives the highest percentage of its total receipts.  These data are reviewed by Statistics of Income division staff for  accuracy. The scientific research industry category includes corporations  conducting biotechnology research and development, but also includes  firms conducting research in nanotechnology and physical, engineering,  and life sciences. As a result, we chose not to report research credits  claimed by corporations in the broader scientific research industry  category as being related to drug development, but we do report orphan  drug credits claimed by corporations in this industry category. We also  obtained and examined reported qualified research expenses for  pharmaceutical manufacturing companies for years 2005 to 2014. IRS\u2019  Statistics of Income division produces estimates based on a  representative stratified sample of corporate returns. IRS provided  additional information on the corporations that reported claiming the  orphan drug and research credits; in both cases a high percentage of the  claims came from large corporations that are included in the stratified  sample with certainty. As a result, we concluded that the estimated credit  totals are reliable given that the estimates are largely based on returns  that were certain to be included in the sample. The amount of research  and orphan drug credits claimed represents claims rather than amounts  utilized due to limitations of the general business credit. Reported  estimates therefore may reflect the upper bounds of what was utilized  from claimed amounts. IRS also provided additional data on total  deductions claimed for qualified research expenditures and amounts  reported on financial statements from Form M-3, for 2010 to 2013.
