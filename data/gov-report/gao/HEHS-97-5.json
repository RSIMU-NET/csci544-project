The six impairments selected were the loss or loss of use of (1) a foot, (2) both ears, (3) a hand, (4) an arm, (5) a leg, and (6) an eye. We selected these impairments because the criteria for each were clear and similar on both schedules.", "Within the federal government, when comparisons are drawn between military and civilian salaries, the salary for a military rank of O-4, a Major or Lieutenant Commander, has been traditionally considered comparable to the salary of a federal employee at grade 12, step 1, on the general schedule (GS) pay scale. Therefore, as agreed with the Subcommittee staff, we based our estimates of the benefits a Major or Lieutenant Commander would receive under FECA at a GS-12, step 1, salary level. To provide a broader perspective of compensation amounts, we used the GS-7, step 1, salary level to estimate the compensation someone with a military rank of O-1, Second Lieutenant, would receive under FECA.

FECA and other workers\u2019 compensation programs primarily focus on compensating workers for their actual lost wages and permanent impairments resulting from occupational diseases or injuries. In contrast, VA\u2019s disability program focuses on compensating veterans for the average reduction in earning capacity they are expected to experience as a result of service-connected conditions. An overall goal of workers\u2019 compensation programs is to return injured employees to work, and in some workers\u2019 compensation programs, benefits are terminated if the worker does not participate in vocational rehabilitation.

In some programs, workers who refuse vocational rehabilitation services when these services are necessary for the person to be employed again may forfeit their right to receive wage-loss benefits. In addition, if an employee dies from a job-related injury or illness, the employee\u2019s dependents can receive survivors\u2019 benefits.", "The compensation benefits that are paid to workers depend on the nature and extent of their injuries and the ability of injured employees to earn their usual wages. Employees whose injuries are not serious may only receive reimbursement for medical care for work-related injuries or illnesses. Many workers\u2019 compensation claims result only in payment for medical care rather than in monetary awards for lost wages or permanent impairments.", "Employees whose injuries or illnesses result in lost wages may be entitled to receive wage-loss benefits. Employees whose injuries or illnesses result in the permanent loss or loss of use of certain body parts or functions are entitled to compensation for permanent impairments. The majority of the monetary benefits that are paid to workers are for wages lost as opposed to permanent impairment. Often wage-loss benefits are paid for temporary disabilities, which may last a relatively short period of time. For example, according to the Department of Labor, for the claims submitted under FECA in fiscal year 1994 for which wage-loss benefits were paid during the first year after submission, the median amount paid was about $4,000. The median time period for which benefits were paid was about 70 days.", "No two workers\u2019 compensation programs are exactly alike. Despite the various differences among state, FECA, and the District of Columbia programs, to be eligible for benefits under any of these laws, workers\u2019 injuries or occupational diseases must arise out of and occur in the course of employment. These criteria, though used somewhat differently among jurisdictions, generally mean that a worker\u2019s illness or injury must occur in the course of performing his or her job in order to be compensable. To be eligible for monetary benefits under workers\u2019 compensation, workers must experience an actual loss in wages or a permanent impairment.", "Most states and the District of Columbia require that employees be out of work during a waiting period ranging from 3 to 7 days before benefits for lost wages can be paid. FECA requires a 3-day waiting period that begins after the expiration of any \u201ccontinuation of pay\u201d to which the worker may be entitled. Continuation of pay is a unique feature of FECA whereby FECA authorizes federal agencies to continue paying employees who are absent from work because of work-related traumatic injuries their regular salaries for up to 45 days before the 3-day waiting period begins. Continuation- of-pay benefits are not payable in occupational disease cases. Under state workers\u2019 compensation programs, if an employee is absent from work continuously for 5 to 42 days after the date of injury, he or she is entitled to wage-loss benefits retroactive to the date of injury.

Under the FECA program, the same employee also would receive 66-2/3 percent (75 percent if the employee has dependents) of his or her lost wages. However, the employee would receive the full $400 because the weekly maximum FECA allows for wage loss is $1,299.38.

Benefits for these permanent impairments are called \u201cschedule awards.\u201d Permanent partial loss or loss of use of members, organs, or body functions listed on federal or state schedules is also compensable, but for less than the maximum number of weeks. The maximum amount of money and period of time during which compensation may be paid for specific functional losses are authorized by statute and vary by program. Table 2 shows the variation in the maximum number of weeks of compensation and dollars payable for certain permanent impairments among selected states and the FECA program. The maximum amount and weeks for the states we selected cover the range of these maximum limits across all states.

For example, under FECA, an employee may receive 66-2/3 percent of his or her salary or wages if there are no dependents (75 percent if there are) for up to a maximum of 312 weeks for the total loss or loss of use of an arm. Accordingly, the loss or loss of use of an arm provides the same number of weeks of benefits to all injured federal workers, but workers with lower wages will receive a lesser amount of monetary benefits. If a worker loses 50-percent use of an arm, he or she would likely receive 66-2/3 percent of his or her salary or wages for 156 weeks, which is 50 percent of the maximum number of weeks allowed. Workers with permanent partial impairments continue to receive compensation for their loss until they receive the full amount they are eligible for, even if they are working.

States using this approach assess the seriousness of the worker\u2019s medical condition; consider such factors as prior education, work experience, and other personal characteristics that affect one\u2019s ability to obtain and retain employment; and estimate the worker\u2019s loss in earning capacity in percentage terms. States normally express total earning capacity in terms of a specified number of weeks.

Unlike workers\u2019 compensation, VA does not base compensation on each individual veteran\u2019s salary or wage loss, nor does it base compensation on how each veteran\u2019s earning capacity is actually affected by his or her service-connected condition. Veterans with the same condition at the same level of severity usually receive the same basic cash benefit.", "The rating schedule contains medical criteria and disability ratings. The medical criteria consist of a list of diagnoses, organized by body system, and a number of levels of medical severity specified for each diagnosis.

These veterans, therefore, are entitled to a 40-percent disability rating whether this injury actually reduces their earning capacity by more than 40 percent or does not reduce it at all. In 1996, all veterans having conditions with a disability rating of 40 percent received basic compensation of $380 per month. In 1996, under VA\u2019s disability program, a veteran received basic compensation of $91 per month, or $1,092 annually, for a condition rated at 10 percent, and up to $1,870 per month, or $22,440 annually, for a condition rated at 100 percent (see table 3).", "In contrast to many workers\u2019 compensation programs, VA\u2019s program does not place any limits on the total amount of monetary benefits veterans can receive or the time period for which they can receive these benefits.

FECA monthly cash benefits for workers with lower salaries may not be higher, however, than VA cash benefits. For example, for the total loss or loss of use of an arm, a federal employee without dependents at a GS-12, step 1, salary level would receive about $2,341 a month for a maximum of 72 months (312 weeks) under FECA. Under VA\u2019s disability compensation program, this same person would receive $1,124 a month.

FECA payments for schedule awards are limited to 6 years or less, whereas VA disability payments are made to disabled veterans for the duration of the impairment, so the payment of several decades\u2019 worth of benefits is not uncommon. FECA payments and VA disability payments can be\u2014and usually are\u2014increased over time. A dollar paid to a recipient today is worth more than a dollar paid at some future date, in terms of both value to the recipient and cost to the government, because a dollar received today can be invested to provide more than a dollar\u2019s benefit in the future.
