Since the first year of implementation, fiscal year 2004, limited improper payments reporting by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and concerns raised by NASA's auditors about its risk assessment process prompted scrutiny from the Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, and International Security, during several oversight hearings. Because the subcommittee noted that USAID's and NASA's performance and accountability report (PAR) reporting on improper payments and recovery auditing was minimal, GAO was asked to review both agencies' IPIA risk assessment methodologies, recovery auditing procedures, and actions under way to improve their IPIA and recovery audit reporting."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the first 3 years of IPIA implementation, fiscal years 2004 through 2006, USAID and NASA performed various procedures to conduct their risk assessments. Many of these procedures are positive steps to address the requirements of IPIA. At the same time, GAO identified numerous deficiencies in the procedures that warrant further improvement. For example, neither USAID nor NASA had developed a systematic process to (1) identify risks that exist in their payment activities or (2) evaluate the results of their payment stream reviews, such as weighting and scoring the effectiveness of existing internal control over payments made and results from external audits. Furthermore, risk assessment documentation maintained by USAID and NASA was lacking or insufficient to support their conclusions that no programs or activities were susceptible to significant improper payments. A lack of detailed written guidance for both agencies may have contributed to the deficiencies identified. Due to inadequacies in their risk assessment process, USAID and NASA cannot be certain that they had no programs or activities susceptible to significant improper payments, and ultimately, had effectively implemented IPIA. Although USAID and NASA have reported on steps taken to recoup improper contract payments, GAO found several weaknesses in their recovery auditing procedures for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. In particular, USAID and NASA did not report recovery auditing information for each fiscal year, documentation was lacking or not adequately supported, and neither agency adhered to all of the reporting requirements outlined in Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) implementing guidance. Other weaknesses noted were agency-specific. For example, USAID recovery auditing procedures were comprised of reviews of certain Office of Inspector General and external audit reports over USAID grant and contract programs. However, the methodology used for conducting those audits may not have constituted a recovery auditing program as defined by OMB guidance, and thus may be insufficient for this purpose. NASA, on the other hand, used IPIA contract payment review results to report amounts recovered for fiscal year 2005. However, the payment reviews were limited in scope and did not provide an adequate representation of the extent of contract overpayments. Due to a lack of, or insufficient, documentation, along with identified weaknesses, the validity and accuracy of the reported recovery amounts are questionable. While USAID and NASA have experienced significant challenges in their first 3 years of IPIA implementation, both agencies have taken steps to strengthen their risk assessment process and, ultimately, IPIA reporting. For example, USAID has developed an agencywide payment database that will be used to research and data mine for potential improper payments. NASA hired two different contractors to develop a methodology for conducting a risk assessment and testing of payment transactions. Actions are also under way to improve recovery auditing efforts. However, improvements are still needed to address some of the weaknesses identified related to conducting risk assessments and performing recovery auditing procedures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Pub.

IPIA has increased visibility over improper payments  by requiring executive branch agency heads, based on guidance from the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to identify programs and  activities susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate amounts  improperly paid, and report on the amounts of improper payments and  their actions to reduce them. Similarly, the Recovery Auditing Act requires  agencies to systematically identify and recover contract overpayments.  This act requires, among other things, that all executive branch agencies  entering into contracts with a total value exceeding $500 million in a fiscal  year have cost-effective programs for identifying errors in paying  contractors and for recovering amounts erroneously paid. Since fiscal year  2004, agencies have been required by OMB to report on IPIA and recovery  auditing efforts in their performance and accountability reports (PAR).", "For the first 3 years of IPIA implementation, fiscal years 2004 through  2006, USAID and NASA have reported that none of their programs and  activities were susceptible to significant improper payments and either did  not report any or provided minimal information on recovery auditing  activities. Although USAID and NASA differ in size, with annual budgets  exceeding $10 billion and $16 billion, respectively, both agencies awarded  over 75 percent of their total budget to contractors or grantees\u2014thereby  increasing the risk of improper payments made to awardees. In particular,  at NASA, we have previously reported on long-standing weaknesses and  vulnerabilities in its contract management. Since 1990, we have designated  NASA\u2019s contract management as high-risk principally because NASA  lacked a modern financial management system to provide accurate and  reliable information on contract spending and placed little emphasis on  product performance, cost controls, and program outcomes. The lack of  an effective financial management system is also included as a financial  management weakness that contributed to NASA receiving a disclaimer of  opinion on its financial statements for the past 3 fiscal years. NASA\u2019s  Office of Inspector General (OIG) has also identified financial  management and the contract and acquisition process as being among the  most serious management and performance challenges.", "At USAID, we have reported on weaknesses associated with its contract  management and oversight of U.S. assistance to Afghanistan. For example,  we found that during fiscal year 2004, USAID did not consistently require  contractors to fulfill contract provisions or provide adequate contract  oversight, including holding contractors to stipulated requirements and  conducting required reviews of contractor performance. We also have  previously reported on control weaknesses in USAID\u2019s ability to collect  agencywide obligation and expenditure data and long-standing challenges  associated with USAID\u2019s financial management and reporting, including a  lack of complete, reliable, and timely information needed to make sound,  cost-effective decisions.", "OIG and external audit reports have also identified weaknesses related to  contract management and oversight in Iraq. USAID\u2019s OIG reported that  the agency made about $8 million in payments to a contractor for security  services in Iraq without a valid obligation, including not obtaining the  minimum documentation required and signing a contract prior to making  these payments. The OIG determined that without an effective funds  control system, USAID cannot prevent overspending or ensure compliance  with various laws enacted to control and guide the implementation of  federal fiscal policy. In addition, on the basis of its review of a $1.33 billion  cost-plus reconstruction contract issued by USAID, the Special Inspector  General for Iraq Reconstruction found insufficient contract oversight that  resulted in inconsistent contract management, inadequate contractor  direction, and ineffective performance assessments.", "In addition to these previously reported weaknesses in USAID and NASA  operations, limited improper payments reporting by the two agencies in  fiscal year 2004 and concerns raised by NASA\u2019s auditors regarding its risk  assessment process prompted scrutiny from your subcommittee during  several oversight hearings on governmentwide improper payments.  Because of congressional concern that USAID\u2019s and NASA\u2019s PAR reporting  on improper payments had not improved in the second year of IPIA  implementation, and both agencies reported minimal recovery auditing  information, you asked us to determine (1) the extent to which USAID and  NASA performed the required risk assessments to identify programs and  activities that were susceptible to significant improper payments for fiscal  year 2004 through fiscal year 2006, (2) steps USAID and NASA have taken  to recoup improper payments through recovery audits, and (3) actions  USAID and NASA have under way to improve their IPIA and recovery  audit reporting.", "To address each of these objectives, we reviewed improper payments and  recovery auditing legislation and OMB implementing guidance. We also  reviewed USAID\u2019s and NASA\u2019s fiscal years 2004 through 2006 PARs and  external audit reports and interviewed agency officials about their risk  assessment methodologies, recovery auditing activities, and efforts  completed and under way to meet the reporting requirements of IPIA and  the Recovery Auditing Act. To assess the reliability of USAID\u2019s and NASA\u2019s  IPIA and recovery auditing reporting, we talked to agency officials about  data quality control procedures and reviewed relevant documentation. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We conducted our work from September 2006 through August 2007  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. See  appendix I for more details on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IPIA was passed in November 2002 with the major objective of enhancing  the accuracy and integrity of federal payments. IPIA requires executive  branch agency heads to review their programs and activities annually and  identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments.  For each program and activity agencies identify as susceptible, the act  requires them to estimate the annual amount of improper payments and to  report those estimates to the Congress. The act further requires that for  programs for which estimated improper payments exceed $10 million,  agencies are to report annually to the Congress on the actions they are  taking to reduce those payments.", "The act also requires the Director of OMB to prescribe guidance for  agencies to use in implementing IPIA. OMB\u2019s implementing guidance  requires the use of a systematic method for the annual review and  identification of programs and activities that are susceptible to significant  improper payments. However, this guidance also allows for annual  reviews (also known as risk assessments) to be conducted less often than  annually for programs where improper payment baselines are already  established, are in the process of being measured, or are scheduled to be  measured by an established date\u2014which is inconsistent with the express  requirement of IPIA. In addition, OMB\u2019s guidance defines significant  improper payments as those in any particular program that exceed both  2.5 percent of program payments and $10 million annually. It requires  agencies to estimate improper payments annually using statistically valid  techniques for each susceptible program or activity. The guidance also  allows agencies to use alternative sampling methodologies and requires  agencies to report on and provide a justification for using these  methodologies in their PARs. For those agency programs determined to be  susceptible to significant improper payments and with estimated annual  improper payments greater than $10 million, IPIA and related OMB  guidance require each agency to annually report the results of its efforts to  reduce improper payments.", "In August 2004, OMB established Eliminating Improper Payments as a new  program-specific initiative under the President\u2019s Management Agenda  (PMA). This separate PMA program initiative began in the first quarter of  fiscal year 2005. Previously, agency efforts related to improper payments  were tracked along with other financial management activities as part of  the Improving Financial Performance initiative of the PMA. The objective  of establishing a separate initiative for improper payments was to ensure  that agency managers are held accountable for meeting the goals of IPIA  and are therefore dedicating the necessary attention and resources to  meeting IPIA requirements. With this initiative, 15 agencies are to  measure their improper payments annually, develop improvement targets  and corrective actions, and track the results annually to ensure the  corrective actions are effective. This list does not include USAID or NASA,  which are nevertheless covered under IPIA and thus are required to  address improper payments for their programs and activities. However,  both USAID and NASA stated that they consulted with OMB, although  infrequently, about procedures planned or under way for the first 3 years  of IPIA implementation.", "In addition, applicable agencies are required by OMB guidance to report  their efforts to recoup contract-related improper payments under section  831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002,  commonly referred to as the Recovery Auditing Act. This legislation  provides an impetus for applicable agencies to systematically identify and  recover contract overpayments for executive branch agencies entering  into contracts with a cumulative total value exceeding $500 million in a  fiscal year. Furthermore, the law authorizes federal agencies to retain  recovered funds to cover in-house administrative costs as well as to pay  other contractors, such as collection agencies.", "Recovery auditing is a method that agencies can use to recoup detected  (as opposed to estimated) improper payments. As such, recovery auditing  is a detective control to help determine whether contractor payments were  proper. Specifically, it focuses on the identification of erroneous invoices,  discounts offered but not received, improper late penalty payments,  incorrect shipping costs, and multiple payments for single invoices.  Recovery auditing can be conducted in-house or contracted out to  recovery audit firms. The techniques used in recovery auditing offer the  opportunity for identifying weaknesses in agency internal controls, which  can be modified or upgraded to be more effective in preventing improper  payments before they occur during subsequent contract outlays.", "Agencies that are required to undertake recovery audit programs were  directed by OMB to provide annual reports on their recovery audit efforts,  along with improper payment reporting detailed in an appendix to their  PAR. Specifically, OMB\u2019s implementing guidance requires that agencies  include in the PAR:    a general description and evaluation of the steps taken to carry out a  recovery auditing program;  the total cost of the agency\u2019s recovery auditing program;  the total amount of contracts subject to review, the actual amount of  contracts reviewed, the amounts identified for recovery, and the  amounts actually recovered in the current year;    a corrective action plan to address the root causes of payment error;    a general description and evaluation of any management improvement  program carried out; and    a description and justification of the classes of contracts excluded from  recovery auditing review by the agency head."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID\u2019s and NASA\u2019s Risk Assessment Processes and Documentation Could Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["For the first 3 years of IPIA implementation\u2014fiscal years 2004 through  2006\u2014both agencies performed various procedures to conduct their risk  assessments.

Both USAID and NASA conducted a review of their  payment streams as part of their risk assessment process to identify  significant improper payments. OMB\u2019s implementing guidance includes a  broad definition of programs and activities subject to IPIA, which  encompasses a review of payment activities. We found during our review  of fiscal year 2006 PARs that agencies generally used one of two  approaches to conduct their risk assessments\u2014a review of program  operations or a review of payment streams. Although agencies are  allowed under OMB\u2019s implementing guidance to determine their program  and activity inventory for the purposes of performing a risk assessment,  the two approaches can produce different results. In particular, a review  of payment streams identifies the susceptibility of improper payments for  specific payment types that could relate to multiple programs within an  organization. On the other hand, a review of distinct programs would  identify the susceptibility of improper payments for the different payment  types included in a particular program. Depending on the volume and  dollar amount of payments or size of a program, an agency could  determine based on OMB\u2019s current definition of significant improper  payments\u2014exceeding $10 million and 2.5 percent of program payments\u2014 that it had significant improper payments using one approach but not with  the other, greatly impacting its risk assessment results.", "Implementing a payment stream approach, USAID and NASA did not  identify any risk-susceptible programs or activities for fiscal year 2004.  This continued into fiscal year 2005 for both agencies. For fiscal year 2006,  USAID identified two high-risk payment streams as part of its risk  assessment\u2014cash transfers and contracts, grants, and cooperative  agreements. However, the identification of these two payment streams  did not result from a systematic process in place to identify high-risk  programs, but rather was due to the high ratio of disbursements for these  two payment streams to total agency outlays (about 77 percent for fiscal  year 2006). On the other hand, NASA continued to assert for fiscal year  2006 that it had no programs susceptible to significant improper payments  although it did not perform a risk assessment for that year.

For fiscal year 2004, these payment  streams consisted of program, operating, and other fund disbursements  made from headquarters and its 38 accounting stations that conduct cash  management activities for approximately 70 mission offices located  overseas. Two of the 11 payment streams\u2014cash transfers and contracts,  grants, and cooperative agreements\u2014totaled $6.8 billion, or 90 percent of  total outlays. USAID\u2019s payment streams are shown in figure 1.", "USAID\u2019s risk assessment for fiscal year 2004 consisted of a two-pronged  review\u2014payments made from headquarters and payments from the 38  mission accounting stations. According to USAID, approximately 75  percent of payments are made at headquarters and 25 percent from the  mission offices. For the headquarters\u2019 risk assessment, USAID stated it  performed a review of all 11 payment streams; however, it did not perform  any risk assessment procedures for two of the payment streams\u2014training  and transportation\u2014because each of these payment streams\u2019 total outlays  did not exceed $10 million, and therefore, would not have met OMB\u2019s dual  criteria for estimating and reporting improper payments. As part of its risk  assessment process, USAID officials told us that they conducted  interviews with management and various operation managers responsible  for the payment types to determine internal controls over payment  activity. USAID also stated it performed sampling of its fiscal year 2003  travel transactions and reviewed 25 percent of all travel transactions  above $2,500 that had been identified as risk susceptible. In addition,  USAID met with the OIG and stated that it reviewed certain OIG reports  and external audit reports with recommendations, such as Defense  Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit reports and Single Audit Act  reports, to identify internal control weaknesses over grant funds. Lastly,  USAID stated that it relied on routine prepayment and postpayment review  activities which are designed to help ensure the accuracy and validity of  payments made. For example, according to USAID policy, voucher  examiners review and process vouchers that contractors submit to USAID  for payment; the examiners determine that a valid obligation exists, check  mathematical accuracy, and ascertain that proper approvals and  authorizations have taken place.", "For the mission accounting stations\u2019 risk assessment, USAID required that  4 of the 11 payment streams be reviewed since it had access to the  payment activity for the remaining 7 payment streams and incorporated  those payments into the headquarters risk assessment. Also, similar to  headquarters, the mission accounting stations were not required to review  payment streams with total outlays less than $10 million. USAID provided  general guidance to the controllers of each mission accounting station on  IPIA and OMB implementing guidance, and included a memorandum from  the Deputy CFO to each controller explaining actions needed to conduct  the risk assessment, along with a template for each mission accounting  station to complete on their review of the payment transactions. USAID  incorporated the results of these payment reviews in the headquarters\u2019 risk  assessment to determine overall risk for the agency.", "For the fiscal year 2005 and 2006 risk assessments, USAID leveraged the  work completed for fiscal year 2004, its baseline year, and compared total  outlays for each subsequent fiscal year to fiscal year 2004, to determine  whether significant changes in reported outlays had occurred. USAID  determined that there had been no significant changes and thus applied  analytical procedures\u2014consisting of multiplying fiscal year 2004 payment  stream percentages of the total fiscal year 2004 net outlay and fiscal years  2005 and 2006 total outlay amounts\u2014to estimate the dollar amount of each  payment stream for each of the given years. Using this information, USAID  stated that it relied on its reviews of OIG and external audit reports,  prepayment and postpayment reviews, and A-123 internal control reviews  to ensure the risk of improper payments was minimized. No payment  reviews were performed at the mission accounting stations for fiscal years  2005 and 2006 because USAID had determined that payments made by the  missions were not high-risk, based on the results of its fiscal year 2004 risk  assessment and the quantitative and qualitative procedures performed.  USAID officials also informed us that they reviewed various external audit  reports and relied on the agency\u2019s routine pre- and postpayment reviews.

See appendix III for a description of each payment  stream. These payment streams represent procurement actions and grant  awards made at NASA\u2019s headquarters and its nine centers located around  the country. For its risk assessment, NASA did not identify a universe of  outlays for all types of payment streams such as travel, training, and  payroll, for our period of review, fiscal years 2004 through 2006. NASA did  provide us with a schedule of six payment streams representing  procurement and grant data reported in NASA\u2019s annual procurement  reports.

Specifically, for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, NASA only  performed a review of its firm-fixed-price payment stream, representing a  small portion (about 12 percent for fiscal year 2004 and 20 percent for  fiscal year 2005) of total reported payment streams. NASA stated that it  excluded its various cost-type contracts because (1) these contracts are  subject to interim and closeout audits performed by DCAA, (2) these  contract payments may be adjusted in future billings to correct previous  errors, and (3) 5 to 10 percent of the cost contract value is withheld until  the closeout audit is completed. NASA officials told us that NASA will  include cost-type contracts in its fiscal year 2007 risk assessment.  Regarding the exclusion of grant payments, NASA stated that these  payments are subject to Single Audit Act reviews as well as periodic  reviews for compliance with cash management, financial management  system, or financial reporting requirements. NASA\u2019s review of its firm- fixed-price payment stream included selecting a sample of firm-fixed-price  payment transactions made during one quarter, at headquarters, and each  center. NASA provided its centers instructions, consisting of an e-mail  from the improper payments coordinator, on the scope of payment  transactions to be reviewed. On the basis of the results of each center\u2019s  review, NASA reported in its fiscal years 2004 and 2005 PARs that it had no  programs and activities susceptible to significant improper payments. For  fiscal year 2006, NASA OCFO officials told us that it did not perform a risk  assessment of all of its programs and activities due to turnover of its  headquarters staff responsible for IPIA and recovery auditing.

Although USAID had general guidance in its  payables management directive that reiterated IPIA requirements, no  procedures existed on how to conduct a risk assessment and evaluate  those results. In addition, NASA had not developed any guidance that  could direct steps performed to ensure it met applicable IPIA  requirements. OMB guidance provides that agencies annually perform risk  assessments of their programs and activities, but offers limited  information on how to conduct a risk assessment, thus allowing agencies  broad flexibility for determining a methodology to employ to meet IPIA  requirements. In our November 2006 report, we recommended, and OMB  agreed, that the IPIA implementing guidance be expanded to describe in  greater detail factors that agencies should consider when conducting their  annual risk assessments. The OMB guidance, though, has not yet been  updated to describe risk factors agencies should consider when  conducting their annual risk assessments.", "While OMB does not require agencies to develop agency-specific guidance  related to IPIA, during our review of agencies\u2019 internal IPIA guidance, we  noted that nine agencies had developed either guidance or a tool, such as  a schedule, survey, or questionnaire, to facilitate their compliance with  IPIA. As the risk assessment is a key step in gaining assurance that  programs and activities are operating as intended and that they are  achieving expected outcomes, it is critical that agencies develop a  comprehensive approach for determining the extent and level of risk of  improper payments in order to identify the nature and type of corrective  action needed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Identified Risk Factors", "paragraphs": ["For the first 3 years of IPIA implementation, significant flaws existed in  USAID\u2019s and NASA\u2019s processes to identify risk in their payment activities.  For example, neither agency had established or considered risk factors to  assist them in identifying programs and activities vulnerable to improper  payments, such as assessments of internal control, audit report findings,  and human capital risks related to staff turnover, training, or experience.  We noted that some agencies have developed factors or risk conditions  that directly or indirectly affect the likelihood of improper payments  within a program or activity. We noted from our review of fiscal year 2006  PARs or annual reports that 13 agencies reported that one of the risk  factors they considered during the assessment included internal and  external reviews, such as results from identified system or program  weaknesses, and OIG and Single Audit Act reports. Similarly, 13 agencies  reported that an assessment of internal controls was another type of risk  factor used during their process.", "Although there is no requirement for agencies to identify risk factors as  part of their risk assessment process, this type of identification is  consistent with our previous recommendation that OMB establish risk  factors in its guidance for agencies to consider and consistent with our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and  executive guide on strategies to manage improper payments, which  provides a framework for conducting a comprehensive risk assessment.  Our executive guide identifies the following four strategies that should be  considered when determining the nature and extent of improper  payments:  institute a systematic process to estimate the level of improper  payments being made by the organization;    based on this process, determine where risks exist, what those risks  are, and the potential or actual impact of those risks on program  operations;    use risk assessment results to target high-risk areas and focus  resources where the greatest exposure exists; and  reassess risks on a recurring basis to evaluate the impact of changing  conditions, both external and internal, on program operations.", "While USAID and NASA did perform procedures that addressed some of  the common risk factors identified by other agencies, there was no  established process in place to identify the types of risk specific to the  payment streams reviewed during the assessment process. Had both  agencies made a more concerted effort to identify particular risk factors,  additional procedures may have been considered, facilitating a more in- depth review and analysis of their payment streams or program  operations. We also found that USAID and NASA had not developed a  standardized process to evaluate the results of actions they completed as  part of their risk assessments, such as weighting and scoring the results of  risk conditions to determine susceptibility. As such, the various  procedures performed did not provide meaningful results or adequately  depict the agencies\u2019 risk of improper payments.", "For example, both agencies reported performing one or more of the  following steps\u2014assessing internal controls, reviewing external audits,  and conducting payment reviews\u2014yet neither agency developed a process  that identified the potential or actual impact of those results, and  ultimately risks, on their agency operations. Assessing the results or risk  conditions identified during the risk assessment plays a major role in  determining the overall risk level of an agency\u2019s operations as risk  conditions do not have an equal effect on all programs or activities. Some  risk conditions may affect a program or activity to a greater or lesser  degree. Likewise, not all risk conditions may be relevant to each program  or activity. Therefore, assigning a weight to each risk condition would  accurately reflect the level of importance and influence each risk  condition has on a specific program or activity.", "We view findings from OIG and external audits as valuable information  that agencies can use to identify areas vulnerable to improper payments.  OIG and external audits, such as performance audits, provide an objective  and systematic examination of evidence for the purpose of providing an  assessment of the performance of a government organization, program,  activity, or function. As part of its risk assessment, USAID reported  conducting a review of OIG and external audits, while NASA did not. Yet,  as previously stated, USAID did not have a process in place to evaluate the  potential or actual impact of those risks on operations. For both USAID  and NASA, we identified various GAO, OIG, and Single Audit Act audit  reports as well as Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation reports that  highlighted fraud, questioned costs, and internal control weaknesses, that  may not have been adequately considered during the risk assessment  process.

In addition, two of the contractor\u2019s senior  procurement officials admitted to soliciting and receiving kickbacks  from the subcontractor in exchange for bid information and assistance  in the approval of change orders. A civil settlement amount of $1.4  million was reached between NASA and the contractor.", "NASA\u2019s OIG found various weaknesses in NASA\u2019s acquisition and  contracting processes such as a lack of a reliable financial management  system to track contract spending, inadequate control over government  property held by contractors, and procurement process abuses by  NASA employees and contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Internal Controls Not Assessed for Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["As part of their risk assessments, USAID and NASA reported that they  relied on pre- and postpayment controls over payment transactions to  identify risk.

In addition, USAID  officials told us that they had interviewed management and various  program managers to assess internal controls. However, USAID had not  developed a list of, or series of questions\u2014such as a standard  questionnaire\u2014to ensure consistency regarding the types of questions  asked across agency operations and that focused discussions on specific  issues related to improper payments and internal controls. Similarly,  NASA told us that it relied on postpayment controls over its various cost- type contracts, thus excluding over 80 percent of its procurement dollars,  and ultimately the related contract payments. Yet, NASA performed no  independent assessments of these postpayment controls and was not  knowledgeable of specific procedures DCAA performed during its  contract audits.

Because of the lack of guidance and  insufficient review, USAID and NASA cannot be certain that these  payment reviews adequately support that payments made were not  susceptible to significant improper payments.", "For its fiscal year 2004 risk assessment, USAID instructed its 38 mission  accounting stations to perform payment reviews of their payroll, travel,  allowances, and other payment streams totaling about $159 million.  Although USAID provided its mission accounting stations with general  guidance regarding IPIA and a template to use when performing their  payment reviews, there were no detailed instructions on specific  characteristics or attributes of the payment transactions that the mission  accounting stations should review to identify improper payments. USAID  told us that the mission accounting stations had flexibility in tailoring the  extent of their risk assessments and sampling methodology because they  collectively represent only 25 percent of USAID\u2019s total disbursements and  each mission (1) differs based on the nature of its programs and the  volume of payment activity and (2) performs 100 percent of payment  reviews as part of its normal course of business. Therefore, some mission  accounting stations may have conducted statistical or nonstatistical  sampling while others performed 100 percent payment reviews. As a  result, such payment review results may not be comparable among  mission accounting stations or representative of their payment activity.  USAID stated that it was not possible to verify or validate any of the  information received from the mission accounting stations since they used  stand-alone accounting systems that were not integrated with  headquarter\u2019s accounting system during our period of review. From these  payment reviews, the mission accounting stations collectively identified  about $258,973 in improper payments for fiscal year 2004. On the basis of  the fiscal year 2004 mission risk assessment results and other quantitative  and qualitative analysis performed, USAID determined that payments  made from mission accounting stations were low-risk and therefore it did  not conduct separate payment reviews for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. For  its fiscal years 2005 and 2006 payment reviews at headquarters, USAID  stated it relied on its reviews of OIG and external audit reports, pre- and  postpayment reviews, and A-123 internal control reviews. However, we  were unable to verify that all payment streams were included in the  reviews and could not evaluate any procedures performed as USAID was  unable to provide documentation that supported these actions or their  results.", "We identified similar weaknesses in NASA\u2019s payment reviews. For  example, NASA also lacked established criteria for payment transaction  reviews conducted by its centers for purposes of IPIA, including specific  characteristics or attributes of the payment transactions that the centers  should review to identify improper payments. This led to inconsistent  application of the methodology that centers were asked to use to conduct  their payment reviews. For example, one NASA center selected payment  transaction amounts of $100,000 or greater rather than the 15 percent of its  first quarter payments consistent with the other centers and as requested  by NASA headquarters. The same center also noted that it reviewed  documentation to determine whether or not the payments complied with  Prompt Payment Act provisions, rather than IPIA requirements. When we  brought it to their attention, NASA OCFO officials said that the center  could have erroneously tested according to the wrong act.", "On the basis of its testing of transactions, NASA reported that it identified  $70,599 in improper payments for fiscal year 2004 from its examination of  $14.6 million in firm-fixed-price contract payments and identified $617,442  in improper payments for fiscal year 2005 based on its examination of  $82.5 million of those same types of contract payments. However, we  noted that NASA did not verify the results of its centers\u2019 payment reviews.  Furthermore, NASA\u2019s independent auditor reported in fiscal year 2004 that  the agency may not have fully complied with IPIA requirements because  NASA did not consider payments other than firm-fixed-price contract  payments as part of the risk assessment process or prepare an estimate of  improper payments. Therefore, the total improper payment amounts  reported may not be accurate, especially given the inconsistencies we  identified. For fiscal year 2006, according to OCFO officials, NASA did not  conduct any payment reviews or overall risk assessment of its payment  activities due to headquarters staff turnover responsible for IPIA. Instead,  it relied on its recovery audit work performed during the year to conclude  it had no programs and activities susceptible to significant improper  payments. The adequacy of such a determination is questionable because  the scope of review under the Recovery Auditing Act targets a specific  type of payment\u2014contracts\u2014whereas the scope of review under IPIA  includes a review of all programs and activities that are subject to different  reporting requirements if they are found to be susceptible to significant  improper payments. Furthermore, OMB guidance under the Recovery  Auditing Act allows agencies to exclude certain classes of contracts from  consideration, which is not permitted under IPIA. Under IPIA, all  programs and activities are subject to review.", "Although NASA reported its payment reviews were statistically based, its  minimal coverage of the firm-fixed-price payment stream was inconsistent  with OMB guidance that directs that agencies use a 12-month period to  report improper payment information. Specifically, for fiscal years 2004  and 2005, NASA identified a small universe of firm-fixed-price  procurement payments as the basis for each year\u2019s payment reviews.  Already representing a small percentage of total reported payment  streams\u201412 percent for fiscal year 2004 and 20 percent for fiscal year  2005\u2014NASA OCFO further narrowed the scope of dollars to be reviewed  by instructing its centers to select statistical samples of only 15 percent of  its firm-fixed-price contract payments made during a 3-month period,  January 1 to March 31 of each year. NASA was unable to provide an  explanation for the basis of these limited reviews. Despite NASA\u2019s  reported use of statistical sampling to conduct its payment reviews, its  small sample population and minimal coverage of the firm-fixed-price  payment stream compared to total procurement dollars does not  adequately represent NASA\u2019s total contract activity, which accounts for  about 85 percent of NASA\u2019s annual budget.", "Furthermore, NASA excluded grant program payments, totaling about  $630 million for fiscal year 2004, from its risk assessment review. OMB  guidance requires that agencies include federal awards subject to the  Single Audit Act, as amended, as part of their review to address IPIA  reporting requirements. In its fiscal year 2004 audit report, NASA\u2019s  auditors reported that the agency may not have fully complied with IPIA  requirements as it did not explicitly consider payments other than firm- fixed-price as part of the risk assessment process or prepare an estimate  of improper payments. The auditors also reported that NASA noted that  audit efforts by nonfederal auditors with respect to grantees and by  government auditors with respect to certain NASA contracts aid in  identifying and mitigating improper payments. While single audits could be  a source of improper payment information, we previously reported that  single audits, by themselves, may lack the level of detail necessary for  achieving IPIA compliance. Specifically, single audits generally focus on  the largest dollar amounts in an auditee\u2019s portfolio. Thus, all programs  identified as susceptible to improper payments at the federal level may not  receive extensive coverage under a single audit. Consequently, both the  depth and level of detail of single audit results are, generally, insufficient  to identify improper payments, estimate improper payments, or both."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USAID and NASA Lacked Sufficient Documentation to Support Their Risk Assessment Processes", "paragraphs": ["While OMB guidance requires agencies to maintain documentation of their  risk assessment, USAID and NASA were unable to support a majority of  the actions highlighted earlier in this report regarding their risk  assessment processes.

NASA relied almost entirely on these payment  reviews to support its conclusion that it had no programs and activities  susceptible to significant improper payments for fiscal years 2004 and  2005, yet could not provide documentation to support its conclusions. For  fiscal year 2006, NASA acknowledged that it did not perform a risk  assessment due to staff turnover, and thus no documentation existed.

OMB guidance defines a recovery audit as a  review and analysis of the agency\u2019s books, supporting documents, and  other available information supporting its payments that is specifically  designed to identify overpayments to contractors that are due to payment  errors. On the other hand, contract audits are normally performed for the  purpose of determining if amounts claimed by the contractor are in  compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable laws and  regulations and are not designed to specifically identify payment errors as  described under recovery audits.

Upon further review  of the contractor\u2019s submitted claims, NASA determined that a vast  majority of the claims submitted by the contractor were not erroneous as  they related to cost-type contracts with provisional billing rates included  in the contract terms, which were subject to a final or closeout audit that  would likely have identified those improper payments reported by the  contractor.

The new,  interactive tool will interface with its core accounting system, Phoenix,  which will enable USAID to annually identify its payment streams and  corresponding volume and dollar amounts by mission or geographic  location, data mine for duplicate payments, research other payment  anomalies, and perform tests of transactions. USAID told us that since  August 2006, when Phoenix was fully implemented agencywide, its  monitoring capabilities and testing of payment transactions had increased  significantly now that its headquarters staff has access to all disbursement  activity regardless of where the payments were made.", "Going forward, USAID also stated it plans to work more closely with the  OIG, including working with the OIG to develop a statistical sampling  methodology for testing its payment streams agencywide as part of its risk  assessment process.

Other steps USAID plans to implement include (1) leveraging the  agency\u2019s assessment of internal control under OMB Circular No. A-123  requirements to determine whether control activities in place are  effectively preventing improper payments; (2) increasing accountability  among managers responsible for addressing IPIA reporting requirements  by including IPIA responsibilities in their work plans, which are tied to the  managers\u2019 performance assessments; and (3) improving its documentation  of steps performed to comply with OMB guidance and internal policy. If  these actions are properly implemented, we believe these actions will  address some of our concerns related to conducting an assessment of  internal control and testing of payment transactions.

Lastly, USAID still lacks a  systematic method to determine if risk of improper payments exists, what  those risks are, and the potential or actual impact of those risks on  operations. For example, while USAID has developed various quantitative  and qualitative procedures as part of its risk assessment process, it still  has not taken the first step of identifying and documenting risk factors that  should be considered to ensure that the procedures performed adequately  address areas within the agency that may be susceptible to improper  payments. Furthermore, USAID has not developed an overall approach to  then evaluate the work performed, including weighting and scoring the  results of its quantitative and qualitative analysis, and thus provide a basis  for making a final determination of its risk level for assessing improper  payments under IPIA.

NASA hired a consulting firm for 2  months (February 2007 through March 2007) to develop a methodology for  conducting its fiscal year 2007 risk assessment. The consultant categorized  the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2006 disbursements, including cost-type contracts  and grant payments, by programs instead of by payment streams, as was  done by NASA in previous years. On the basis of its review of  disbursements, the consulting firm established a materiality level of        $80 million. All programs with total disbursements greater than $80 million  were included in the program universe for further review. The consultant  identified 30 programs with approximately $10.8 billion in disbursements  to include in the scope of review for determining risk level.", "To assess the risk level of the programs, the consultant examined agency  documentation and conducted (1) site visits; (2) interviews of program  managers, other agency personnel, and NASA OIG; and (3) walk-throughs  of program operations. On the basis of these steps, the consultant  identified seven risk conditions and developed a risk matrix to evaluate  and score each risk condition, using a 5 point scale\u2014with 1 point  indicating low risk and 5 points indicating high risk. Following a  calculation of the key risk factors that considered the frequency of risk,  severity of risk, and the overall risk score, 5 of the 30 programs were  deemed to be at risk for being susceptible to significant improper  payments. The 5 programs are (1) Mars Exploration, (2) Solar System  Research, (3) Space Shuttle Program, (4) International Space Station  Program, and (5) Institutions and Management.", "NASA subsequently hired another consulting firm to conduct statistical  sampling from April 2007 through September 2007 of the 5 programs to  determine if the programs are susceptible to significant improper  payments and thus would need to estimate and report on the amounts of  improper payments and actions to reduce them. Within each of these 5  programs, the consulting firm identified five payment categories that were  subject to detailed testing; they were travel expense reimbursement,  payroll and employee benefits, grant payments, government purchase  cards, and procurement and contracts. From its review, the consulting  firm found approximately $884,243 of improper payments during the  period of October 1, 2005, through September 30, 2006.

NASA concurred with all four of our  recommendations and indicated that it would develop IPIA guidance to  include detailed procedures to address the four key steps of IPIA,  including incorporating the risk assessment methodology developed by its  consulting firm. NASA noted that it has centralized its IPIA and Recovery  Auditing Act activities at the NASA Headquarters OCFO (which will  include responsibility for maintaining documentation to support its  activities) and stated that it will report recovery auditing information in its  PAR in accordance with OMB guidance.

The scope of our review included two  agencies, USAID and NASA.", "To determine the extent to which USAID and NASA performed the  required risk assessments for fiscal years 2004 through 2006, we reviewed  improper payment legislation and OMB implementing guidance. For both  agencies, we reviewed their PARs for fiscal years 2004 through 2006;  reviewed internal guidance consisting of policies and procedures to  address cash disbursements, accounts payable, and contract management;  interviewed agency officials about the risk assessment process; and, when  available, obtained and reviewed supporting documentation. In addition,  we reviewed criteria for conducting risk assessments in our Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government and executive guide on  Strategies to Manage Improper Payments: Learning from Public and  Private Sector Organizations. We also reviewed other agencies\u2019 PARs  and internal IPIA guidance to identify examples of risk factors used and  procedures followed when conducting their risk assessment process.", "To determine steps USAID and NASA took to recoup improper payments  through recovery audits, we reviewed the Recovery Auditing Act and  Appendix C to OMB Circular No. A-123, Requirements for Effective  Measurement and Remediation of Improper Payments.

For example, to  determine the reliability of USAID\u2019s payment inventory data for fiscal year  2004, we tied USAID\u2019s total payment streams to the Statement of  Budgetary Resources included in the financial section of the agency\u2019s PAR.  For NASA, we applied alternative analytical procedures to assess the  reliability of NASA\u2019s payment data, as we did not receive a breakout of the  payment streams to tie directly to the Statement of Budgetary Resources.  We compared procurement obligations contained in the annual  procurement reports with NASA\u2019s net outlays in the Statement of  Budgetary Resources for fiscal year 2006. We matched the percentage of  obligations with information contained in our fiscal year 2007 High-Risk  Series, and found that fiscal year 2006 net outlays comprised  approximately 85 percent of obligations.

A description of the  11 payment streams, along with a definition of each, follow.  1.  Payroll. This payment stream consists of all U.S. direct hire base pay  and related expenses, foreign national direct hire payroll, retirement  and benefits, all personal services contractor\u2019s payroll, and all foreign  national personal services contractor\u2019s payroll, retirement, and  benefits.  2.  Mission Allowances. This payment stream consists of employee  allowances, cost of living, educational allowances, and home service  transfer allowances.  3.  Cash Transfers. This payment stream consists of the agency\u2019s cash  transfers to the benefiting foreign countries as well as foreign  organizations. These payments are made and deposited via the U.S.  Treasury and/or the Federal Reserve Bank into the foreign  government\u2019s account as designated in the official agreement or treaty  between the U.S. and the foreign government.  4.  Travel. This payment stream represents all travel expenses, including  travel costs incurred for educational language training, evacuation,  postassignment travel to field, home leave and rest and relaxation, site  visits to mission offices, conferences, seminars, and meetings, and  other operational travel.  5.  Transportation. This payment stream consists of all transportation  and freight costs incurred to missions or headquarters and from  missions or headquarters.  6.  Training. This payment stream consists of all costs incurred to obtain  technical and professional training, such as language training,  certification training for contract, project, and financial offices,  training support costs, and other technical and professional training.  7.  Other Operating Expenses. This payment stream consists of other  expenses incurred by USAID to perform its work. Examples of other  operating expenses are supplies, local travel, conferences, and other  miscellaneous expenses that are deemed necessary for the successful  performance of USAID\u2019s work.  8.  Payments to Other Agencies. This payment stream consists of all  payments made to other federal agencies for services and/or goods  received. Outlays include rental payments to the General Services  Administration for office and warehouse rent, payments to the Office  of Personnel Management for background investigation services, and  payments to the Defense Contract Audit Agency for federal audit  services.  9.  Credit-Financing Funds. This payment stream is principally intended  for credit enhancement purposes and may be used where (a) the  agency\u2019s sustainable development objectives may best be achieved  effectively using credit, and (b) the risks of default may be reasonably  estimated and managed. It is a financing tool to be used in addition to  or in lieu of grant funding where appropriate. Credit financing funds  agreements will be utilized only when the partner is a non-sovereign  entity. No sovereign loan guarantees are permissible under existing  credit financing authorities. Credit financing shall be a demand-driven  initiative, with operating units having primary responsibility for  designing, authorizing, and implementing activities in support of  approved strategic objectives and within administration and  congressional priorities for assistance. Credit financing operations  require a clear separation of responsibility for assessing the  developmental soundness and the financial soundness of each activity,  with the latter responsibilities entrusted to a credit review board  within the agency. Credit financing shall not be used unless it is  probable that the transaction would not go forward without it, taking  into consideration whether such financing is available for the term  needed and at a reasonable cost.  10. Revolving Funds. This payment stream was created for a one-time  purchase of land and a building in fiscal year 2004. There were no  payments made from this account in either fiscal year 2005 or fiscal  year 2006.  11. Contracts, Grants, and Cooperative Agreements.", "Contract. A mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller  to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the  buyer to pay for them.

NASA did not conduct a risk  assessment for fiscal year 2006. Instead, NASA relied on its recovery  auditing work to determine that no programs and activities were  susceptible to significant improper payments. A description of the six  payment streams, along with a definition of each, follow.  1.  Firm-fixed-price contracts provide for a price that is not subject to any  adjustment on the basis of the contractor\u2019s cost experience in  performing the contract. This contract type places upon the contractor  maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit  or loss. It provides maximum incentive for the contractor to control  costs and perform effectively and imposes a minimum administrative  burden upon the contracting parties. The contracting officer may use a  firm-fixed-price contract in conjunction with an award-fee incentive  and performance or delivery incentives when the award fee or  incentive is based solely on factors other than cost. The contract type  remains firm-fixed-price when used with these incentives.  a. Cost-plus-incentive-fee is a cost-reimbursement contract that  provides for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula  based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.  This contract type specifies a target cost, a target fee, minimum and  maximum fees, and a fee adjustment formula. After contract  performance, a fee payable to the contractor is determined in  accordance with the formula. The formula provides, within limits, for  increases in the fee above the target fee when total allowable costs are  less than target costs, and decreases in the fee below the target fee  when total allowable costs exceed target costs. This increase or  decrease is intended to provide an incentive for the contractor to  manage the contract effectively. When total allowable cost is greater  than or less than the range of costs within which the fee-adjustment  formula operates, the contractor is paid total allowable costs, plus the  minimum or maximum fee.  b. Fixed-price incentive contract is a fixed-price contract that provides  for adjusting profit and establishing a final contract price by  application of a formula based on the relationship of total final  negotiated cost to the total target cost. The final price is subject to a  price ceiling, negotiated at the outset. There are two types of fixed- price incentive contracts\u2014firm target and successive target contracts.  a. Cost-plus-award-fee is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides  for a fee consisting of (a) a base amount fixed at inception of the  contract, and (b) an award amount that the contractor may earn in  whole or in part during performance and that is sufficient to provide  motivation for excellence in such areas as quality, timeliness, technical  ingenuity, and cost-effective management. The amount of the award  fee to be paid is determined by the government\u2019s judgmental  evaluation of the contractor\u2019s performance in terms of the criteria  stated in the contract. This determination and methodology for  determining the award fee are unilateral decisions made solely at the  discretion of the government.  b. Fixed-price contracts with award fees (FP-AF), a fixed price  consisting of all estimated costs and profit is established at contract  award along with an additional, separate award fee amount. The fixed  price is paid for satisfactory performance; the award fee, if any, is  earned, for performance beyond that required. Procurement officer  approval is required for this type of contract. FP-AF combinations are  used when the government, although wanting to provide an incentive  to the contractor to deliver at an excellent or outstanding technical  level, is unable to define that level in quantitative terms, or when  metrics are not available or their use is not practical.  4.  Cost-plus-fixed-fee is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for  payment to the contractor of a negotiated fee that is fixed at the  inception of the contract. The fixed fee does not vary with actual cost,  but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed  under the contract. This contract type permits contracting for efforts  that might otherwise present too great a risk to contractors, but it  provides the contractor only a minimum incentive to control costs.  a. Fixed-price redetermination provides for both a firm fixed price for  an initial period of contract deliveries or performance, and prospective  redetermination, at a stated time or times during performance, of the  price for subsequent periods of performance.  b. Fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment provide for  upward and downward revision of the stated contract price upon the  occurrence of specified contingencies. Economic price adjustments  are of three general types: adjustments based on established prices,  adjustments based on actual costs of labor or material, and  adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or materials.  c. Cost, or cost-no-fee, is a contract where the contractor is  reimbursed allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs but receives no  fee. Generally, cost contracts are used for research and development  work performed by nonprofits and educational institutions, for  facilities contracts, and for research and development or production  contracts with for-profit contracts when they expect to derive some  commercial benefit from the contracts. These contracts provide little  incentive to the institution or contractor to control costs.  d. Cost-sharing contracts are cost-reimbursement contracts in which  the contractor receives no fee and is reimbursed only for an agreed- upon portion of its allowable costs.  e. Labor-hour contracts are a variation of the time-and-materials  contract, differing only in that materials are not supplied by the  contractor.  f. Time-and-materials contracts provide for acquiring supplies or  services on the basis of (a) direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly  rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative  expenses, and profit, and (b) actual cost for materials.  g. Other is a designation for any other contract types that are not  separately listed in the NASA annual procurement report. It is not a  federal acquisition regulation-recognized contract type.  h. Combination is not a separate contract type; it notes that a  particular contract consists of more than one contract type, e.g., a  cost-plus-award-fee contract and a cost-incentive-fee contract.  6.  Grant is an award of financial assistance, including cooperative  agreements, in the form of money or property in lieu of money, by the  federal government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include  technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or  other assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan grantees,  interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term  does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum  award, which the grantee is not required to account for."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the United States Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Carla Lewis, Assistant Director;  Francine DelVecchio; Lisa M.
