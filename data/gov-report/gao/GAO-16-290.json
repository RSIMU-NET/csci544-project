However, for certain program areas and individual programs, budget estimates changed more significantly than the overall estimates. NNSA's modernization efforts occur in four areas under the Weapons Activities appropriation account: stockpile; infrastructure; research, development, testing, and evaluation; and other weapons activities. For the stockpile area, budget estimates over 25 years increased by 13.2 percent over the nominal values in the Fiscal Year 2015 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan . Within the stockpile area, the estimates for life extension programs (LEP), which refurbish nuclear weapons, increased by 19.6 percent compared with the prior year's estimate, in part because of changes in the scope and schedule for some programs. In contrast, estimates for the other weapon activities area decreased by 18.1 percent, mainly because NNSA shifted two counterterrorism programs out of the Weapons Activities budget and into NNSA's separate Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation budget.", "The estimates in NNSA's 2016 nuclear security budget materials may not align with all elements of modernization plans for several reasons. First, the Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan includes estimates for 2021 through 2025 that are $4.4 billion higher than the same time period in a set of out-year projections for funding levels that were included in a joint report by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy. NNSA noted this issue in the 2016 plan and stated that it will need to be addressed as part of fiscal year 2017 programming. In addition, in some years, NNSA's budget estimates for certain weapons refurbishment efforts are below the low point of the programs' internally developed cost ranges. For example, the W88 Alteration 370 budget estimate of $218 million for 2020 was below the low end of the internal program cost range of $247 million. NNSA officials stated that the total estimates for this program are above the total of the midpoint cost estimates for 2016 through 2020 and that funding for 2016 to 2019 is fungible and could be carried over to cover any potential shortfall in 2020. GAO also identified instances where certain modernization costs were not included in the estimates or may be underestimated, or where budget estimates for some efforts could increase due to their dependency on successful execution of other NNSA programs. For example, an NNSA official said that budget estimates for the IW-1 LEP\u2014which is NNSA's first interoperable ballistic missile warhead LEP\u2014are predicated on NNSA successfully modernizing its plutonium pit production capacity. This official stated that if there are delays in modernizing this capacity, the IW-1 LEP could bear greater costs than currently estimated. In August 2015, GAO recommended that NNSA provide more transparency with regard to shortfalls in its budget materials. NNSA agreed and said that it plans to implement this recommendation starting in its 2017 budget supporting documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report.

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\u2014a separately  organized agency within the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014is responsible  for designing, producing, and maintaining the country\u2019s nuclear weapon  stockpile. This work is largely executed at eight government-owned,  contractor-operated sites, collectively known as the nuclear security  enterprise. Since 1992, the United States has observed a moratorium on  underground testing of nuclear weapons and has shifted from producing  new nuclear weapons to maintaining the stockpile through refurbishment.  The United States has also experienced a decline in the condition of its  weapon production infrastructure. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review\u2014 which outlines U.S. nuclear policy, strategy, capabilities, and force  posture\u2014identified long-term modernization goals, including sustaining a  secure and effective nuclear arsenal through the life extension of existing  nuclear weapons; increasing investments to rebuild and modernize the  nation\u2019s nuclear infrastructure; and strengthening the science, technology,  and engineering base. To meet these modernization goals, NNSA is  refurbishing nuclear weapons in the stockpile through alterations and life  extension programs (LEP); replacing or renovating decades-old  weapons-related facilities; conducting simulations and laboratory  experiments to ensure that existing weapons remain safe and reliable;  and recruiting and training personnel with the specialized skills to sustain  the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program and maintain the stockpile.", "In addition to NNSA, two other organizations are responsible for the  nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program. First, the Department of Defense  (DOD) is responsible for implementing the U.S. nuclear deterrent  strategy, which includes establishing the military requirements associated  with planning for the stockpile. Second, the Nuclear Weapons Council,  which is composed of representatives from DOD and DOE, facilitates  high-level coordination to secure, maintain, and sustain the nuclear  weapons stockpile.", "NNSA\u2019s modernization plans and the budget estimates to implement  these plans are described in two key policy documents, updated annually,  that together comprise NNSA\u2019s nuclear security budget materials. First,  NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan is the agency\u2019s  formal means of communicating to Congress information on  modernization and operations plans and budget estimates over the next  25 years. Second, NNSA\u2019s annual justification of the President\u2019s budget  request provides program information and budget estimates for the next 5  years. This 5-year plan is called the Future-Years Nuclear Security  Program, and the budget estimates in this plan are the basis for the  funding levels approved by the Office of Management and Budget. These  estimates are identical to those presented in the first 5 years of the  Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. To implement NNSA\u2019s  modernization plans, the agency\u2019s February 2015 justification of the  President\u2019s budget request included about $47.2 billion for 2016 through  2020, of which about $8.8 billion was for 2016. In addition to these  documents, DOD and DOE together produce a third, integrated document  on plans for the nuclear deterrent that includes information on DOD and  DOE\u2019s modernization budget estimates. This annual report, which DOD  and DOE are required to submit jointly to the relevant Senate and House  committees and subcommittees, is referred to as the section 1043 report  or the DOD-DOE joint report.The report is to address, among other  things, the plan for the nuclear weapons stockpile and its delivery  systems, and is to include a 10-year range of modernization budget  estimates.", "NNSA\u2019s 2016 budget consists of four appropriations accounts: (1)  Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, (2) Naval Reactors, (3) Federal  Salaries and Expenses, and (4) Weapons Activities. NNSA\u2019s activities in  the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan are funded by the  Weapons Activities appropriation account. The Future-Years Nuclear  Security Program also includes information on all of NNSA\u2019s  appropriations accounts.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 contains a  provision that GAO study and report annually on whether NNSA\u2019s nuclear  security budget materials provide for funding that is sufficient to  modernize and refurbish the nuclear security enterprise as well as  recapitalize its infrastructure. This is the fifth year we have undertaken  work in response to this provision. This report assesses (1) the extent to  which NNSA\u2019s budget estimates and plans for modernization activities  reflected in its fiscal year 2016 nuclear security budget materials differ, if  at all, from those in its fiscal year 2015 budget materials and (2) the  extent to which the fiscal year 2016 nuclear security budget materials  align with modernization plans as presented in the Stockpile Stewardship  and Management Plan.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed NNSA\u2019s 2016 budget  materials, specifically for its Weapons Activities appropriation account.  This scope is consistent with that of our August 2015 review. We  focused our review on major modernization efforts\u2014that is, refurbishment  of nuclear weapons through LEPs and alterations and major construction  efforts to replace aging facilities for plutonium and uranium. To determine  the extent to which NNSA\u2019s budget estimates and plans for modernization  activities differed from those in the 2015 budget materials, we compared  the information in the 2016 budget materials with the information in the  2015 materials. We also interviewed agency officials to discuss changes  in the materials from 2015 to 2016. To determine the extent to which  NNSA\u2019s budget materials align with its modernization plans, we compared  information on the budget estimates in the 2016 budget materials with the  information on modernization plans in the same documents. We also  interviewed NNSA officials to obtain further information on changes to  modernization plans and discussed any perceived misalignments with  them.", "All figures in the report are presented in nominal, or current, dollars,  which include projected inflation, unless otherwise noted. To assess the  reliability of the data underlying NNSA\u2019s budget estimates, we reviewed  the data to identify missing items, outliers, or obvious errors; interviewed  NNSA officials knowledgeable about the data; and compared the figures  in the congressional budget justification with those in the Fiscal Year  2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan to assess the extent  to which they were consistent. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes, which were to report the total  amount of budget estimates and those estimates dedicated to certain  programs and budgets and to compare them to last year\u2019s estimates. All  years are in fiscal years, unless otherwise noted.

NNSA  allocates funds to activities that directly support the stockpile area  through Directed Stockpile Work within the Weapons Activities  appropriation account.", "The infrastructure area includes government-owned, leased, and  permitted physical infrastructure and facilities supporting weapons  activities. NNSA\u2019s 2016 nuclear security budget materials include  information on two major types of infrastructure activities: (1)  Infrastructure and Safety and (2) Readiness in Technical Base and  Facilities, which includes two major construction projects. First, the  Uranium Processing Facility is a construction project to replace  enriched uranium capabilities currently located in the aging Building  9212 at the Y-12 National Security Complex. This project is part of a  larger strategy to maintain NNSA\u2019s enriched uranium capability by  relocating enriched uranium operations performed in Building 9212  into other existing buildings by 2025 and by constructing a series of  smaller buildings. Second, the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research  Replacement construction project at Los Alamos National  Laboratory, which is part of NNSA\u2019s broader plutonium infrastructure  strategy, is composed of subprojects to move analytical chemistry and  materials characterization capabilities into two existing facilities.  NNSA\u2019s broader plutonium infrastructure strategy also includes the  construction of at least two additional modular structures that the  Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan  reports will achieve operating capacity by 2027. The Uranium  Processing Facility and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research  Replacement construction projects are both part of NNSA\u2019s major  modernization efforts.", "The research, development, testing, and evaluation area is  composed of programs that are technically challenging, multiyear,  multifunctional efforts to develop and maintain critical science and  engineering capabilities. These capabilities enable the annual  assessment of the safety and reliability of the stockpile, improve  understanding of the physics and materials science associated with  nuclear weapons, and support the development of code-based  models that replace underground testing.", "The other weapons activities area includes budget estimates  associated with nuclear weapon security and transportation, as well  as legacy contractor pensions, among other things.", "The four areas are interconnected. For example, experiments funded  under the research, development, testing, and evaluation program area  can contribute to the design and production of refurbished weapons,  which is funded under the stockpile program area. The infrastructure  program area offers critical support to both the stockpile and the  research, development, testing, and evaluation program areas by  providing a suitable environment for their various activities, such as  producing weapons components and performing research and  experimentation activities.", "The U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile is composed of seven different  weapons types, including air-delivered bombs, ballistic missile warheads,  and cruise missile warheads (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Budget Estimates and Plans for Modernization Differed Little from the Previous Year\u2019s, but Certain Programs Changed to a Greater Degree", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s 2016 budget estimates for modernization total $297.6 billion over  25 years, which is a slight increase from the 2015 estimates of $293.4  billion; however, for certain program areas or individual programs, budget  estimates changed more significantly. The overall increase was  moderated by a shift of two counterterrorism programs to another area of  NNSA\u2019s budget. Program areas increased by as much as 13.2 percent or  decreased by as much as 18.1 percent.

These budget estimates,  which are for activities in the Weapons Activities area, are provided in the  four areas discussed above: stockpile; infrastructure; research,  development, testing, and evaluation; and other weapons activities. The  overall increase was moderated by the shift of two counterterrorism  programs from the Weapons Activities budget into NNSA\u2019s separate  Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation budget. The two counterterrorism  programs that were moved out of the Weapons Activities budget together  totaled approximately $8 billion. According to NNSA\u2019s 2016 budget  justification, this realignment is intended to provide greater clarity  regarding the total funding and level of activity in the counterterrorism  area. The realignment of these programs, along with other smaller  decreases in the other weapons activities category, together accounted  for an 18.1 percent decrease in the other weapons activities category  during the 25-year period covered by the plan. Without the realignment of  the two counterterrorism programs, the increase in NNSA\u2019s overall  Weapons Activities budget in the 2016 plan would have been  considerably larger, totaling approximately $12.3 billion, or 4.2 percent,  over the 2015 Weapons Activities budget.

Part of this increase resulted from  the addition of approximately $3 billion to support the Domestic Uranium  Enrichment program, as well as increases in estimates for weapons  refurbishment activities, particularly LEPs, as discussed later in this  report. The 2016 budget materials indicate a decrease of approximately  $1.8 billion for infrastructure activities during the next 25 years, compared  with the 2015 estimates, in part because of reductions in recapitalization  and site operation budget estimates. The 2016 budget materials  increased proposed spending on research, development, testing, and  evaluation activities by approximately $900 million during the same  period.

To support this replacement, NNSA  shifted planned spending for other programs\u2014including $15.1 million  originally planned for the W76-1 LEP\u2014toward this effort. The Fiscal  Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan reported that  the agency also shifted planned spending intended for surveillance of  B61 and B83 bombs into the conventional high explosive replacement  effort. The Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management  Plan estimated the total cost for the W88 Alteration 370 at $2 billion  over the 25-year period covered by the plan, while the 2015 plan  estimated the total cost at $1.2 billion, for an increase of  approximately $0.8 billion.", "The cruise missile warhead LEP (renamed the W80-4 LEP) now has a  first production unit planned for 2025\u20142 years earlier than the first  production unit in the 2015 plan.

The Fiscal Year 2015 Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan included a line for budget estimates for this project;  however, the estimates were zero for each year except for 2012. The  2015 plan included budget estimates that totaled $3.1 billion in the  program readiness subcategory under the infrastructure category, which  NNSA officials stated were ultimately intended for the Chemistry and  Metallurgy Research Replacement construction project. In the Fiscal Year  2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, NNSA shifted $1.7  billion in planned spending out of program readiness and into the  construction project\u2019s line item, also under the infrastructure category.  This shift appears to be an increase in the total amount for major  construction activities in the 2016 budget materials. However, as noted  above, the overall total for infrastructure declined slightly, in part because  NNSA officials said that they determined that the remainder of the $3.1  billion from program readiness is not required to support the project.  Nevertheless, the $1.7 billion reported in the Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan is $214 million lower than the total  estimates that NNSA reported in its 2016 congressional budget  justification, which included a more detailed construction project data  sheet for the project.

In August  2015, we found that NNSA\u2019s infrastructure budget estimates were not  adequate to address its deferred maintenance backlog and that the  backlog would continue to grow. We recommended that in instances  where budget estimates do not achieve DOE benchmarks for  maintenance and recapitalization investment over the 5-year budget  estimates, NNSA identify in the budget materials the amount of the  shortfall and the effects, if any, on the deferred maintenance backlog. We  also recommended that until improved data about the importance of  facilities and infrastructure to mission are available, NNSA clarify in the  budget materials for the Future-Years Nuclear Security Program the  amount of the deferred maintenance backlog that is associated with  facilities that have little to no effect on programmatic operations and is  therefore low priority to be addressed. NNSA concurred with our  recommendations. Specifically, NNSA agreed to include more information  on maintenance, recapitalization, and deferred maintenance on excess  facilities and stated that it will address them in the 2017 budget request or  budget support materials as appropriate.

The Directed Stockpile Work  category in the plan and in the 2016 Future-Years Nuclear Security  Program contain detailed budget information on weapon refurbishment  efforts that includes specific budget estimates for each effort as well as  high and low cost ranges that NNSA developed for them. For each  effort, we assessed the extent to which the budget estimates aligned with  its high-low cost estimates. Specifically, we examined instances where  the low end of the cost range estimates was greater than the budget  estimates.", "We found that the annual budget estimates are generally consistent with  NNSA\u2019s internal cost estimates; that is, in most years, the annual budget  estimates for each weapon refurbishment effort fall within the high and  low cost ranges that NNSA developed for each program. However, in  some years, NNSA\u2019s budget estimates for some refurbishment efforts  may not align with modernization plans. Specifically, for some years, the  low end of cost ranges that NNSA developed for some LEPs exceeds the  budget estimates. This indicates potential misalignment between plans  and budget estimates for those programs in those years, or the possible  need for NNSA to increase budget estimates for those programs in the  future. For instance, see the following:", "The B61-12 LEP\u2019s budget estimates during the 5-year period covered  by the Future-Years Nuclear Security Program align with plans.", "However, the low cost range estimate of $195 million for the final year  of production in 2025 exceeds the budget estimate of $64 million.  NNSA officials said that this difference is not a concern because this  misalignment occurs during the final year of the LEP effort and this  estimate may overstate costs for the end of B61-12 program.", "The W88 Alteration 370\u2019s low cost range estimate exceeds its budget  estimate for 2020. The budget materials report that the program\u2019s  budget estimate that year is $218 million; however, the low point of  the cost range is $247 million. NNSA officials stated that this is not a  concern because there is flexibility to address possible misalignments  in future programming cycles. NNSA officials also stated that the total  estimates for this program are above the total of the midpoint cost  estimates for 2016 through 2020 and that funding for 2016 to 2019 is  fungible and could be carried over to cover any potential shortfall in  2020.", "The W80-4 LEP\u2019s low range cost estimate of $476 million exceeds its  budget estimates of $459 million for 2020. NNSA officials stated that  because the budget estimates for this LEP are above the low point of  its estimated cost range during other years, the misalignment in 2020  represents a small incongruity in an otherwise sound LEP profile.", "The budget estimates for the IW-1 LEP are within the high and low  estimated cost ranges for most years. However, the IW-1\u2019s low cost  range estimate of $175 million exceeds its budget estimate of $113  million in 2020, which is its first year of funding. NNSA officials said  that by shifting funding projected for 2021 to 2020, the IW-1 budget  estimates would still be within the cost ranges.", "For the W76-1 LEP, we compared the budget estimates in the 2016  Future-Years Nuclear Security Program and the Fiscal Year 2016  Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan with internal cost estimates  NNSA developed for the LEP. We found that the budget estimates for all  years within the Future-Years Nuclear Security Program, except for 2018,  are below NNSA\u2019s internal cost estimates for that program, raising  questions about whether the budget for the LEP is aligned with  anticipated costs. According to NNSA officials, the W76-1 LEP is nearing  completion, and the model used to develop internal cost estimates for the  W76-1 is predicting the LEP\u2019s end-of-program costs in a way that may not  reflect the rate at which the program winds down. For more information  on the LEPs and their budget estimates and cost ranges in the Fiscal  Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, see appendix II.", "NNSA officials stated that the intent in providing budget estimates and  cost range estimates for each weapon refurbishment effort is to show  general agreement between the two sets of estimates. Notwithstanding  the differences we identified between budget estimates and low-end cost  range estimates for certain efforts in certain years, NNSA officials stated  that the budget estimates and the cost range estimates are in general  agreement for each LEP and alteration in terms of total costs and trend.  In addition, NNSA officials stated that there is some flexibility in the  funding for these efforts, and that the programs may carry over some  funds from one year to the next if needed to cover costs, depending on  the reason for the misalignment, among other things.", "In our August 2015 report on NNSA\u2019s nuclear security budget materials,  we found that not including information that identifies potential  misalignments in LEP budget estimates compared with the LEP internal  cost estimates can potentially pose risks to the achievement of program  objectives and goals, such as increase in program costs and schedule  delays. NNSA agreed with our recommendation from that report to  provide more transparency with regard to shortfalls in its budget  materials. Specifically, NNSA said that it would include, as appropriate,  statements in future Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plans on  the effect of funding an LEP effort at less than suggested by a planning  estimate cost range.

The budget estimates for the refresh reported in the  2016 budget materials are roughly $300 million less than the refresh  requires. Officials told us that the initial budget planning for the refresh  contained a cost of approximately $500 million. However, NNSA  found that this estimate was incorrect and increased it to  approximately $800 million. NNSA officials stated that this project is  still in the process of establishing a new, official baseline, which  officials expect to complete in 2016.", "The 2016 budget materials may not contain all necessary costs for  NNSA\u2019s efforts to maintain its enriched uranium capability, which  include relocating select operations performed in Building 9212 to  other existing buildings and constructing a series of smaller buildings.  Specifically, NNSA officials stated that the budget estimates in the  2016 budget materials for these efforts do not include the costs  associated with infrastructure upgrades (such as ceiling repairs and  heating, air conditioning, and other controls systems) in two existing  buildings at the Y-12 site. NNSA officials stated that the scope to  maintain operations in the existing facilities is being developed and  prioritized into a multiyear effort among multiple programs, separate  from the Uranium Processing Facility project. According to another  NNSA official, these costs were still under development, but the  official estimated that the upgrades may cost tens of millions of dollars  for each building.", "The costs of the plutonium infrastructure strategy\u2014in which NNSA is  currently preparing to move analytical chemistry and materials  characterization capabilities into existing facilities as part of the  Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement construction project  while also considering constructing new modular buildings under a  separate project\u2014are also uncertain and possibly underestimated.  This uncertainty is due to the fact that NNSA has not yet determined  the number of additional modular buildings that may be required,  although the Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan calls for at least two. NNSA officials also stated  that estimated costs for these efforts have not yet been baselined and  that the cost of such a project cannot be estimated with any certainty  until it has proceeded further into the planning process and  established a baseline.", "In addition to some costs not being included in budget estimates, the  estimates for some NNSA modernization efforts could increase in the  future because of their dependency on successful execution of other  NNSA programs. Specifically, NNSA managers for the LEPs stated that  some of these programs could incur future cost increases or schedule  delays because of other NNSA programs supporting the LEPs. For  instance, NNSA officials told us that the W80-4 LEP will require a new  insensitive high explosive to support the system. This is because the B61- 12 LEP is consuming the currently available stocks of insensitive high  explosive. As a result, NNSA is developing a new insensitive high  explosive to meet the needs of the W80-4 LEP. However, NNSA officials  told us that the performance of the new explosive currently being  produced is not comparable to the quality of existing explosive being  consumed by the B61-12 LEP. Consequently, these officials stated that  the costs of the W80-4 LEP could rise because of additional funding that  may be required to further develop the new explosive. The Fiscal Year  2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan notes that as design  options are down selected, the budget estimate for the W80-4 may shift in  response.", "An NNSA official also stated that the IW-1 LEP budget estimates in the  2016 budget materials are predicated on NNSA successfully modernizing  its plutonium pit production capacity. The official stated that if there are  delays in the current plutonium infrastructure strategy, the IW-1 LEP will  bear costs that are greater than currently estimated to produce the  number of additional plutonium pits it needs to support the program. The  Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan notes that  estimates for programs in their earlier stages, such as the IW-1 LEP, are  subject to uncertainty.

NNSA\u2019s nuclear security budget  materials are composed of two key policy documents that are issued  annually: the agency\u2019s budget justification, which contains estimates for  the 5-year Future-Years Nuclear Security Program, and the Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan, which provides budget estimates  over the next 25 years.

According to DOE officials, for all  LEPs besides the W76-1, DOE uses two different approaches to estimate  the costs of LEPs. Under the first approach, according to officials, DOE  develops specific budget estimates by year through a \u201cbottom-up\u201d  process. DOE officials describe this as a detailed approach to developing  the LEP budget estimates, which, among other things, integrates  resource and schedule information from site participants. Under the  second approach, which DOE refers to as a \u201ctop-down\u201d process, DOE  uses historical LEP cost data and complexity factors to project high and  low cost ranges for each LEP distributed over the life of the program  using an accepted cost distribution method. Officials noted that the values  in these cost ranges reflect idealized funding profiles and do not account  for the practical constraints of the programming and budgeting cycle. For  the W76-1 LEP, DOE has developed specific budget estimates by year.", "Because the W76-1 LEP is the basis of DOE\u2019s top-down model, DOE  does not develop high and low cost ranges for it. Instead, DOE published  the W76-1 LEP estimates in the Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship  and Management Plan as a comparison between the Future-Years  Nuclear Security Program request and a single LEP model line. For the  W76-1 LEP, we compared the budget estimates with the LEP model line.", "For all LEPs besides the W76-1, we assessed the extent to which the  specific bottom-up budget estimates were aligned with the high-low cost  ranges developed through the top-down model. Specifically, we examined  where the specific budget estimates were under the low end of the cost  range predicted by the top-down model. We did this by reviewing charts  in the Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan and  the underlying data for those charts. In instances where the low cost  range exceeded the budget estimates, we followed up with NNSA officials  for additional information.", "To assess the reliability of the data underlying NNSA\u2019s budget estimates,  we reviewed the data to identify missing items, outliers, or obvious errors;  interviewed NNSA officials knowledgeable about the data; and compared  the figures in the congressional budget justification with those in the  Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan to assess  the extent to which they were consistent.
