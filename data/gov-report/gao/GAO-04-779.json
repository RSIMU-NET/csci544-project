As a result, Navy inventory worth millions of dollars is vulnerable to fraud, waste, or abuse. First, Navy repair contractors are not acknowledging receipt of government-furnished material from the Navy's supply system. Although a DOD procedure states that contractors will notify the military services' inventory control points once material is received, Naval Inventory Control Point officials are not requiring its repair contractors to do so. Consequently, the Naval Inventory Control Point is not adhering to another DOD procedure that requires the military services to follow up with repair contractors within 45 days when the receipts for items are not confirmed. Naval Inventory Control Point officials stated that receipting for government-furnished material, which is earmarked for immediate consumption in the repair of another item, might overstate the inventory levels in their inventory management system. Without material receipt notification, the Naval Inventory Control Point cannot be assured that its repair contractors have received the material. For fiscal year 2002, the most recent and complete data available at the time of GAO's review, the Naval Inventory Control Point reported that 4,229 government-furnished material shipments (representing 4,301 items value at approximately $115 million) had been shipped to its repair contractors. GAO randomly selected and examined 308 government-furnished material shipments, representing 344 items that were shipped to the Navy's repair contractors. Based on this random sample, GAO estimated that 50 unclassified items may be unaccounted for, with a value of about $729,000 in aircraft-related government-furnished material. Additionally, the Naval Inventory Control Point does not send quarterly reports on the status of government-furnished material shipped to its repair contractors to the Defense Contract Management Agency. DOD and Navy procedures require that the Naval Inventory Control Point generate and distribute quarterly reports on government-furnished material shipped to repair contractors, including information on total shipments and their dollar value, number of shipments for which receipts are unknown, and rejected requisitions to the Defense Contract Management Agency. Although there are a number of DOD and Navy procedures that outline this reporting requirement, the Naval Inventory Control Point officials responsible for implementing this procedure were unaware of the requirement. The Naval Inventory Control Point lacks procedures to ensure that these reports are generated and distributed to the Defense Contract Management Agency. Without the reports, the Defense Contract Management Agency may be unable to independently verify that the Navy repair contractors have accounted for all government-furnished material shipped to them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As we have reported in a number of our products, the lack of control over  inventory shipments increases vulnerability to undetected loss or theft and  substantially increases the risk that millions of dollars will be spent  unnecessarily.

In some  cases, the Navy furnishes the material necessary to perform the repairs at  the contractors\u2019 locations. Responsibility for controlling this material is  shared among the Naval Supply Command, the Naval Inventory Control  Point, the Defense Logistics Agency, repair contractors, and the Defense  Contract Management Agency. The Naval Supply Command administers  the Navy\u2019s supply system and provides inventory management policies and  procedures. The Naval Inventory Control Point procures, manages, and  supplies inventory for naval aircraft, submarines, and ships worldwide.  The Defense Contract Management Agency assesses the accuracy of repair  contractor records and accounts for all government property furnished to  a contractor.", "Our objective was to determine whether the Naval Inventory Control Point  and its repair contractors adhere to DOD and Navy inventory management  control procedures governing the accountability for and visibility of  shipped government-furnished material. We did not review the Navy  inventory management control procedures for items needing repair that  are provided to Navy contractors because of a recent June 2003 DOD  Office of the Inspector General report. While the Inspector General\u2019s  report indicated that the Navy had taken actions to improve its procedures  and controls to account for these items at commercial repair facilities, it  found that additional improvements were needed to improve the  monitoring and oversight of shipped inventory.", "To assess the Naval Inventory Control Point\u2019s and its repair contractors\u2019  adherence to DOD and Navy inventory management control procedures  related to government-furnished material shipped to repair contractors,  we randomly selected and examined 308 government-furnished material  shipments. These shipments represented 344 items that were shipped to  Navy repair contractors in fiscal year 2002, the most recent and complete  data available at the time of our review. We sent surveys to 29 Navy repair  contractors requesting data on these unclassified, classified, and sensitive  shipments valued at about $11.9 million. We received survey responses  from 20 of the 29 contractors, representing 207 government-furnished  material shipments (corresponding to 243 items). Our review focused on  the Naval Inventory Control Point facility located in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, which manages aircraft-related inventory. We assessed the  reliability of the data used in this report and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted our review from March 2003 through April 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

With prior approval from Naval  Inventory Control Point item managers, Navy repair contractors can also  use material located at their facilities. DOD procedures and Federal  Acquisition Regulation procedures generally require that repair  contractors establish and maintain an internal property control system for  the control, use, maintenance, repair, protection, and preservation of  government property in their possession.", "The Navy currently has 359 repair contractors using its Web-based  inventory management system, known as the DOD Commercial Asset  Visibility System. This system provides the Navy with asset reporting  coverage for more than 95 percent of its commercial repair business.", "For fiscal year 2002, the most recent and complete data available at the  time of our review, the Naval Inventory Control Point reported that 4,229  government-furnished material shipments (representing 4,301 items valued  at approximately $115 million) had been shipped to its repair contractors.  Table 1 shows the derivation of the sample size of our survey, including  the number and value of shipments for which we received survey  responses.", "DOD requires the Navy to use a number of procedures to monitor items  shipped to and received by repair contractors. First, the recipient of the  material is responsible for notifying the Naval Inventory Control Point  once an item has been received. If the Naval Inventory Control Point has  not been provided a receipt within 45 days of shipment, it is required to  follow up with the intended recipient. The rationale behind these  requirements is that until receipt is confirmed, the exact status of the  shipment is uncertain and therefore vulnerable to fraud, waste, or abuse.  The Naval Inventory Control Point is also required by DOD and Navy  procedures to submit quarterly reports to the Defense Contract  Management Agency identifying all government-furnished material that  has been provided to a contractor. These reports allow the Defense  Contract Management Agency to independently verify that Navy repair  contractors have accounted for all government-furnished material shipped  to them. As a result, the Defense Contract Management Agency does not  have to rely strictly on records provided by Navy repair contractors.", "In addition to these DOD and Navy procedures, the Navy, as a  representative of the federal government, is also obligated to establish and  maintain effective internal control systems. The Federal Managers\u2019  Financial Integrity Act of 1982 requires the General Accounting Office to  issue standards for internal control in government. According to these  standards, internal control is defined as an integral component of an  organization\u2019s management that provides reasonable assurance that the  following objectives are being achieved: (1) effectiveness and efficiency of  operations, (2) reliability of financial reporting, and (3) compliance with  applicable laws and regulations. A subset of these objectives is the  safeguarding of assets. Internal control should be designed to provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention of or prompt detection of  unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency\u2019s assets.  Effective and efficient internal control activities help ensure that an  agency\u2019s control objectives are accomplished. The control activities are  the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce  management\u2019s directives, such as the process of adhering to DOD  requirements for receipt of government-furnished material and issuance of  quarterly government-furnished material status reports.", "DOD annually ships inventory valued at billions of dollars to various  locations around the world. For years, DOD has had difficulty tracking this  inventory from origin to destination. The accountability problem with  shipped inventory is part of a more global issue. Since at least 1990, we  have considered DOD\u2019s inventory management to be a high-risk area  because DOD\u2019s inventory management procedures are ineffective. The  lack of adequate controls over shipped inventory and the resulting  vulnerability to undetected loss or theft have been major areas of concern.  In March 1999, we reported that significant weaknesses existed at all  levels of the Navy\u2019s shipped inventory management structure, leading to  potential theft or undetected losses of items and demonstrating inefficient  and ineffective logistics management practices. We concluded that these  weaknesses and the problems they created were primarily a result of the  Navy not following its own procedures regarding controls over shipped  inventory. In following up with the Navy, we found that the Navy had  implemented many of our recommendations that have improved the  accountability over its shipped inventory. According to Naval Inventory  Control Point officials, at least 75 percent of their shipped inventory  discrepancies have been resolved. Also, according to a June 2003 DOD  Office of the Inspector General report, the Navy had taken actions to  improve its procedures and controls to account for items repaired at  commercial repair facilities.

They indicated that the Naval  Inventory Control Point does not require its repair contractors to  acknowledge receipt of government-furnished material because such  material is provided with the expectation that it will immediately be  consumed in the repair of other items. Naval Inventory Control Point  officials also stated that submitting notification of receipt for this material  might overstate the inventory levels in the DOD Commercial Asset  Visibility System\u2014the Navy\u2019s inventory management system\u2014because the  system would show this material as on-hand at its repair contractors\u2019  facilities when the material is actually earmarked for immediate use in the  repair of another item.", "We have noted the Naval Inventory Control Point officials\u2019 concerns about  the potential for notification of receipt of government-furnished material  to overstate inventory levels. However, one of the Navy repair contractors  in our review currently uses the DOD Commercial Asset Visibility System  to enter receipt of government-furnished material, without overstating the  inventory levels maintained within the system. Specifically, the Navy  repair contractor is using a standard module of the DOD Commercial  Asset Visibility System to enter receipt of material received in usable  condition from the Navy\u2019s supply system. Upon entering a receipt of  material in the system, the contractor then issues the item to itself for  immediate use in the repair of another item. This process eliminates the  possibility of adverse impacts to inventory levels. However, the Naval  Inventory Control Point is not using this module of the DOD Commercial  Asset Visibility System for the receipt of material received in usable  condition.
