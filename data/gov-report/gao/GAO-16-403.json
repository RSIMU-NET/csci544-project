VA reported spending approximately $3.9 billion in 2015 and received appropriations of approximately $4.1 billion in 2016 to improve and maintain its IT resources. Even as the department has engaged in various attempts to improve its IT management capabilities, GAO has issued numerous reports that highlighted challenges in its efforts.", "This study was to determine (1) how VA is organized to manage and perform key IT-related functions and the extent to which it has centralized the management of IT resources, (2) the extent to which VA has implemented effective IT human capital management, and (3) the extent to which VA has established key processes to effectively manage major system development and acquisition efforts. To conduct its study, GAO reviewed VA policies, procedures, and other documentation and compared the department's processes to best practices for human capital management and IT systems development and acquisition. GAO also interviewed VA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) performs key information technology (IT)-related functions, such as leadership, strategic planning, systems development and acquisition, and systems operations and maintenance, largely through its centralized Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), led by the Chief Information Officer (CIO). VA's two IT governance boards are intended to play a role in other key functions, such as investment management. Nevertheless, the department faced challenges in effectively managing IT, including (1) preventing IT activities from occurring outside the control of OI&T, (2) maintaining collaboration between OI&T and business units, and (3) delivering efficient and cost-effective IT capabilities. In response to these and other challenges, the CIO initiated an effort in January 2016 to transform OI&T into a more veteran-focused organization that emphasized transparency, accountability, innovation, and teamwork. The transformation strategy calls for OI&T to stabilize and streamline core processes and platforms, mitigate weaknesses from information security and GAO assessments, and improve outcomes by institutionalizing a new set of IT management capabilities. The CIO intends to complete the transformation by the first quarter of 2017.", "Key to an agency's success in effectively managing its IT systems is sustaining a workforce with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to execute a range of management functions that support its mission and goals. VA took steps to implement effective IT human capital practices by documenting an IT human capital strategic plan and initiating an update based on changed priorities, analyzing workforce data, identifying skill gaps for the current year, and implementing an IT training program. However, OI&T had not consistently implemented all of these practices. Specifically, the office had not (1) tracked and reviewed historical and projected leadership retirements and (2) identified skills and competencies needed beyond the current year. Without annually tracking and reviewing data related to leadership retirements or identifying skills needed in future years, OI&T faces a risk of being unprepared to effectively respond to vacancies in key positions and not having the capabilities to deliver IT support that can contribute to improved services for veterans.", "Key to successful development and acquisition of IT services is establishing documented processes that reflect best practices. Although there were gaps in some areas, VA's processes generally included best practices for project validation, project planning, requirements management, risk management, project monitoring and control, and process and product quality assurance. In addition, processes for developing and maintaining a project schedule had not fully addressed the majority of the associated best practices. Ensuring that these processes address all key practices will assist the department in effectively managing its IT system development and acquisitions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that VA take two actions to assist the department in sustaining a workforce with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to execute its mission and goals, as well as six actions to assist the department in developing comprehensive processes that reflect systems development best practices.

In  September 2013, the VA Inspector General reported that the  department\u2019s Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction had  used $13 million in supply funds, rather than approved IT funds, to  develop a suite of electronic contracting applications to support the  office\u2019s procurement process. Further, the report noted that the  Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction had not used the  department\u2019s IT project management system, PMAS, to develop the  contracting system, although doing so was mandated by the  Secretary in June 2009 for all IT development projects department- wide.", "According to the report, the office followed its own project  management process that was similar to PMAS. However, in doing  so, the system development effort was not subjected to OI&T\u2019s risk  management, monitoring, oversight and control, and reporting  processes within PMAS. According to the report, officials in the Office  of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction incorrectly believed that VA  allowed for a PMAS exception because they had used supply funds,  and not IT funds, for the development. The Inspector General  recommended that the Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and  Construction implement controls to ensure the systems development  project and all future IT development efforts fall within the control and  oversight of the PMAS process. The office concurred with the  recommendation.", "More recently, in March 2015, the Inspector General reported that  VHA had improperly obligated $92.5 million and spent $73.8 million in  medical support and compliance funds, rather than IT funds, to  develop its health care claims processing system through the VHA  Financial Services Center. According to the report, the former VHA  Deputy Chief Business Officer stated that funds and development  services provided through the Financial Services Center were used in  hopes of achieving a faster delivery of the claims processing system.  The Inspector General reported that, by doing so, VHA had avoided  competing with other VA projects for IT systems appropriations. Thus,  the Inspector General recommended that the Under Secretary for  Health obtain the appropriate funding to support the development of  the claims processing system. The interim Under Secretary for Health  concurred with the recommendation and agreed to establish oversight  mechanisms and issue guidance to ensure that VHA uses the  appropriate funds.", "Collaboration between OI&T and business units was not always  effective. In September 2015, challenges with collaboration between  OI&T and VA business units were highlighted by an independent  assessment of VA\u2019s health care delivery systems and management  processes, including health IT processes. Several clinicians  interviewed for that assessment stated that collaboration between  systems developers and clinicians seemed to have disappeared after  the centralization, resulting in uncoordinated execution of health IT  strategies and limited development of new and improved capabilities  for existing IT systems. The assessment noted that although the goals  of OI&T and VHA did not conflict at the strategic level, the  organizations often did not agree on priorities for executing the  strategic plans. The assessment team recommended that VA and  VHA transform IT strategy, planning, and execution by, among other  things, establishing service-level agreements and refining the  planning and budgeting process to ensure that business needs are  effectively identified, prioritized, funded, and used to drive health IT  investments. The team recommended that VA also develop a  governance policy to ensure the strategic plans are executed well and  in a timely manner.", "Similarly, staff within the Office of Finance informed us of their  dissatisfaction because OI&T controls the budget and the priorities for  systems development efforts and IT change management. These staff  stated that OI&T\u2019s priorities do not always align with the needs of the  administrations or other staff offices, thus potentially delaying the  delivery of needed services.", "PMAS limited VA\u2019s efforts to efficiently and cost-effectively  deliver new IT capabilities. The September 2015 independent  assessment also stated that overly demanding processes for system  development, as defined by OI&T\u2019s PMAS, impeded cost-effective  delivery of new health IT capabilities and limited VA\u2019s ability to  measure the value of its investments. The assessment report further  stated that the PMAS process was schedule driven and risk averse,  leading many project managers to limit the amount of functionality in  each release, thereby increasing the total time for any useful  capability to be released. In addition, assessment interviewees  indicated that documentation required by PMAS consumed a  significant percentage of development time. Accordingly, the  assessment team recommended that VA establish product-focused  teams to ensure delivery of needed capabilities to users and that the  department\u2019s system development process be modified from focusing  on documentation and schedule to focusing more on functionality  delivered."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CIO Transformation Strategy Aims to Address Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing challenges in IT management, the CIO initiated an effort in  January 2016 to transform the focus and functions of OI&T.

To  address this challenge, in September 2015, as part of the CIO\u2019s effort to  transform OI&T, VA documented a long-term cybersecurity strategy. This  strategy identified five goals for successfully building a comprehensive  cybersecurity capability: (1) protecting veterans\u2019 information and VA data  by ensuring privacy concerns are addressed and ensuring secure  technology and data systems; (2) providing secure and resilient  information systems technology, business applications, publicly  accessible platforms, and shared data networks; (3) protecting VA  infrastructure and assets, including the boundary environments that  provide potential access and entry into VA; (4) enabling effective  operations by improving governance and organizational alignment at  enterprise, operational, and tactical levels (points of service interactions);  and (5) recruiting and retaining a talented cybersecurity workforce  covering multiple disciplines within cybersecurity.", "As another part of this transformation, the CIO began transitioning the  oversight and accountability of IT projects from PMAS to a new project  management process called the Veteran-focused Integration Process  (VIP) in January 2016, in an effort to better streamline systems  development and speed up the delivery of new IT capabilities. According  to the VIP guide, all systems development projects that touch the VA  network or use money from the IT appropriation will be required to follow  VIP. The CIO intends for VIP to facilitate an expanded use of the Agile  system development methodology resulting in, for example, the delivery  of system functionality on a more frequent, 3-month delivery cycle,  whereas PMAS delivered functionality in 6-month cycles. In addition, VIP  is intended to streamline IT project management by reducing the number  of artifacts (i.e., documentation) that must be developed (from 58 to 8)  and the number of critical decision points (from 5 to 2). According to the  CIO\u2019s transformation strategy, under the new VIP process, OI&T will also  be required to consider security and architecture standards early in  project planning phases, whereas PMAS required this later in the  development process.
