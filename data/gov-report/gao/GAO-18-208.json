Accordingly, the department has  undertaken various efforts to modernize the system, using government  contractors to do so.", "In 2008, and again in 2014, we reported on significant challenges in VA\u2019s  efforts to modernize VistA. Given these longstanding challenges, you  asked us to provide information on the department\u2019s VistA modernization  efforts. Our specific objectives were to (1) identify the efforts that VA has  undertaken to modernize VistA, including key contractors, contract costs,  and expected contractor activities and (2) determine the department\u2019s  current plans for, and progress to date, in modernizing VistA.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed VA documentation, including  the department\u2019s budget submissions and other information compiled  during prior GAO work that examined the department\u2019s initiatives to  modernize VistA. We also obtained documentation from the Veterans  Health Administration (VHA), the major component within the department  tasked with delivering health care services, and VA\u2019s Office of Information  and Technology (OI&T), which oversees the department\u2019s information  technology (IT) acquisitions and operations. This documentation  described contracts, related obligations, and expected contractor  activities for the department\u2019s VistA modernization efforts, from fiscal  years 2011 through 2016\u2014the time period for which data were available.", "In compiling contract data, we included data on awards of new contracts;  modifications to previously awarded contracts; and the issuance of task  orders on indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts. VA was unable  to provide data on VistA modernization contracts prior to fiscal year 2011  because the department\u2019s records retention policy does not require it to  maintain such data. In addition, we did not request contract data  subsequent to fiscal year 2016 because that is the last fiscal year for  which data for a full year was available at the time that we were  performing our analysis. We analyzed the available data to determine the  number of contractors working on the modernization efforts and the  amounts of funding that were obligated to the contracts.", "To determine the key contractors, we first identified all of the contractors  that worked on both modernization efforts for which we received data. We  then ranked the identified contractors according to the total reported  dollars obligated for contracts that each contractor had been awarded.  We designated the top 15 ranked contractors, in terms of dollars  obligated, as key contractors. These 15 key contractors received  contracts that accounted for about two-thirds of the funds obligated to  VistA modernization contracts from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. We  subsequently analyzed the information that VA provided on the work  tasks to be performed by these key contractors to identify obligations  made for contracts to provide different types of work, including  development, project management, and operations and maintenance.", "We assessed the reliability of the contract data we received by reviewing  it for missing elements and outliers. We met with officials responsible for  VistA-related contracting to address questions about any missing data  and outliers, as well as to obtain additional information about how the  data were developed. We supplemented the data by using additional  information received from VA and the Federal Procurement Data  System. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objective.", "To determine current plans for modernizing VistA, we reviewed available  documentation, which included draft program schedules, organization  charts, congressional testimonies of the VA Secretary, a White House  press conference transcript, departmental press releases, and the  department\u2019s justification for awarding a non-competitive contract for a  commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic health record system.

VistA began operation in  1983 as the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program. In 1996, the  department changed the name of the system to the Veterans Health  Information Systems and Technology Architecture\u2014VistA.", "The system is comprised of more than 200 different software applications,  including 17 pharmacy applications; 11 laboratory applications; 10  eligibility, enrollment, and registration applications; and 12 financial  management applications. Most VistA applications are based on an  architecture that links servers and personal computer workstations at VA  facilities. VistA also has interfaces with applications within other VA  systems, as well as selected systems of other federal agencies (e.g.,  DOD health information systems used to treat injured service members)  and private care providers and pharmacies.", "VistA was developed based on the collaboration of staff in the VA medical  facilities and VHA IT personnel, with the intention of providing a system  that would meet the clinicians\u2019 needs. Specifically, clinicians and IT  personnel in the various medical facilities collaborated to define the  system\u2019s requirements and, in certain cases, carried out its development  and implementation. In this regard, staff at a medical center could  develop and implement applications at the local level to facilitate the  potentially different functions at each location. This approach has resulted  in about 130 different instances, or variations, of the system being used  throughout the department\u2019s medical facilities.", "VA has made numerous enhancements to the functionality of VistA since  1983. A significant example is the release in 1996 of the Computerized  Patient Record System (CPRS), a graphical user interface that enabled  the department to provide an individual electronic health record for each  VA patient. Specifically, CPRS enables clinicians to enter, review, and  continuously update information connected with a patient. Among other  things, clinicians can order lab tests, medications, diets, radiology tests,  and procedures; record a patient\u2019s allergies or adverse reactions to  medications; request and track consults; enter progress notes, diagnoses,  and treatments for each encounter; and enter discharge summaries.", "Another example of the enhancements made to VistA was the  department\u2019s implementation of an imaging capability (VistA Imaging) at  all of the medical facilities. This capability enabled multimedia data, such  as radiology images, to be linked to a patient\u2019s electronic medical record.", "VistA contains a comprehensive, integrated, electronic health record for  each patient that is viewable by all of the department\u2019s clinicians at all of  its medical facilities, thus eliminating the need for paper medical records.  This capability has been key to the department\u2019s efforts over the last 20  years to share electronic medical records with DOD, and with its work to  achieve interoperability, which enables different information systems or  components to exchange information and to use the information that has  been exchanged.", "Nevertheless, even with the enhancements and modifications made to  VistA over time, the system is more than 30 years old and has become  increasingly difficult and costly to maintain. One reason VistA is difficult  and costly to maintain is that the system is programmed in the MUMPS  programming language, a language for which there is a continually  dwindling supply of qualified software developers, according to the  department.", "In 2015, an independent assessment of health IT at VA, conducted by the  MITRE Corporation, raised questions regarding the lack of any clear  advances made during the past decade with VistA and the increasing  amount of time needed for VA to release new capabilities. The study  also noted that the standards and terminology used by VistA do not  enable interoperability across the multiple systems within VA, or between  the department and non-VA facilities, including private sector providers  and DOD. Given the concerns identified, the study recommended that VA  assess the cost versus benefits of various alternatives for delivering  modernized capabilities, such as COTS electronic health record systems,  open source systems, and the continued development of VistA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Has Pursued Four VistA Modernization Initiatives Since 2001, with Over a Billion Dollars Obligated for Contractors\u2019 Activities During Fiscal Years 2011 through 2016", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, VA has pursued four efforts to modernize VistA.

The modernization efforts are described as follows.", "In 2001, VA undertook its first VistA modernization project, the  HealtheVet initiative, with the goals of standardizing the department\u2019s  health care system and eliminating the approximately 130 different  systems used by its field locations at that time. HealtheVet was scheduled  to be fully implemented by 2018 at a total estimated development and  deployment cost of about $11 billion. As part of the effort, the department  had planned to develop or enhance specific areas of system functionality  through six projects, which were to be completed between 2006 and  2012. Specifically, these projects were to provide capabilities to support  VA\u2019s Health Data Repository and Patient Financial Services System, as  well as the Laboratory, Pharmacy, Imaging, and Scheduling functions.", "In June 2008, we reported that the department had made progress on the  HealtheVet initiative, but noted issues with project planning and  governance. In June 2009, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs announced  that VA would stop financing failed projects and improve the management  of its IT development projects. Subsequently in August 2010, the  department reported that it had terminated the HealtheVet initiative.", "In February 2011, VA began its second VistA modernization initiative, the  iEHR program, in conjunction with DOD. The program was intended to  replace the two separate electronic health record systems used by the  two departments with a single, shared system. In addition, because both  departments would be using the same system, this approach was  expected to largely sidestep the challenges that had been encountered in  trying to achieve interoperability between their two separate systems.", "Initial plans called for the development of a single, joint iEHR system  consisting of 54 clinical capabilities to be delivered in six increments  between 2014 and 2017. Among the agreed-upon capabilities to be  delivered were those supporting laboratory, anatomic pathology,  pharmacy, and immunizations. According to VA and DOD, the single  system had an estimated life cycle cost of $29 billion through the end of  fiscal year 2029.", "However, in February 2013, the Secretaries of VA and DOD announced  that they would not continue with their joint development of a single  electronic health record system. This decision resulted from an  assessment of the iEHR program that the secretaries had requested in  December 2012 because of their concerns about the program facing  challenges in meeting deadlines, costing too much, and taking too long to  deliver capabilities. In 2013, the departments abandoned their plan to  develop the integrated system and stated that they would again pursue  separate modernization efforts.", "In December 2013, VA initiated its VistA Evolution program as a joint  effort of VHA and OI&T that was to be completed by the end of fiscal year  2018. The program was to be comprised of a collection of projects and  efforts focused on improving the efficiency and quality of veterans\u2019 health  care by modernizing the department\u2019s health information systems,  increasing the department\u2019s data exchange and interoperability with DOD  and private sector health care partners, and reducing the time it takes to  deploy new health information management capabilities. Further, the  program was intended to result in lower costs for system upgrades,  maintenance, and sustainment. According to the department\u2019s March  2017 cost estimate, VistA Evolution was to have a life cycle cost of about  $4 billion through fiscal year 2028.", "Since initiating VistA Evolution in December 2013, VA has completed a  number of key activities that were called for in its plans. For example, the  department delivered capabilities, such as the ability for health providers  to have an integrated, real-time view of electronic health record data  through the Joint Legacy Viewer, as well as the ability for health care  providers to view sensitive DOD notes and highlight abnormal test results  for patients. VA also initiated work to standardize VistA across the 130  VA facilities and released enhancements to its legacy scheduling,  pharmacy, and immunization systems. In addition, the department  released the enterprise Health Management Platform, which is a web- based user interface that assembles patient clinical data from all VistA  instances and DOD.", "Although VistA Evolution is ongoing, VA is currently in the process of  revising its plan for the program as a result of the department recently  announcing its pursuit of a fourth VistA modernization program  (discussed below). For example, the department determined that it would  no longer pursue additional development or deployment of the enterprise  Health Management Platform\u2014a major VistA Evolution component\u2014 because the new modernization program is envisioned to provide similar  capabilities.", "In June 2017, the VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the  department\u2019s approach to modernizing VistA. Specifically, rather than  continue to use VistA, the Secretary stated that the department plans to  acquire the same electronic health record system that DOD is  implementing. In this regard, DOD has contracted with the Cerner  Corporation to provide a new integrated electronic health record system.  According to the Secretary, VA has chosen to acquire this same product  because it would allow all of VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s patient data to reside in one  system, thus enabling seamless care between the department and DOD  without the manual and electronic exchange and reconciliation of data  between two separate systems.", "According to the VA Secretary, this fourth VistA modernization initiative is  intended to minimize customization and system differences that currently  exist within the department\u2019s medical facilities, and ensure the  consistency of processes and practices within VA and DOD. When fully  operational, the system is intended to be the single source for patients to  access their medical history and for clinicians to use that history in real  time at any VA or DOD medical facility, which may result in improved  health care outcomes. According to VA\u2019s Chief Technology Officer,  Cerner is expected to provide integration, configuration, testing,  deployment, hosting, organizational change management, training,  sustainment, and licenses necessary to deploy the system in a manner  that meets the department\u2019s needs.", "To expedite the acquisition, in June 2017, the Secretary signed a  \u201cDetermination and Findings,\u201d for a public interest exception to the  requirement for full and open competition, and authorized VA to issue a  solicitation directly to the Cerner Corporation. According to the  Secretary, VA expects to award a contract to Cerner in early 2018, and  deployment of the new system is anticipated to begin 18 months after the  contract has been signed.", "VA\u2019s Executive Director for the Electronic Health Records Modernization  System stated that the department intends to deploy the new system  incrementally to its medical facilities. Each facility is expected to continue  using VistA until the new system has been deployed at that location.
