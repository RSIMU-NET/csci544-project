Air Force officials encountered challenges as they began implementing the commission's recommendations which the revised approach may address. For example, the Air Force had difficulty coordinating across components and offices and coordinating among teams working on inter-related recommendations. Under the revised approach, the Air Force has grouped related recommendations together and placed responsibility for each group under senior officials to improve coordination. According to Air Force officials, the revised approach requires development of milestones and tasks for each recommendation but does not require development of performance measures. Federal internal control standards, leading program management practices, and GAO's prior work have shown that performance measures which contain key attributes\u2014such as baseline and trend data\u2014can help managers monitor progress toward achieving program goals and identify areas for corrective actions. Since the revised approach was not fully in place as of January 2016, the Air Force had not developed complete implementation plans with milestones, tasks, and performance measures to monitor and oversee progress on the remaining 36 open recommendations. Under its original management approach, the Air Force had developed implementation plans for 3 recommendations. These plans generally contained milestones and tasks but were incomplete, since they did not consistently include performance measures that were clear, measurable, or contained a baseline from which implementation progress could be measured. While the Air Force's revised approach includes some positive steps, it is new, its effectiveness is unknown, and it does not require performance measures to gauge progress. Without complete implementation plans that include performance measures which reflect the key attributes, the Air Force will continue to lack important information to monitor progress and assess whether performance is meeting expectations for the 36 recommendations that are still open.", "Several of the commission's recommendations related to the feasibility of shifting a portion of the active to the reserve component forces. The Air Force has assessed potential changes to its force mix using a process it developed for this purpose. The process combines quantitative and qualitative analysis with stakeholder input and judgment to identify options for changing the mix of active and reserve component forces. These options are then presented to senior Air Force leaders for their consideration, and the leaders' decisions inform the planning phase of the budget development process. To support its process, the Air Force has developed customized, classified data analyses for 44 aircraft types and mission areas. The Air Force finished these analyses in December 2015, and officials said the results informed planning for the fiscal year 2018 budget. However, since the budget development and execution cycle spans up to four years, it is not clear at this time how many of the proposed force mix options may ultimately be implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, for the 36 remaining open commission recommendations, the Air Force develop complete implementation plans that include performance measures.

We interviewed Air Force officials to understand their  approach to managing and providing oversight for implementing the  commission\u2019s recommendations. We also reviewed Executive Committee  minutes and interviewed Air Force officials about their efforts to  implement selected recommendations. We judgmentally selected a  sample of open recommendations that, as a group, had the following  attributes: Air Force officials had identified implementing the  recommendations as facing challenges; the reason for limited progress  was not clear based on a review of an Air Force status briefing; included  at least one recommendation with a team leader from the reserve  component; and included multiple recommendations where the  implementation was led by the same team. In addition, we compared the  implementation plans that had been developed as of September 2015 to  leading practices on program management including identifying  milestones, tasks, and performance measures. We identified these  selected leading practices on milestones, tasks, and performance  measures from a combination of prior GAO work on performance  measurement and planning, the Government Performance and Results  Act (GPRA)\u2014as updated by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010\u2014 related guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, Air Force  guidance on business case analyses, and federal internal control  standards.

According to Air Force officials, internal challenges included: expected  completion dates not identified; difficulties in coordinating implementation  efforts across offices; and inter-related recommendations. First, neither  the commission nor the Air Force established time frames for completing  implementation of all the commission\u2019s recommendations. The lack of an  overall implementation time frame, or time frames for most individual  recommendations, may have conveyed the idea that implementation was  open-ended, since there was generally no clear end-date to work toward,  according to Total Force Continuum Office officials. Second, the Air Force  experienced challenges in coordinating implementation efforts across  components and directorates. According to Air Force officials, extensive  coordination and cooperation across the Air Force components and Air  Force headquarters\u2019 directorates is needed to implement many  commission recommendations. This coordination did not consistently  occur because, according to Air Force officials, the level of the team  leaders who manage each recommendation\u2014typically Colonels or  Lieutenant Colonels\u2014lacked the authority to task personnel outside their  office which meant that cooperation and coordination were generally  dependent on persuasion rather than direction. According to Air Force  officials, although the Total Force Continuum office manages the process  to implement the commission\u2019s recommendations, the team leaders and  members generally belong to other organizations. For example, the team  working on the recommendation to develop an integrated pay and  personnel system includes representatives from the office of the Deputy  Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (team leader), Air  Force Personnel Center, Air Force Reserves, National Guard Bureau,  and the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial  Management and Comptroller. In addition, implementation team roles  have been an additional duty, rather than the sole duty for these team  leaders and members. Finally, successful implementation of some  recommendations depends on implementation of related  recommendations according to the February 2015 Report on  Recommendations of the National Commission on the Structure of the Air  Force and Air Force officials. For example, a pilot program to integrate  active and reserve component forces into an \u201cIntegrated Wing\u201d needs to  be established and tested before 6 other recommendations can be fully  implemented, according to Air Force officials. The results of this pilot  program will inform decisions on how to implement a range of  recommendations such as policies and procedures concerning filling key  deputy positions, and considerations for personnel awards, decorations  and promotions.", "In addition to these internal challenges, Air Force officials explained that  they also encountered external challenges. Air Force officials stated that  while they can take actions to make some progress in implementing many  of the commission\u2019s recommendations, full implementation of some  recommendations depends on support from external agencies or  Congress. For example, one recommendation is for the President to  direct the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to develop  national requirements for Homeland Security and Disaster Assistance.  Also, Air Force officials have identified a number of legislative actions  necessary to fully implement seven commission recommendations. For  example, they said that legislative action is necessary to fully implement  one recommendation to develop a pilot project for \u201ccontinuum of service\u201d,  that is, the ability for personnel to transition more seamlessly among the  components. To fully implement another recommendation related to  instructor pilots, the Air Force identified legislative action as necessary to  permit reserve personnel and dual status military technicians to train  active duty pilots as a primary duty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Is Revising Its Approach to Manage and Oversee Recommendation Implementation", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force is revising its approach to manage and oversee  implementation of the remaining 36 commission recommendations, and it  expected to fully initiate this approach in March 2016. According to Air  Force officials, the Air Force Assistant Vice Chief of Staff directed the use  of a new approach that strategically groups related recommendations to  facilitate management, oversight, and coordination. To do this, the Air  Force aligned the commission\u2019s recommendations with objectives in the  Air Force Human Capital Annex of its Strategic Master Plan. According  to Air Force officials, categorizing the recommendations under the  objectives in the Human Capital Annex, will help the Air Force  synchronize related efforts and thereby minimize the potential for  overlapping efforts. The Air Force also designated a General Officer  and/or civilian equivalent at the Senior Executive Service level to manage  and oversee implementation of recommendations in each group. The  General Officer or civilian equivalent at the Senior Executive Service level  will periodically report the progress of his or her group of  recommendations to the governance structure for the Human Capital  Annex and the Executive Committee. Recommendations that did not  align with any of the objectives were grouped under the Total Force  Continuum office. Half (21) of the commission\u2019s recommendations fall  within the Total Force Continuum group, including recommendations  related to increasing the number of reserve component instructor pilots,  fielding equipment concurrently among active and reserve component,  and identifying homeland security and disaster assistance requirements.

In  addition, the Air Force intends to use implementation templates for each  group of recommendations as well as each individual recommendation.  The templates\u2019 instructions explain that the structure is adapted from the  structure for implementation-type plans discussed in an Air Force  instruction. Upon reviewing the templates, we noted that they contain a  requirement for milestones and are to specify the tasks that need to be  completed to implement each recommendation.

Our prior work has demonstrated that using performance measures  facilitates assessment of how goals are being achieved and can also  identify areas for improvement, if needed.", "Air Force officials explained that their revised approach requires aligning  actions on related recommendations and identifying tasks and milestones  for each recommendation. Leading practices for program management  advocate grouping related projects in a coordinated way to maximize  benefits, track actual against planned milestones, and to identify  interrelationships among projects, as well as to monitor project  performance to identify any needed modifications. In addition, our prior  work and leading practices have shown that an implementation plan,  consisting of tasks, milestones, and performance measures that contain  key attributes can help organizations gauge progress toward achieving  their desired results and can help leaders identify when corrective actions  are needed.", "We determined that the Air Force has made progress incorporating  leading practices for milestones and tasks, but has not incorporated\u2014and  did not yet have plans to require\u2014performance measures that include  key attributes. To understand the extent to which the Air Force had  previously incorporated leading practices, we reviewed implementation  plans for 3 of the 36 recommendations that have not yet been  implemented. These plans were developed before the Air Force adopted  its revised management approach. We evaluated these three plans  because, at the time we conducted our analysis, the Air Force had not  developed any plans under its revised approach. Based on our analysis  of these Air Force plans, we found that the Air Force had developed  strategic milestones and partially identified tasks to achieve objectives in  the 3 implementation plans it developed before adopting its revised  management and oversight approach. In the implementation plans for the  3 recommendations we reviewed, the plans were not presented in a  single document and the documents did not always identify milestones for  all interim tasks.", "Our prior work suggests that, ideally, objectives and measures should be  described in a single document, such as an implementation plan, that  defines how results can be measured. According to our Business Process  Reengineering Assessment Guide, agencies undergoing business  transformations should develop a detailed implementation plan that lays  out what needs to be done to achieve implementation of new processes  by identifying milestones and specifying timetables for all actions so that  progress can be closely monitored. We have also reported that  developing and using specific milestones to guide and gauge progress  toward achieving an agency\u2019s desired results informs management of the  rate of progress toward achieving goals and whether adjustments need to  be made to maintain progress within given time frames.", "Also, our prior work on performance measurement and federal internal  controls discusses using performance measures to assess performance  over time. In 2012, we reported that federal agencies engaging in large  projects can use performance measures to determine how well they are  achieving their goals and to identify areas for improvement, if needed.  We have found that by developing and tracking performance against a  baseline for all measures, agencies can better evaluate progress and  determine whether or not goals are being achieved. Through our prior  work on performance measurement, we have identified key attributes of  performance measures that can help managers monitor progress toward  achieving program goals and priorities. Previous GAO work also  indicates that agencies successful in measuring performance had  performance measures that demonstrate results, are limited in number,  cover multiple priorities, and provide useful information for decision  making. Table 2 below summarizes selected attributes of performance  measures and lists potential adverse consequences if attributes are  missing.", "We analyzed the three implementation plans developed under the Air  Force\u2019s original approach, to assess the extent to which the performance  measures contained in the plans contained the key attributes discussed  above. We found that the plans\u2019 performance measures contained one or  more of the seven relevant key attributes, but they did not incorporate all  seven attributes. For example, the performance measures did not  consistently include clear, measurable, objective measures and a  baseline assessment of current performance. Moreover, because the  commission\u2019s recommendations were addressed individually and not  grouped together at the time the measures were developed, we could not  easily determine whether measures for related recommendations  collectively addressed the Air Force\u2019s priorities in a balanced manner.", "The revised management approach, discussed in the Executive  Committee\u2019s December 2015 meeting, includes tasks and milestones, but  not performance measures. According to Air Force officials, the  milestones for each group are required to be developed according to a  standardized template that the Total Force Continuum office developed.  The implementation plan template contains an overall plan for the group  of recommendations and annexes detailing plans for each  recommendation within the group. According to Air Force officials, the  information in the plan is to include: a discussion of the commission\u2019s  recommendation including relationships to other commission  recommendations; strategic milestones and tasks with completion dates,  assumptions, and constraints; and a project schedule with tasks, offices  of primary responsibility, number of days for task completion and  implementation dates. However, the template does not provide for  performance measures. The milestones are due at the March 2016  Executive Committee meeting. According to Air Force officials, the  milestones and the proposed template apply the basic principles  contained in Air Force guidance on business case analysis procedures,  which include linking tasks to specific, achievable milestones. According  to Air Force officials, as of December 2015, the Air Force requires the use  of project management charts that include program objectives and  milestones specifying tasks that will have to be completed to implement  each recommendation. Under the revised approach, project schedules  will link milestones and tasks with responsible offices and identify due  dates for completion of both strategic milestones and tactical tasks in a  single document. According to Air Force officials, each month, the  Executive Committee will review each group\u2019s status and progress in  achieving their tasks and milestones. In addition, at each monthly  meeting, the Executive Committee will review in detail all the  recommendations within one of the groups. Therefore, the Executive  Committee will review each individual recommendation and any  associated issues, tasks, and milestones at least twice a year.", "Because the new, revised approach and the implementation plan  template do not require development of performance measures, the Air  Force will continue to lack critical information to oversee implementation  of the commission\u2019s recommendations and will not have full visibility to  track progress.

The Air Force  developed its force mix option process to evaluate the mix of active and  reserve component forces across the Air Force. As part of this process,  the Air Force developed customized, classified data analyses for 44  aircraft types and mission areas. For example, the Air Force analyzed:  bombers; the various aircraft used for the personnel recovery mission;  and civil engineering, logistics, and medical services forces.

The  process combines data analysis and stakeholder inputs. According to  officials from the Total Force Continuum office, the data analysis portion  of the process uses authoritative data from established sources across  the Air Force. For example major commands such as Air Combat  Command provide flying hours data and the office of the Assistant  Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller  provides cost data. Relevant stakeholders from across the Air Force  (including Air Force Reserves, Air National Guard, various Air Force  Headquarters directorates, and major commands), also have the  opportunity to provide their comments, ideas, and suggestions at several  points throughout the process. Using the data analysis, stakeholders  develop and refine force mix options. The key components of developing  force mix options\u2014 assumptions, data analysis, and stakeholder input\u2014 are discussed below.", "Assumptions: According to officials who manage the process, the data  analysis contains key assumptions concerning demand, readiness, and  operational tempo. Demand is derived from Department of Defense  (DOD)-approved planning scenarios. In building this analysis, the Air  Force focuses on the surge period to determine whether or not it has  enough forces, but it focuses on the \u201cpost-surge\u201d period (i.e., the period of  time after cessation of major combat operations when there is a  continuous demand for forces to rotate in and out of the area for several  years) to determine its appropriate mix of its forces. The Air Force  assumes that all units are ready and available to perform their missions  and also assumes that it will be able to comply with operational  deployment guidance. The DOD goal for operational deployment to dwell  ratio for active component forces is 1:2 or greater, meaning one  deployment period would be followed by a non-deployed period that is at  least twice as long. For the reserve component, the Air Force assumes it  can meet a 1:5 mobilization to dwell ratio, meaning that one mobilization  period would be followed by a period five times as long when the unit is  not mobilized. Since the data in the workbooks is inter-connected, any  change in the assumptions could affect the output. For example, if the  reserve component\u2019s mobilization to dwell ratio changes (e.g., from 1:5 to  1:10), then more active component forces may be needed to meet the  demand. Also, if units are less than fully ready, then any gap between the  supply of forces and the scenario\u2019s rotational demand may increase,  thereby increasing risk, according to Air Force officials. These  assumptions are explained to senior leaders before the analysis results  are presented.", "Data analysis: For each aircraft type and mission area, the Air Force  builds a classified, customized Excel workbook that contains a series of  interconnected spreadsheets that contain hundreds of cells. Although  each workbook is customized for each aircraft or mission area, they  generally contain the same or similar types of data including: unit manpower by component; flying hours and cost per flying hour; direct and indirect personnel costs; and information on the current number of units;  comparisons of unit supply and demand.", "According to officials who manage the process, much of the data entered  into the Excel workbooks comes from standard data sources. For  example, flying hours data come from the approved training program for  each aircraft type, and manpower data comes from unit manning  documents.

While the descriptions of implementing the non-probability sample of  seven selected recommendations cannot be projected to all 36 open  recommendations, they do illustrate the Air Force\u2019s original process for  implementing the commission\u2019s recommendations.", "In addition, we analyzed the implementation plans that had been  developed under the Air Force\u2019s original approach for 3, inter-related  recommendations to determine the extent to which these documents  incorporated leading practices such as milestones, tasks, and  performance measures. We evaluated these plans because, at the time  we conducted our analysis, the Air Force had not developed any plans  under its revised approach. Also, Air Force officials said that plans for  these 3 recommendations were the only implementation plans that had  been developed under the original approach. The documents constituting  the implementation plan for the 3, inter-related recommendations were  not contained in one consolidated document but instead consisted of  multiple documents, such as action plans and other guidance-type  documents that were identified by Air Force officials as implementation  plans. For purposes of our analysis, we refer to these multiple documents  for each of the 3 recommendations as \u201cimplementation plans\u201d.", "We compared the implementation plans for the 3 recommendations with  leading practices for program management that included the use of  milestones and tasks. We derived these practices by reviewing a  combination of Air Force guidance, industry practices, and our prior  work. We also compared the implementation plans with leading practices  on performance measures which we derived from a combination of  federal internal control standards, prior GAO work on performance  measurement and planning; the Government Performance and Results  Act (GPRA)\u2014as updated by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010;  related guidance from the Office of Management and Budget; and Air  Force guidance on business case analyses. Our prior work identified ten  attributes of effective performance measures. Of the ten attributes  associated with effective performance measures, we selected seven  attributes against which to evaluate performance measures in the Air  Force\u2019s three implementation plans. We excluded the attributes for  \u201cgovernment-wide priorities\u201d, \u201ccore program activities,\u201d and \u201clinkage\u201d,  since we judged these attributes less relevant to the Air Force\u2019s plans.  Excluding these attributes would still yield a sound assessment. The  seven attributes we selected would provide comprehensive information,  over time, on how well the Air Force was progressing with its plans to  implement the recommendations and identify areas for increased focus.", "In our scorecard analyses, two GAO analysts independently conducted  analyses of performance measures, milestones, and tasks described in  each implementation plan. Any disagreements between the two  assessments were discussed and reconciled by a third analyst. In our  scorecard analysis of milestones and tasks, we determined that  implementation plans included milestones when we were able to identify  milestones in the plans. We determined that the implementation plans  \u201caddressed\u201d inclusion of tasks tied to milestones if each task had a  milestone associated with it. An implementation plan \u201cpartially addressed\u201d  inclusion of tasks tied to milestones if some, but not all of the tasks had  an associated milestone. Finally, an implementation plan \u201cdid not  address\u201d inclusion of tasks tied to milestones if we determined that none  of the tasks had a milestone tied to it. In our scorecard analysis of  performance measures, we determined that a performance measure  \u201caddressed\u201d an attribute when it included all elements of the attribute,  even if it lacked specificity and details and could thus be improved upon.  A performance measure \u201cpartially addressed\u201d an attribute when it  included more than one, but not all, elements of the attribute.", "Consequently, our designation of \u201cpartially addressed,\u201d may include a  wide variation of, from one to six, demonstrated attributes. A performance  measure \u201cdid not address\u201d an attribute when it did not include or discuss  any elements of the attribute, and/or any implicit references were either  too vague or general to permit assessment. For the attribute \u201climited  overlap\u201d we determined that the attribute was \u201cnot applicable\u201d if the  implementation of the commission recommendation was not dependent  on implementation of another recommendation. To supplement this  analysis and gain further insight into issues of strategic import, we also  interviewed cognizant officials from the Air Force team implementing the  3, inter-related recommendations that have implementation plans, team  leaders and members for seven recommendations, representatives from  the Air Force Reserves, Air National Guard, and Air Force headquarters  staff from the Total Force Continuum office within the Headquarters Air  Force Strategic Plans and Programs Directorate, and the office of the  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and  Comptroller.", "To describe how the Air Force has assessed the potential for increasing  the proportion of reserve to active component forces as discussed in the  commission\u2019s report, we identified the scope, content, and process for the  Air Force\u2019s High Velocity Analysis (referred to in the report as the force  mix option process) which is the process the Air Force developed to  identify and assess force mix options. We first identified the scope of the  Air Force analysis by reviewing documentation such as the Air Force  analysis schedule and interviewing Air Force officials (from the Strategic  Plans and Programs Directorate and the office of the Assistant Secretary  of the Air Force, Financial Management and Comptroller). This work  provided information on how individual analyses were developed and  which aircraft and mission areas were analyzed. Since the Air Force had  developed 55 Excel workbooks for analyzing 44 aircraft types and  mission areas as of December 2015, we selected a non-probability  sample to serve as illustrative examples and learn how the workbooks  were built, identify data inputs and their sources, and identify who verifies  data inputs, how data are verified, and how the workbooks are used to  develop force mix options. From the universe of 44 aircraft types and  mission areas, we selected three analyses that had the following  attributes: the analysis was complete and not on-going; one that was for a  combat mission, one that was for a combat support mission; and one that  had a \u201cdeploy in place\u201d mission. The three analyses we selected were:  bombers, personnel recovery, and intercontinental ballistic mission  forces. We did not trace a sample of the data in each workbook back to  its original source documents or verify workbook formulas since we were  not assessing the accuracy or reliability of the data or analyses. We did  review documentation showing that the Air Force has steps in its process  for stakeholders to review and modify workbook inputs. While the details  of the three analyses we sampled cannot be projected to all 55  workbooks, the sample did enable us to describe the overall force mix  option process, including the type of information presented to Air Force  leadership.", "Next, we reviewed examples of documentation of the results of the force  mix option process such as examples of briefings presented to senior Air  Force leadership to determine whether assumptions and limitations were  presented to decision makers.
