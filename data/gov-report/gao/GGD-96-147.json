As stated in Title V, Congress found that (1) it was more effective in human and fiscal terms to prevent delinquency than to attempt to control or change it, (2) half or more of all states were unable to spend any juvenile justice formula grant funds on delinquency prevention because of other priorities, and (3) federal incentives were needed to assist states and local communities in mobilizing delinquency prevention policies and programs.", "The 1992 reauthorization required us to submit to Congress a study of the incentive grant program for local juvenile delinquency prevention.

Congress appropriated $13 million in fiscal year 1994 and $20 million in fiscal year 1995 for these purposes.", "Title V grant funds are to serve as stimuli for local governments to mobilize support from community leaders, develop multiyear prevention plans, and pool public and private resources in implementing programs designed to reduce the future incidence of delinquent behavior and youth crime through adoption of effective strategies that address risk factors for delinquency. To be eligible for Title V funds, the grantees are to provide a 50-percent match of the grant amount, including in-kind contributions (e.g., lease of office space or equipment paid by local government or private sources) to fund the activity.", "OJJDP also administers other programs such as the Title II Formula Grant Program. Title II of the 1974 act provides grants-in-aid to states and local governments to improve juvenile justice systems and to prevent and control delinquency. To receive and remain eligible for funds under Title V, jurisdictions must be in compliance with Title II formula grant program core requirements. The four key core requirements are (1) not detaining status offenders or nonoffenders (e.g., neglected children) in secure detention or correctional facilities, (2) not detaining or confining juveniles in any institution where they have contact with adult detainees, (3) not detaining or confining juveniles in adult jails or lockups, and (4) demonstration of efforts to reduce the disproportionate confinement of minority youth where it exists.", "According to the Department of Justice Delinquency Prevention Program guidelines, approximately 70 percent of the jurisdictions at one time or another have devoted 100 percent of available Title II formula grant funds toward meeting the four core requirements. As a result, many jurisdictions have been limited in the amounts of OJJDP Title II funds that they could devote to delinquency prevention.", "Since the Title V program started, OJJDP has issued two annual reports to Congress. Its 1994 report (1) highlighted activities and accomplishments during the first year of Title V implementation, (2) described efforts to foster interagency coordination of delinquency prevention activities, and (3) contained recommendations for future Title V activities. The 1995 report (1) described efforts to set the foundation for the success of Title V by capacity building (e.g., providing training and technical assistance) and establishing coordination and collaboration within Justice, between federal agencies, and at state and local levels; (2) identified early indications of success; and (3) provided conclusions on past and future contributions of Title V."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Title V Program: Risk-Focused Strategy for Delinquency Prevention", "paragraphs": ["According to OJJDP, the Title V Delinquency Prevention Program has been implemented on the basis of local adoption of \u201crisk-focused prevention\u201d strategies such as those identified in the social development prevention model, Communities That Care (CTC), developed by J. David Hawkins and Richard F. Catalano, Jr. of the University of Washington in Seattle. OJJDP guidelines call for jurisdictions and localities to consider this model, or comparable risk-focused prevention approaches, by (1) identifying risk factors known to be associated with delinquent behavior operating within communities, (2) assessing those protective factors that buffer the effect of the identified risk factors, and (3) targeting program interventions to occur at the earliest appropriate stage in a child\u2019s development and within the local community. The CTC model defines five categories of risk factors that have been found to be predictive of juvenile delinquency: individual characteristics, such as alienation, rebelliousness, and lack of bonding to society; family influences, such as parental conflict, child abuse, poor family management practices, and history of problem behavior affecting the family (e.g., substance abuse, criminality, teen pregnancy, and dropping out of school); school experiences, such as early academic failure and lack of peer group influences, such as friends who engage in problem behavior (minor criminality, drugs, gangs, and violence); and community and neighborhood factors, such as economic deprivation, high rates of substance abuse and crime, and neighborhood disorganization.", "According to the CTC model, protective factors must be introduced to counter these risk factors. Protective factors are qualities or conditions that moderate a juvenile\u2019s exposure to risk. Protective factors fall into three basic categories: (1) individual characteristics, such as a resilient temperament and a positive social orientation; (2) bonding with prosocial family members, teachers, adults, and friends; and (3) healthy beliefs and clear standards for behavior.", "Risk-focused delinquency prevention is intended to provide communities with a conceptual framework for (1) identifying and prioritizing risk factors, (2) assessing how current resources are being used, (3) identifying needed resources, and (4) choosing specific programs and strategies that directly address risk factors through the enhancement of protective factors. According to state and local officials, this approach requires a commitment by, and participation of, the entire community in developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy for preventing delinquency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title V Implementation", "paragraphs": ["The Title V program is implemented in two phases. During phase one, the assessment and planning phase, communities interested in participating in the Title V Program must form a local prevention policy board (PPB) and conduct an assessment to identify and prioritize the risk factors operating within their community.

This plan serves as the substantive basis for the community\u2019s application to the state\u2019s juvenile justice advisory group, or its designated administrative agency, for Title V funding. The programs and services to be implemented must be designed to reduce the impact of identified risk factors on children living in the applicant community.", "Phase two of the Title V process involves the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the programs and services specified during phase one, as well as the ongoing coordination of services within the applicant communities.

Five of the 12 objectives were established to reach the first goal of economic empowerment targeting youth ages 10 to 17 and their families. They were to (1) start 3 neighborhood/family owned businesses; (2) create 24 new jobs, with one-half of them for youth; (3) train 100 youth in business development skills; (4) rehabilitate and occupy 3 vacant commercial properties in the target area; and (5) lower the number of street arrests on blocks occupied by new businesses by 50 percent.", "To achieve the goal of family support, another five objectives were established targeting at-risk families with preschool children, ages birth to 6 years. They included (1) starting 2 new family centers, (2) instituting monthly home visits to provide parenting education for 200 families, (3) creating 2 new family support networks serving 20 families per network, (4) lowering absenteeism from the family among these 200 families by 60 percent, and (5) achieving less than 10-percent retention rates for first graders from network-involved families.", "The last 2 of the 12 objectives were established to achieve the goal of mobilizing against violence by targeting children ages 6 to 10 and their families. They included lowering suspension rates for fighting in elementary schools by 70 percent and lowering the number of violent incidents at community and youth centers by 70 percent.", "Intervention Strategy: The core strategy was aimed at creating collaborative planning and coordination of specific programs that address juvenile delinquency risk factors. The community collaborative approach was to leverage other programs and resources to address risk factors operating in target neighborhoods. Community mobilization strategies were used to build and support teams of professionals (education, business, human services, law enforcement); parents; residents; and youth to counteract effects of the four risk factors.", "Project Description: The project was designed to develop and implement family preservation, violence prevention, and economic training programs. It also sought to promote revitalization in three depressed neighborhoods, strengthen community organization, provide parenting education through satellite family centers, and promote conflict resolution through nonviolent means. This project focused on changing organizations, agencies, rules, settings, institutions, and established practices. The project also delivered services to clients.", "Economic development initiatives included fostering successful neighborhood-based family/community-owned businesses and cooperatives to complement ongoing job training and business development projects. Economic development and training components targeted youth as potential employees or owners of local businesses, promoted neighborhood economic growth through business development training, and provided technical assistance to small business owners and potential owners. For example, a series of workshops was provided for business owners and potential owners focusing on (1) identifying the economy of the neighborhood, including the in-flow and out-flow of cash and capital; (2) developing marketable business ideas; (3) developing sound business plans; and (4) marketing business concepts to obtain start-up capital. These efforts were envisioned to increase family and youth economic empowerment and result in two to three new businesses within a year. Emphasis was placed on businesses owned by families in the target area and that included young people in helping to plan and be employed by them.", "Two new family centers were to be established to develop family support networks, sponsor collaborative education workshops, and provide in-home parent education visits. Ineffective family management was to be addressed through development of skills, confidence, support networks, and capacities of at-risk families to enable them to manage their day-to-day lives. These efforts were seen as helping to create protective factors for youth by (1) stabilizing their home lives; (2) helping parents to promote healthy beliefs and standards; and (3) establishing bonds with others (e.g., parents, prosocial peers, and adults) that reinforce healthy modes of behavior.", "Another aspect of the project, mobilization against youth violence, was designed to counteract the risk of early and persistent antisocial behavior, particularly the growth of violent behavior such as fighting among children in elementary school. It aimed to prevent juvenile delinquency through community organization and youth education activities that teach and reinforce nonviolent means of social interaction and conflict resolution. The project also included an intensive year-round, violence prevention campaign that sponsored conflict resolution seminars and organized recreational and social family nights at youth centers.", "Other program activities included peer mediation, drug and alcohol abuse prevention, parenting training, the establishment of secondary (satellite) family centers within focus areas, and special activities in each neighborhood. Other available services included family social services, comprehensive case management, job readiness training and interviewing techniques, parenting programs on discipline and drug and alcohol awareness, after-school enrichment programs, and family and youth advocacy and outreach.

The program operated in eight middle schools. The second component of the Norfolk Effective Prevention Program provided transportation to selected students to AVBP, which helped middle school students who exhibited tendencies toward violent behavior, such as fighting and hitting. Students were to be released from school during the school day and transported to another location where they receive intensive training on ways to reduce violent and combative behaviors.
