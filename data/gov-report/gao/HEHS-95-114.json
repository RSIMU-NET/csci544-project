The average monthly number of children in foster care nationwide increased 53 percent, from 280,000 to 429,000, during this period. The total foster care population in the three states reviewed increased 66 percent between 1986 and 1991, while the number of young foster children more than doubled\u2014increasing by 110 percent.

The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-272) added most of these safeguards\u2014such as requirements that the case file contain a plan for appropriate care and services, as determined by state and local foster care policies; periodic court or administrative reviews; and a reunification program to return children to their parents. This act also authorized HHS to provide technical assistance to aid states in developing programs to meet the requirements of the law. Furthermore, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-239) added other safeguards to the Social Security Act, including a requirement to maintain health records for foster children.", "A combination of federal, state, and county funds may be used to provide services to young foster children.

Recent medical advances in early identification and treatment can enhance and prolong the lives of these children. Early identification is also critical because HIV-infected children should receive modified immunizations to prevent adverse reactions, and their exposure to infectious illnesses such as measles or chicken pox\u2014which are particularly hazardous to these children\u2014should be minimized.", "While state laws, and the county policies based on them, do not prohibit HIV testing or the disclosure of test results, some can hamper HIV testing and disclosure. State laws and county foster care policies, where they exist, vary widely. In some locations, including the three reviewed, these laws and policies impede HIV testing and disclosure by specifying the risk factors that must be present in order to request HIV testing; who has the authority to consent to testing; and to whom HIV test results can be disclosed. For example, for the 36 states with HIV testing policies as of 1992, one-half of the foster care agencies in the states with testing policies may not have authority to consent to an HIV test for a child, even when the child was identified by the agency as being at high risk for HIV."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Number of HIV-Infected Children Is Largely Unknown as Few Children Are Tested", "paragraphs": ["Foster care agencies in the locations reviewed do not know the full extent of their caseloads that is at high risk for HIV since no mechanism exists to ensure that all young foster children are assessed for HIV risk. While two of the three locations we reviewed currently have some HIV risk assessment requirements, one location did not require risk assessments for all foster children until recently, and the other has not implemented clear assessment procedures. HIV risk has long been associated with intravenous drug use, but more recent research has established an equally strong link between HIV risk and the lifestyle of nonintravenous cocaine and crack users. Using New York City\u2019s current HIV risk factors, which include nonintravenous drug use, we assessed our 1991 population of young foster children on the basis of one risk factor, parental drug abuse.

Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the Los Angeles area, and the west coast in general, most AIDS in women is due to heterosexual contact.

Moreover, these children were less likely to receive health-related services of all kinds.

Research found that foster care agencies treat kinship care placements and traditional foster care placements differently. Studies indicate that caseworkers generally provide less monitoring and assistance to kinship care placements. Some states have policies requiring less frequent caseworker visitations to kinship care homes, although these homes are more likely to be unlicensed. For example, a 1992 HHS study found that in 30 states, children may be placed in kinship care homes whether or not the homes meet minimum standards designed to ensure the safety and suitability of foster homes and foster parents. Mandatory orientation and training for foster parents are the most frequently waived licensing requirements for kinship caregivers.

Other studies posit that this increase may be the result of state and county interpretations of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 as implying a preference for relative placements. In recognizing that foster care would continue to be a necessary child welfare service, this act required states to place children in the \u201cleast restrictive (most family-like) setting available,\u201d which has been interpreted by many states as implying a preference for kinship care.

For example, one of the foster care agencies we reviewed continues to develop and implement recordkeeping systems in an attempt to improve its ability to ensure that foster children receive needed services. The agency is currently implementing its third variation of a medical recordkeeping system in recent years. Implementation of the first two versions was unsuccessful, and the third was too recently implemented for us to determine its success.

It established a comprehensive assessment center at the county-run children\u2019s emergency shelter, but that effort appears to have met with only limited success. Medical staff at the center told us that it is seldom used by foster children of any age who reside outside the shelter. The foster care agency is also supporting the development of an ambitious and complex system of multidisciplinary assessment and medical clinics for foster children. This most recent effort, while promising, depends on factors largely outside the control of the foster care agency, such as the continuing involvement of the academia-based physicians who proposed the system and the viability of a complex design for funding services. Furthermore, the system needs strong support from within the agency and procedures that direct foster children to the new system if\u2014unlike the current assessment center\u2014it is to reach even a sustainable level of utilization.", "Recognizing that states need assistance in improving their child welfare programs, including foster care, ACF recently increased its technical assistance efforts.

The safeguards include a requirement that case files of foster children contain up-to-date health-related information, such as records of immunizations and a child\u2019s health conditions. We previously reported that HHS did not audit states on their compliance with all required safeguards for foster children, and we recommended that it expand its audits to include all safeguards. In March 1995, ACF officials confirmed that their audits still do not examine whether states are complying with the health-related safeguards. An HHS determination that a state has passed its compliance audit entitles the state to receive the full federal child welfare funding available by law. However, since HHS does not audit for compliance with the health-related safeguards, states have no federal financial incentive to comply with them. ACF plans to include these safeguards in future audits, according to the same officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Important health-related needs, including routine medical examinations and various specialized services, remained unmet for nearly one-third of the young foster children in the locations reviewed.

It questioned whether inadequate caseworker recordkeeping provided an incomplete depiction of the health-related services received by young foster children. Before beginning the case file review, to test the feasibility of using this method, we reviewed the case files of a small sample of children and then requested the foster care agencies in the three locations reviewed to provide information on those same children from all possible sources, including service providers and foster parents. In general, we found that the additional information provided from these other sources did not change the conclusions we had reached on the basis of our case file review regarding the level of services these children received.

We acknowledge that Los Angeles County has a policy of evaluation for risk of exposure to HIV as an ongoing process for all foster children. However, in September 1994, numerous county program officials told us that the county has no procedures to systematically ensure that risk assessments take place; consequently, this policy does not ensure that foster children who are at high risk for HIV will be identified and tested. In addition, in fall 1994, we visited the assessment center at the children\u2019s emergency shelter and interviewed key program officials and medical staff.

Philadelphia County officials provided us with an electronic database of the records for foster children in that county in 1991.", "Before drawing the sample, we narrowed the databases to include only foster children whose third birthday occurred no later than December 31, 1991. This resulted in population sizes of 8,249 for Los Angeles County, 13,171 for New York City, and 1,335 for Philadelphia County. Then we selected random samples from each of these locations resulting in a total sample of 414 children. The population sizes and initial sample sizes are shown in table I.1.", "We requested all foster care case files for each child in the sample. A few cases were dropped from the sample because the children did not meet the criterion of being in foster care during the review year or were not of the appropriate age. Other cases were dropped because county officials could not locate the records. Finally, we dropped cases of children who were in foster care during our review period for less than 30 days in Los Angeles County and New York City, and less than 60 days in Philadelphia County. We did this to eliminate cases in which a child\u2019s tenure in foster care was shorter than the time foster care agencies were allowed, by their local regulations, to complete initial medical examinations. This resulted in final samples totaling 360 young foster children in our three locations.", "We examined the foster care case files for the period covering a child\u2019s first entry into foster care until the end of the review year or until the child was discharged from foster care, whichever occurred earlier. We used an automated data collection instrument to record information from the case files. The recorded information was reviewed for accuracy by the individual preparing it before finalizing each electronic record. We also reviewed the case file data for consistent coding among individuals; minor adjustments were made to the coding as a result of that review.", "We analyzed the case file data using univariate and bivariate analyses, descriptive statistical methods. We found that for some of the data, the results varied among the three locations; however, the conclusions we drew from the analyses of each location were similar. Thus, the locations could be combined for analysis. Finally, when combining these data, we weighted them to adjust for disproportionate sampling and produced aggregate estimates. However, the results pertain to only the three locations combined and do not necessarily reflect populations of foster children at the state or national level.", "For data derived from the case file review, the percentage estimates reported in the letter and the numerical estimates reported in appendix II are point estimates. Because the estimates are based on combined results from three samples, each is subject to sampling error. The size of the sampling error reflects the precision of the estimate; the smaller the error, the more precise the estimate. Sampling errors for the estimates were calculated at the 95-percent confidence level except where noted. We are 95-percent confident that the actual percentages fall within the confidence intervals reported in appendix II. In other words, there is a 5-percent chance that the confidence intervals do not contain the actual population percentages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Analysis of Placement Type and Service Delivery", "paragraphs": ["For the analysis comparing the subpopulations of children in kinship and traditional foster care, we used only records of children who had been placed exclusively in kinship care or exclusively in traditional foster care.
