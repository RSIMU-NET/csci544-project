CBP\u2019s SBI  Program Office is responsible for managing key acquisition  functions associated with SBInet, including tracking and overseeing  the prime contractor.", "In September 2006, CBP awarded a 3-year contract to the Boeing  Company for SBInet, with three additional 1-year options. As the  prime contractor, Boeing is responsible for designing, producing,  testing, deploying, and sustaining the system. In September 2009,  CBP extended its contract with Boeing for the first option year. CBP  is acquiring SBInet incrementally in a series of discrete units of  capabilities, referred to as \u201cblocks.\u201d Each block is to deliver one or  more system capabilities from a subset of the total system  requirements.", "In August 2008, the DHS Acquisition Review Board decided to delay  the initial deployment of Block 1 of SBInet so that fiscal year 2008  funding could be reallocated to complete physical infrastructure  projects. In addition, the board directed the SBInet System Program  Office (SPO) to deliver a range of program documentation, including  an updated Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), detailed test  plans, and a detailed schedule for deploying Block 1 to two initial  sites in the Tucson Sector of the southwest border. This resulted in  a revised timeline for deploying Block 1, first to the Tucson Border  Patrol Station (TUS-1) in April 2009, and then to the Ajo Border  Patrol Station (AJO-1) in June 2009. Together, these two  deployments are to cover 53 miles of the 1,989-mile-long southern  border. However, the SBI Executive Director told us in December  2009 that these and other SBInet scheduled milestones were being  reevaluated. As of January 2010, the TUS-1 system is scheduled for  government acceptance in September 2010, with AJO-1 acceptance  in November 2010. However, this schedule has yet to be approved  by CBP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Effectively Managed SBInet Testing", "paragraphs": ["Testing is essential to knowing whether the system meets defined  requirements and performs as intended. Effective test management  involves, among other things, developing well-defined test plans and  procedures to guide test execution. It is intended to identify and  resolve system quality and performance problems as early as  possible in the system development life cycle.", "DHS has not effectively managed key aspects of SBInet testing,  which has in turn increased the risk that the system will not perform  as expected and will take longer and cost more than necessary.  While the department\u2019s testing approach appropriately consists of a  series of progressively expansive test events, some of which have  yet to be completed, test plans and test cases for recently executed  test events were not defined in accordance with relevant guidance.  For example, none of the plans for tests of system components  addressed testing risks and mitigation strategies.", "Further, SBInet test procedures were generally not executed as  written. Specifically, about 70 percent of the procedures for key test  events were rewritten extemporaneously during execution because  persons conducting the tests determined that the approved  procedures were not sufficient or accurate. Moreover, changes to  these procedures were not made according to a documented quality  assurance process but were instead made based on an  undocumented understanding that program officials said they  established with the contractor. While some of these changes were  relatively minor, others were significant, such as adding  requirements or completely rewriting verification steps. The volume  and nature of the changes made to the test procedures, in  conjunction with the lack of a documented quality assurance  process, increases the risk that system problems may not be  discovered until later in the sequence of testing. This concern is  underscored by a program office letter to the prime contractor  stating that changes made to system qualification test procedures  appeared to be designed to pass the test instead of being designed to  qualify the system.", "These limitations are due, among other things, to a lack of detailed  guidance in the TEMP, the program\u2019s aggressive milestones,  schedule, and ambiguities in requirements. Collectively, these  limitations increase the likelihood that testing will not discover  system issues or demonstrate the system\u2019s ability to perform as  intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBInet Testing Results Have Identified a Growing Number of System Performance and Quality Problems", "paragraphs": ["The number of new SBInet defects that have been discovered during  testing has increased faster than the number that has been fixed.  (See figure 1 for the trend in the number of open defects from March  2008 to July 2009.) As we previously reported such an upward trend  is indicative of an immature system.", "Some of the defects found during testing have been significant,  prompting the DHS Acquisition Review Board in February 2009 to  postpone deployment of Block 1 capabilities to TUS-1 and AJO-1.  These defects included the radar circuit breaker frequently tripping  when the radar dish rotated beyond its intended limits, COP  workstations crashing, and blurry camera images, among others.", "While program officials have characterized the defects and  problems found during development and testing as not being \u201cshow  stoppers,\u201d they have nevertheless caused delays, extended testing,  and required time and effort to fix. Moreover, the SPO and its  contractor have continued to find problems that further impact the  program\u2019s schedule. For example, the radar problems mentioned  previously were addressed by installing a workaround that included  a remote ability to reactivate the circuit breaker via software, which  alleviated the need to send maintenance workers out to the tower to  manually reset the circuit. However, this workaround did not fully  resolve the problem, and program officials said that root cause  analysis continues on related radar power spikes and unintended  acceleration of the radar dish that occasionally render the system  inoperable. One factor that has contributed to the time and  resources needed to resolve this radar problem, and potentially  other problems, is the ability of the prime contractor to effectively  determine root causes for defects. According to program officials,  including the SBI Executive Director, the contractor\u2019s initial efforts  to isolate the cause of the radar problems were flawed and  inadequate. Program officials added, however, that they have seen  improvements in the contractor\u2019s efforts to resolve technical issues.", "Along with defects revealed by system testing, Border Patrol  operators participating in an April 2009 user assessment identified a  number of concerns. During the assessment, operators compared  the performance of Block 1 capabilities to those of existing  technologies. While Border Patrol agents noted that Block 1 offered  functionality above existing technologies, it was not adequate for  optimal effectiveness in detecting items of interest along the border.  Users also raised concerns about the accuracy of Block 1\u2019s radar,  the range of its cameras, and the quality of its video. Officials  attributed some of the identified problems to users\u2019 insufficient  familiarity with Block 1; however, Border Patrol officials reported  that the participating agents had experience with the existing  technologies and had received 2 days of training prior to the  assessment. The Border Patrol thus maintained that the concerns  generated should be considered operationally relevant.", "Effectively managing identified defects requires a defined process  for, among other things, assigning priorities to each defect and  ensuring that more severe ones are given priority attention.  However, the SPO does not have such a documented approach but  instead relies on the prime contractor for doing so. Under this  approach, defects were not consistently assigned priorities.  Specifically, about 60 percent (or 801 of 1,333) of Block 1 defects  identified from March 2008 to July 2009 were not assigned a priority.  This is partly attributable to the SPO\u2019s lack of a defined process for  prioritizing and managing defects. Officials acknowledge this and  stated that they intend to have the contractor prioritize all defects in  advance of future test readiness reviews. Until defects are managed  on a priority basis, the program office cannot fully understand Block  1\u2019s maturity or its exposure to related risks, nor can it make  informed decisions about allocating limited resources to address  defects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Science and Technology Directorate Testing Process Is Being Used to Leverage Maturing Technologies for SBInet", "paragraphs": ["The SPO does not have its own process for testing the relevance to  SBInet of technologies that are maturing or otherwise available from  industry or other government entities. Instead, it relies on DHS\u2019s  Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), whose mission is to  provide technology solutions that assist DHS programs in achieving  their missions. To leverage S&T, CBP signed a multiyear Interagency  Agreement with the directorate in August 2007. According to this  agreement, S&T is to research, develop, assess, test, and report on  available and emerging technologies that could be incorporated into  the SBInet system. To date, S&T has focused on potential  technologies to fill known performance gaps or improve upon  already-made technology choices, such as gaps in the radar system\u2019s  ability to distinguish true radar hits from false alarms. S&T officials  told us that they interact with Department of Defense (DOD)  components and research entities to identify DOD systems for  SBInet to leverage. In this regard, SPO officials stated that the  current SBInet system makes use of DOD technologies, such as  common operating picture software and radar systems.

As such, it is  important that each phase of Block 1 testing be managed with rigor  and discipline. To do less increases the risk that a deployed version  of the system will not perform as intended, and will ultimately  require costly and time-consuming rework to fix problems found  later rather than sooner. Compounding this risk is the unfavorable  trend in the number of unresolved system problems, and the lack of  visibility into the true magnitude of these problems\u2019 severity. Given  that major test events remain to be planned and conducted, which in  turn are likely to identify additional system problems, it is important  to correct these testing and problem resolution weaknesses.", "This concludes my prepared statement.
