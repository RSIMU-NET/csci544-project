DOD\u2019s public water systems, like all public water systems, are  required to comply with legally enforceable drinking water regulations that  are issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Safe  Drinking Water Act, as well as with any additional regulations issued by  state environmental agencies.

PFCs are widely used to make everyday products more resistant  to stains, grease, and water, such as by keeping food from sticking to  cookware and making clothes and mattresses more waterproof.  According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,  exposure to elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA could cause increased  cancer risk and other health issues in humans. EPA and DOD have  detected elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water at or near  DOD installations, and EPA has also found these chemicals in drinking  water at non-DOD public water systems across the United States.", "DOD has included PFOS and PFOA on its list of emerging contaminants.  DOD defines emerging contaminants as chemicals or materials that the  department currently uses or plans to use that present a potentially  unacceptable human health or environmental risk; have a reasonably  possible pathway to enter the environment; and either do not have  regulatory standards based on peer-reviewed science, or their regulatory  standards are evolving due to new science, detection capabilities, or  pathways. DOD has also included perchlorate, which is a chemical that  DOD uses in rocket fuel, on its list of emerging contaminants.

We compared data from EPA\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Information System  for the same time frame to determine the extent to which violations  recorded in the EPA system were also reported by the military  departments to ASD (EI&E). We also analyzed the data to identify any  differences in violations between DOD- and non-DOD-treated drinking  water. We assessed the reliability of the DOD and EPA data on violations  of health-based drinking water regulations by reviewing relevant  documentation, testing the data for obvious errors, and interviewing  knowledgeable officials. As we have previously found, EPA\u2019s data system  may not contain all public water system violations because states have  generally under-reported violations. During this review, we also found  that some public water system identification numbers for DOD  installations could not be matched with EPA\u2019s data system and, therefore,  these identification numbers were excluded from our analysis. As a  result, some DOD installation violations may be missing from the data,  and we may not have comprehensive violations data for health-based  drinking water regulations at DOD installations. Nonetheless, we  determined that DOD and EPA data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of identifying whether any drinking water violations were  recorded in EPA\u2019s system but not internally reported within DOD, as well  as to indicate possible differences in reported violations for DOD\u2019s two  types of public water systems.

Under Section 1431 of the Safe Drinking  Water Act, EPA may issue orders necessary to protect human health  where a contaminant in a public water system presents an imminent and  substantial endangerment. EPA may do so if appropriate state and local  authorities have not acted to protect human health. These orders may  require, among other things, carrying out cleanup studies, providing  alternate water supplies, notifying the public of the emergency, and  halting disposal of the contaminants threatening human health. The Ohio  Environmental Protection Agency has similar authority.", "According to information provided by officials from the Ohio  Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and DOD, DOD has taken steps  to respond to the administrative orders. Table 3 provides further details  on each order and examples of actions by DOD to address the orders.", "In addition to actions specific to these four installations, DOD has initiated  other actions to test for, investigate, and mitigate elevated levels of PFOS  and PFOA at or near installations across the military departments.  Following the release of EPA\u2019s lifetime health advisory for PFOS and  PFOA in May 2016, each of the military departments issued guidance  directing installations to, among other things, test for PFOS and PFOA in  their drinking water and take steps to address drinking water that  contained amounts of PFOS and PFOA above the EPA\u2019s lifetime health  advisory level. The military departments also directed their installations to  identify locations with a known or suspected prior release of PFOS and  PFOA and to address any releases that pose a risk to human health\u2014 which can include people living outside DOD installations.", "As a result of these efforts, DOD has initiated actions to address PFOS  and PFOA in drinking water both on military installations and outside  military installations. As of March 2017, DOD data indicated that the  department was taking steps to address levels of PFOS and PFOA above  the EPA\u2019s lifetime health advisory level in drinking water on 11 military  installations in the United States, 2 of which we visited during the course  of this review (see fig. 1).", "According to DOD data, these installations took various corrective actions  to mitigate the presence of PFOS and PFOA in the drinking water,  including shutting down drinking water wells, providing alternative drinking  water, and installing treatment systems. For example, at Eielson Air Force  Base in Alaska, the Air Force reported shutting down three of the  installation\u2019s six drinking water wells and installing a treatment system to  remove PFOS and PFOA from the drinking water. At Marine Corps Base  Camp Pendleton in California, the Navy reported that a well contaminated  with PFOS and PFOA was taken out of service and that the affected  reservoir was drained and replaced with water from another source;  follow-on testing showed that the presence of PFOS and PFOA were  returned to below the EPA\u2019s lifetime health advisory level. At Fort  Leavenworth in Kansas, the Army reported that the private company that  operates the installation\u2019s drinking water system had shut down two wells  contaminated with PFOS and PFOA and plans to install a treatment  system before returning those wells to service.", "Additionally, according to DOD data as of December 2016 the military  departments had identified 391 active and closed installations with  known or suspected releases of PFOS and PFOA, and had reported  spending almost $200 million on environmental investigations and  mitigation actions at or near 263 (or about 67 percent) of those  installations. In particular, DOD had initiated mitigation actions, which  include installing treatment systems or supplying bottled water, to address  PFOS and PFOA in drinking water for people living outside 19  installations\u20145 of which we visited during the course of this review (see  fig. 2).", "The following cost data provided by DOD were current as of December  2016, and are supplemented by additional information we obtained during  our installation visits.", "The Air Force identified 203 installations with known or suspected  releases of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $120 million on  environmental investigations at those installations, and spent about  $33 million on mitigation actions at or near 14 of the 203 installations.  For example, the Air Force reported spending over $5 million on  environmental investigations and mitigation actions at Peterson Air  Force Base in Colorado. During our visit to that installation, officials  showed us the sites they are investigating\u2014to include the current (see  fig. 3 below) and former fire training areas\u2014to determine the extent to  which their prior use of firefighting foam may have contributed to the  discovery of PFOS and PFOA in the drinking water of three nearby  communities. Additionally, the Air Force has awarded a contract for,  among other things, installing treatment systems in those  communities. In another example, the Air Force reported spending  about $800,000 on environmental investigations at Joint Base  Langley-Eustis in Virginia, but nothing yet on mitigation actions.  During our visit to this installation, officials told us that they had not  taken any mitigation actions because they do not use the installation\u2019s  groundwater as a drinking water source; the utility that serves the  installation, as well as the nearby city of Newport News, obtains its  drinking water primarily from a surface water source, which officials  said was approximately 20 miles from the installation.", "The Navy identified 127 installations with known or suspected  releases of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $20.5 million on  environmental investigations at 47 of those installations, and spent  about $24 million on mitigation actions at or near 5 of those  installations. For example, the Navy reported spending about $15  million on environmental investigations and mitigation actions at the  former Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove in  Pennsylvania. During our visit to this installation, officials told us that  the Navy is investigating the extent to which PFOS and PFOA on the  installation may have contaminated a nearby town\u2019s drinking water.  The Navy has agreed to fund installation of treatment systems and  connections of private well owners to the town\u2019s drinking water  system, among other things. In another example, the Navy reported  spending nearly $3 million on environmental investigations and  mitigation actions at Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress in  Virginia. During our visit to this installation, officials told us that the  Navy is providing bottled water to the approximately 20 to 30  personnel who work there and plans to install a treatment system to  treat for PFOS and PFOA.", "The Army identified 61 installations with known or suspected releases  of PFOS and PFOA, spent about $1.6 million on environmental  investigations at 13 of those installations, and has not yet begun any  mitigation actions at or near the identified installations. For example,  the Army reported spending about $26,000 on environmental  investigations at Fort Carson in Colorado, but nothing yet on  mitigation actions. During our visit to this installation, officials told us  that they had found PFOS and PFOA in groundwater near their  previous fire training area but that the installation does not use that  groundwater as a drinking water source, and state officials told us that  it is unlikely that PFOS and PFOA from Fort Carson had affected any  nearby drinking water sources.", "According to DOD, it may take several years for the department to  determine how much it will cost to cleanup PFOS and PFOA  contamination at or near its military installations. In January 2017, we  reported that DOD had not notified Congress that the costs for  environmental cleanup at closed installations will significantly increase  due to the high cost of remediating emerging contaminants\u2014including  PFOS and PFOA. We also reported that DOD officials had not  determined the total costs for cleaning up emerging contaminants at  closed installations. We recommended that DOD include in future annual  reports to Congress best estimates of the environmental cleanup costs for  emerging contaminants as additional information becomes available, and  DOD concurred with the recommendation and stated its commitment to  do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Previously Directed Installations to Test for Perchlorate in Drinking Water", "paragraphs": ["DOD previously directed installations to test for perchlorate in drinking  water.

Installations that found  perchlorate in their drinking water were to consult with their leadership on  appropriate actions to take and to continue testing on a quarterly basis  until they determined that perchlorate levels were likely to remain below  EPA\u2019s health advisory level, or any applicable federal or state regulation.  Citing congressional and regulatory agency concerns related to  perchlorate, DOD developed a database for storing the results of  perchlorate testing. According to ASD (EI&E), the database was last  updated in 2009 and is no longer being used by the department.", "ASD (EI&E) officials stated that they are no longer regularly testing  drinking water for perchlorate unless there is a state requirement to do so;  previous testing indicated that DOD was not a primary source of  perchlorate in drinking water and that known releases of perchlorate did  not currently pose a threat to drinking water. According to EPA, the  agency expects to issue a final drinking water regulation for perchlorate  by the end of 2019.

Unless ASD (EI&E) and the military  departments act to make any necessary clarifications to and increase  understanding of DOD\u2019s annual reporting requirements, ASD (EI&E) may  not have complete data to effectively oversee the military departments\u2019  compliance with drinking water regulations. Further, the data indicated  that systems providing DOD-treated drinking water had more reported  health-based violations than DOD systems providing non-DOD-treated  drinking water. However, DOD has not used these data to identify the  reasons that these differences may exist. Without using available data to  identify why differences in violations appear to exist between DOD\u2019s two  types of public water systems, DOD will likely be hampered in its ability to  identify what actions, if any, could be taken to address any differences  and improve overall compliance with health-based drinking water  regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of five recommendations to DOD.", "The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and  Environment, in consultation with the Secretaries of the military  departments, should identify and implement any necessary changes to  DOD\u2019s environmental compliance policy to clarify DOD\u2019s reporting  requirements for violations of health-based drinking water regulations.

This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1)  internally reported data on compliance with health-based drinking water  regulations at military installations and used those data to assess  compliance at its two types of public water systems and (2) taken actions  to address concerns with its firefighting foam containing perfluorinated  chemicals (PFCs) and to address elevated levels of  perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and  perchlorate in drinking water at or near military installations.", "For objective one, we reviewed DOD\u2019s policy on environmental  compliance in the United States, which directs the military departments to  annually report data to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and Environment (ASD (EI&E)) on compliance with and  violations of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state health- based drinking water regulations at military installations. We analyzed  data reported by the military departments to ASD (EI&E) on compliance  with and violations of health-based drinking water regulations at DOD  public water systems located at military installations in the United States  for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the most recent data available at the  time of our review. We analyzed the data to identify (1) the number of  people served by DOD public water systems that complied with  applicable EPA and state health-based drinking water regulations during  the fiscal year and (2) the number of people served by DOD public water  systems that violated at least one of these regulations sometime during  the fiscal year. We performed this analysis for both types of DOD public  water systems\u2014those that provide DOD-treated drinking water, and  those that provide non-DOD-treated drinking water. We also used the  data to identify the military installations where the reported violations  occurred; the nature of the violation (including the contaminant involved);  and the number of people affected. Next, we collected data from EPA\u2019s  Safe Drinking Water Information System for all public water systems in  the United States. We used DOD-provided public water system  identification numbers to identify in the EPA system any violations for  health-based drinking water regulations at those DOD systems for fiscal  years 2013 through 2015. We then compared the violations found in  EPA\u2019s data to the data reported by the military departments to ASD  (EI&E) to determine the extent to which the military departments were  reporting all violations of health-based drinking water regulations to ASD  (EI&E).", "We also analyzed DOD\u2019s data to identify any differences in violations  between DOD- and non-DOD-treated drinking water. We evaluated the  military departments\u2019 reported data and DOD\u2019s use of these data to  determine compliance with DOD\u2019s reporting requirements in the  department\u2019s environmental compliance instruction and Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. According to these  standards, quality information is needed to achieve an organization\u2019s  objectives, management is to monitor performance over time and  promptly resolve any findings, and actions such as improved  communication to and additional training for personnel are helpful for an  organization to meet its objectives. We also discussed our analysis with  ASD (EI&E) and military department officials, and discussed possible  reasons for why any violations went unreported to ASD (EI&E) and why  there may be differences in violations between DOD- and non-DOD- treated drinking water. We assessed the reliability of the DOD and EPA  data on violations of health-based drinking water regulations by reviewing  relevant documentation, testing the data for obvious errors, and  interviewing knowledgeable officials. As we have previously found, EPA\u2019s  data system may not contain all public water violations as states have  under-reported the violations. During this review, we found that some  public water system identification numbers for DOD installations could not  be matched with EPA\u2019s system and, therefore, were excluded from our  analysis. As a result, some DOD installation violations may be missing  from the data, and we may not have comprehensive violations data for  health-based drinking water regulations at DOD installations.  Nonetheless, we determined that DOD and EPA data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of identifying whether any drinking water  violations were recorded in EPA\u2019s system but not internally reported  within DOD, and to indicate possible differences in drinking water  violations, as reported by the military departments, between DOD\u2019s two  types of public water systems.", "For objective two, we reviewed policies issued by the military  departments on the use of firefighting foam that contains PFCs. We also  reviewed DOD documents related to research into PFC-free firefighting  foams that can meet the department\u2019s performance and compatibility  requirements, as well as DOD\u2019s military specification document that  outlines those requirements. We met with officials from ASD (EI&E) and  the military departments to discuss their policies on the use of firefighting  foam and actions taken to address concerns with the use of firefighting  foam containing PFCs, including the future use of firefighting foam.  Additionally, we met with Navy officials responsible for testing existing  firefighting foam products and setting the military specifications for  firefighting foam use in DOD.", "Additionally, we obtained and reviewed four regulatory administrative  orders\u2014three from EPA and one from the Ohio Environmental Protection  Agency\u2014directing DOD to address elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA  contamination in drinking water at or near four active and closed military  installations, and reviewed documentation related to DOD\u2019s efforts to  address these administrative orders.
