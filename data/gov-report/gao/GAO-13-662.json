Additional years can be spent in appeals. This is costly to IRS and creates years of uncertainty about a large corporation's actual tax liability. In response, IRS developed CAP in 2005. Under this process, IRS and taxpayers agree on how to report tax issues before the return is filed: compliant and cooperative taxpayers can get a streamlined IRS review of their tax return in a phase called Compliance Maintenance. GAO was asked to assess this process. In this report, GAO (1) describes the goals and potential benefits of the process, (2) assesses IRS's efforts to determine whether these goals are met, (3) assesses IRS's readiness to move more taxpayers into Compliance Maintenance, and (4) describes IRS's efforts to coordinate the process with its existing compliance processes. GAO reviewed IRS documentation and data, interviewed IRS officials and corporate tax experts, and held focus groups with tax executives of large corporations and with IRS audit staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Officials GAO interviewed inside and outside of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) generally agreed on the potential major benefits of the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) to taxpayers and IRS as reflected in its goals. These goals include saving IRS time and resources to use for other audits while ensuring compliance, and reducing taxpayer burden while increasing certainty on tax amounts now owed.", "Contrary to its guidelines, IRS has not evaluated whether the goals are being achieved or the process should be expanded. IRS officials told GAO that IRS will start developing an evaluation plan in 2013, but did not provide dates for when an evaluation would be completed. IRS cannot show the extent to which the goals are being met for two reasons.", "Some goals do not have measures and none have targets. Although developing measures and setting targets for goals (such as ensuring taxpayer compliance) can be difficult, not doing so limits IRS's ability to determine whether the process is working as intended.", "IRS does not have consistent and complete data for CAP. Inconsistent data make some analyses difficult to do. For instance, the average annual staff hours spent auditing a return could not be analyzed because the code to track staff time charges sometimes included non-CAP time charges. Incomplete data did not allow IRS to track progress for some goals. While IRS audit teams document tax issues in case files, IRS does not compile the data to track issue resolution. As a result, IRS cannot readily determine whether audit teams are resolving issues uniformly or identifying emerging tax compliance issues. Similarly, IRS does not have a system to track resource savings. Without a system, IRS cannot know the amount of saved resources or plan for their reallocation.", "IRS has been moving taxpayers into Compliance Maintenance without documenting a plan to ensure, among other things, that IRS has the capacity to assimilate these taxpayers in an expedited fashion, as intended. In addition, IRS audit staff had concerns about guidance on moving taxpayers in and out of this phase. IRS clarified the guidance in May 2013, but has not verified whether the audit staff understand it. Without verification, IRS does not have reasonable assurance that the audit staff understand which taxpayers are right for Compliance Maintenance and when it would be appropriate to remove them.", "IRS is addressing difficulties in coordinating CAP with other compliance processes. Difficulties include resolving some complex tax issues within the expedited time frames, and ensuring that all IRS specialists who assist audit teams understand the process.

To ensure  compliance, IRS examines (audits) corporate tax returns of the largest  corporations every year. IRS views the continuous audits as necessary  because the largest corporations regularly engage in complex business  transactions for which determining the correct tax requires careful  interpretation of the tax code. Through these audits, IRS proposed  assessments of $20.1 billion in additional tax in fiscal year 2012.", "While resulting in billions of dollars of additional tax assessed, traditional  corporate audits usually start months or years after a tax return is filed  and can take years to complete. Even after completion, more years  usually elapse before appeals are resolved and final tax assessments are  determined. For corporations, the traditional audit process leads to years  of uncertainty about their actual tax liabilities, uncertainty that must be  reflected on financial statements. For IRS, the process is costly and can  result in delays in uncovering new types of transactions that evade or  misinterpret the tax laws.", "In an attempt to improve the traditional corporate audit process, IRS  developed the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) as a pilot program  in 2005. Managed by IRS\u2019s Large Business and International Division  (LB&I), IRS examiners and participating large corporations work to reach  agreement on how to report tax issues before their tax returns are filed.", "To the extent CAP works as intended, taxpayers should achieve tax  certainty sooner with less administrative burden compared to traditional  post-filing audits, allowing taxpayers to better manage tax reserves and  more precisely report earnings on financial statements. In addition, IRS  intends for CAP to foster tax compliance while reducing its cost for  corporate audits. IRS also intends that any resources saved, particularly  in a streamlined review CAP phase known as Compliance Maintenance,  be devoted to auditing other corporations, thereby increasing audit  coverage.", "You asked us to assess CAP. This report (1) describes the goals and  potential benefits of CAP, (2) assesses IRS\u2019s efforts to determine whether  CAP is meeting its goals, (3) assesses IRS\u2019s readiness to expand  Compliance Maintenance, and (4) describes IRS\u2019s efforts to coordinate  CAP with existing processes for large corporate compliance. To address  these objectives, we reviewed IRS documentation, our prior work, and  other relevant literature. We also assessed IRS\u2019s efforts on CAP with  criteria in the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of  1993, GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, and the Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. We attempted to replicate IRS\u2019s  analysis of CAP and do separate analyses of CAP taxpayers. We  interviewed IRS officials responsible for managing CAP and conducting  exploratory CAP research. In addition, we interviewed 11 corporate tax  experts, including former IRS officials who were familiar with or had  experience with CAP. We held six focus groups with a total of 22 account  coordinators who are the primary IRS representative for CAP audits, two  focus groups with a total of 11 managers of IRS\u2019s Issue Practice Groups  who are responsible for providing guidance and advice to CAP audit  teams on resolving tax issues, and one focus group with 12 tax  executives of large corporations to understand their experiences using  CAP.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IRS has two categories of traditional audits for large corporations:  Coordinated Industry Cases (CIC) and Industry Cases (IC). CAP includes  both CICs and ICs, with the majority being CICs (about 88 percent). The  distinction between CIC and IC is based on criteria such as the amount of  gross assets, amount of gross receipts, number of operating entities,  multiple industry status, total foreign asset amounts, and amount of  foreign taxes paid. All corporations that are designated as CICs are  audited every year by a team of IRS staff while corporations that are  designated as ICs are not held to the same requirement.", "Before IRS created CAP, large corporations waited about 50 months on  average from the time a tax return was filed to IRS closing of the  traditional audit under CIC. This did not include additional time after the  audits were closed to resolve any appeals of the audit results\u2014a process  that usually took another 2 or 3 years. Therefore, obtaining certainty  about the status of tax issues reported on the tax return for a given tax  year may have taken 6 or 7 years\u2014if not longer. This created significant  burdens and problems for taxpayers and IRS. As already noted,  taxpayers had to reflect uncertainty about their tax liability on their  financial statements. This meant that taxpayers had to put aside reserves  in a provisional account meant for changes in taxes owed after an audit.  Large corporation tax officials we spoke to said that when corporations  have a large reserve, it lowers their expected profits. In addition, IRS  might not become aware of emerging tax issues associated with new  types of business transactions or products for years. Traditional audits of  large corporations still take years, as shown in figure 1.", "IRS launched CAP in March 2005 as a pilot program to assess its viability  as an alternative approach to large corporate tax administration. For the  pilot, IRS selected voluntary, corporate taxpayers based on factors  including their working relationship with IRS, a history of not taking  aggressive tax positions, and not having major tax litigation under way.", "IRS created pre-filing and post-filing stages for CAP. In pre-filing, a  taxpayer works with the CAP team to resolve issues of tax controversy  and to determine the appropriate tax treatment of completed transactions  before filing the tax return. CAP requires contemporaneous exchange of  information about a taxpayer\u2019s completed transactions and other events  that may affect tax liability. In post-filing, the CAP audit team reviews the  tax return to confirm adherence to agreements on how tax issues should  be reported. In exchange for increased cooperation and transparency, the  taxpayer may attain tax certainty sooner and with less administrative  burden, compared to traditional post-filing audits.", "After 6 years of experience with the CAP pilot, IRS management decided  to make CAP permanent in March 2011. IRS had received positive  feedback from taxpayers and employees on the CAP pilot, indicating they  wanted CAP to continue. Officials who had worked at IRS told us that IRS  did exploratory research on the pilot\u2019s impacts on timeliness as well as on  other areas.", "In making CAP permanent, IRS created three phases by adding the Pre- CAP and Compliance Maintenance phases to the existing CAP phase. To  avoid confusion, we will refer to the entire CAP program (all three phases)  as CAP to distinguish it from the CAP phase defined below.", "Pre-CAP phase: To enter CAP, all audits for prior tax years must be  resolved. The large corporate taxpayer and IRS work together in the  traditional post-file audit process to close audits of tax returns filed for  previous tax years within agreed upon time frames. Closing these audits  can take significant time if, as suggested by figure 1, audits are open for  many tax years.", "CAP phase: The large corporate taxpayer and IRS work to identify tax  issues and resolve how they are to be reported for the current tax year in  the pre-filing stage. IRS then confirms these issues are reported as  agreed upon during the post-filing review.", "Compliance Maintenance phase: Large corporate taxpayers who  continue to meet the CAP phase eligibility requirements and expectations  may progress to Compliance Maintenance after at least 1 year in the CAP  phase. Taxpayers must continue to be compliant and transparent in filing  tax returns and pose no new tax compliance risks. IRS intends to spend  less time examining these returns when filed as well as significantly  reducing the scope and depth of the pre-filing review. IRS\u2019s guidance  explains that the criteria for considering a taxpayer for Compliance  Maintenance include the complexity and number of issues, and the  taxpayer\u2019s history of CAP compliance, cooperation, and transparency.", "Taxpayers are expected to continue disclosing completed business  transactions, information on material items and issues that occur during  the CAP year, and their proposed tax positions on these disclosed items.  The Internal Revenue Manual states that taxpayers can be removed from  Compliance Maintenance depending on the complexity, number of  issues, or other factors.", "Not every large corporation is eligible for CAP. Table 1 shows the criteria  for each phase.", "Taxpayers must sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that  outlines their agreement to meet the CAP requirements. For Pre-CAP, the  MOU will be effective for the first Pre-CAP year and continue until audits  of tax returns for all transition years are closed and the CAP phase  selection criteria are fulfilled. For the CAP phase, the MOU applies to a  single tax year known as the CAP year. For Compliance Maintenance,  the CAP phase MOU is used. To continue in the CAP and Compliance  Maintenance phases, taxpayers must reapply and execute a new MOU  for each CAP year.", "Of about 60,000 large corporate taxpayers considered for audit in fiscal  year 2012, 161 were in CAP. Figure 2 shows the growth of CAP since its  inception in 2005.", "CAP taxpayers work with team and account coordinators who serve as  the primary IRS representative for all federal tax matters. In the Pre-CAP  phase, taxpayers work with an assigned team coordinator; in the CAP  phase or Compliance Maintenance phase, taxpayers work with an  assigned account coordinator. Other IRS team members include IRS  examiners, the team manager, the territory manager, and the Director of  Field Operations, as well as various IRS specialists (as needed) who offer  technical knowledge about tax issues and large corporations.", "CAP work on a tax return may be concluded in one of three ways:  1.  Full Acceptance Letter\u2014IRS provides the taxpayer with a full  acceptance letter if the pre-filing stage concludes with a taxpayer fully  complying with the MOU and with resolutions of all identified items  and issues through factual clarification, closing agreement(s), issue  resolution agreement(s), or a combination of these. The letter  constitutes written confirmation that IRS will accept the taxpayer\u2019s  return if it is filed consistent with those resolutions and no additional  items or issues are discovered during the post-filing review that were  not previously disclosed.  2.  Partial Acceptance Letter\u2014IRS provides the taxpayer with a partial  acceptance letter if the pre-filing stage concludes with a taxpayer fully  complying with the MOU, but IRS and the taxpayer cannot resolve all  identified items or issues before the tax return is filed. The letter  constitutes written confirmation that IRS will accept the taxpayer\u2019s  return for the resolved items and issues if the post-filing review shows  the return is filed consistent with the agreement(s).  3.  Termination Letter\u2014IRS can issue a termination letter at any time,  which results in the case being withdrawn from CAP and transferred  to a traditional post-filing examination. This can happen for several  reasons, including the taxpayer: not adhering to information document request (IDR) response times,  not responding to IDRs, or not providing complete IDR responses; not engaging in meaningful or good-faith issue resolution discussions; failing to thoroughly disclose prior, concurrent, and ongoing  transactions;  failing to disclose a tax shelter or listed transaction;  failing to disclose an investigation or litigation that limits access by the  IRS to current corporate records; or not adhering to any other MOU commitment(s).", "Two other new reporting requirements, one financial and one tax, have  been introduced since the 2005 pilot and may reinforce CAP. The first,  Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation Number 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, implemented in June 2006,  requires public and private corporations subject to the U.S. Generally  Accepted Accounting Principles to disclose uncertain tax positions.  Several of the tax experts we spoke to said this gives IRS an additional  source for verifying the completeness of the disclosures that corporations  make in the CAP phase. The second, Schedule UTP, Uncertain Tax  Position Statement, has a similar disclosure purpose. IRS implemented it  in 2010 as required reporting by taxpayers that have assets equaling or  exceeding $50 million. Along with their tax returns, these taxpayers are  to disclose information on the Schedule UTP about tax positions that may  affect federal income tax liabilities or are included in audited financial  statements. According to the August 2011 UTP guidance and procedures  for CAP, CAP teams should compare the list of taxpayer disclosures  made to them during the CAP year to the issues identified on the  Schedule UTP to verify that the disclosures match."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Significant Benefits Are Envisioned from CAP As Reflected in Its Goals", "paragraphs": ["IRS envisioned that CAP would yield significant benefits to participating  taxpayers and IRS by resolving tax issues in a pre-filing environment.

Because the goals are not all mutually exclusive, some  benefits can be perceived as relating to more than one goal.", "Ensure taxpayer compliance: IRS and non-IRS officials indicated  that compliance may be higher under CAP. Specifically, transactions  disclosed by taxpayers in CAP may not have been disclosed or  otherwise detected during traditional audits. For example, some  account coordinators and large corporation tax officials who  participated in our focus groups said that the risk of getting removed  from CAP sometimes prompts large corporations to over-disclose  issues and transactions.", "Increase currency for taxpayers: IRS and non-IRS officials  generally agreed that CAP increases currency. Some of the officials  informed us that currency reduces taxpayers\u2019 cost to retrieve  information as well as their interest expenses on unpaid tax liabilities.  Currency means that the appropriate documents and corporate staff  knowledgeable about a particular transaction are more likely to be  available for consultation.", "Enhance the accurate, efficient, and timely resolution of complex  tax issues: IRS and non-IRS officials generally agreed that currency  could also enhance the resolution of disputes over tax issues for the  reasons given above. Having documents and responsible corporate  staff available should make it easier for IRS to understand the tax  implications of a transaction. In addition, a full or partial acceptance  letter can speed the post-filing review of resolved issues.", "Increase audit coverage by providing more efficient use of IRS  resources: IRS and non-IRS officials generally agreed that CAP has  the potential to reduce IRS resources spent auditing large  corporations relative to what would have been spent on traditional  audits. Some of the officials stated that most of the resource savings  would occur in the Compliance Maintenance phase. Any resources  saved through Compliance Maintenance could be reinvested in  increasing the audit coverage of CAP and non-CAP taxpayers.

While CAP may reduce taxpayer  administrative burden over time, corporate tax experts indicated that  CAP requires significant upfront investment from taxpayers because  all audits for prior tax years must be resolved.", "Increase certainty for taxpayers: IRS and non-IRS officials we  spoke with generally agreed that CAP can increase the certainty that  taxpayers have about their tax obligations when tax returns and  financial statements are filed. They specifically emphasized the value  to corporations of not having to maintain reserves for potential future  tax liabilities. A corporate tax expert told us that certainty is so  valuable to corporations that they may be willing to concede certain  tax issues to achieve it. Increased certainty has other effects, such as  making it less likely that state tax returns will need to be amended,  which also saves time and resources.", "Both IRS officials and corporate tax experts informed us that for CAP to  achieve such benefits, taxpayers must be willing to disclose transactions  to IRS. For this reason, transparency and communication are emphasized  in the MOU. The corporate tax experts we interviewed readily  acknowledged that not all large corporate taxpayers may be good  candidates for CAP.

The  Senate Committee on Appropriations, in June 2012, urged IRS to develop  additional performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of CAP.  The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) in  February 2013 recommended that IRS develop an evaluation plan for  CAP and IRS agreed to do so in responding to TIGTA\u2019s report.

For example, it is not easy to  measure compliance by large corporations or concepts like certainty and  administrative burden.

IRS has directly measured compliance for different  groups of taxpayers in the past, such as through audits of randomly- selected taxpayers. IRS has not used this approach with large  corporations because it may be a burden both for IRS and taxpayers.", "An alternative to measuring the direct impact of CAP on compliance is  the use of proxy measures. During the pilot as well as after making  CAP permanent, IRS tried various approaches to measure a proxy for  compliance in paying taxes owed, such as the taxes paid before and  after audit by CAP taxpayers compared to non-CAP taxpayers. One  approach attempted to create peer groups for CAP taxpayers to  compare taxes paid by CAP taxpayers with those paid by non-CAP  peers. Another approach explored ways to estimate the impact of  CAP on effective tax rates. However, the results were not conclusive  because of the challenges of controlling for other factors that could  affect taxes paid. IRS has not researched the potential use of  another proxy measure for compliance: using the results from  measuring the quality of work by CAP teams to identify material tax  issues and to develop support for how these issues should be  reported on tax returns. Without compliance measures or related  proxy measures and accompanying targets, it will be difficult for  Congress and IRS to know whether CAP is meeting its goal for  ensuring taxpayer compliance.", "Reduce overall examination cycle time: IRS has defined a measure  for this goal but its related data are inconsistent.

Measuring the pre-filing time  could provide insights on whether a taxpayer is a good candidate for  CAP. For example, a long pre-filing period could be an indicator of  complex tax issues or delays in providing information to IRS.  However, as discussed in the next section, we found inconsistencies  in the CAP data for use in measuring this goal. In particular, we could  not resolve inconsistencies in the reporting of cycle time data by  different sources.", "Increase currency for taxpayers: LB&I has data on currency for all  CIC audits, but it has not broken out currency data for CAP pre-filing  work or post-filing audits.

IRS  knows that CAP taxpayers are satisfied with their issue resolutions.  According to IRS\u2019s 2012 taxpayer satisfaction survey, 80 percent of  the CAP respondents were satisfied with issue resolution in CAP. It  is useful to know how taxpayers feel about issue resolution; however,  IRS does not have a system to track issues that are being audited and  resolved to provide data to help assess the goal. For example, IRS  does not track whether the same issues repeat year after year or  whether IRS and the CAP taxpayer agreed on a method to be used to  resolve the issue in future tax years.

However, IRS does not have a measure of the actual  burden on CAP taxpayers because it has not been able to identify  how to capture taxpayer burden (other than relying on survey  responses). IRS has been attempting to more directly measure how  CAP affects taxpayer burden but has faced challenges. In 2013, IRS\u2019s  Research, Analysis, and Statistics (RAS) division analyzed whether  CAP taxpayers were less likely to use outside tax preparation  services. While RAS concluded that payments for such services were  significantly lower for corporations that had been in CAP for at least a  year, this result might indicate that CAP corporations choose to use  more in-house staff and fewer outside experts for work related to  taxes rather than from being in CAP.

An IRS  official indicated that data used by IRS to manage CAP are manually  transferred from multiple databases into an excel spreadsheet. Without  controls or documentation to ensure and validate their consistency, we  could not be assured of the validity and accuracy of the data that IRS  uses to create the CAP report used by LB&I leadership. Furthermore, this  limits the ability to do analyses, such as: measuring the average hours spent to close a tax return and staff time  charges for a tax year by pre-filing and post-filing activities.  Specifically, tracking staff time charges on pre-filing activities for CAP  could not be done because the code used by IRS to track some  charges also included non-CAP activities; doing an analysis of CAP  time charges would help determine whether CAP saves resources  compared to traditional audits. comparing taxpayer\u2019s returns filed before and after they entered CAP  to analyze any similarities and differences, accounting for when  taxpayers entered CAP and moved from the Pre-CAP phase to the  CAP phase.

When CAP audit teams entered  issue data into IMS, IRS did not know whether the teams were  consistently selecting the proper issue codes. IRS officials indicated that  entering the issue into IMS can be a significant burden because IRS has  tens of thousands of issue codes to consider and one issue can be  associated with multiple codes from which to choose. Furthermore, IRS  does not require this issue field to be completed and does not know  whether CAP teams entered all issues audited. As a result, the risk  increases that data are not consistent and complete. Thus, neither we nor  IRS could determine the number, types, and dollar amounts of  recommended tax changes for issues addressed in CAP.", "In addition, data in CAP case files are not tracked and thus are not readily  available to assess whether the issue resolution goal is being met. IRS  has not created a system to compile data from the issue resolution  agreements between CAP teams and taxpayers to guide how issues are  to be reported on tax returns when corporations file; instead, these  agreements are kept in a case file for each CAP taxpayer. An IRS official  agreed to attempt to start electronically tracking issues reported on issue  resolution agreements and said in July 2013 that the mandatory entry of  data from the issue resolution agreements into the IMS would be  recommended to the LB&I Business Review Board in late July 2013.  Thus, the date and methodology for starting to track the issues resolved  during pre-filing are not known. Even if implemented, the planned tracking  would not cover all other audited issues and whether they were resolved  during post-filing. Without such CAP-wide data, it will be difficult for IRS to  know whether it is resolving issues uniformly across CAP taxpayers for a  current tax year or addressing the same complex tax issues year after  year for a CAP taxpayer.", "Even if IRS compiled and tracked data on all audited issues, whether or  not resolved, IRS does not have a way to identify and track emerging tax  issues. Compared to traditional audits, CAP could help identify new  issues sooner for multiple CAP taxpayers because CAP occurs in real- time.

Standards for program management state that specific desired  outcomes or results should be conceptualized, defined, and documented  in the planning process as part of a road map, along with the appropriate  steps and time frames needed to achieve those results. The standard  practices also call for assigning responsibility and accountability for  ensuring the results of program activities.", "Such a plan also could discuss how IRS will assimilate these taxpayers  and ensure that IRS has the capacity to manage the increased workload  within the expedited time frames envisioned for corporate taxpayers  placed into Compliance Maintenance. Without such an assessment and  plan to guide expansion, IRS will not know whether Compliance  Maintenance will help meet CAP goals, such as reducing the resources  devoted to pre- and post-filing, or increasing audit coverage while  maintaining compliance.", "The lack of a documented plan for expanding Compliance Maintenance  could create risks for CAP in ensuring that this phase includes the right  types of taxpayers. Our reviews of IRS documents and our focus groups  held with account coordinators indicated that confusion exists about how  IRS would monitor taxpayers in Compliance Maintenance and how it  would remove taxpayers that no longer qualify. Account coordinators that  we included in our focus groups expressed uncertainty over how IRS  would monitor CAP taxpayers, given that some taxpayers could  potentially \u201cgame\u201d Compliance Maintenance because this phase requires  a lighter review using less resources than the CAP phase. Account  coordinators were also uncertain about the process and criteria for  removing taxpayers when we spoke to them in March and April 2013. In  addition, they told us that a taxpayer that had been accepted into  Compliance Maintenance for tax year 2013 was expected to remain in  Compliance Maintenance until all of the work was completed for that tax  year, regardless of whether their circumstances changed (such as tax  personnel changes in the taxpayer\u2019s business or discovery of new  complex tax issues).", "We brought the concerns from account coordinators that participated in  our focus groups to the attention of IRS. In response, IRS management  informed us that they revised their draft user guide for Compliance  Maintenance at the end of May 2013 and clarified the process and criteria  for moving taxpayers from Compliance Maintenance back to the CAP  phase. An IRS official explained that moving a taxpayer out of  Compliance Maintenance would require a serious compliance risk.  According to the May 2013 draft user guide, taxpayers would remain in  Compliance Maintenance for the entire pre-filing phase. If their  compliance risk changes, such taxpayers will remain in Compliance  Maintenance for that calendar year but may be moved back to the CAP  phase in the next year. Additionally, a March 2013 notification letter to  CAP taxpayers approved for Compliance Maintenance highlighted that if  changes occurred (such as to transparency, cooperation, or tax return  filing activity) IRS might revisit whether they should remain in Compliance  Maintenance.", "IRS has not yet verified whether these recent changes are uniformly  understood by account coordinators and resolve their concerns, which  they shared in our focus groups during March and April 2013. At the end  of June 2013, IRS indicated agreement that verifying the changes to the  guidance may help address the account coordinators\u2019 concerns. Verifying  that the changes it took resolved account coordinators\u2019 concerns could  provide IRS with reasonable assurance that its staff are including the right  types of taxpayers in Compliance Maintenance and are monitoring and  removing them appropriately.", "The potential savings from Compliance Maintenance relate to multiple  CAP goals, such as increased audit coverage and taxpayer certainty, as  well as reduced overall examination cycle time.

Specifically, CAP taxpayers in the survey perceived a lack of urgency and  cooperation by the specialists working on CAP audits. Moreover, account  coordinators we included in our focus groups expressed some concerns  that the need for cooperation between IRS and the taxpayer in the CAP  environment had not been fully adopted by specialists throughout IRS.", "Without a cooperative and transparent environment, CAP teams are  hindered in coordinating with specialists, which may affect IRS\u2019s ability to  achieve its goals.

It  holds the promise of significant benefits for participating corporations in  the form of increased certainty about tax liability and reduced  administrative burden. It also has the potential to save IRS resources,  which could be reallocated to increase audit coverage. Attracted by these  benefits, IRS has been expanding the number of taxpayers in CAP and  the related Compliance Maintenance phase. However, despite several  efforts, IRS has not succeeded at assessing whether or not CAP is  achieving its goals. While anecdotal evidence indicates that CAP may be  effective at ensuring compliance, increasing certainty, saving resources,  and achieving other goals, a CAP-wide assessment could validate these  results and help ensure that support for CAP, both inside and outside  IRS, does not wane.", "The lack of a CAP assessment is related to missing or incomplete  performance measures, nonexistent targets for the CAP goals, and  incomplete or inconsistent data. Without a full suite of measures and  targets as well as appropriate data for program evaluation, fully assessing  whether CAP is achieving its goals is not possible. The consequences of  not establishing performance measures and not collecting the data  needed to track performance can be significant. For example, one CAP  goal is to resolve complex tax issues, but IRS does not track whether they  are being resolved. As a result, IRS will not be able to tell whether CAP is  dealing with disputes over the same issues year after year. Similarly, IRS  does not track whether CAP is identifying emerging tax issues. Without  such tracking, IRS cannot share information about emerging issues  across IRS, creating a risk that some IRS audits might miss the issue or  treat taxpayers inconsistently. For its goal on increasing audit coverage  by saving resources through CAP, IRS did not have a way to collect data  on the resources saved. Without that data, IRS cannot readily plan for  how any savings will be used to increase audit coverage.", "Finally, without an assessment and plan for expansion, the rationale and  pathway for expanding Compliance Maintenance are missing. In addition,  the extent to which CAP staff understand how taxpayers are to be  monitored and, if necessary, removed from Compliance Maintenance has  not been verified. Absent a clear plan for expanding Compliance  Maintenance and ensuring that account coordinators clearly understand  guidance on monitoring and removing taxpayers, it will be difficult for IRS  to provide reasonable assurance that Compliance Maintenance accepts  the most compliant and cooperative corporate taxpayers, which is  necessary for this phase to work as intended and to contribute to CAP  goals, such as generating resource savings to increase audit coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that IRS is meeting the stated goals of CAP, we recommend  that the Principal Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue and Deputy  Commissioner for Services and Enforcement take the following seven  actions:", "Develop an evaluation plan for CAP, using IRS\u2019s guidelines for  conducting program evaluations, that can  track progress against the goals, and determine whether and how much to expand CAP.", "Develop measures for each CAP goal and set related targets.", "Consistently and completely capture data needed to track progress  against the CAP goals.", "Track all CAP tax issues and at a minimum, identify whether they are resolved or not resolved, and whether any are new or emerging issues that should be shared  IRS-wide.", "Track savings from Compliance Maintenance and CAP overall and  develop a plan for reinvesting any savings.", "Develop a plan for expanding Compliance Maintenance.", "Verify that the updated guidance for Compliance Maintenance on  monitoring and removing CAP taxpayers has resolved CAP staff  concerns about how these tasks are to be accomplished."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to IRS for review and comment.
